Black, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This civil case is before the Court on Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the claims of Plaintiff Annie Borden\n   (Doc. 50) and the parties' responsive memoranda (Docs. 56, 61).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Annie Borden and Kachena Richardson commenced this lawsuit, which alleges that Defendants engaged in deceptive and misleading marketing and advertising practices. Plaintiffs are former students in Antonelli's Practical Nursing Program (\"PNP\"). Plaintiffs' claims, which are asserted on behalf of themselves and a putative class, are premised on their contentions that Defendants misrepresented facts about the PNP, including its quality and approval from the Ohio Board of Nursing (\"OBN\"), and failed to provide adequate instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On these bases, the Complaint asserts claims for violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"ODTPA\"), breach of contract, fraud, constructive fraud, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment. (Doc. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, Antonelli filed a Counterclaim against Ms. Borden. (Doc. 47). The Counterclaim asserts that Ms. Borden is liable for $6,815.50 in unpaid tuition and asserts claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts pertaining to Ms. Borden's claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Antonelli opens the PNP; encounters issues with its approval from the OBN\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September, 2013, Antonelli opened the PNP. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 12; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 12). At the time it opened, the PNP was \"conditionally approved\" by the OBN. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 13; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 13). While designated \"conditionally approved,\" Antonelli was still allowed to enroll and graduate students, and its graduates were eligible to sit for the NCLEX-PN exam and to become licensed practical nurses in the State of Ohio. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 15; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2014, the OBN and Antonelli entered into a consent agreement (\"Consent Agreement\") (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 14; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Consent Agreement recognized that the PNP had not met certain standards set forth in the Ohio Administrative Code applicable to nursing education programs and extended the PNP's conditional approval until November 2015, at which time the OBN stated it may grant or deny full approval status. (Doc. 50-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November, 2015, the OBN provided Antonelli with another proposed consent agreement (\"Second Consent Agreement\") that would have extended the conditional approval of the program until November, 2016. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 16; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 16; Doc. 50-10). The proposed Second Consent Agreement again explained that the PNP had not met certain standards set forth in the Ohio Administrative Code applicable to nursing education programs. (Doc. 50-10). Antonelli was required to sign the proposed Second Consent Agreement by November 12, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Instead of signing the proposed Second Consent Agreement by the required date, Ms. Barnette, then the Program Administrator of the PNP, added proposed modifications and returned it to the OBN. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 17; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 17). Ms. Barnette's changes were rejected and the\n   deadline for Antonelli to sign Second Consent Agreement passed. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 20, 2015, the OBN issued a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (\"Notice\") to Antonelli. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 50-13). The Notice informed Antonelli that the OBN \"is authorized to propose to deny full approval and withdraw conditional approval of the [PNP] based on its failure to meet and maintain the standards established in rules adopted under Section 4723.07, ORC.\" (Doc. 50-13 at 5). The Notice gave Antonelli thirty days to request a hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Barnette drafted a Request for Hearing (\"Request\") and mailed it to the OBN on December 14, 2015. (Doc. 50 at \u00b6 21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 4, 2016, Ms. Barnette contacted the OBN to inquire as to the hearing date. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 22; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 22). The OBN advised it had not received Ms. Barnette's request. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 23; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, the OBN issued an Order withdrawing the PNP's conditional approval and denying full approval status for the program; the Order was sent via Certified Mail to Antonelli on March 29, 2016. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 24; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 24). On March 30, 2016, the PNP was suspended. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Antonelli filed a Motion to Stay against the OBN in the Franklin County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas on April 11, 2016. The Motion for Stay was granted and the program was re-opened after less than 20 days. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 26; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The issue of whether Antonelli properly made a Request for Hearing that must be honored by the OBN was then before the Court of Common Pleas. A hearing was held on April 26, 2016. On May 11, 2016, the Court ruled in Antonelli's favor and ordered that Antonelli had complied with the requirements to request a hearing and was, therefore, entitled to a hearing before the OBN. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 27; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Administrative Hearing with the OBN was conducted before Hearing Examiner Ronda Shamansky on September 20-21, 2016. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 28; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 28). Thereafter, Ms. Shamansky entered her Report and Recommendation recommending that the OBN continue conditional approval of the PNP for at least one additional year. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the OBN adopted the Report and Recommendation and ordered that conditional approval be extended for the PNP through November 16, 2017. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 30; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Borden's experience in the PNP\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Borden enrolled in the PNP in or around May 2014. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 1; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 1). At the time she enrolled, she signed and initialed several documents that are of consequence to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Ms. Borden executed an Enrollment Agreement. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 32; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 32). In bold print, the Enrollment Agreement expressly notified Ms. Borden that Antonelli does not guarantee its credits will transfer to another institution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Antonelli College does not guarantee transferability of its credits to other institutions of higher education. Transfer credit is always at the discretion of the receiving institution. If you plan to transfer credit\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    from Antonelli College to another institution, please check with the other institution before enrolling to determine if it will accept credits and/or specific courses taken at Antonelli College.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 50-2 at 3) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, concurrent with the Enrollment Agreement, Ms. Borden executed a State of Ohio Student Disclosure Form issued by the State of Ohio Board of Career Colleges and Schools. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 34; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 34). Ms. Borden initialed next to the following disclosure: \"I understand that the transferability of credits to another institution is determined exclusively by the receiving institution. No person can imply or guarantee that my credits will be transferable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 50-21 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, Ms. Borden executed a Policies and Procedures disclosure whereby she certified,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she had received a copy of the Antonelli College Catalog (\"College Catalog\"). (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 50-22 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The College Catalog that Ms. Borden certified she received expressly stated that the PNP had been granted \"Conditional Approval\" by the OBN:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Antonelli College Practical Nursing Program was granted Conditional Approval by the Ohio Board of Nursing. Conditional Approval is the initial approval status granted to a new nursing education program that meets and maintains the requirements of Chapter 4723-5, Ohio Administrative Code, and is necessary for the implementation of the program. Graduates of the Practical Nursing program are eligible to sit for the NCLEX-PN and apply for licensure as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) in the State of Ohio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 37; Doc. 50-9 at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, Ms. Borden saw documentation within her first six months of enrollment that identified the approval status of the PNP as conditional. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 38; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After three terms, Ms. Borden withdrew from the program due to pregnancy. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 3; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 3). She returned in May or July 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Borden claims that, after Antonelli entered into the Consent Agreement which provided conditional approval from the OBN for a limited period of time, Ms. Barnette and Ms. Elkins told her she \"had nothing to worry about\" regarding the PNP's status with the OBN. (Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Notwithstanding their representations, the OBN withdrew the PNP's conditional approval and denied full approval, causing the PNP to temporarily shut down in March 2016. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following the shut-down of the PNP, Ms. Borden returned in April 2016, and she graduated in January 2017. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 5; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 5). Ms. Borden claims delays associated with the shut-down caused her graduation date to be delayed by five months and resulted in her paying an additional five months of tuition. (Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff passed the NCLEX-PN, became a licensed practical nurse with the State of Ohio in April 2017, and obtained\n   full time employment as a licensed practical nurse. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Facts pertaining to Defendants' Counterclaim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   By signing the Enrollment Agreement, Ms. Borden agreed to pay tuition and fees in exchange for educational services provided by Antonelli. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Additionally, Ms. Borden signed a Financial Aid Application in which she certified to Antonelli that she would \"be responsible for a balance [of tuition and costs] due in cash that is not paid by federal, state, or agency assistance.\" (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 8; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 8; Doc. 50-6). To pay for her tuition, Ms. Borden received Federal Student Aid, including Pell Grants, Subsidized Loans and Unsubsidized Loans, as well as cash payments. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants claim that Ms. Borden has not made a payment since January 25, 2017, and she has a balance due for unpaid tuition of $6,815.50. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Doc. 50-7 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ms. Borden disputes this amount and claims that, pursuant to her Student Statement dated August 2017, her outstanding balance is only $4,790.50. (Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ms. Borden does not have standing to assert the ODTPA claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Count One of the Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants violated the ODTPA by making deceptive, false and misleading statements concerning the PNP. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 75-83). Count One alleges Defendants' deceptive, false and misleading statements deceived Ms. Borden, influenced her decision to pay for and enroll in the PNP, and that she has been damaged as a direct result. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 77-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants argue Ms. Borden does not have standing to pursue this claim because she is an individual consumer and has not suffered a commercial injury. (Doc. 50 at 10-13). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Under the ODTPA, a person engages in an unlawful \"deceptive trade practice\" when, in the course of the person's business, vocation, or occupation, he or she,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (7) represents that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they do not have, or that a person has a sponsorship, approval,\n   status, affiliation, or connection that the person does not have;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (9) represents that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, or grade, or that the goods are of a particular style or model, if they are of another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ohio Rev.

First, most courts have reasoned that the ODTPA is analogous to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, which similarly confers standing on \"any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged\" by conduct prohibited under the Act. Despite this language, federal courts have consistently held individual consumers lack standing under Section 43(a) because they are not within the class of persons that the Lanham Act was designed to protect,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , persons engaged in commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147731\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/838/631/#p649\">\n    838 F.Supp.2d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining consumers lack standing under the ODTPA because it is analogous to the Lanham Act, which only protects \"persons engaged in commerce, not individual consumers, against unfair competition\") (quotation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Porsche Cars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307776\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/880/801/#p873\">\n    880 F.Supp.2d at 873-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the ODTPA is substantially similar to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and the Lanham Act protects the interests of a purely commercial class that does not include\n   individual consumers\") (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Terlesky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207254189\">\n    2015 WL 7254189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at **2-3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20155236\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

The Court addresses these claims together because they contain almost identical elements and supporting facts, namely that Defendants misrepresented and/or concealed certain information, and Ms. Borden relied on Defendants' misrepresentation and/or concealment to her detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Ms. Borden identifies three categories of information she contends supports the Misrepresentation Claims. First, Ms. Borden argues Defendants misrepresented the existence of agreements with other schools that allowed credits to transfer to RN programs. (Doc. 56 at 12; Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6 4). Second, Ms. Borden argues that Antonelli misrepresented/concealed the fact that the PNP was only \"conditionally\" approved by the OBN. (Doc. 56 at 13; Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6 5). Third, Ms. Borden argues that, after entering into the Consent Agreement, Defendants concealed the temporary nature of the PNP's conditional approval by reassuring Ms. Borden that she had \"nothing to worry about\" regarding the PNP's approval status shortly before the PNP was temporarily shut down. (Doc. 56 at 14-15; Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants argue that all of Ms. Borden's misrepresentation claims are impermissible educational malpractice claims in disguise. (Doc. 50 at 6-7). The Court does not agree. The Misrepresentation Claims allege wrongful conduct in addition to and separate from the PNP's allegedly inadequate instruction, and, accordingly, are not impermissible educational malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rockwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264845\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/718/#p724\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining an educational malpractice claim as a \"claim that educational services provided were inadequate\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants argue the Misrepresentation Claims are barred to the extent they are premised on the alleged misrepresentation that Antonelli credits would transfer to RN programs.

(Doc. 50 at 11). The Court agrees. Ms. Borden admits she signed the Policies and Procedures disclosure, which states that she received a copy of the College Catalog. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 56-1 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 50-22 at 2). The College Catalog expressly stated that the PNP was granted \"Conditional Approval\" by the OBN. (Doc. 50-1 at \u00b6 37; Doc. 50-9 at 8). Ms. Borden's certification that she had received the College Catalog bars the Misrepresentation Claims to the extent they are premised on Defendant's allegedly misrepresenting that Antonelli was \"fully\" certified by the OBN.\n   <em>\n    Irvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201607460\">\n    2005 WL 1607460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, 2005 Ohio App. LEXIS 3271, at **10-11 ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201303257\">\n    2011 WL 1303257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at **4-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2035800\">\n    2011 U.S. Dist.

Specifically, Defendants argue that the Consent Agreement was posted in the student lounge as required by its terms. (Doc. 61 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court does not agree with Defendants' position. Ms. Borden argues that Ms. Barnette and Ms. Elkins told her she had \"nothing to worry about\" regarding the PNP's status with the OBN while concealing the fact that, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, the PNP was only conditionally approved for a temporary period of one year, at which point conditional approval could be suspended or revoked. (Doc. 56 at 14; Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Doc. 30 at \u00b6 53). Ms. Borden claims these representations were false as demonstrated by the fact that the OBN subsequently suspended the PNP, which delayed Ms. Borden's graduation date by five months\n   and caused her to incur an additional five months of tuition expenses. (Doc. 56 at 14; Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   At this stage, Ms. Borden has set forth sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether Defendants' assertion that Ms. Borden \"had nothing to worry about\" regarding OBN approval and alleged concealment of the Consent Agreement constitute actionable misrepresentations. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 50) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Ms. Borden's claims for fraud, constructive fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Antonelli is not entitled to summary judgment on the Counterclaim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As part of Defendants' motion, Antonelli requests summary judgment on its Counterclaim against Ms. Borden. Specifically, Antonelli argues that Ms. Borden breached terms of the Enrollment Agreement and Financial Aid Application requiring her to pay Antonelli for the balance of tuition that is not paid by federal, state, or emergency assistance. (Doc. 50 at 19-20). Antonelli claims that balance is $6,815.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Ms. Borden asserts two arguments in response. First, Ms. Borden argues that the amount Antonelli seeks is incorrect. Ms. Borden argues that her Student Statement, dated August 11, 2017, shows that her balance due is only $4,790.50. (Doc. 56-21 at \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2022744\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 2).

(Doc. 56 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   At this stage, Ms. Borden has demonstrated that an issue of fact exists that precludes summary judgment on Antonelli's counterclaim. Specifically, an issue of fact exists as to the balance owed by Ms. Borden. Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 50) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   to\n   the extent it seeks judgment on Antonelli's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    H.
