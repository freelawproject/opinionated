Defendants argue that plaintiff \"has failed to follow those procedures for all but one of the claims in her complaint[.]\" Defs.' Mem. 10. I address plaintiff's claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    1. Applications between April 2015 and June 2015 for Unspecified Positions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"Brooks ... failed to consider [her] for all available vacancies advertised at DHS-OCFO between April 2015 and June 2015,\" Compl. 4, and that she was not referred for a Records and Management Specialist position or a GS-14 position with U.S. Customs and Border Protection,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Defendants counter that plaintiff raised none of these issues at the administrative level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 13. Unfortunately for plaintiff, defendants are correct. How so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is apparent from plaintiff's formal EEO complaint and the Statement of Accepted Claim that plaintiff challenged three employment decisions: (1) non-selection for the Budget Analyst position; (2) non-selection for the Program Analyst position; and (3) non-selection for the FEMA position.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination, Case No. HS-HQ-24268-2015; Statement of Accepted Claim dated December 30, 2015. No other positions or applications are mentioned in her EEO complaint. I therefore must dismiss all of plaintiff's claims not raised at the administrative level for failure to exhaust.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheatham v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897310\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/935/225/#p235\">\n    935 F.Supp.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (D.D.C. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    2. Non-Selection for the FEMA Position\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The FEMA hiring event to which plaintiff refers in her complaint occurred on June 25, 2015. Compl. 5; SOMF \u00b6 9. It appears from the complaint that plaintiff believes she had been offered a position, and that the offer was then rescinded upon receipt of \"an adverse reference regarding Plaintiff's employment at DHS-OCFO,\" which was provided by Ms. Hudson on the same day as the hiring event.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897310\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/935/225/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if this were the case, however, plaintiff's claim on this point must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , plaintiff was required to contact an EEO Counselor \"within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). That period would have ended on or about August 10, 2015, or 45 days after the hiring event, yet plaintiff\n   did not amend her then-pending EEO complaint until October 19, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Accepted Claim dated December 30, 2015 at 2 (Claim No. 5). Because plaintiff failed to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely manner, she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies regarding non-selection for a FEMA position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Discrimination Based on Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Nielsen discriminated against her on the basis of a physical disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 3; Statement of Accepted Claim dated December 30, 2015 at 1-2 (Claim Nos. 1-2, 7); Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination, Case No. HS-HQ-24268-2015 at 34. But nowhere in her pleadings does plaintiff identify her disability, allege that defendants were aware of her disability, or allege any facts to link defendants' purported discriminatory acts to her disability. Nor does plaintiff point to any materials in the record tending to show that defendants discriminated against her because of an unspecified disability. There simply are no facts alleged or proven to support a disability discrimination claim. The Court accordingly grants defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim of discrimination based on disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Non-Selection for Budget Analyst Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff's claim arising from non-selection for the budget analyst position is hardly a model of clarity. But after careful consideration of the record before me, this Court grants defendants' motion for summary judgment for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, plaintiff suggests she had not \"been referred to the hiring official as a Schedule A applicant,\" Compl. 5, and that her application was evaluated using inappropriate selection criteria,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the record shows that a three-member hiring panel for Vacancy Announcement Number DHSHQ15-1380243-FO reviewed and rated plaintiff's application.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem., Exs. 12-14. On these facts, which plaintiff does not challenge, I cannot conclude that defendants refused to consider her application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, plaintiff alleges that her application \"was evaluated using selection criteria which penalized [her] for being unemployed by DHS as of January 2014,\" Compl. 5, and was \"rated on [the bases of plaintiff's] employment status and stability,\" Statement of Accepted Claim dated December 30, 2015 at 2 (Claim No. 7). But plaintiff points to no evidence in the record to support these assertions. In fact, the record in this case shows that the hiring panel applied the same criteria to plaintiff s application as it applied to all the other applications it reviewed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem., Ex. 12 at 138 &amp; Attach. A-C, Ex. 13 at 188-89, Ex. 14 at 212, 217-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, plaintiff neither alleges in her complaint nor demonstrates through record materials that there was a causal connection between her 2013 EEO activity and the non-selection decision in 2015. \"To prove unlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that [she] opposed a practice made unlawful by Title VII; (2) that the employer took a materially adverse action against [her]; and (3) that the employer took the action 'because' the employee opposed the practice.\"\n   <em>\n    McGrath v. Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051474,3769301\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1377/\">\n    666 F.3d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1380 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Without question, plaintiff opposed a practice made unlawful under Title VII, and DHS took an adverse action against plaintiff when the hiring panel did not select her for the Budget Analyst position. Plaintiff's claim fails, however, because she cannot demonstrate causation. Nothing in plaintiff's opposition to defendants' motion suggests or proves that DHS rejected her\n   application because of her 2013 EEO activity. And the causation element is particularly lacking given the fact that plaintiff s protected activity occurred nearly two years before the non-selection decision that she challenges here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p274\">\n    532 U.S. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p274\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p274\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (where complainant relied on temporal proximity to demonstrate causation, an adverse \"[a]ction taken ... 20 months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, defendants' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and plaintiff's complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice. A separate order consistent with this decision accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In addition to these applications, plaintiff appears to allege that she also applied for, was deemed eligible for, and not referred for, a position with U.S. Customs and Border Protection in October 2016. Compl. 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Plaintiff's additional amendments to the EEO complaint on December 18, 2015 and December 21, 2015 are not directly related to the Title VII claims brought in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Statement of Accepted Claim dated December 30, 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiff's original complaint bears a date stamp indicating that the Clerk of Court received the pleading on February 27, 2017. The Court treats the complaint as if it had been filed on that date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Insofar as plaintiff challenges her non-selection for the Program Analyst position, see Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination, Case No. HS-HQ-24268-2015 at 35, the claim must fail because plaintiff has not demonstrated that DHS declined to consider her because of her disability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
