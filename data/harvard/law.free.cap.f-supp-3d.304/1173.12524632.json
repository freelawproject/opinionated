DAVID PROCTOR, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is before the court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. # 4). The motion to dismiss has been fully briefed and is under submission. (Docs. # 9 &amp; 10). After careful review, and for the reasons explained below, the court concludes that the Motion to Dismiss is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff worked for several years as a program manager in the Professional and Conference Services Division (the \"Division\") at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa (the \"University\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1 at \u00b6 15). She alleges that she suffered from severe neural foraminal narrowing and compression of a spinal nerve, which she controlled through exercise and use of a special chair before 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Leroy Hurt, an associate dean of professional development and conference services, pressured her to hire a male candidate for an open position and criticized her for questioning the male candidate during his interview about his salary requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Moreover, Hurt required Plaintiff to undergo coaching after the interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). In September 2013, Plaintiff complained to the University's EEOC office about gender discrimination because Hurt had hired the lesser-qualified male candidate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2013, Plaintiff alleges that Hurt refused to allow her to terminate a subordinate for poor job performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). She asserts that (1) Hurt's refusal undermined her authority and (2) Hurt allowed a non-disabled supervisor to terminate a subordinate for poor job performance. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-24). Plaintiff further complains that Hurt ordered her to relinquish planning and control of a conference to another employee with no apparent disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in April 2014, Plaintiff alleges that Hurt harassed her about exercising in the University's gym during lunch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Hurt allegedly directed her to not change clothes at work and to shower before returning to the office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiff, other employees were allowed to change clothes at the office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's back conditions worsened in 2014, and she underwent back surgery in December of that year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Thereafter, she experienced slurred speech, grasping problems, and drooling, which progressively worsened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). In February 2015, Hurt complained about Plaintiff's autistic son visiting her office between classes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). In June 2015, Hurt allegedly directed Plaintiff to relinquish all of her office furniture, including the special chair she needed to alleviate her back condition. (The Complaint does not specify whether Plaintiff lost her ability to use the chair.) (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). In August 2015, Plaintiff complained to the University's human resources department that Hurt had \"undermined her ability to complete a major project by permitting [Plaintiff's] main support staff person to resign without giving a full two (2)-week notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2015, Hurt issued Plaintiff a write-up that falsely accused her of yelling at another employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). Plaintiff alleges that Hurt threatened to pressure other employees to testify against her if she contested the write-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff complained to a human resources employee about Hurt's \"retaliatory conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, Hurt permitted a male employee to yell at female employees without any repercussions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). In September 2015, Hurt also moved another employee, Lisa Dunn, into Plaintiff's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2015, Hurt demoted plaintiff from program manager to sales manager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). Plaintiff complained to Defendants Craig Edelbrock and Hurt that she would likely not succeed as a sales manager due to her slurred speech, her limitations in moving her right leg, and after-effects from her back surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). Plaintiff's slurred speech harmed her ability to make telephone sales calls, and her lack of mobility impeded her ability to conduct in-person sales calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45). According to Plaintiff, Hurt failed to inform her of fundraising protocols, which impeded her fundraising efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). At one point following her demotion, Hurt limited Plaintiff's fundraising\n   \"to selling at exhibit booths and seeking low-level sponsors under $10,000, which were already being handled in the Marketing Department.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). Hurt later instructed Plaintiff to focus on securing grants, rather than making sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). In August 2016, Plaintiff submitted a draft proposal for a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services, but Hurt decided to appoint another person to handle that grant application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). Plaintiff began treatment for Parkinson's Disease in December 2016 and was diagnosed with Parkinson's in January 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). Thereafter, she informed Hurt of the diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's Complaint States Plausible Allegations of Title VII Sex Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Complaint does not state a Title VII discrimination claim because it fails to plead a prima facie case of discrimination, identify a male comparator, and explain how similarly situated males received more favorable treatment. (Doc. # 4 at 8-10). After review, the court finds that the Complaint contains sufficient detail about Plaintiff's demotion and work environment to present plausible disparate treatment and hostile work environment claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a Title VII disparate treatment case, a plaintiff does not need to allege facts in the complaint \"sufficient to make out a classic\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   prima facie case.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

(Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). Moreover, she has described another situation where Hurt hired a lesser-qualified male candidate over a more-qualified female candidate and criticized Plaintiff's assertiveness towards the male candidate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21). While this incident occurred a few years prior to Plaintiff's demotion, it suggests there is circumstantial evidence that Hurt discriminates towards females.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castillo v.

But this argument clearly misses the mark. In some circumstances, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie Title VII case without showing the existence of a comparator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

The Complaint States Plausible Allegations of a Hostile Environment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a Title VII hostile environment claim.

Sec'y, Dep't of Veterans Affairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054730\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1179/#p1195\">\n    822 F.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gowski v.

To prove a claim of hostile work environment under Title VII, an employee must show: \"(1) that [s]he belongs to a protected group; (2) that [s]he has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment must have been based on a protected characteristic of the employee ...; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) that the employer is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or direct liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Courts commonly consider four factors in determining whether the conduct at issue is severe or pervasive enough to permeate a workplace: \"(1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453017\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/277/1269/#p1275\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453017\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/277/1269/#p1275\">\n    at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, although it is a close call, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled a plausible hostile environment claim. She claims that Hurt criticized her assertiveness for questioning a male applicant about his pay requirements and directed her to complete coaching thereafter. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). Moreover, she asserts that Hurt denied her the ability to terminate an underperforming subordinate, \"whereas he did not undermine the authority of similarly-situated males.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 70). As stated above, Plaintiff received a write-up based on yelling at a subordinate when a male colleague received no punishment for similar conduct.

Plaintiff contends that her program manager job constituted a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities, and Defendant should have reasonably accommodated her by keeping her in that position. (Doc. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 87, 89). And, she has explained that her slurred speech and lack of mobility impaired her ability to perform the essential functions of a sales manager. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42). She informed Defendants Hurt and Edelbrock about these limitations. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). While the court recognizes this claim presents a close call (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's allegations do not specify whether she struggled with the functions of a sales manager after the alleged demotion, and she worked as a sales manager for at least a year and a half before filing suit), the court finds that Defendant's objections to the claim are best suited for the summary judgment stage, where the court will have the benefit of a Rule 56 record.

Because the Alabama Supreme Court never addressed whether negligent hiring, training, and supervision claims can be brought against mere supervisors, the court concludes that\n    <em>\n     Ex parte City of Montgomery\n    </em>\n    cannot be read to approve the viability of such a negligence theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    A negligent hiring, training, or supervision claim premised on a subordinate's\n    <em>\n     age\n    </em>\n    discrimination is distinguishable from Plaintiff's negligence claim here because Alabama law expressly prohibits age discrimination in employment in the Alabama Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     King v.
