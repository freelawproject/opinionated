Defendant U-Haul International, Inc. is a business incorporated in Nevada with its primary business location in Arizona. Plaintiff filed suit in Deschutes County Circuit Court alleging intentional and negligent misrepresentations and unlawful trade practice by defendant. Defendant removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

On May 26, 2016, plaintiff called defendant's office in Port Angeles, Washington to inquire about the availability of a 6' x 12' trailer. After confirming the availability of the trailer, plaintiff made a reservation to rent the trailer for May 29, 2016, through defendant's online portal. Plaintiff drove with his family to Port Angeles, Washington on May 27, 2016. On May 28, 2016, plaintiff alleges that he received a call informing him that the trailer he reserved was not available. Due to this unavailability, plaintiff asserts that he had to rent and use a smaller trailer on May 29, 2016. He alleges that this forced him to make a second trip from Sunriver, Oregon to Port Angeles, Washington to move items that would not fit on the first trip. Plaintiff also alleges that items were left behind and not moved due to the lack space in the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff avers that he was initially unable to serve defendant in Oregon because defendant's status with the Oregon Secretary of State was \"inactive,\" and its registered agent in Oregon declined to accept service. Wardlow Decl. at \u00b6 4. After failed attempts to communicate with defendant's legal department, plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint listing defendant's two entities in Arizona and Oregon alleging intentional and negligent misrepresentations and unlawful trade practice in Deschutes County Circuit Court. After plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), defendant removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed the present motion to remand, alleging that there is no diversity jurisdiction between the parties. Defendant subsequently moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay proceedings and compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A defendant may remove an action filed in state court to federal court if there is diversity or federal question jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b).

Here, plaintiff challenges defendant's removal arguing that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that diversity jurisdiction has not been established. For district courts to have original subject matter jurisdiction over civil actions through diversity, the matter in controversy should exceed $75,000 exclusive of interest or costs and the parties must be citizens of different states.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Amount in Controversy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his motion to remand, plaintiff alleges that the amount in controversy is under the required $75,000 threshold. The amount in controversy depends on the value of the unaggregated individual claims, both for monetary damages and equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    In re Ford Motor Co./Citibank (S.D.), N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485723\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/952/#p958\">\n    264 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958-59 (9th Cir. 2001). Potential punitive damages are also part of the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Where a statute authorizes an award of attorney fees, the fees are part of the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Galt G/S v.

The Ninth Circuit has not definitively ruled whether prospective, unaccrued attorney fees are part of the amount in controversy when a case is removed.\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. CarMax Auto Superstores, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174578\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/644/\">\n    840 F.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649 n.2 (9th Cir. 2016). Thus, I examine whether the value of plaintiff's unaggregated claim exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The amounts proffered for compensatory and statutory damages are not in controversy. Plaintiff requests compensatory damages in the amount of $1,400.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also prays for statutory damages of $200 for each of defendant's alleged violations of O.R.S \u00a7 646.608. Plaintiff alleges 44 distinct violations of the statute, meaning that the total request for statutory damages is $8,800 (44 violations times $200 per violation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, I look to plaintiff's potential punitive damages. Oregon law does not allow the pleading of punitive damages in an initial complaint. O.R.S. \u00a7 31.725. However, despite Oregon's punitive damages pleading requirements, federal courts may consider the potential for punitive damages when determining the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497536\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/927/#p946\">\n    261 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   946 ;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Culpepper v.

Or. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In reviewing awards for punitive damages for unlawful trade practices, Oregon courts have approved ratios of 3.9:1 between the punitive damage award and the economic damage award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

I find that applying a ratio of 3.9:1 is appropriate here though Oregon Courts have approved awards involving much higher ratios.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parrott v.

When an underlying statute\n   authorizes an award of attorneys' fees, either with mandatory or discretionary language, such fees may be included in the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Missouri State Life Insurance Company et al. v.

While preserving arguments as to the reasonableness of plaintiff's fee expenditures or the merit of any of plaintiff's claims, defendants do not dispute the inclusion of pre-removal attorneys' fees in assessing the amount in controversy requirement. Therefore, pre-removal attorneys' fees, $28,470 as estimated by plaintiff, may be included in the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Galt G/S\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219287\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/1150/#p1155\">\n    142 F.3d at 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties dispute whether potential future attorneys' fees should be considered in calculating the amount in controversy. Initially, I note that \"[i]t remains an open question whether attorney's fees that are anticipated but unaccrued at the time of removal or filing in federal court ... may be included in the amount-in-controversy. Other circuits and the district courts in this circuit are divided on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , at 649 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits all allow potential attorneys' fees to be calculated as part of the amount in controversy, so long as recovery of fees is authorized by statute or contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tenth Circuit offers the most thorough reasoning regarding the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miera v.

Plaintiff argues that consumers have no choice but to accede to the Arbitration agreement. However, the Ninth Circuit has concluded \"the take-it-or-leave-it nature of [a contract] is insufficient to render it unenforceable\" on account of procedural unconscionability when the arbitration clause \"was not hidden or disguised and where the plaintiff was given time to read the documents before assenting to their terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Runyan v.

Here, the claims were not hidden or disguised for the reasons discussed below. Moreover, plaintiff had multiple opportunities to read the Arbitration agreement before assenting to the terms. For all these reasons, the agreement is not void on grounds of oppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, plaintiff alleges that defendant concealed the arbitration provisions in the agreements which constituted procedural unconscionability due to surprise. While plaintiff focuses on the visibility and accessibility of the specific provisions, defendant focuses on multiple occasions that plaintiff could have actually read and signed the rental agreements containing arbitration provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is true that inconspicuous contract terms, in general, may be used as evidence to demonstrate surprise and potential procedural unconscionability. However, the fact that plaintiff is an attorney who was given notice throughout the reservation process by means of two separate\n   documents and an addendum weighs against finding surprise.

The language about the scope of claims subject to arbitration was not buried somewhere inaccessible to plaintiff. In fact, the notice that plaintiff was assenting to the Arbitration Agreement was located mere inches above the signature block in the rental agreement.

Plaintiff's monopoly power argument is misplaced. Because I have already analyzed defendants' monopoly power in relation to the procedural unconscionability, I will briefly examine the terms of the arbitration agreements. Addressing several provisions of the arbitration agreements, plaintiff alleges that the terms are unfair and one-sided. Defendant counters by elaborating on each provision's language explaining that none of the provisions are substantively unfair. Answering the questions of substantive unconscionability, I first note that the Supreme Court has concluded that waivers of class-wide relief are per se enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Mobility LLC v.

Moreover, I find that defendant's Confidentiality provision, and Notice and Demand Procedure are not unreasonably favorable to defendant.

Defendant further argues that this court should include plaintiff's claims for disgorgement in calculating the amount in controversy. Plaintiff argues that because he is bringing suit on behalf of other similarly situated plaintiffs, the costs of compliance and disgorgement may not be aggregated under\n    <em>\n     Ford, supra.\n    </em>\n    There, the court held that such costs cannot be aggregated in a class action suit.\n    <em>\n     In re Ford Motor Co./Citibank (S.D.), N.A.\n    </em>\n    , at 958-959. Regardless, it is unnecessary to consider these arguments here, as the unaggregated damages and costs outlined above already place the amount in controversy above the jurisdictional threshold.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
