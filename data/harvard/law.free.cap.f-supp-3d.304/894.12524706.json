(\"Electrolux\") alleging defects in a self-cleaning oven Electrolux manufactures. (Doc. 1.) Electrolux filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) asserting many of Plaintiffs' claims are insufficiently pled. Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition, Electrolux filed a reply brief, and the matter was taken under submission. For the reasons set forth below, Electrolux's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2015, Plaintiffs purchased a Kenmore Elite oven, manufactured by Electrolux, from Sears for $1,964.99. Plaintiffs purchased this model for its self-cleaning feature. On September 9, 2016, Plaintiffs used the self-cleaning feature for the first time, but after a few hours, discovered that the oven had stopped working. When Plaintiffs contacted Sears, they were told that Sears was aware of the issues with the oven, but the warranty had expired and Plaintiffs would need to pay for the repairs themselves. On inspection of the oven by a Sears' repairperson, the oven's thermostat could not support the temperature that was reached when the oven's self-cleaning feature was engaged. The repairperson advised Plaintiffs never to engage the self-cleaning function again. Plaintiffs were charged $184.37 for Sears to install a new thermostat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of themselves and on behalf of a National and a California State Class which include all persons who \"acquired an Electrolux designed and/or manufactured oven range primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ....\" (Cmplt., \u00b6 27.) Plaintiffs identify the following defect in the oven: \"[t]he oven's thermostat burns out while using the self-cleaning feature of the oven. Because of inherent design and manufacturing flaws (the \"Defect\") known to Electrolux, its Frigidaire and Kenmore oven thermostats are defective.\" (Cmplt., \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Electrolux has filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), challenging the sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is a challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations set forth in the complaint. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper where there is either a \"lack of a cognizable legal theory\" or \"the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Balistreri v.

Economic Loss Rule Precludes Plaintiffs' Strict Liability and Fraudulent Concealment Claims as Currently Pled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Electrolux contends that Plaintiffs' strict liability and fraudulent concealment claims are barred by the economic loss rule, which prohibits a tort claim for purely economic loss. According to Electrolux, Plaintiffs' damages are limited to paying for a repair to the oven and for loss of use resulting from being told not to use the self-cleaning feature on the oven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue they allege more than just economic loss: Plaintiffs and other putative class members have suffered property loss, financial harm, loss of use, and other damages. Plaintiffs maintain that at the pleading stage, this is sufficient. Plaintiffs also assert that the economic loss rule does not preclude their claims because they have a special relationship with Electrolux.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Nature of the Alleged Defect and Resulting Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As an initial matter, the complaint's allegations about the nature of the defect and the damages incurred are inconsistent. As it pertains to their own Electrolux oven, Plaintiffs allege a defect with their oven's thermostat such that it cannot withstand the temperatures during the self-cleaning cycle-i.e., the thermostat malfunctions and quits operating (Cmplt., \u00b6 12), apparently causing the entire oven to be unusable until the thermostat is replaced (Cmplt., \u00b6 26). After specifically defining the \"Defect\" as the burning out of the oven's thermostat during the oven's self-cleaning function, the complaint subsequently refers more generally to \"Defects\" in the oven caused by an unspecified problem in the \"electrical system\" creating a fire hazard (Cmplt., \u00b6\u00b6 26, 31, 85). Plaintiffs apparently kept their oven even after the thermostat was repaired (Cmplt. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24), and never allege they were informed or believed it presented a safety or fire hazard. They state only that the repair technician told them never to engage the self-cleaning function, presumably because it would again damage the thermostat. Later in the complaint, however, there are allegations that the \"Defects would cause their ovens to fail, combust, and catch fire-damaging the ovens and other property,\n   and threatening the personal safety of customers.\" (Cmplt., \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The nature of the alleged defect and the problems it purportedly cause are directly related to assessing whether the economic loss rule applies, what problem Electrolux was allegedly aware of before the product was sold to Plaintiffs, and what may or may not be covered by any implied or express warranty. The Court will evaluate Plaintiffs' claims on the basis of the defect as they define it and allege to have experienced it (design and manufacturing defects causing the oven's thermostat to burn out while using the self-cleaning feature of the oven (Cmplt., \u00b6 12) ). Subsequent allegations pertaining to different, unspecified defects in the oven's electrical system that posed a safety hazard or caused damage to property other than the oven will not be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Economic Loss Rule Precludes Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In California, under the \"economic loss rule,\" a manufacturer or distributor may be strictly liable or liable for negligence for injury to property caused by a defective product, but is not liable in tort for purely economic loss. The product defect must cause damage to other property, that is, property other than the product itself.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v. Super.

Arguing there are damages alleged beyond purely economic loss, Plaintiffs point to allegations of \"property loss, financial harm, loss of use, and other damages,\" but the only property loss Plaintiffs alleged was to the oven itself, which does not constitute more than economic loss.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777255\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/473/#p483\">\n    29 Cal. 4th at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20614\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20P.3d%20450\">\n    58 P.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (damage to property must be property\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the product). \"Financial harm\" and \"loss of use\" as alleged generally by Plaintiffs are economic losses only.\n   <em>\n    Casden Builders Inc. v.

No Exception to the Economic Loss Rule Applies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain their claims are exempt from the economic loss rule because they have a special relationship with Electrolux. An exception to the economic loss rule exists where the relationship between the parties is such that it would be equitable to impose a duty of care to avoid purely economic loss.\n   <em>\n    Ott v.

(Cmplt., \u00b6 12, 13.) Plaintiffs claim Electrolux knew its ovens contained this defect but concealed this fact from consumers. (Cmplt. \u00b6 92.) As discussed above, the nature of the defect, and thus the nature of the information Electrolux concealed, is not clear and thus not specific. While Plaintiffs allege and define their oven defect as one pertaining to the oven thermostat causing it to fail during the self-cleaning function, Plaintiffs later appear to allege a broader \"electrical defect\" that caused ovens to combust and catch fire, melt, and cause damage to other property besides the oven itself, creating a safety hazard. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Cmplt., \u00b6 12 (defining defect as \"oven's thermostat burns out while using the self-cleaning feature of the oven\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90, 92 (defect in \"the electrical system\").) Plaintiffs themselves, however, did not allege they experienced an electrical defect in the oven that caused a safety and fire hazard-in fact, Plaintiffs apparently fixed their oven's thermostat and kept the oven, albeit on the admonition not to engage the self-cleaning function without risk of damaging the thermostat again. After defining the \"Defect\" (Cmplt., \u00b6 12), the complaint then refers inconsistently to \"Defects\" (\u00b6\u00b6 15, 16). Paragraph 27 uses Defect and Defects interchangeably, and Paragraph 31 returns to claiming there is a \"uniform Defect.\" It is possible the allegations can be clarified, but as the complaint is pled, it is difficult to know the specific nature of\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   defect or defects Electrolux allegedly concealed from Plaintiffs. For this reason, the Court cannot conclude that the circumstances of Electrolux' alleged omission or what information Electrolux withheld from consumers is pled with specificity.

Plaintiffs maintain their primary theory is predicated on an omission/concealment and argue it can be sufficiently pled by stating a reason why the omission was false and misleading.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , to successfully allege a manufacturer was aware of a defect, a plaintiff is typically required to allege\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the defendant obtained knowledge of the specific defect\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff's purchase of the defective product.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048442\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1136/#p1145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048442\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1136/#p1145\">\n    at 1145-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, Wilson alleged his HP laptop would run on battery power, even when plugged into an a/c adapter, requiring him to replace the motherboard to utilize the laptop. Wilson alleged HP knew of this defect because of its access to aggregate information and data, another lawsuit against HP involving the same defect, and Wilson produced several customer complaints about the defect made by others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   court contrasted actual knowledge allegations in several cases, first comparing cases where the allegations were sufficient.

The plaintiff sufficiently alleged Hyundai knew about this defect because it constantly tracked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration database for reports of defective Sonata sub-frames, and that database revealed Sonatas were experiencing unusually high levels of sub-frame deterioration and other structural deterioration issues. Contrarily, in cases where plaintiffs provided only conclusory\n   allegations that the defendant manufacturer had access to information about the defect or was in a \"superior position to know the truth about the [product],\" the claims were deemed deficient.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048442\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1136/#p1145\">\n    668 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1147 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tietsworth v.

Electrolux argues it had no reason to know of these complaints because it has no connection to this consumer affairs website nor have Plaintiffs alleged such a connection. Moreover, Electrolux maintains, very few of the complaints are relevant to the thermostat defect Plaintiffs experienced with their oven, and over half the complaints were posted\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs had purchased Electrolux's oven.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Consumer complaints or consumer reports of defects at a relevant time and in a manner that would provide notice of the defect to the defendant may be sufficient to show actual knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Kowalsky v.

Cal. 2011). Plaintiffs present complaints from a consumer affairs website, but unlike the consumer complaints in\n   <em>\n    Cirulli\n   </em>\n   and similar to those considered in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs allege no link between that website and Electrolux, such that Electrolux would have been aware of the complaints. Several people who posted complaints noted they had called Sears to report problems, but none alleged they contacted Electrolux. Without any factual basis showing how Electrolux would have been aware of these consumer complaints, they are insufficient to allege Electrolux's knowledge of the defect. Additionally, of the 23 consumer complaints Plaintiff references, only 10 were made before Plaintiffs purchased Electrolux's product, and of those 10, only two relate to the thermostat and the self-cleaning feature defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege Electrolux obtained notice of the oven's defect through its own early warning systems and statistical analyses, and because Electrolux conducts a significant amount of after-market testing that should have informed it that the ovens had a defective electrical system. (Cmplt., \u00b6 17.) While Plaintiffs' allegations are more than speculative assertions that Electrolux has knowledge of the defect due to its access to aggregate data or its \"superior position,\" allegations found lacking in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , they are too generic and non-specific to meet the requirements under Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs allege Electrolux knew of the defect because of its \"early warning systems and statistical analyses that it employs, or should have employed ....\" (Cmplt., \u00b6 16.) Not only does this allegation lack specificity as to what early warning system or analyses were employed, it\n   equivocates whether Electrolux actually has such early warning systems or analyses in place. Plaintiffs also allege Electrolux conducted a significant amount of after-market testing, but the complaint lacks any specific details about what type of after-market testing was performed and whether this unidentified testing was performed prior to Plaintiffs' purchase of Electrolux's oven in June 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Electrolux (1) monitors warranty statistics and service call rates to detect problems as soon as customers begin to experience them, (2) tracks returned products and parts to investigate faults and reduce warranty claims rates, and (3) employs quality engineers to monitor customer complaints from Electrolux's call center to detect problems. However, there are no allegations showing whether complaints were made to Electrolux's call center, or whether customers were otherwise reporting problems to Electrolux or returning the product or parts to Electrolux. To the extent these allegations are made on \"information and belief\" as noted in the complaint, this lacks the requisite specificity because there is no explanation upon what the belief is founded.\n   <em>\n    Shroyer v.

The customer complaints on a consumer affairs website have not been linked to Electrolux to show how Electrolux would have necessarily been aware of these complaints, and the allegations regarding systems or testing that Electrolux may or may not have had in place lack specificity and detail about what testing was performed, when such testing was done, or any allegation showing that complaints or defects were reported to Electrolux during the period before Plaintiffs purchased their oven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Actual Reliance Allegations Are Insufficient\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Electrolux argues Plaintiffs' actual reliance allegations for each of their fraud-based claims are inadequate because they fail to explain what marketing materials, statements, or representations Plaintiffs relied upon in making their purchase of Electrolux's product. Reliance can be shown in a fraudulent omission case by establishing that \"had the omitted information been disclosed, [the plaintiff] would have been aware of it and behaved differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Boschma v.

(Cmplt., \u00b6\u00b6 26, 96.) Plaintiffs' allegations about the nature of the defect are inconsistent, and their allegations of reliance on Electrolux's misrepresentations or omissions are mixed with other allegations about a seemingly different type of defect in the oven. Without a specific and clear allegation about the nature of the defect, it is unclear what was concealed from Plaintiffs about the product and whether that information would influence the consumers' decision to buy the product.

Section 2310(d) provides that any \"consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter, or under a written warranty, implied warranty, or service contract\" may sue for damages and any other legal and equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Electrolux provided a written warranty to them and the putative class that warranted the oven would be free from defects in materials or workmanship for a year from the original date of purchase including to those customers who purchased extended warranties that added an additional three years' guarantee of non-defective material workmanship. (Cmplt., \u00b6 43.) According to Plaintiffs, Electrolux breached the warranty obligations by failing to repair or replace the oven at no charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Electrolux asserts Sears provided the warranty to Plaintiffs, and since Electrolux did not provide the warranty, Plaintiffs' express warranty claim against it fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Electrolux also argues that even if it had issued the warranty, it is limited to materials and workmanship and does not cover design defects. In response, Plaintiffs argue the warranty is available on Electrolux's website, and Electrolux has therefore either authorized the warranty or ratified it.

The complaint alleges clearly that Electrolux provided a written warranty to Plaintiffs. (Cmplt., \u00b6 43.) Electrolux's argument that it did not actually issue the warranty is a dispute about the veracity of the allegations, not the sufficiency of the pleading. Whether the warranty was\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   issued by Sears or whether Electrolux somehow ratified the warranty by making it available to retailers or otherwise publishing it on its website is a factual determination requiring evidentiary support; it is not appropriate for decision on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Stamas v.

The complaint sufficiently alleges the thermostat defect was both a design and manufacturing flaw. (Cmplt., \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18 (defect caused by inherent design and manufacturing flaws).)

According to Electrolux, Plaintiffs used their oven for approximately a year after they purchased it and then continued to use the oven after the thermostat problem emerged and was repaired. Plaintiffs respond that the oven was not fit for its ordinary purpose because\n   the oven created a safety hazard. Moreover, Plaintiffs maintain that when an ancillary feature on a product, like the self-cleaning function on Plaintiffs' oven, cannot be used due to a defect, at least one case has held that a product may not be usable for its ordinary purpose.

The allegations indicate Plaintiffs kept their oven after the thermostat problem was discovered and repaired, even though they were warned by the repairperson not to reengage the self-cleaning function. From this allegation, it cannot be presumed the existence of the defect created a safety hazard if Plaintiffs continued to use the oven despite awareness of the defect with the thermostat. The oven was not unfit for its ordinary purposes based on a safety issue, at least as the defect is defined in the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cmplt. \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nevertheless, it appears Plaintiffs oven was unusable for its ordinary purpose between the time the defect manifested during use of the self-cleaning cycle and when Plaintiffs had the thermostat repaired by Sears. (Cmplt., \u00b6 21 (after engaging the self-cleaning function, Plaintiffs discovered the oven had stopped working). The inability of the oven to properly heat and cook food after the thermostat was broken by the self-cleaning function rendered the oven unfit for its ordinary purpose. After the thermostat was repaired, Plaintiffs were told never to engage the self-cleaning function again. While the self-cleaning function may be an ancillary feature of the oven, the situation here is different from cases where an ancillary feature itself does not operate as promised, but the product still operates in a safe and reliable manner. For example, as long as a car can provide safe, reliable transportation, it is generally considered merchantable even if certain features such as a navigation system, do not function properly.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p979\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979-80 (N.D.

To restore the oven to any use, the thermostat had to be replaced. This is distinguishable from an ancillary feature that does not function properly due to a defect, yet the product itself continues to be fit for its ordinary purposes. Neither claim is deficient for failure to allege a lack of fitness for the oven's ordinary purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Implied Warranty Claim Under California Commercial Code Fails for Lack of Vertical Privity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Electrolux argues Plaintiffs' implied warranty claim (Count III) fails because Plaintiffs allege they bought their oven from Sears, so there is no vertical privity between Plaintiffs and Electrolux.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although the Beverly-Song Consumer Warranty Act allows for an implied warranty claim regardless of privity, implied warranty claims under the California Commercial Code still require privity\n   of contract.

They allege only that the Sears repairperson told them not to engage the self-cleaning function again. (Cmplt., \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26.)
