In the Underlying Litigation, Bluegreen Resorts Management, Inc. (Bluegreen) sued the Association based on the Association's alleged improper termination of a management agreement, which allegedly caused Bluegreen reputational injury and other damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court is the Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 28) filed by Scottsdale, to which the Association filed a Response in Opposition (Doc. 32). Scottsdale filed a Reply (Doc. 35). Having considered the parties' submissions, the record, and the pertinent law, the Court concludes that Scottsdale's motion must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Uncontested Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Association is a condominium/timeshare association located in Ormond Beach, Florida. (Ins. Policy, Ex. A to Doc. 1, at 4). As alleged in the second amended complaint of the Underlying Litigation, the Association and Bluegreen entered into a management agreement in September of 1981, designating Bluegreen as the Association's sole management firm in charge of, for instance, hiring staff, reviewing contracts, and maintaining financial records. (Ex. B to Doc. 1 at 3). This management agreement, as alleged by Bluegreen, was in effect until August 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Bluegreen alleges that the Association breached the management agreement by improperly terminating the contract, causing reputational injury and damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). According to the underlying complaint, on July 10, 2015, the Association's board voted to terminate the agreement and sent a 60-day notice-of-termination letter to Bluegreen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Despite Bluegreen's objections enumerated on July 21, 2015, the Association included information regarding the termination of Bluegreen in its August 2015 newsletter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). On August 21, 2015, the Association's board selected a new management company, and \"on or about September 9, 2015\" Bluegreen met with the incoming management company \"to provide the items and information related to the operation of the Association and the Outrigger Beach Club.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the Association's Counterclaim (Doc. 11 at 6) filed in the present action, Bluegreen's claims in the Underlying Litigation \"trigger Scottsdale's duty to defend the Association for the claims asserted ... pursuant to the Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Scottsdale issued the relevant commercial general liability policy (the Policy) to the Association with a policy period beginning September 10, 2015, and ending September 10, 2016. Scottsdale has provided a defense to the Association in the Underlying Litigation for one year under a reservation of rights and now seeks a declaratory judgment that the Policy does not provide coverage to the Association because the claim: 1) does not seek damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" under the Coverage A Insuring Agreement, 2) does not arise from \"personal and advertising injury\" under the Coverage B Insuring Agreement, and 3) even if it does arise from \"personal and advertising injury,\" falls squarely within the Policy's exclusion for \"personal and advertising injury\" arising out of a breach of contract. (Doc. 28). Scottsdale contends that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify the Association in the Underlying Litigation.

As a consequence of the Association's breach of the Management Agreement, Bluegreen has suffered reputational injury and other damages in excess of $100,000.\" (Ex. B to Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Personal and Advertising Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Policy provides that Scottsdale will defend and indemnify the Association for personal and advertising injury. (Ex. B to Doc. 1 at 15, \u00a7 1 (Coverage B)(1)(a) ). \"Personal and advertising injury\" is defined, in relevant part, as \"injury ... arising out of one or more of the following offenses: ... Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, \u00a7 V(14) ). \"Advertisement\" is further defined as \"a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about [the Association's] goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, \u00a7 V(1) ). The Scottsdale policy also includes an exclusionary clause providing that coverage does not apply to personal or advertising injury arising out of a breach of contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, \u00a7 1 (Coverage B)(2)(f) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Association argues that the personal and advertising injury portions of its coverage are implicated because Bluegreen allegedly suffered reputational injury. These injuries, the Association contends, are premised on the Association's August 2015 newsletter and Bluegreen's September meeting with the new management company, both of which allegedly caused reputational damages. According to the\n   Association, the alleged \"injury or disparagement of goods and services\" did not arise out of a breach of the management agreement and therefore is outside the breach-of-contract exclusion. In contrast, Scottsdale contends that Bluegreen's damages are for economic loss and thus are not a result of personal or advertising injuries. Scottsdale additionally asserts that the policy's exclusion for injuries arising out of a breach of contract applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Any reputational injury allegedly caused by the August 2015 newsletter falls within the definition of \"personal and advertising injury.\" As alleged, the newsletter qualified as a notice about services sent to the Association's members to garner support that disparaged Bluegreen's goods and services, causing injury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. B to Doc. 1 at 23, \u00a7 V(14) ). Reading the underlying complaint and policy in a light most favorable to the insured, it is possible that the August 2015 Newsletter actually harmed Bluegreen's reputation, causing a \"personal and advertising injury\" under the terms of the policy. On the other hand, as discussed below, Bluegreen alleges no facts pointing to reputational injury occurring from the meeting with new management around September 9th. As such, only the August 2015 newsletter could trigger coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While the underlying complaint points to a potential advertising injury caused by the August 2015 newsletter, Scottsdale has no duty to defend or indemnify due to the policy's breach-of-contract exception. The underlying complaint does not request damages for any and all representational injuries caused by the Association. Rather, Bluegreen limits its pleading to \"reputational injury and other damages\" that are \"a\n   <em>\n    consequence of\n   </em>\n   the Association's breach of the management agreement.\" The underlying principle in the terms \"as a consequence of\" and \"arising out of\" is that, in this case, the injury\n   <em>\n    results from\n   </em>\n   an act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of whether the August 2015 newsletter occurred as a result of the breach, the only reputational damages Bluegreen requests are those that arise out of the breach of the management agreement. As such, under the clear language of the policy, the breach-of-contract exclusion applies to any alleged reputational injury and bars coverage for the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Policy Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Scottsdale also contends that no events related to the alleged breach of contract and resulting damages occurred within the policy's effective period of September 10, 2015, to September 10, 2016. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Coverage B of the Policy limits the application of the policy \"to 'personal and advertising injury' caused by an offense arising out of [the Association's] business but only if the offense was committed ... during the policy period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, \u00a7 1 (Coverage B)(1)(b) ). Additionally, Coverage B specifically excludes \" 'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of oral or written publication, in any manner, of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, \u00a7 2(c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its allegations, Bluegreen pointed to several events, most of which clearly occurred before the policy's effective period-the July 10, 2015 board vote to terminate the management agreement; the August 21, 2015 meeting to install a new managing company; and the August 2015 newsletter. Additionally, Bluegreen details a series of letters regarding the alleged wrongful termination that were sent before September 10, 2015. Under the plain meaning of the contract, none of these occurrences could trigger coverage. Specifically, no argument is made that the August 2015 newsletter-from which the Association asserts the \"personal and advertising injury\" arose-was not published before the beginning of the policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Association asserts that Bluegreen's meeting with the Association's new managing company \"on or about September 9, 2015 to provide the items and information related to the operation of\" the Association could place the Underlying Litigation within the coverage period. But even if the meeting did occur within the policy period, Bluegreen presents no allegations in the underlying complaint that this meeting caused any damage to its reputation or constituted a breach of the management agreement. Rather, the meeting was an exchange of information between management companies. As such, the Underlying Litigation does not fall within the policy because, as alleged, any offense that occurred took place outside of the policy period\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plain language of the insurance policy controls. No events, as alleged, potentially causing injury occurred during the policy period. Thus, Scottsdale has no duty to defend or indemnify the Association in the Underlying Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Association's Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Association asserts that the Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied because Scottsdale failed to overcome the Association's affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, and estoppel. According to the Association, it was prejudiced because Scottsdale failed to initiate the present action to disclaim coverage for more than one year despite being aware of all the facts and circumstances of the underlying case. In response, Scottsdale contends that the affirmative defenses fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under Florida law, the general rule is that \"the insurer's coverage or restrictions on the coverage cannot be extended by the doctrine of waiver and estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

(Ex. A to Doc. 35). The Association points to no binding precedent applying equitable doctrines to a coverage defense\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the insurer issues a reservation of rights letter. Additionally, the Association does not claim it was unaware of the effect of the reservation. Therefore, the affirmative defenses of estoppel, waiver, and laches do not preclude entry of summary judgment for Scottsdale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Timing of Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Association argues that Scottsdale's motion should be denied as premature because it was filed before adequate opportunity for discovery. Scottsdale, on the other hand, asserts that discovery is neither required nor necessary because the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and the affirmative defenses fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Rule 56 implies that \"summary judgment should not be granted until the party opposing the motion has had an adequate opportunity for discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Snook v.

But, as stated above, this argument fails because the Association's affirmative defenses fail as a matter of Florida law. Estoppel theories may only apply when the insured proves prejudice\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the insurer fails to issue a reservation-of-rights letter to insured.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7439772\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/653/371/#p373\">\n    653 So.2d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
