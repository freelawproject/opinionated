SPRINGMANN, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Motions for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 129, 131] filed by Defendant Taplogic, LLC, and a Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 142] filed by Plaintiff Agri-Labs Holding LLC. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment on non-infringement, invalidity, and lack of personal jurisdiction and venue. The Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on infringement. These Motions are now fully briefed and ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 22, 2015, the Plaintiff filed its Complaint [ECF No. 1] against the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant infringed the Plaintiff's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C286%2C857\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,286,857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '857 Patent\") regarding a \"Soil Sample Tracking System and Method.\" The Defendant answered on February 17, 2015 [ECF No. 11], alleging numerous affirmative defenses and counterclaiming for a declaratory judgment that it has not infringed the '857 Patent and that the '857 Patent is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The '857 Patent involves a method and system directed to soil sampling to determine nutrient levels across various areas in fields. After samples were collected, they could then be tested to determine any nutritional deficiencies. The test results would be transferred to a fertilizer applicator, which would adjust the flow of nutrients according to recorded geographic positions. Previously, a farmer who wanted to evaluate the nutritional needs of soil would collect soil samples from various places and mark the containers into which the samples were placed with individual identifiers to memorialize the precise geographic position from which each sample was collected. Handwritten identifiers and pre-printed labels were two common methods for marking sample containers. However, both of these methods were time-consuming and prone to errors. Technicians could misread handwritten identifiers in a lab. They could also incorrectly enter the information on the pre-printed labels into a computer. The '857 Patent purported to solve these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There are two independent claims at issue. Independent Claim 1 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A method comprising: generating a plurality of soil sample containers each having a unique identifier associated therewith; manually pulling at least one soil sample from a field and placing said at least one soil sample in a respective one of said plurality of soil sample containers; scanning said unique identifier associated with said soil sample container containing said at least one soil sample with a handheld remote terminal, wherein said handheld remote terminal includes a handheld remote terminal sampling application, wherein said handheld remote terminal sampling application is configured to allow a sample taker to enter a farm/client name and a field identifier, and wherein said handheld remote terminal sampling application includes a handheld scanning application configured to allow said sample taker to scan said unique identifier with a scanner on said handheld remote terminal; obtaining a geographic coordinate reading associated with a location in said field from where said soil sample is obtained; and associating said soil sample with said unique identifier and said geographic coordinate reading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Independent Claim 13 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A system, comprising: a plurality of containers each containing a unique identifier; a handheld remote terminal including a device operable to read said unique identifiers and geographic position sensor, wherein a plurality of soil samples are manually taken from a field and as each said soil sample is placed in said container said handheld remote terminal includes an application operable to read said unique identifier and associate said unique identifier and thus said container with said soil sample, wherein said handheld remote terminal is operable to automatically use said geographic position sensor to obtain a position reading in said field and further associate said soil sample with said geographic position, wherein said unique identifier and said geographic position are stored in a database; a second application on said handheld remote terminal operable to sync the contents of said database to a\n   lab device, wherein said lab device is operable to read said unique identifier upon receipt of said containers; a test instrument operable to test said soil samples and generate one or more test results as a function of said soil sample, wherein said test results are uploaded to said unique identifier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The product accused of violating the claimed method and system is called the AgPhD Soil Test application (\"the AgPhD App\"), developed by the Defendant for use with smartphones. The Plaintiff accuses the Defendant of infringement because when the end-users of the AgPhD App use the smartphone app for its intended purpose, the Plaintiff asserts that both the method and system claims of the '857 Patent are infringed. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant is liable for this infringement because all of the relevant steps of the method and all of the components of the system are attributable to the Defendant. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant is liable both for direct and indirect infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, the Court will address the Defendant's arguments regarding personal jurisdiction and improper venue. As to jurisdiction, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant waived its right to challenge personal jurisdiction when it appeared, answered, and asserted counterclaims against the Plaintiff. The Court agrees. \"[B]y asking the court for relief, [the Defendant] consented to jurisdiction in the same way a plaintiff consents to jurisdiction by filing an action with a court.\"\n   <em>\n    Mallard v.

In this case, the Defendant affirmatively requested declaratory relief, litigated this case on the merits for nearly three years, and only now, at summary judgment, argues the point. Therefore, the Defendant has waived this defense, and the Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Venue in patent actions is governed exclusively by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which provides: \"Any civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\" In\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland LLC v.

Thus, the Defendant argues, in this case, venue is improper because the Defendant resides in Kentucky and has no \"regular and established\" place of business in Indiana. The Defendant also argues that it has not waived its right to challenge venue because of this recent change in controlling law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Resolving a split among the district courts, the Federal Circuit recently held that venue challenges based on\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   were not previously available to defendants under the meaning of Rule 12(g)(2) and, thus, were not waived under Rule 12(h)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    In re Micron Tech., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1099\">\n    875 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1099-1100 (Fed.

The '857 Patent, however, provides a specific way to solve a specific problem. The '857 Patent does not claim the ends sought, but rather claims the means of achieving those ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Prior to the invention claimed in the '857 Patent, several different techniques existed, and still exist today, for soil sampling. One such technique involves the use of a computer to guide the human sampler to a location in a field where, upon arrival, a sample would be obtained and placed into a container. The sampler would then handwrite information on the container to identify the container, such as a farm name, a field name, and a method of identification, like a number. This method was time consuming and prone to errors caused by mislabeling or misreading the information. Another technique involved pre-printing labels. In this technique, a sampler would place a pre-printed label onto a container after obtaining the sample. This technique was also time consuming and also vulnerable to errors such as misplacing labels. Both techniques were also vulnerable to errors in the laboratory; the identifiers could be misread or incorrectly entered into a computer. Others sought to solve these problem with complex machinery that was expensive to purchase and to fix. The invention embodied in the '857 Patent improves the technological process of soil sampling and the manner in which soil sample containers are tracked and associated with the geographic location in the field from where the samples are obtained. The method and system claimed in the '857 Patent therefore accomplish something the industry had not previously been able to accomplish and resolve a particular problem related to the collection of soil samples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Defendant also argues that the Plaintiff has done no more than add a generic computer to a method conventionally known in the art. In\n   <em>\n    Multimedia Plus, Inc. v. Playerlync, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that \"[f]or a computer to 'impose a meaningful limit on the scope of a claim, it must play a significant part in permitting the claimed method to be performed, rather than function solely as an obvious mechanism for permitting a solution to be achieved more quickly, i.e., through the utilization of a computer for performing calculations.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123595\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/264/#p271\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (finding that \"the patent [did] not disclose any specialized programming or other specific technology for accomplishing [the claimed] functions\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    SiRF Tech., Inc. v.

The Defendant points to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C947%2C866\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,947,866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '866 Patent\"), which claims an \"Apparatus and Method For Handheld Sampling,\" and argues that the specification of the '866 Patent states that the apparatus could be used with a smartphone, providing the necessary motivation. Specifically, the '866 Patent states: \"In another embodiment (not shown), the latest generation of hybrid cell phones may be used in place of [personal data assistant] 30 and camera 20, as hybrid cell phones now include a built-in camera, web browser, and full-fledged [personal data assistant] capabilities.\" '866 Patent, col. 5:9-12. The Defendant then argues in a conclusory fashion that \"all of the steps in\n   claim 1 and most of Claim 13\" of the '857 Patent are present in the '866 Patent, notes that the '866 Patent is in the same field as the '857 Patent, and reiterates that \"almost any patents mentioned have a motivation to combine as noted in\" the Tanner declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Rep. Br. 10, ECF No. 150.) But, as discussed above, this is insufficient to meet the Defendant's burden of proof to show invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the Defendant has failed even to mention objective considerations of nonobviousness. The Defendant attempts to justify this omission, arguing that the Plaintiff \"did not use them in their patent application and has no expert to discuss them so it is not necessary for [the Defendant] to do so.\" The Court disagrees with this assertion. First, it is unclear why a patentee would be required to \"use\" secondary considerations in its patent application. This is especially so with commercial success, a consideration explicitly laid out by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , which would likely be unknown at the time of patent. Moreover, the Federal Circuit has made clear that there is no \"burden-shifting framework\" by which the Plaintiff must prove secondary considerations once the Defendant has made a prima facie showing of obviousness based only on the prior art.\n   <em>\n    In re Cyclobenzaprine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755968\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/1063/#p1077\">\n    676 F.3d at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing where \"it [was] clear that the district court assumed that it was [the plaintiff's] burden to disprove the court's initial obviousness finding\"). Thus, the absence of an expert to explain these considerations is not fatal to the Court's consideration of them. In fact, Federal Circuit precedent does not support an argument that expert testimony is required to show objective considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755968\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/1063/#p1077\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding district court was \"wrong to ignore the non-expert evidence proffered on this point\"). Without evaluating its weight, the Court notes that there is evidence of record as least as to the commercial success of the AgPhD App. The Plaintiff's failure to address any objective indicia of non-obviousness in response to the Defendant's arguments does not aid the Defendant in meeting its burden to show obviousness by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, the Court will deny the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Accused Product Infringes the '857 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Patent infringement analysis involves two steps. First, the Court must determine the scope and meaning of the claims of the patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman v.

The Defendant first argues that it is the wrong party to the lawsuit because it does not own the AgPhD App. In support, the Defendant states that another company offers the AgPhD App on the App Store and Google Play, that the Defendant has never offered the AgPhD App on the App Store and Google Play, and that the Defendant does not own or control the website agphdsoiltest.com. However, the Defendant admits that it developed the accused product, and the Plaintiff has produced other evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the Defendant is or was responsible for the sale and\n   maintenance of the accused product.

The Defendant argues that it does not indirectly infringe because the Plaintiff has come forward with no evidence of instances of direct infringement and because the AgPhD App has substantial noninfringing uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

Independent Claim 1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Independent Claim 1 consists of eight steps, all of which the Plaintiff has the\n   burden to demonstrate are performed during the use of the AgPhD App. The first step requires \"generating a plurality of soil sample containers each having a unique identifier associated therewith.\" In its Markman Order, the Court construed the term \"generate\" to mean \"deliver or produce.\" The Court construed the term \"unique identifier\" to mean \"a machine readable representation of data, which may but need not consist of a bar code, relating to the object to which it is attached.\" At some point, users of the AgPhD App could order soil sample bags, containing QR codes from Midwest Laboratories through the agphdsoiltest.com website. The Defendant argues that this limitation is not met because there is no evidence that a QR code is a \"unique identifier.\" However, the instructions provided with the AgPhD Soil Test App instruct the end-user to \"[s]can the QR code on the bag ... to identify the sample location.\" From this a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the QR code is a representation of data that is machine readable that relates to the object to which it is attached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tinnus Enter., LLC v.

We are aware of no case law prohibiting a court from relying on product instructions to find direct infringement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The second step requires \"manually pulling at least one soil sample from a field and placing said at least one soil sample in a respective one of said plurality of soil sample containers.\" There are multiple ways to pull a soil sample, both manual and mechanical. A reasonable trier of fact could find that the instructions provided with the AgPhD Soil Test App instruct the end-user to manually pull soil samples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The third step consists of \"scanning said unique identifier associated with said soil sample container containing said at least one soil sample with a handheld remote terminal.\" In its Markman Order, the Court construed \"handheld remote terminal\" to mean a \"smartphone.\" The Court construed the term \"scan\" to mean \"to convert into digital form for processing\" and \"scanner\" to mean \"a device that converts information into digital form for processing.\" The Defendant argues that the AgPhD App merely takes images and that taking an image with a smartphone is not \"scanning\" under the Court's definition. But, a reasonable trier of fact could determine that the purpose of \"taking a photo\" of the QR code is to identify the sample and that using a digital image for identification necessary requires the QR code to be \"convert[ed] into digital form for processing.\" Even if this claim limitation is not met literally, a reasonable trier of fact could find that it is met under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The fourth step requires that the \"handheld remote terminal includes a handheld remote terminal sampling application.\" The AgPhD App is an application that is downloaded and installed onto smartphones for the purpose of aiding in soil sampling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The fifth step requires that the \"handheld remote terminal sampling application is configured to allow a sample taker to enter a farm/client name and a field identifier.\" The Defendant argues that the AgPhD App does not meet this limitation because the end-user can also enter the client/farm name on a tablet or a personal computer and choose to enter it via the website rather than the app. But, the '857 Patent does not require that the end-user's only option to enter the farm/client name and a field identifier be via a smartphone.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vulcan Eng'g Co. v.

Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The sixth step requires that the \"handheld remote terminal sampling application includes a handheld scanning application configured to allow said sample taker to scan said unique identifier with a scanner on said handheld remote terminal.\" In its Markman Order, the Court defined \"application\" as \"a piece of software that performs one or more functions.\" The Defendant argues that the AgPhD App does not meet this limitation because it is only one piece of software, and there is no separate scanner. The Defendant also argues that the QR code is not a unique identifier but that the QR code is used only to generate the unique identifier within the AgPhD App. As the Court noted above, a reasonable trier of fact could find that taking an image of a QR code in order to generate a number falls under the Court's definition of scanning, i.e., \"to convert into digital form for processing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Defendant's assertion that the claims require a separate piece of software for the scanning function is unpersuasive. \"It is settled law, and it is good sense, that one does not escape infringement by combining into one element what a claim specifies as two, provided that the single element performs the function of both in the same way.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibbs v.

Given the Court's construction of \"application\" to mean \"a piece of software that performs one or more functions,\" a reasonable trier of fact could find that a single application can perform both steps required by Claim 1 and, therefore, that this limitation is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The seventh step requires \"obtaining a geographic coordinate reading associated with a location in said field from where said soil sample is obtained.\" The Defendant argues that the AgPhD App does not meet this limitation because the end-user can obtain a geographic reading from anywhere, not just a location in a field, such as a golf course or a yard. But, again, nothing in the '857 Patent requires that the application permit geographic readings\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in a field, and extra capabilities do not automatically make the app non-infringing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The final step is \"associating said soil sample with said unique identifier and said geographic coordinate reading.\" Although the Defendant insists the app does not have to, it admits that the AgPhD App can associate a unique identifier with a geographic coordinate reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether, in the course of using the AgPhD App for its intended purpose, all of the steps of the method of Claim 1 are performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2. Dependent Claims 2-5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Dependent Claim 2 adds the limitation: \"wherein said unique identifier comprises a barcode.\" At least at some point, the soil sampling bags delivered by Midwest Laboratories contained QR codes, and the Plaintiff claims that it is a well-known\n   fact that QR codes are a type of bar code. The Defendant argues that the only evidence that the Plaintiff has offered to satisfy its burden of proof is a Wikipedia article, which is not typically admissible evidence. The Defendant also argues that the Plaintiff cannot meet its burden of proof on this Claim without expert testimony, which it does not have. The Court agrees. QR codes and their relationship to bar codes is not something that is within the common and ordinary experience of a lay juror. The Plaintiff has disclosed no experts in this case and has proffered no other admissible evidence. Without expert testimony, the Plaintiff cannot meet its burden of proof at trial to show that the bags delivered by Midwest Laboratories for use with the AgPhD App meet this limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Claim 3 requires: \"The method of claim 1, further comprising storing said unique identifier and said geographic coordinate reading in a database associated with said handheld remote terminal.\" The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff needs expert testimony to establish this limitation, which it does not have. The Court agrees. Although \"database\" as used in the '857 Patent may be commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, it is not commonly understood by a lay juror. The Plaintiff argues that there must be a database associated with the smartphone because Claim 4, which depends from Claim 3, requires syncing said database with a server, and the Defendant admits that the AgPhD App syncs data located on the App itself to a server and that once the data is transferred to the server, it is stored on a database. However, the deposition testimony on which the Plaintiff relies for this admission indicates only that information is stored in a database associated with a\n   <em>\n    server\n   </em>\n   , not with the\n   <em>\n    handheld remote terminal\n   </em>\n   as claimed. Moreover, the Court does not find that \"syncing\" is a term commonly understood by a lay juror. Thus, the Plaintiff lacks expert testimony to explain, for example, how a database works, how a database is \"associated\" with any given device, or whether two databases are, in fact, required for syncing to occur. Thus, without expert testimony, the Plaintiff cannot met its burden to show that the \"database\" limitation is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Claim 4 requires: \"The method of claim 3 further comprising syncing said database associated with said handheld remote terminal with a server.\" Because this claim depends from Claim 3, and the Plaintiff has not met its burden of proof to show that all of the limitations of Claim 3 are met, the Plaintiff necessarily cannot meet its burden of proof to show that Claim 4 is infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is not clear whether the remaining Claims depending from Claim 1 are still at issue. In its final infringement contentions, the Plaintiff has also asserted infringement of Dependent Claim 5, whereas the Defendant, in its final non-infringement contentions includes arguments regarding Dependent Claims 5-12. Neither party argued the merits of these Claims in their briefing. However, each of Dependent Claims 5-12 require the \"database\" limitation from Claim 3, and therefore, the Plaintiff cannot satisfy its burden of proof to show infringement as to any of these Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment of non-infringement as to Dependent Claims 2-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    b. System Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Plaintiff has the burden to prove that when end-users of the AgPhD App use the app for its intended purpose, all of the components of the claimed system are present. One of the limitations in Independent Claim 13 requires that \"said unique identifier and said geographic position\n   are stored in a database,\" where an application is \"operable to sync the contents of said database to a lab device.\" However, the Plaintiff's argument suffers from the same flaws as its argument regarding Dependent Claim 3. As the Court noted above, \"database\" is not commonly understood by the lay juror, and the Plaintiff has no expert witness or other admissible evidence that this limitation is met. Therefore, the Plaintiff cannot meet its burden of proof to show infringement of Claim 13. Nor, therefore, can the Plaintiff meet its burden of proof as to any of the Claims depending from Claim 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    c.
