STORY, United States District Judge\n   This case comes before the Court on Harbour Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [34], Defendant National Asset Advisors, LLC's Partial Motion to Dismiss [63], and Defendant National Asset Advisors, Inc.'s Motion to Withdraw Answer to Cross Claim of Defendant JCT Capital [74]. After reviewing the record, the Court enters the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of contract for deed (\"CFD\") home purchase transactions extended by Harbour Portfolio VI, LP and Harbour Portfolio VII, LP (the \"Harbour Defendants\") to the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege that these CFDs contained abusive credit terms. They also allege that the Harbour Defendants intentionally targeted Plaintiffs because of their race and that the Harbour Defendants actions had a disparate impact on Plaintiffs because they are African-American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Harbour Defendants purchased all, or nearly all, of its properties from Fannie Mae's portfolio of \"real estate owned\" properties, which are homes that went through foreclosure but were not purchased by third parties. (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\"), Dkt. [81].) These homes were often in poor or uninhabitable condition, but no repairs were made prior to selling them via the CFDs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) The Harbour Defendants would mark up the sale price of the home to four or five times their purchase price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Under the terms of the CFDs, interest rates were 9.9% or 10% over a 30-year period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The CFDs also put the burden of home repairs, maintenance, property taxes, and homeowner's insurance on the buyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Each CFD contained a forfeiture clause giving the Harbour Defendants the right, upon default, to elect to cancel the contract, keep all amounts paid, and evict the buyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Harbour Defendants engaged in reverse redlining, the practice of issuing subprime loans to minority communities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) They allege that the Harbour Defendants purchased homes located in communities that are majority African-American and designed a marketing scheme to draw primarily African-American buyers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) The Harbour Defendants advertised by placing signs in front of the properties and through word of mouth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.) The Plaintiffs allege that the people most likely to see the signs or hear about the Harbour Defendants' properties were those already in the neighborhoods, i.e. African-Americans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiffs rely in large part on statistics to show both that the Harbour Defendants intentionally targeted African-American buyers and that their actions had a disparate impact on African-Americans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs now bring multiple claims against the Harbour Defendants and others involved. Relevant to the currently pending motions, some or all of the Plaintiffs bring claims against the Harbour Defendants under the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Georgia Fair Housing Act, the Truth in Lending\n   Act, the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act and the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Towards the Elderly Act, and the Georgia Residential Mortgage Act, and for equitable mortgage, declaratory judgment, unjust enrichment, and malicious eviction. Due to allegations of the mismanagement of escrow funds, Plaintiffs bring a claim against National Asset Advisors, Inc. (\"NAA\") under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and for equitable mortgage, declaratory judgment, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs also bring claims against Harbour Portfolio VII, LP and NAA for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and for negligence based on the escrow mismanagement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Harbour Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the twelve claims brought against it. NAA has filed a motion to dismiss Counts Seven, Eight, Nine and Eleven and a partial motion to dismiss Counts Ten and Twelve. Defendant NAA has also filed a Motion to Withdraw Answer to Cross Claim of Defendant JCT Capital [74], which the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   as unopposed.

While the Harbour Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden as to all four elements, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs have alleged that the Harbour Defendants had a policy of only purchasing homes from Fannie Mae and only advertising via yard signs and word of mouth. These are facially neutral policies. They have alleged that the homes available from Fannie Mae constituted less than one-quarter of foreclosure properties available during the relevant time period. (SAC, Dkt. [8-1] \u00b6 46.) This supports an inference, at the pleading stage, that the policy of purchasing from Fannie Mae was arbitrary because the Harbour Defendants could have purchased homes from other sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs have also pleaded facts that show a statistically imbalanced lending pattern that adversely impacts a minority group. They have alleged that a disproportionate concentration of the transactions by the Harbour Defendants occurred in high-minority census tracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) As alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, \"Fannie Mae sales in Fulton and DeKalb County from 2011-2015 were located in census tracts that had\n   a mean percentage of African-American residents of 71.37%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   However, \"the mean racial makeup of the census tracts where other (non-Fannie Mae) single family home sales occurred in Fulton and DeKalb County over the same time period was 48.37% African American.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   These facts support an inference at the pleading stage that the Harbour Defendants' customers were more likely to be members of a protected class than is true for the population of Fulton and DeKalb Counties as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the Harbour Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not and cannot allege a robust causal connection between any alleged facially neutral policy and the alleged disproportionate racial outcome. The racial disparity in the relevant census tracts predates any involvement by the Harbour Defendants. Therefore, their conduct could not have caused the racial disparity. While it is true that the Harbour Defendants' policy of purchasing from Fannie Mae did not cause the racial imbalance in these areas, this argument misses the point. Plaintiffs do not argue that because of the policy, there are more African-Americans living in these areas. They argue that because the Harbour Defendants decided to purchase homes in areas with a higher concentration of African-Americans, African-Americans are more likely to be home buyers in this area and thus adversely impacted by the Harbour Defendants' alleged predatory lending practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fair Hous.

Plaintiffs have therefore stated a prima facie FHA claim under a theory of disparate impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Harbour Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for intentional discrimination under the FHA because they fail to allege that they were treated differently than similarly situated people outside of their protected class. In reverse redlining cases, however, courts have held that \"if the plaintiff presents direct evidence that the lender intentionally targeted her for unfair loans on the basis of [membership in a protected class], the plaintiff need not also show that the lender makes loans on more favorable terms to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

To state a claim under UDPTEA, a party must allege he is a disabled person or elder person. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-850 (defining \"disabled person\" and \"elder person\"). A disabled person is one \"who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the such person's major life activities.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-850(1). Plaintiffs Ola Johnson and Al Butts are both alleged to receive Social Security Disability. (SAC, Dkt. [8-1] \u00b6\u00b6 145, 225.) To receive disability benefits, one must be unable to \"engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous\n   period of not lest than 12 months.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). Working is considered a major life activity under UDPTEA. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-850(3). The allegations that Plaintiffs Ola Johnson and Al Butts receive Social Security Disability is therefore sufficient to state a claim under UDPTEA. As to Plaintiff Veronica Pitts, however, the Second Amended Complaint contains no allegations that she is a disabled person or elder person under UDPTEA.

Even if they have adequately alleged the breached contractual provision, it argues, Plaintiffs have failed to show a material breach of said provision. Plaintiffs allege that Harbour Portfolio VII, LP \"entered into a contractual agreement with the above-listed Plaintiffs that Harbour would collect a monthly escrow payment as necessary to pay required property taxes and, in the case of Ms. Hutchins, Homeowners' Association fees.\" (SAC, Dkt. [8-1] \u00b6 478.) They further allege that Harbour Portfolio VII, LP breached this contractual agreement by \"collecting funds in excess of the amount needed to pay required property taxes, failing to timely pay required property taxes, causing fees and interest to accrue and then passing these charges onto the consumer, failing to pay Homeowner's Association fees while collecting these fees from the consumer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 479.)

The Court has found that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for breach of contract. They may likewise state a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Therefore, the Harbour Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [34] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count Eleven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Count Twelve-Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs Lisa Ellis-Blades, Anita Jordan, LaQuinta Hutchins, Laundra Martin,\n   Ola and Michael Johnson, and Al Butts and Veronica Pitts bring claims for negligence against Harbour Portfolio VII, LP and another defendant. Defendant Harbour Portfolio VII, LP argues that this claim must fail for two reasons. First, it argues that the Second Amended Complaint is unclear as to which defendant, it or NAA, breached duties to Plaintiffs and what those duties are. Second, it argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege that it, instead of NAA, breached any duty. The Court finds that the Second Amended Complaint makes clear that Plaintiffs allege that both Harbour Portfolio VII, LP and NAA breached their duties to Plaintiffs which arise under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"). It also makes clear that Plaintiffs' claim for negligence against Harbour Portfolio VII, LP is predicated on its liability for the actions of its agent, NAA. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-6-51.

The parties involved here were the same as in the dispossessory actions. There is also an identity of the causes of action since the present claim for malicious eviction and the claim before the magistrate court are both predicated on the same contract. The only question before the Court is whether the magistrate court was a court of competent jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' malicious eviction claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that because the Georgia Constitution vests exclusive jurisdiction respecting title to land in Superior Courts, the magistrate court was not a court of competent jurisdiction such that res judicata can now bar their claim. They are correct that the magistrate court would not have had jurisdiction to hear this claim. Their claim for malicious prosecution, however, was a compulsory counterclaim, and a defendant before a magistrate court waives any such claim not brought. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-10-45(a) (\"If any defendant\n   has a counterclaim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim, which counterclaim does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the court cannot obtain jurisdiction, such counterclaim shall be asserted by the defendant at or before the hearing on the plaintiff's claim or thereafter be barred.\"). Both the dispossessory claims and the claims for malicious eviction arise out of the same transactions or occurrences. Plaintiffs have therefore waived their right to bring this claim now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   That the magistrate court did not have jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' claim does not alter the analysis. \"The plain language of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-10-45(d) provides for the filing of compulsory counterclaims for amounts exceeding the jurisdictional limits of the magistrate court and the transfer of the case to another court with jurisdiction over the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Oh v.

(Pls.' Resp., Dkt. [68], at 8; Def. NAA's Reply to Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n to Partial Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. [72], at 2.) Count Nine is therefore dismissed against NAA to the extent it seeks repayment of amounts spent on home repairs and improvements or homeowner's insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   NAA argues that Plaintiffs have failed to show that they have been conferred a benefit. Plaintiffs have alleged that NAA has retained excess funds paid to it, but these funds were held in Plaintiffs' escrow accounts. NAA could not, it argues, benefit from money kept in such a fashion. The Court finds, however, that Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for unjust enrichment at this stage of litigation. A reasonable inference can be drawn that NAA retained the funds for its own benefit. This satisfies Plaintiffs' pleading requirements. Defendant National Asset Advisors, LLC's Partial Motion to Dismiss [63] is therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   as to Count Nine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    D.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Count Eleven-Breach of Contract and Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs Lisa Ellis-Blades, Anita Jordan, LaQuinta Hutchins, Laundra Martin, Ola and Michael Johnson, and Al Butts and Veronica Pitts bring claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against NAA and another defendant. NAA argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that it was a party to any contract with Plaintiffs. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"Harbour Portfolio [VII, LP] entered into a contractual agreement with the above-listed Plaintiffs that Harbour would collect a monthly escrow payment as necessary to pay required property taxes and, in the case of Ms. Hutchins, Homeowners' Association fees.\" (SAC, Dkt. [8-1] \u00b6 478.) As to NAA, they allege that \"Harbour Portfolio [VII, LP], by and through its servicing agent NAA, has mishandled the servicing of the escrow accounts\" and therefore breached the contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 479.) While Plaintiffs argue that they have pled facts from which a reasonable inference may be drawn that NAA entered into an escrow agreement on its own behalf, the Court finds that the facts as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint do not support such an inference. Defendant National Asset Advisors, LLC's Partial Motion to Dismiss [63] is therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count Eleven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing, the Harbour Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [34] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   . More specifically, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 1;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 2;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 3;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the appraisal and escrow claims but\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to the ability to repay claim in Count 4;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to the FBPA claims,\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Ola Johnson's and Al Butts's UDPTEA claims, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Veronica Pitt's UDPTEA claim in Count 5;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 6;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to DeMarkus Horne, Ola and Michael Johnson, and Rita Henigan and Rohan Powell and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to all other Plaintiffs in Count 7;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to DeMarkus Horne, Ola and Michael Johnson, and Rita Henigan and Rohan Powell and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to all other Plaintiffs in Count 8;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to\n   Count 10;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 11;\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 12; and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 13. Defendant National Asset Advisors, LLC's Partial Motion to Dismiss [63] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   . More specifically, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 7;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 8;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the claims relating to home repairs, improvements, and homeowner's insurance and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to the claims relating to property taxes in Count 9;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the partial motion to dismiss Counts 10, limiting these claims to the violations that occurred within the relevant limitations period;\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count 11; and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the partial motion to dismiss Counts 12, limiting these claims to the violations that occurred within the relevant limitations period.

None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs, however, support this conclusion. In\n    <em>\n     National Fair Housing Alliance v.

They do not, however, cite any case so limiting ECOA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Although Plaintiffs allege that the Harbour Defendants no longer own the CFD for Plaintiff Jackie Brown (SAC, Dkt. [81] 141), the Harbour Defendants acknowledge that they do in fact own that contract. (Mem. of Law in Supp. of Harbour Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. [34-1], at 28 n.27.) Plaintiff Jackie Brown's claim is therefore not dismissed. In addition, although the Harbour Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have alleged that they no longer own the CFD for Plaintiff LaQuinta Hutchins, Plaintiffs have actually alleged that she was told there was a new owner but that there has been no proof of such a transfer. (SAC, Dkt. [8-1] \u00b6\u00b6 313, 316.) Plaintiff LaQuinta Hutchins's claim is therefore not dismissed. Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Anita Jordan received notice that her home was sold, but there are sufficient allegations in the Second Amended Complaint to infer that the property was not in fact sold. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 198-99.) Plaintiff Anita Jordan's claim is therefore not dismissed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
