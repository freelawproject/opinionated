Defendants Tony Hasratian, Paula Hasratian, the Tony Hasratian Living Trust, and the Paula Hasratian Living Trust (collectively, the Hasratians) bring a separate motion for summary judgment (Docket 59) as to D.C.'s first cause of action for negligence and seventh cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART El Matador's motion for summary judgment. The court GRANTS the Hasratians' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tony Hasratian and Paula Hasratian founded the El Matador restaurant in 1963 or 1964. Tony and Paula are officers in El Matador, Inc. and Tony still makes management decisions for the restaurant. In 2013, their 39-year-old daughter, Jennifer Hasratian, was a manager of El Matador. Tony and Paula had also given Jennifer around 20 or 30 percent of the shares in El Matador Inc., and she was an officer in the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jennifer lived in a condo. Tony and Paula lived in a separate home. Tony and Paula's home had an office where another daughter regularly performed bookkeeping duties for the restaurant. The home office also had monitors linked to security cameras at the restaurant so that individuals could see what was going on there. Tony and Paula had given Jennifer a key and the security codes to their home. When Tony and Paula were out of town, Jennifer would occasionally pick up the\n   mail and generally look after her parents' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March and April of 2013, 16-year-old D.C. and several of his friends began hanging out with Jennifer at her condo. He stayed the night there on a couple of occasions. Jennifer would give alcohol to D.C. and his friends when they came over. She acquired at least some of this alcohol by taking it from the restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early May, Jennifer gave D.C. a job at El Matador as a dishwasher. On one occasion, Jennifer gave D.C. alcohol while he was at work. Around two weeks after D.C. started working at the restaurant, D.C. was drinking alcohol with his friends and Jennifer at her condo. He became intoxicated and passed out on a bed. He awoke to Jennifer unzipping his pants and engaging in oral sex with him. She then engaged in vaginal sex with him before he passed out again. Thereafter, Jennifer provided alcohol to and engaged in sexual activity with D.C. on multiple occasions at her condo. Jennifer also had sex with D.C. in Tony and Paula's home on several occasions when Tony and Paula were out of town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   D.C. testified that Jennifer's sexual relationship with him \"really messed up [his] head for a while.\" [D.C. dep., p.160] In July, D.C. attempted suicide and was hospitalized on several occasions. While D.C. was in the hospital for the second time after a suicide attempt, Jennifer sent a text message to D.C.'s mother. It stated that if D.C. didn't make it to work that evening, he would be replaced. Based on this text message, he never returned to work and considered his employment to be over. When D.C. was hospitalized for a third time, a nurse observed inappropriate intimate contact between D.C. and Jennifer. D.C.'s mother subsequently discovered several sexually charged text messages from Jennifer on D.C.'s cell phone. Based upon this information, D.C.'s mother called the police. D.C. admitted to the sexual relationship and cooperated with the ensuing investigation of Jennifer's criminal sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   D.C. sued Jennifer, Tony, Paula, Tony and Paula's trusts, and El Matador under various theories of liability. El Matador has moved for summary judgment on D.C.'s negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, hostile work environment, and wrongful termination claims. Tony, Paula, and their respective trusts have moved for summary judgment on D.C.'s negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A federal court exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims \"applies the substantive law, including choice of law rules, of the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    BancOklahoma Mortg.

On one occasion, she furnished alcohol to D.C. at work. She also left the restaurant with D.C. on several occasions in order to have sex with him and told him not to clock out.

Under the initial inquiry of section 317, none of this conduct occurred on El Matador's premises, at a location where Jennifer had access because of her agency relationship with El Matador, or while using a chattel belonging to El Matador. All of the sexual acts occurred either at Jennifer's home or her parent's residence. D.C. has presented evidence that the Hasratian residence has an office in the basement where El Matador business, such as bookkeeping and monitoring of surveillance cameras, is conducted. But regardless of whether the home office would be considered \"a premises in possession\" of El Matador, the entire home would not attain this status. Because Jennifer's tortious sexual conduct occurred in the living quarters of the Hasratians' home and not in the home office, El Matador had no duty to control Jennifer's harmful behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Next, the court examines D.C.'s assertion that El Matador had a duty to prevent Jennifer from providing alcohol to him. D.C. has presented evidence that on one occasion Jennifer gave him alcohol at the restaurant. In addition, there is some evidence that Jennifer took alcohol belonging to El Matador and gave it to D.C. at her home. Thus, D.C. provided evidence that Jennifer was \"using a chattel of the master\" when she furnished him alcohol in her home.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Under the second step of section 317, however, there is no indication that El Matador knew or should have known of a need to control Jennifer's conduct related to providing alcohol to minors. D.C. presented evidence of her parent's knowledge that Jennifer had problems with her own consumption of alcohol in the past, including DUI arrests and car accidents caused by intoxication. But there is no evidence that El Matador knew or had reason to know that Jennifer was giving alcohol to minors at work or that she was stealing alcohol so that she could provide it to a minor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because there is no evidence before the court that could satisfy all of the requirements of section 317, El Matador is entitled to summary judgment on D.C.'s negligent supervision claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    3) Direct Liability for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Finally, D.C. has presented no argument or evidence to support a theory of direct liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress against El Matador. There is no evidence that an El Matador agent operating within the scope of his or her employment engaged in any extreme conduct that \"involved an unreasonable risk of causing the distress.\"\n    <em>\n     Carlton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958010\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/323/571/#p585\">\n     323 P.3d at 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In sum, because D.C. has not presented evidence that would support either a negligence claim or a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against El Matador, it is entitled to summary judgment as to these causes of action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    B. The Hasratians' Summary Judgment Motion\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    D.C. alleges that the Hasratians are liable for their daughter's misconduct under two broad theories. First he argues that because the Hasratians gave Jennifer a key to their house, Jennifer became the Hasratians' agent and they are liable for Jennifer's misconduct with D.C. while they were in the home. Second, D.C. alleges that he was an invitee to the Hasratian's\n    home and that they are liable under a premises liability theory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    1) Agency Theory of Liability\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Hasratians gave Jennifer a key and access codes to their home so that she could pick up the mail and watch over the house when they were gone. On several occasions, Jennifer brought D.C. to the Hasratians' home while they were out of town. While they were in the residence, Jennifer gave D.C. alcohol and engaged in illegal sexual activity with him. D.C. argues that Jennifer became the Hasratians' agent while they were out of town, and that they are therefore subject to\n    <em>\n     respondeat superior\n    </em>\n    liability for her actions while inside the home.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    This court need not determine whether Jennifer became an agent for the Hasratians because she acted outside the scope of any potential agency relationship. As discussed above, a principal is only liable when the agent is acting within the scope of the agency relationship.\n    <em>\n     M.J.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802045\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/371/21/#p30\">\n     371 P.3d at 30-31\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The only agency relationship that could arguably exist here related to picking up mail and watching over the house in the Hasratians' absence.

Under a premises liability theory, a \"possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land.\"\n    <em>\n     Hale v.

D.C.'s premises liability theory, therefore, fails as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Because both D.C.'s agency and premises liability theories are unavailing, the court grants summary judgment for the Hasratians and their trusts as to the negligence cause of action and the negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

He also argues that when his mother told Jennifer that she \"had some explaining to do\" to the police that she was opposing discrimination on behalf of her minor son. [Pl. exh. 7, \u00b6 12] D.C. further asserts that he was subjected to an adverse employment action by being terminated from his employment when Jennifer subsequently sent his mother a text stating: \"Tell your crazy kid to leave me alone.\" [Pl. exh. 7, \u00b6 14] D.C. contends that this text message was a constructive dismissal from his employment caused by protected opposition to discrimination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    El Matador argues, however, that there is no causal link between a protected activity and an adverse employment action in this case because the undisputed evidence shows that D.C. either quit or was fired before the police investigation began and before D.C.'s mother threatened Jenifer on behalf of her son. D.C. testified in his deposition that during his second hospitalization for attempting suicide Jennifer sent D.C.'s mother a text message stating that he had to be at work that night or he would be replaced. [D.C. dep., p. 180] D.C.'s mother told D.C. about the text message, but because of his hospitalization he could not go to work that evening. [D.C. dep., p. 180] D.C. testified that based upon this text message, he never went back to work.

D.C.'s deposition testimony, therefore, demonstrates that there can be no causal link between the protected activity of reporting Jennifer's criminal behavior and an adverse employment action because he was no longer an employee when he engaged in the protected activity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    After his deposition, D.C. produced a declaration that proffered a different timeline for the termination of his employment at El Matador. The declaration states that after D.C. participated in the police investigation, Jennifer sent a text message to his mother stating: \"Tell your crazy kid to\n    leave me alone.\" [D.C. decl., \u00b6 37] D.C. further declared:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    Jennifer Hasratian's communications, including \"Tell your crazy kid to leave me alone\", was [sic] understood and in context of the discussions [sic] that my employment at El Matador was terminated by El Matador through Jennifer Hasratian.

D.C. clearly testified that his job at El Matador ended around the time of his second hospitalization. But his later declaration claims that Jennifer fired him at a later date. Thus, this court must weigh the three factors in determining whether the contradictory affidavit constitutes an attempt to create a sham fact issue. The first consideration disfavors the exclusion of D.C.'s declaration. Although his attorney was present, plaintiff's counsel did not cross-examine him during the deposition. The second and third considerations, however, weigh heavily in favor of deeming a portion of the declaration to be a sham affidavit. As D.C. was giving testimony as a percipient witness to the timing of his separation from El Matador, he had access to all pertinent evidence when he testified in the deposition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Franks v. Nimmo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1619841\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/1230/#p1237\">\n     796 F.2d 1230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1237 (10th Cir. 1986) (concluding that an affidavit created only a sham issue of fact because the deponent, \"as a participant in the alleged conversations ... clearly had access to the relevant evidence at\" the time of the deposition). Nor was the declaration based upon newly discovered evidence. Moreover, the declaration does not attempt to clarify an ambiguity or confusion in the deposition testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Balancing these three considerations, the court finds that D.C.'s declaration creates\n    only a sham issue of fact. The court, therefore, disregards the portion of D.C.'s affidavit in which he declares that Jennifer constructively fired him after he cooperated with the police investigation. Absent any other evidence that El Matador subjected D.C. to an adverse employment action subsequent to a protected activity, there can be no proof of causation. Therefore, El Matador is entitled to summary judgment on D.C.'s retaliation claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Wrongful Discharge\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    \"An at-will employee whose employment has been terminated in violation of a clear and substantial public policy may sue for wrongful termination.\"\n    <em>\n     Ray v.

The Utah Supreme Court has\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    identified four categories of public policies that may provide a basis for a wrongful termination claim: (i) refusing to commit an illegal or wrongful act, such as refusing to violate the antitrust laws; (ii) performing a public obligation, such as accepting jury duty; (iii) exercising a legal right or privilege, such as filing a workers' compensation claim; or (iv) reporting to a public authority criminal activity of the employer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839645\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/359/614/#p620\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis removed) (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In his sixth cause of action, D.C. alleges that he was wrongfully terminated (either formally or constructively) for reporting Jennifer's criminal activity in derogation of Utah's public policies. But D.C.'s wrongful termination claim fails as a matter of law for the same reason that his retaliation claim fails. As noted above, there is no competent evidence that El Matador fired D.C. after he reported a crime to the police. Instead, the evidence only supports the proposition that he no longer worked at El Matador by the time that D.C. cooperated in the investigation. There can be no causal connection between his termination and the activity protected by Utah's public policy-reporting the criminal activity of an employer. El Matador, therefore, is entitled to summary judgment on D.C.'s wrongful termination claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants El Matador, Inc., El Matador Restaurante &amp; Cantina, and El Matador Restaurant (collectively, El Matador).

D.C.'s inclusion of a phrase in the title to a cause of action is insufficient to raise an independent claim as there are no assertions of fact to support the claim.
