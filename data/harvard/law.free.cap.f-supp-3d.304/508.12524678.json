Faber, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is about whether Verizon's Customer Agreement, which contains an arbitration clause, binds the defendant, Judy Little, and requires the court to submit this action to arbitration. For the reasons that follow, the defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceeding pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (ECF No. 5) is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and plaintiff's action is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Judy Little purchased a mobile hotspot device on October 21, 2015, at a Verizon\n   Wireless retail location in Princeton, West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 5-1, \u00b6 4. Before activation, Verizon required Little to sign a standardized electronic sales receipt agreeing to the terms and conditions of Verizon Wireless' Customer Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 5-1, Ex. A (\"Verizon Sales Receipt\"). The electronically signed sales receipt stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I AGREE TO THE CURRENT VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMER AGREEMENT ... INCLUDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MY PLAN ...\n   <em>\n    I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM AGREEING TO ... SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF JURY TRIALS\n   </em>\n   ... I AM AWARE THAT I CAN VIEW THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT ANYTIME AT VERIZONWIRELESS.COM OR IN MY VERIZON ACCOUNT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (emphasis added). The sales receipt states \"JUDY LITTLE\" as the \"Account Owner Name\" and includes a signature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   While Little's signature does not appear to be a full signature,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff does not claim that she did not sign the sales receipt. The Customer Agreement referenced in the sales receipt is a 10-page document that includes an arbitration provision within a section titled \"HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH VERIZON WIRELESS?\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 5-1, Ex. B, at 7-9 (\"Verizon Customer Agreement\"). This section expounds upon the arbitration clause announced in the sales receipt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Little used the wireless hotspot for \"less than two weeks,\" but the device \"failed to work properly.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7-1, Ex. A, \u00b6\u00b6 9. As a result, she returned the device but Verizon continued to charge her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Later, Verizon allegedly contacted Little in an attempt to collect the outstanding balance owing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7-33.

But\n   <em>\n    U-Haul\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that a physical copy of an incorporated document needs to be received by a customer. Instead, the Verizon Sales Receipt had to give Little \"the requisite knowledge of the contents\" of the incorporated document, creating mutual assent between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    U-Haul\n   </em>\n   , the company essentially baited and switched consumers into consenting to arbitration and other terms and conditions without knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Verizon gave Little notice of the arbitration agreement before she signed the sales receipt by announcing that an arbitration clause existed within the sales receipt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verizon Sales Receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff lodges two additional objections. First, plaintiff alleges that the signature on the sales receipt is not hers, instead resembling a \"pixelated loop\" created by a computer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7, at 5-6. Plaintiff does not allege she did not sign the Verizon contract, nor that the signature was procured by fraud, coercion or inducement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, even if the signature is not a realistic model of Little's signature, it makes no legal difference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grant-Fletcher v.
