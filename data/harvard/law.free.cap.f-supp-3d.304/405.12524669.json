Before me is Defendants' motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to all of Plaintiff's federal claims and NYSHRL claims, and those claims are dismissed with prejudice. Because I dismiss the federal claims before me, and because Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims are governed under a lower threshold of proof than their federal counterparts, I decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims under the NYCHRL. Therefore, Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims are dismissed without prejudice to Plaintiff filing those claims in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lambert is a 29-year-old African-American male of Jamaican national origin. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 6; Lambert Aff. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lambert suffers from a skin condition known as \"barber's itch\" or \"Folliculitis Barbae Traumatica.\" (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7.) Lambert was hired in December 2011 as a House Officer\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at Trump. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trump is a high-rise building located at 1 Central Park West. The building contains both hotel rooms and residential condominiums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) Trump maintains an Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Policy, (McCabe Aff. Ex. D.),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Lambert received a copy of the EEO Policy,\n   which he signed prior to commencing his employment at Trump, (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 9; McCabe Aff. Ex. F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Individual Defendants were also employed at Trump while Lambert was a House Officer. Ahearn is employed as a House Officer, (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 3); Calderon is employed as an Assistant Front Office Manager, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Ahearn and Plaintiff are co-workers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Ahearn and Calderon also received and signed copies of the EEO Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; McCabe Aff. Ex. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Ahearn's Termination and Reinstatement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 23, 2013, Lambert met with Keisha Purcell Midouin, the Assistant Director of Human Resources at the time, to discuss comments that Ahearn made from January 2013 to April 2013. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 11). At this meeting, Lambert told Midouin that \"(1) in January 2013, when speaking with another House Officer about the recent termination of an Engineering Apprentice, Mr. Ahearn commented that the Apprentice would not have been terminated if he was black; (2) in mid-April 2013, while discussing the Boston marathon bombing, Mr. Ahearn purportedly made a derogatory reference about black people shooting one another; (3) on April 20, 2013, Mr. Ahearn allegedly described House Officer Michael Wiafe, as quiet unless 'you are African;' and (4) that same evening, Mr. Ahearn told Plaintiff and another House Officer 'see you later my dark skinned friends.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (quoting McCabe Aff. Ex. G).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Midouin immediately commenced an investigation into each of these allegations, interviewing the witnesses identified by Lambert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Based on this investigation, Trump terminated Ahearn's employment on May 8, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Thereafter, the New York Hotel &amp; Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\") grieved Ahearn's termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20; McCabe Aff. Ex. N.) On May 10, 2013, Ahearn's discharge was converted to a time-served suspension without pay, and he returned to work as a House Officer at Trump. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Following Ahearn's reinstatement, Lambert asked Deirdre Rosen, the Vice President of Human Resources, if Ahearn's shift could be changed because Lambert was uncomfortable working with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) In response, Rosen explained that she could not change Ahearn's shift because she did not have the power to do so, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; Lambert Dep. Tr. 107:10-15),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but advised Plaintiff that there were two open shifts that he could transfer into if he did not want to work on the same shift as Ahearn, (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 23). Lambert did not request or apply for a shift change. (Lambert Dep. Tr. 114:20-116:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Lambert's Notice of Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about August 26, 2013, Lambert filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC (the \"EEOC Charge\"), and notice of the EEOC charge was served on Trump on September 5, 2013. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 42; McCabe Aff. Ex. X.) In the EEOC Charge, Lambert alleged that Ahearn made racial comments toward him starting in April 2013, and that Lambert was being retaliated against for complaining about Ahearn and the remarks. (McCabe Aff. Ex. X.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Lambert's Write-Up for Excessive Absences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 14, 2013, Sal Blando, the Director of Security at Trump, issued Lambert a warning for continued excessive absences. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 47; McCabe Aff. Ex. AA.) Lambert does not dispute that he was\n   absent for the days listed in the warning. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 49.) Blando had previously advised Lambert in April 2013 that he had \"exhausted all of [his] paid sick days,\" and that \"[a]ny employee who abuses sick leave benefits shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (McCabe Aff. Ex. Z.) After receiving this warning, Lambert called out sick on July 13, 2013, August 8, 2013, and August 26, 2013; Lambert claims he had a doctor's note for each of these days. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Lambert's Requests for Vacation, Overtime, and Use of a Hotel Room\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Vacation scheduling at Trump is governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, which instructs that \"vacation must be made before January 15th or by May 1st for any remaining weeks available.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Vacation days are granted in accordance with seniority and the date the request was made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lambert acknowledges that he took vacation on December 16 and December 18, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) According to Trump's records, Ahearn took two vacation days in December 2013: December 8 and December 29. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trump employees are also offered the opportunity to work overtime based on seniority. (Getman Decl. \u00b6 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employee who accepts the offer of overtime first is given the opportunity to work the overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lambert alleges that he made six requests to work overtime shifts from December 2013 to March 2014, all of which were denied. (Lambert Aff. \u00b6 30.) From September 2013 to March 2014, Trump's records indicate that Lambert worked 107.75 hours of overtime; Ahearn worked 98 hours of overtime; and Benabou worked 122.25 hours of overtime. (Supp. Getman Decl. \u00b6 4-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lambert maintains that Trump's figures are not an accurate reflection of his actual overtime because many of Lambert's tasks during his regular shift are factored into this figure. (Lambert Aff. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Trump also maintains a policy of providing employees with use of a hotel room to sleep if an employee works two consecutive shifts separated by only a few hours, provided that the hotel is not fully occupied. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 59.) According to Lambert, Benabou told Lambert during this time that \"he was going upstairs to sleep because he got a hotel room,\" (Lambert Dep. Tr. 155:16-22), which indicated to Lambert that Benabou's request was approved. However, Trump's records do not reflect that Benabou was given a hotel room in December 2013. (Getman Decl. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Lambert's Locker Is Vandalized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On or about March 6, 2014, Lambert forwarded a letter to Rosen complaining that on February 23, 2014, \"he found his locker open and a sticker of a face in black and white color was taped to [it].\" (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 62.) In the letter, Lambert advised Rosen that he had complained about the situation to Midouin and asked for a different locker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to his request, Midouin had stated that there were no lockers available, but that she could provide him with a new lock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lambert rejected this offer, nor did he change the lock himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Lambert never found his locker opened again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff \"did not ask for the alleged sticker on his locker to be removed, nor did he try to remove it himself.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Lambert Is Asked to Shave\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trump's associate handbook provides that \"[m]ustaches and [b]eards are acceptable if trimmed and neat and do not extend below the upper lip.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; McCabe Aff. Ex. O.) On or about June 11, 2014, Lambert mailed a letter to Prince Sanders, the Hotel Manager of Trump, providing a doctor's note that stated that Lambert had a skin condition (the \"June Doctor's Note\"). (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 25; McCabe Aff. Ex. P.) The June Doctor's Note stated that Lambert had been advised by his doctor to not shave his beard until his skin condition resolved. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 25; McCabe Aff. Ex. P.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the letter to Sanders, Lambert alleged that (1) on May 4, 2014, Calderon asked him to shave and threatened to write him up; (2) on May 11, 2014, Calderon again asked him why his hair was not trimmed, and said \"this is the last time I am telling you to trim your hair off;\" (3) on May 17, 2014, Calderon again asked why he was not shaved, told Lambert that he was going to bring it up in a meeting with Sanders, and suggested that Lambert get a doctor's note; (4) on May 24, 2014, Samuel Adote, a bellman, asked Lambert why he was not shaved; (5) on that same day, Sanders asked Lambert why he was not shaved and suggested that Lambert buy ointment for his skin; and (6) on May 18, 2014, a manager named Hector told Lambert that he \"must shave now.\" (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 28 (quoting McCabe Aff. Ex. Q).) Sanders forwarded the letter and the June Doctor's Note to Helen Getman, the Area Director of Human Resources, who promptly contacted Lambert to set up a meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   One week later, on June 18, 2014, Lambert met with Getman and advised her that Calderon and other Trump employees had requested that Lambert shave, despite his skin condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Getman began an investigation into Lambert's allegations, interviewing Calderon, Sanders, and the other individuals identified by Lambert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Getman directed each individual who she interviewed to refrain from asking Lambert to shave and from engaging in discussion with Lambert on the topic of shaving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; Getman Decl. \u00b6 21; Calderon Dep Tr. 26:23-27:6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lambert does not recall being asked to shave after the meeting with Getman. (Lambert Dep. Tr. 288:14-22.) At his deposition, Lambert testified that, despite recording all incidents of alleged discrimination in a journal that he kept, he did not record being asked to shave by anyone at Trump after meeting with Getman on June 18, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288:23-289:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Lambert Is Called \"Gay\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 3, 2014, Lambert alleged in a letter to Suzie Mills, Lambert's Hiring Manager, that a bellman at Trump called him gay. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 33; McCabe Aff. Ex. W.) According to Lambert, the bellman called him gay in retaliation for Lambert's charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 35.) Lambert acknowledges that he never told the bellman that he filed the EEOC Charge, and he does not know whether the bellman was aware of the EEOC Charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    H.\n    <em>\n     Lambert Is Physically Threatened\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 14, 2014, Lambert was working with Tom Rich, a Security Supervisor at Trump. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Rich asked Lambert to perform a \"security-related function,\" and it was within Rich's job duties to assign such a function to Lambert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.) According to Lambert, Lambert asked Rich why he was being asked to perform this security-related function, and Rich stated, \"you think you are tough, you aren't untouchable, they don't have to shoot you, you can be paralyzed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Lambert did not report Rich's comments to the police or to Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.) Two days after Rich's threat, Plaintiff met with Getman, but made no mention of Rich's alleged threat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Plaintiff did not advise Trump of Rich's alleged threat until he filed his complaint in this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-107\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-107\">\n    \u00b6 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Lambert Resigns\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 29, 2014, Lambert was injured lifting a laundry bag and took workers' compensation leave beginning on July 29, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) From that date until March 2015, Lambert was on workers' compensation leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Between July 29, 2014 and March 12, 2015, no one at Trump made any comments to Plaintiff about his race, national original, or disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Lambert planned on returning to work up to and including February 2015, and he felt safe returning at that time. (Lambert Dep. Tr. 302:13-304:21.) However, in March 2015, Lambert believed he could no longer return to work because he did not feel safe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 303:23-304:21.) On March 13, 2015, Lambert resigned from his employment at Trump, alleging that he was constructively discharged. (McCabe Aff. Ex. EE.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on January 26, 2015. (Doc. 1.) After the parties agreed to two stipulations granting Defendants additional time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the complaint, (Docs. 6-7), Defendants filed their answers on April 17, 2015, (Docs. 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   An initial pre-trial conference was held on July 15, 2015. (Dkt. Entry July 15, 2015.) A case management plan and scheduling order was entered into shortly thereafter, and the parties proceeded with discovery. (Doc. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 13, 2016, Defendants submitted a pre-motion letter regarding their anticipated motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 32), and Plaintiff filed his response letter on July 20, 2016, (Doc. 33). On July 27, 2016, I held a post-discovery conference, which also served as a pre-motion conference, and granted Defendants leave to file their motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Entry July 27, 2016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 18, 2016, Plaintiff sought leave to amend his complaint on consent from Defendants to add a claim of constructive discharge. (Doc. 35.) I granted Plaintiff leave to amend, (Doc. 36), and Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint on August 25, 2016, (Doc. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 12, 2016, Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment, accompanying memorandum of law, and supporting materials. (Docs. 40-46.) On October 14, 2016, Lambert filed his opposition and supporting materials. (Docs. 47-51.) After I granted an extension of time for Defendants to submit their reply, (Doc. 53), Defendants filed their reply and supporting materials on November 7, 2016, (Docs. 54-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the parties' submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\n   as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Fay v.

Lambert only disputes that Trump's figures do not amount to his actual overtime, asserting that many of Lambert's tasks during his regular shift are factored into this figure. (Lambert Aff. \u00b6 9.) As an initial matter, Lambert does not supply any details to support his conclusory claim, and he does not explain how this fact, even if true, impacts his claim that he was denied overtime. In addition, this alleged distortion would be the same for Ahearn and Benabou's figures as well, and thus would have no effect on any comparison of the three employees.

(Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 46.) Under Trump's policy-of which Lambert was made aware through Blando's warning in April 2013-these absences constituted grounds for disciplinary action.

Moreover, Lambert has not alleged and there is no evidence in the record that he suffered any material alteration to his job duties as a result of the write-up, such as a demotion, decrease in salary, or suspension.

At his deposition, Lambert testified that he could not remember anyone at Trump asking him to shave after he met with Getman. (Lambert Dep. Tr. 288:14-290:10.) He also testified that he kept a journal of all incidents of alleged discrimination, and that his journal did not document any instances of anyone asking him to shave after he met with Getman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288:14-290:10.) Therefore, to the extent that Lambert attempts to suggest that anyone at Trump continued to ask him to shave after he met with Getman, the suggestion is belied by his sworn testimony during his deposition. Lambert cannot create a triable issue of fact by contradicting his own sworn deposition testimony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hayes v. N.Y.C.

Specifically, Lambert argues that \"any action taken by [Trump] only occurred after Plaintiff was denied an accommodation request [in May 2014], and after Plaintiff suffered a severe skin irritation as a result of that request.\" (Pl.'s Opp. 19.) Considering the record as a whole, I find that there was no unreasonable delay in accommodating Lambert's request. In May 2014, Calderon asked Plaintiff to shave multiple times, despite knowing about his skin condition. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 28.) On June 10, 2014, Lambert sent a written request for an accommodation to Sanders describing Calderon's various requests, and Sanders forwarded the letter to Getman. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McCabe Aff. Ex. P; Getman Decl. \u00b6 18.) Eight days from the date of Lambert's letter, Lambert met with Getman to discuss the issue.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Lambert alleges that he was retaliated against in the following ways: he (1) was issued a false write-up for excessive absences; (2) was denied vacation, overtime, and use of a hotel room; (3) had a locker vandalized; (4) was assigned an increased workload that resulted in his suffering a work-related injury; (5) was physically threatened; and (6) was called gay by another Trump employee. For each claim, Lambert fails to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With respect to Lambert's claim that he was issued a false write-up for excessive absences in retaliation for his EEOC Charge, Lambert fails to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Lambert filed the EEOC Charge on August 26, 2013, and Trump issued Lambert a warning for his continued excessive absences on October 14, 2013. Lambert argues that this sequence of events establishes that he was issued the warning in retaliation for the EEOC Charge. However, Lambert does not dispute that Trump previously advised Lambert in April 2013-four months before Lambert filed the EEOC Charge-that Lambert had \"exhausted all of [his] paid sick days,\" and that \"[a]ny employee who abuses sick leave benefits shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (McCabe Aff. Ex. Z.) Thus, Lambert fails to establish a causal connection between the EEOC Charge and the write-up, because Lambert was given his first warning regarding excessive absences months before filing the EEOC Charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even if Lambert were to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, and thus establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden would then shift back to Trump to offer a non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. After receiving the warning in April 2013, Lambert called out sick on July 13, August 8, and August 26, 2013, and he does not dispute that he was out sick for these days. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 46.) Under Trump's policy-of which Lambert was made aware through the warning in April 2013-these absences constituted grounds for disciplinary action. Lambert claims that he had a doctor's note for each of these absences, but fails to articulate why this fact alters the analysis. Thus, Trump offers a valid non-retaliatory reason for the write-up, and Lambert has offered no evidence to \"establish that his ... protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    Villar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177809\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/135/105/#p136\">\n    135 F.Supp.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nassar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/#p362\">\n    570 U.S. at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/#p362\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With respect to Lambert's remaining retaliation claims, Lambert's only argument is that Trump's retaliatory animus can be inferred from the timing of the filing of the EEOC Charge and the adverse employment actions. (Pl.'s Opp. 21-23.) Lambert further supports this argument by asserting that these adverse employment actions were the first actual opportunity that Trump had to retaliate against Lambert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) This argument also fails to establish causation for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, to establish a causal connection on the basis of temporal proximity alone, the adverse action must be \"very close\" in time to the protected activity.\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p273\">\n    532 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p273\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the undisputed record establishes that (1) more than three months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge on September 5, 2013 and the denials of vacation time, overtime, and use of a hotel room in December 2013; (2) more than five months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge and Lambert's locker being vandalized on February 23, 2014; (3) more than ten months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge and Lambert's assignment of an increased workload in July 2014; (4) more than ten months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge and Lambert's assignment\n   of an increased workload in July 2014; (5) more than ten months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge and the alleged physical threat in July 2014; and (6) more than ten months separate Lambert's filing of the EEOC Charge and when another Trump employee purportedly called him gay in July 2014. Therefore, the passage of time in each instance defeats any inference of discriminatory intent based solely on temporal proximity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203245448\">\n    2012 WL 3245448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, the \"first opportunity to retaliate\" theory only applies where \"the adverse action occurred at the first actual opportunity to retaliate.\"\n   <em>\n    Summa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p128\">\n    708 F.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lambert argues that Trump's first opportunity to retaliate against Lambert was after Lambert \"requested something,\" and thus any passage of time is mitigated by this theory. (Pl.'s Opp. 23.) However, unlike the employee in\n   <em>\n    Summa\n   </em>\n   , Lambert does not provide any explanation for why Trump's first opportunity to retaliate was in response to a request from Lambert.\n   <em>\n    Summa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p128\">\n    708 F.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The start of the spring season was the first moment in time when the football coaching staff could have retaliated against Summa as she was not directly working for them over the intervening months.\"). Indeed, retaliation could have occurred earlier and taken any number of other forms; therefore, the \"first opportunity to retaliate\" theory has no application here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Third, Lambert does not establish that the Trump employees involved were even aware that he filed the EEOC Charge, undermining any causal connection between the EEOC Charge and these adverse employment actions. For example, Lambert does not allege that Rich, who allegedly made the physical threat against him, was even aware that he filed the EEOC Charge. And with respect to Lambert's claim that was called gay by another Trump employee, Lambert concedes that he never told the bellman involved that he filed the EEOC Charge, and that he does not know whether the bellman was aware of the EEOC Charge.

Lambert's hostile work environment claim is based on many of the same claims as his discrimination and retaliation claims, namely:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \u2022 Ahearn made racist comments to Lambert over a six-week period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \u2022 Lambert was issued a write-up for excessive absences in October 2013;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \u2022 Lambert was denied requests for vacation, overtime, and use of a hotel room over a four-month period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 Lambert's locker was vandalized on one occasion in March 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \u2022 Trump and its employees were insensitive to Lambert with respect to his skin condition, asking him to shave multiple times in May 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \u2022 A bellman at Trump repeatedly called Lambert gay in July 2014;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \u2022 A security supervisor at Trump physically threatened Lambert on one occasion in July 2014, stating \"you think you are tough, you aren't untouchable, they don't have to shoot you, you can be paralyzed;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 Lambert's workload increased in July 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. 4-5.) The record establishes that a number of these claims were addressed and ameliorated by Trump as quickly as they occurred, and at least one-the alleged threat by Rich-was never even reported to Trump. As discussed above, (\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B), upon learning of Lambert's allegations that Trump employees asked him to shave despite his skin condition, Getman immediately asked those employees to refrain from asking Lambert to shave. Lambert testified at his deposition that he did not remember being asked to shave after he met with Getman to discuss his allegations related to his skin condition. (Lambert Dep. Tr. 288:14-22.) Thus, by Lambert's own admission, the only time period in which he recalls being asked to shave was from May 4, 2014-the first time that Calderon asked him to trim his beard-to June 18, 2014-when he met with Getman to discuss his allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Similarly, upon learning of Lambert's allegations that Ahearn made racist comments, Midouin immediately commenced an investigation and Trump fired Ahearn. Lambert argues that this action was a \"temporary fix\" because the Union subsequently grieved Ahearn's discharge and\n   Ahearn was reinstated to his post. However, Lambert's characterization that this disciplinary action was a \"temporary fix\" is disproven by the fact that Lambert fails to allege a single racial comment by Ahearn that occurred after Ahearn's reinstatement. To the extent that Lambert felt uncomfortable working the same shifts as Ahearn, Lambert does not dispute that Trump offered him the opportunity to switch to a different shift after Ahearn's reinstatement, but Lambert never applied for a different shift. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 23; Lambert Dep. Tr. 114:20-116:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Lambert's remaining claims do not amount to a hostile work environment because they were episodic events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chukwuka v.

(Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 74.) Thus, Lambert does not identify any discriminatory or retaliatory action in the months leading up to his resignation. This seven-month gap belies Lambert's claim that his resignation was directly tied to the discriminatory treatment that he suffered at Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   With regard to the alleged threat by Rich, in addition to the reasons set forth above, a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for him for constructive discharge based upon this isolated incident. Lambert did not report Rich's comments to the police or to Human Resources, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41), and Trump did not become aware of Rich's alleged threat until Lambert filed his complaint in this action, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). Moreover, Lambert's current claims of fear are not supported by the record. Lambert felt safe enough to return to work up to and including February 2015, (Lambert Dep. Tr. 302:13-304:21), but by March 2015, Lambert believed he could no longer return to work because he did not feel safe, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 303:23-304:21). Lambert's conclusory assertion about concern for his safety is not explained by any evidence in the record. Therefore, Lambert's sudden fear of returning to work after he filed his complaint in this action cannot be a basis for his claim of constructive discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Because I find no evidence that Trump or its employees \"intentionally created an intolerable work atmosphere that forced [Lambert] to quit involuntarily,\"\n   <em>\n    Whidbee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238400\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/62/#p74\">\n    223 F.3d at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     NYCHRL Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Lambert also brings discrimination and retaliation claims under the NYCHRL against Trump.
