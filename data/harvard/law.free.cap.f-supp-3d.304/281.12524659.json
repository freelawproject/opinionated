INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Deborah Lee Prince (\"Prince\") brings this appeal under section 405(g) of title 42 of the United States Code from the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"), which denied her application for Title II disability insurance benefits and Title XVI supplemental security income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Doc. No. 1). Prince seeks either reversal or remand of the Decision rendered by Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Richard A. DiBiccaro, which affirmed the Commissioner's denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Order to Reverse Final Decision of Commissioner (\"Mot. to Reverse\") (Doc. No. 26). The Commissioner cross-moves for an order affirming that Decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Order Affirming the Commissioner's Decision (\"Mot. to Affirm\") (Doc. No. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Motion for Order to Reverse Final Decision of Commissioner is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The Motion for Order Affirming the Commissioner's Decision is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prince applied for disability and supplemental security income benefits on February 15, 2013, alleging a disability onset date of September 26, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation of Facts (\"Stip. of Facts\") (Doc. No. 26) at 1. The Commissioner denied Prince's application initially on May 21, 2013, and upon reconsideration on July 21, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Order to Reverse (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") (Doc. No. 26) at 2. Prince requested a hearing with an ALJ, which was held before ALJ DiBiccaro on July 9, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. of Facts at 1. A supplemental hearing was later held on November 14, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 30, 2015, ALJ DiBiccaro issued an unfavorable decision for Prince, affirming the Commissioner's denial and finding that Prince was not disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, ALJ DiBiccaro found that Prince's impairments did not meet or equal any listing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, and that, with her level of residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), there were jobs in the national economy that she could perform,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prince requested review by the Appeals Court, which denied the request on June 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Following that denial,\n   ALJ DiBiccaro's January 30, 2015 Decision became a final decision reviewable by this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prince then filed this appeal on August 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court adopts the facts as stated in the Plaintiff's Stipulation of Facts, to which the Commissioner stipulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Affirm (\"Def.'s Mem.\") (Doc. No. 34-1) at 2. Only those facts relevant to the issues raised in the Motions before the court are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time of the July 9, 2014 administrative hearing, Prince was 51-years-old and was living in a camper on private property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. of Facts at 5; Certified Transcript of Record (\"R.\") at 381. Prince last worked as a certified nurse's assistant (\"CNA\") at Gaylord Hospital, but was no longer able to work after September 26, 2006, when she was injured while trying to assist a patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; R. at 582. The onset date of Prince's alleged disability occurred two years later, on September 26, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at 311.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prince's physicians have diagnosed her with carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral ulnar nerve dysfunction, cervical degenerative disc disease, cervicogenic migraines, and neuropathy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. of Facts at 7-22. Prince's medical issues appear to have begun in 1989, when she tripped over a bicycle and her arm went through a glass window.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; R. at 384. After the accident, she underwent reconstruction of her hand, forearm, and eight flexor tendons to repair damage to her ulnar nerve, ulnar artery, and forearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. of Facts at 7. Before 2009, Prince was treated by Dr. Nasir Ramin, Dr. Babu Kumar, and Dr. Mustapha Kemal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13. Prince also attended physical therapy in 2008 for chronic back pain, hand numbness, and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. Prince's medical record is interrupted by a gap from February 2009 until October 2012, when she did not receive any treatment for her impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. After 2012, Prince established a primary care relationship with Dr. Muneeb Samma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under section 405(g) of title 42 of the United States Code, it is not a function of the district court to review\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   the ALJ's decision as to whether the claimant was disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaal v.

Instead, the court may only set aside an ALJ's determination as to social security disability if the decision \"is based upon legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Balsamo v. Chater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219710\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/75/#p79\">\n    142 F.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (2d Cir. 1998).

Admin., Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p447\">\n    683 F.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447-48 (2d Cir. 2012). It requires \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p447\">\n    at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the Commissioner's findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, those findings are conclusive, and the court will not substitute its judgment for the Commissioner's.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yancey v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prince argues that ALJ DiBiccaro's Decision should be reversed or remanded for three reasons. First, she argues that certain documents that should have been considered by the ALJ were not in the Record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 8-9. Second, Prince argues that the ALJ erred by ignoring testimony from the vocational expert that there was no work available for her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Third, she argues that the ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   erred by not finding several ailments to be severe, not determining that her combination of impairments meet or medically equal the listed impairments, and ignoring impairments that were not found to be severe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prince's first argument-that certain medical documents she provided to her counsel are missing from the Record-is her only argument that the Record was incomplete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Reply to the Def.'s Mem. (\"Pl.'s Reply\") (Doc. No. 37) at 2. Although she does not argue that the ALJ failed to adequately develop the Record in other respects, in view of the \"special solicitude\" courts accorded to\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   litigants, the court will construe Prince's specific failure to develop the record claim as encompassing other aspects of the Record the ALJ had a duty to develop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5664096\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/471/#p474\">\n    470 F.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"It is well established that the submissions of a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   litigant must be construed liberally and interpreted 'to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pabon v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645529\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/241/#p248\">\n    459 F.3d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (2d Cir. 2006) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon review of the Record, the court concludes that the ALJ committed legal error by failing to adequately develop the Record to obtain clarification from Prince's treating physician, and therefore remand is appropriate. Upon remand, the court suggests that the ALJ should also develop the Record regarding Prince's explanations for her decision not to undergo carpal tunnel release and the gap in her treatment before drawing an adverse inference about her credibility on either of those bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Duty to Develop the Record\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   An ALJ in a Social Security benefits hearing has an affirmative obligation to develop the record adequately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosa v.

In his Decision, the ALJ pointed to Dr. Samma's treatment notes from the day he completed Prince's disability paperwork, in which Dr. Samma stated, \"disability paperwork filled based on patient's responses.\" R. at 22, 693. The ALJ indicated that he understood Dr. Samma to mean that the answer to each question in the questionnaire was in effect answered by Prince, not Dr. Samma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at 22.

The ALJ afforded Dr. Samma's opinion \"little weight\" because it was \"not supported by the objective medical evidence, including his own record of treatment\" and because the \"medical source statement reflects the claimant's subjective allegations rather than Dr. Samma's medical conclusions.\" R. at 22.
