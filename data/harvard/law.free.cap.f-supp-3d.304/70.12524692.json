Compl. [Dkt. # 11] \u00b6 11. This case arises out of the fact that plaintiff has been seeking formal federal recognition, which would give the Burt Lake Band (or \"the Band\") a number of rights and benefits, since at least 1935. Plaintiff has brought this action against Ryan Zinke, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Interior; John Tahsuda III in his official capacity as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs for the Department of the Interior;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the United States Department of Interior (\"DOI\"), alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 5130\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , in connection with two events: the agency's failure to issue a decision on a petition for recognition that was filed in 1935, and the agency's 2015 promulgation of regulations which preclude the Band from re-petitioning the agency for recognition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants have moved to dismiss all of the claims, and for the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part: the Court will dismiss\n   Counts II and III because they are barred by the statute of limitations; it will deny the motion to dismiss Counts IV, V, and VI because plaintiff does have standing to bring them; and it will dismiss Count VII for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.

In 1935, a group of the Band's ancestors petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") within the Department of Interior to be recognized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Am.

[Dkt. # 1], and filed an amended complaint on June 1, 2107. Am. Compl. The amended complaint includes seven constitutional and statutory claims. Counts I, II, and III challenge the agency's failure to issue a final decision on the 1935 Petition under the APA, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 5th Amendment. Counts IV, V, and VI challenge the agency's 2015 Regulations under the APA, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. The final count, Count VII, invokes the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act and demands that the Court order the Secretary to place the Band on the List. Based on these claims, plaintiff seeks the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1) An order directing the agency \"to adjudicate the 1935 IRA Petition;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2) A declaration that the 2015 Regulations are \"unlawful, unconstitutional, and unenforceable;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3) An order directing the agency to \"consider and adjudicate a supplemental petition from the Band for recognition;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4) An order directing the agency to place plaintiff on the \"Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5) Other \"relief as the Court deems just, proper, and equitable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Am.

The Court agrees. Plaintiff maintains that the statute of limitations would not have started to run until the agency officially denied its petition. Pl.'s Opp. at 5.

It is hard to put one's finger on the exact date when plaintiff should have been aware that the agency had taken no action on its 1935 Petition-1938? 1941? 1945?-but there is no question that we crossed that bridge more than six years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By plaintiff's own account, it discovered its injury in the 1980s. The complaint notes that plaintiff obtained \"internal correspondence\" of DOI officials in the 1980s when it was in the process of preparing another petition. Am. Compl. \u00b6 85.

According to defendants, such a prohibition was already put in place by regulations adopted in 1994, so \"the 2015 [R]egulations did not injure [p]laintiff as they merely continued the pre-existing bar on re-petitioning.\" Defs.' Mot. at 18. This is a very cramped interpretation of the standing doctrine. It is indisputable that the agency initiated a new rulemaking process in 2014 that expressly proposed enacting a provision that would have allowed for re-petitioning, and it invited public comment on that issue. Plaintiff submitted comments on the proposed rule because it was directly affected by the re-petitioning ban, and a change in the regulations would have enabled it to submit a \"new petition based on new facts and circumstances\" that the Band had gathered since the agency denied its petition in 2006.

The current process has been criticized as \"broken\" or in need of reform. Specifically, the process has been criticized as too slow (a petition can take decades to be decided), expensive, burdensome, inefficient, intrusive, less than transparent and unpredictable. The proposed rule would reform the process by, among other things, institutionalizing a phased review that allows for faster decisions; reducing the documentary burden; allowing for a hearing on the proposed finding to promote transparency and\n   process integrity; establishing the Assistant Secretary's final determination as final for the Department to promote efficiency; and establishing objective standards, where appropriate, to ensure transparency and predictability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On the issue of re-petitioning, the agency explained that the proposed rule would \"[a]llow, in limited circumstances, a petitioner previously denied under the regulations to re-petition under the revised rule,\" and it invited public comment on this and other proposed changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   During the notice and comment period, plaintiff submitted comments to the agency on the proposed changes, including the proposed re-petitioning provision, which would have given it the opportunity to re-petition after the 2006 denial.

The Band wrote that it supported the proposed rule for re-petitioning because \"[a]llowing new petitioners to be recognized under less onerous criteria without giving the same opportunity to a Tribe denied acknowledgement under prior more stringent criteria would be grossly unfair.\" Ex. D to Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Ultimately, the agency did not adopt the re-petitioning provision. On July 1, 2015, it published its final rule and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The final rule promotes consistency, expressly providing that evidence or methodology that was sufficient to satisfy any particular criterion in a previous positive decision on that criterion will be sufficient to satisfy the criterion for a present petitioner. The Department has petitions pending that have never been reviewed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Allowing for re-petitioning by denied petitioners would be unfair to petitioners who have not yet had a review, and would hinder the goals of increasing efficiency and timeliness by imposing the additional workload associated with re-petitions on the Department, and OFA in particular.
