Smith, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is before the Court on motions from Defendants John Smith (ECF Nos. 40, 41), Phi Kappa Psi, Inc., (\"PKP\") (ECF Nos. 50, 51), and Brown University (\"Brown\" or \"University\") (ECF No. 65), variously attacking Plaintiff Jane Doe's Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") (ECF No. 39). After a brief overview of the alleged facts, the Court considers and denies all but part of Brown's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and part of Defendant John Smith's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As alleged in the SAC, on October 17, 2014, Doe attended a party hosted by the members of Phi Kappa Psi-Rhode Island Alpha Chapter (\"Alpha Chapter\") at the fraternity's residence on the Brown campus. Then a junior at Brown, Doe arrived at the party with her friend, Mary Roe, who soon found herself in conversation with John Smith. Eventually Smith offered Roe a drink. Roe assented, but requested a drink that would not aggravate one of her myriad food allergies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smith obliged, mixing an ostensibly hypoallergenic cocktail, out of the view of Doe and Roe. Roe took a sip and handed the drink to Doe who also partook before handing the drink back to Roe to finish. Both women soon entered something of a fugue, experiencing a loss of motor function, cognitive awareness, and memory. After they became separated as a result of their disorientation, Doe stumbled into Michael Jones, a Brown student she had met once before. In the early hours of October 18, 2014, Jones led Doe to her dormitory room and had sex with her while she lay incapacitated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next morning Doe sought medical treatment at Brown University Health Services (\"Health Services\"), where she requested testing for ingestion of date-rape drugs. Dr. Marsha Miller at Health Services took blood and urine samples and sent them to the Rhode Island Hospital Toxicology Laboratory. On October 27, 2014, Dr. Miller informed Plaintiff that her samples had tested positive for gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (\"GHB\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the positive test and a formal complaint filed with Brown by Doe,\n   the University opened three disciplinary proceedings, one each against Alpha Chapter, Jones, and Smith. On December 10, 2014, Brown's Student Conduct Board found the fraternity \"Responsible\" for charges that included illegal possession or use of drugs; illegal provision, sale, or possession with intent to sell drugs; and actions that result in or can be reasonably expected to result in physical harm to a person. And on December 22, 2014, the Student Conduct Board found Jones \"Not Responsible\" on two sexual misconduct charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brown set the disciplinary hearing regarding Smith's conduct for December 19, 2014. But on December 15 the hearing was enjoined by court order. In January, through no fault of her own, there appeared reason to doubt much of the physical evidence supporting Doe's claims: A toxicology analysis of Roe's hair came back negative for GHB. A report by Dr. David Greenblatt (who had been retained by Smith) concerning the toxicology testing of Doe's urine sample concluded that such testing produced invalid results. The University's own expert, Dr. Guy Vallaro, agreed with Dr. Greenblatt as to the invalidity of the urine sample, and also found that the testing of Doe's blood sample and of Roe's hair sample had been faulty, producing inconclusive results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   News of the invalid tests led University Provost Joseph Meisel to reduce the penalty previously handed down to Alpha Chapter, and the University dropped its disciplinary proceeding against Smith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ruling on Doe's appeal, Dr. Meisel also upheld the Student Conduct Board's \"Not Responsible\" determination as to Jones. All three determinations were made despite the Provost's continued belief, based on the witness testimony in the Alpha Chapter proceeding, that Doe and Roe had been given a substance that incapacitated them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doe appealed the University's decision to drop its investigation into Smith, which the University denied. Doe suspects this decision was part of an effort on Brown's part to shield Smith-the son of a University Trustee-from investigation. As grounds for this suspicion, Doe notes that the University rejected receipt of evidence that Smith was running a false-identification business, and that University officials had previously told Doe that Smith's disciplinary hearing would continue regardless of the toxicology results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Emboldened by what they considered their successful defense of Doe's complaints against them, Alpha Chapter and Smith began intimidating Doe, with impunity. For instance, despite the University withdrawing its recognition of Alpha Chapter, the fraternity went on to recruit new members and gather at the fraternity house. The purpose of one such gathering was raising the fraternity's flag in counter-protest as a group of Brown students marched through campus against the University's handling of Doe's and Roe's cases. There was also an incident where Alpha Chapter distributed leaflets on campus that disclosed confidential information regarding Doe's allegations. For his part, Smith began staying overnight in Doe's dormitory in violation of a \"No Contact\" order, a situation that made Doe uncomfortable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Not only did the University stand by as others moved against her, it also denied her an interview to Brown's medical school-even though Doe was, on paper, one of Brown's best students, and was\n   ultimately offered admission by many other top medical schools. Doe believes that Brown's decision was not on the merits, but rather retaliation for Doe's vigorous assertion of her rights throughout the University's investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Doe brings claims against Brown for discrimination (count one) and retaliation (count two) in violation of Title IX. She also charges the University with negligence (counts three and four). Doe's claims against PKP (count five) and Alpha-Chapter representatives (counts four and five) sound in negligence. And finally, Doe sues Smith for assault and battery (count six).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Doe asks for damages to compensate her for the severe emotional harm she allegedly experienced as a result of the incident at Alpha Chapter's party and Brown's conduct during its investigation of the incident. Doe claims that her compromised emotional state disrupted her studies, extracurricular activities, and overall enjoyment of campus life. She also asks for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As mentioned above, and discussed below, Defendants have variously challenged the SAC. Some of these challenges succeed; most do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Brown University's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Brown moves for judgment on the pleadings as to counts one, two, three, and four of Doe's SAC. \"The standard of review of a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is the same as that for a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Frappier v.

So, the Court will view \"the facts contained in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom,\" and then decide whether the complaint \"contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143784\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/538/#p549\">\n    814 F.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (1st Cir. 2016) (alteration and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Count One: Title IX Discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Count one alleges Title IX discrimination against Brown. Under Title IX, \"recipients of federal funding may be liable for 'subject[ing]' their students to discrimination where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual harassment and the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Zuckerberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761189\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/82/#p93\">\n    522 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he plaintiff is both the author and the master of its complaint. As such, it has the power to decide what law [it] will rely upon. We think that principle extends to a plaintiff's decision as to which causes of action to bring ....\" (citation omitted) ). Doe has pled the law she believes applies to her claims; she has not pled fraud, and therefore the heightened pleading standard applicable to fraud claims does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   D. PKP's and Smith's Motions to Strike\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   PKP and Smith move to strike certain parts of the SAC. A party may move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) to strike \"from a pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). \" Rule 12(f) is designed to reinforce the requirement in Rule 8(e) that pleadings be simple, concise, and direct.\"\n   <em>\n    Fundi v. Citizens Bank of R.I.\n   </em>\n   , No. CA 07-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=078%20ML%202007\">\n    078 ML, 2007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   WL 2407106, at *3 (D.R.I. Aug. 22, 2007) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But \"while ruling on a motion to strike is committed to the district court's sound judgment, such motions are narrow in scope, disfavored in practice, and not calculated readily to invoke the court's discretion. This is so because striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and ... it is often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory or harassing tactic.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning v. Bos. Med. Ctr.

PKP's Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   PKP wants stricken three paragraphs in Doe's complaint that refer to studies that estimate the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses, and that describe how alcohol and fraternities have contributed to these assaults. PKP argues that such information is not relevant to Doe's claims, and in the alternative, that to the extent such information is relevant, it is nevertheless unduly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   PKP's arguments fail because, as Doe points out, data on the prevalence of campus sexual assault are relevant to, among other things, establishing the duty of care for her negligence claim against PKP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ouch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166246\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/963/630/#p633\">\n    963 A.2d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To prevail on a claim of negligence, a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.\" (citations omitted) ). The prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses, and the extent to which such is facilitated by alcohol served at fraternities, is relevant to the foreseeability of Doe's alleged harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166246\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/963/630/#p633\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166246\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/963/630/#p633\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that Rhode Island courts use an ad hoc approach to determining whether a duty of care exists, which turns on, among other things, \"the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, PKP's arguments that these data may not be admissible are insufficient to support a Rule 12(f) motion to strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheffield v.

Mass. 2016) (\"[I]nadmissibility is insufficient to support a Rule 12(f) motion.\").

Smith's Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Smith moves to strike several paragraphs from Doe's brief that allege Smith operated a fake-identification business out of his residence at Brown. Smith argues that these allegations are immaterial and impertinent to the issues in the case, and that they are unduly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Doe responds that these allegations support her claims insofar as they identify how Smith purchased alcohol for the party, which was the medium through which Smith committed the alleged battery. Doe also claims that the University declined to accept evidence of Smith's business, which, she argues, is evidence for her contention\n   that the University unfairly protected Smith during its investigation of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court recognizes that allegations of running a fake-identification business do not cast Smith in the best light, and are not at the heart of Doe's case. However, Doe has sufficiently demonstrated how these allegations could be relevant to her case. And in any event Smith has not made it \"clear that the allegations in question can have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Lennon v.

The Court therefore denies Smith's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As set out above, the Court grants in part and denies in part Brown University's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 65); denies Phi Kappa Psi, Inc.'s, Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 50); grants in part and denies in part John Smith's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 41); and denies both PKP's (ECF No. 51) and Smith's (ECF No. 40) motions to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    As it must, this section presents Doe's rendering of the facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Arruda v.

However, dismissing the former while allowing the latter to proceed is the result of Brown's being further removed from Doe's alleged injury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bucki\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8333034\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/914/491/#p495\">\n     914 A.2d at 496\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting \"the closeness of connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered\" as factor in duty-of-care analysis). The allegations, after all, are that PKP supervised and had control over Alpha Chapter and its individual members.
