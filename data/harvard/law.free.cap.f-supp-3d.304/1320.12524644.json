BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Introduction\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute arises from alleged misrepresentations and confidentiality breaches in connection with the purchase and sale of 340 railcars (the \"Railcars\") for approximately $22 million. Plaintiff Infinity Transportation III LLC (\"Infinity\") purchased the Railcars pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement effective May 29, 2015 (the \"Purchase Agreement\"). (Compl. Ex. 2). At the time of sale, the Railcars were included in a pool of other railcars available for lease to national railroad companies (the \"Pool\"). Infinity alleges there were preexisting commercial relationships between XPO and major railroads that XPO represented did not exist. These preexisting relationships impacted the inclusion of the Railcars in the Pool, thus impacting the value of the Railcars to Infinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Railcars are used by railroads to carry shipping containers throughout the United States. (Compl. \u00b6 14). These railcars, owned by different owners, operate in a pool. The owner of the cars in the pool are paid by railway companies based on a \"car hire\" rate. This rate is calculated based on the amount of time the railcar is used and\n   the distance traveled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). When a loaded railcar in the Pool reaches its destination, it is unloaded, and reloaded if a railroad customer wants to transport shipping containers to another location. If the railcar is not reloaded, it is redirected elsewhere until it is needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though empty, the railcar continues to earn \"car hire\" from the railroads on whose lines the car travels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   XPO is one of the nation's largest logistics and intermodal companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). It owns or otherwise has an interest in a fleet of railcars that it operates in the Pool. The Railcars XPO sold to Infinity were in the Pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about April 13, 2015, Infinity and XPO entered into a non-disclosure agreement (the \"Nondisclosure Agreement\") in connection with their discussions regarding the possibility of XPO selling railcars to Infinity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; Ex. 1). In the Nondisclosure Agreement the parties agreed not to disclose the fact of their discussions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During their negotiations, Infinity asked XPO to expressly represent that the Railcars in the Pool were not subject to any special arrangement XPO had with any railroad. Infinity wanted to confirm that XPO had not entered into any side agreements or understandings that would adversely affect the Railcars' use in the Pool after XPO sold the Railcars to Infinity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 7, 2015, an Infinity executive, Paul Goss, sent an e-mail to Phil Harrison, XPO's agent for the sale, asking XPO to \"[c]larify any formal or implied 'quid pro quo' agreements, if any, between [XPO] and any railroads or shippers that bind use of this equipment to business activity originated by [XPO].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). Harrison expressly represented that he was unaware of any agreements and that there were no arrangements between XPO and any railroad that would impact the continued use of the Railcars in the Pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the diligence period, the parties entered into the Purchase Agreement in which Infinity purchased the Railcars for approximately $22 million. In the Purchase Agreement, XPO represented in paragraph 5.1(b):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   To XPO's knowledge, XPO's ownership of any of the Railcars is not a condition precedent (either formal or informal, contractual or noncontractual, oral or written) to any railroad's willingness to load, unload, move, or accept any of the Railcars for movement; provided, however, XPO makes no representations or warranties about the practices or preferences of any railroad, it being understood that in any event the Railcars operate subject to the AAR Code of Car Service Rules/Code of Car Hire Rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 \u00b6 5.1(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Purchase Agreement also contains a confidentiality provision (\"Confidentiality Provision\") that requires the parties\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   to keep confidential and not to disclose to any person or entity, other than its employees, attorneys, advisors and financiers, this Agreement and the contents hereof, including without limitation, the purchase price and other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transactions, except as may be required by applicable law, necessary for UMLER modifications, or permitted under the parties' Confidentiality Agreement dated April 13, 2015. The parties agree not to make any press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions\n   without the parties' mutual consent or except as may be required by applicable law. XPO and Buyer shall jointly prepare such notifications to third parties as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to the Transactions contemplated thereby.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2, \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 1, 2015, Dan Heird, XPO's VP of Railcar Assets, sent an email to Jean Chavez at Union Pacific railroad informing Union Pacific that the Railcars had been sold to Infinity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3). Between June 1, 2015, and June 5, 2015, XPO also informed CSX railroad that XPO sold the Railcars to Infinity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Shortly thereafter, Union Pacific rejected several Railcars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). CSX also informed Infinity it would not accept the Railcars for reloading on its lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sometime later, Norfolk Southern railroad told Infinity that it would not accept the Railcars on its line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). Infinity has not been able to reliably circulate Railcars within the Pool, significantly diminishing their value to Infinity, including by loss of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After railroads elected not to use the Railcars, Infinity claimed to have learned, through discussions with XPO, that XPO had misrepresented the nature of its prior arrangements with the railroads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). XPO admitted it had an arrangement with Union Pacific that governed use of the Railcars when they were owned by XPO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53). Infinity claims Union Pacific agreed to act as a Home Road for XPO's Railcars. This arrangement affected Union Pacific's willingness to load, unload, move, and accept the Railcars for movement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 28, 2017, Infinity filed this action against XPO [1]. On April 10, 2017, Infinity filed its Amended Complaint [10] alleging nine counts against XPO. Count One alleges breach of the Purchase Agreement as a result of XPO's alleged representation that its ownership was not a condition precedent to any railroad's use of the Railcars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-72). Count Two alleges breach of the Purchase Agreement's Confidentiality Provision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-79). Count Three alleges breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in connection with the Purchase Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-87). Count Four alleges breach of the Nondisclosure Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-94). Count Five alleges breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in connection with the Nondisclosure Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-102). Count Six alleges fraud, fraudulent inducement, and fraudulent concealment based on XPO's alleged false representations and XPO's representations made to Paul Goss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-116). Count Seven alleges negligent misrepresentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117-127). Count Eight alleges violations of the Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"GUDTPA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-136). Count Nine claims litigation expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137-142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 8, 2017, XPO moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim. ( [13] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only substantive count not challenged in the motion is Count One, alleging breach of contract for violation of the provision of the Purchase Agreement concerning the representation about XPO's commercial relationships with railroads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
