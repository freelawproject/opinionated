As set forth in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   , the key question is \"whether the focus of the claims is on the specific asserted improvement in computer capabilities ... or, instead, on a process that qualifies as an 'abstract idea' for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1335-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Published less than a week after\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re TLI Commc'ns LLC Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    TLI\n   </em>\n   \") emphasized that claims are drawn to an abstract idea if they are directed to \"the use of conventional or generic technology in a nascent but well-known environment, without any claim that the invention reflects an inventive solution to any problem presented by combining the two.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p612\">\n    823 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (Fed.

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit defined the key inquiry as \"whether the claims in these patents focus on a specific means or method that improves the relevant technology or are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea and merely invoke generic processes and machinery.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n    837 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1314 (Fed.

While these patents may require the use of a computer to collect inputs for the method, that does not direct the patents away from an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BASCOM Glob.Internet Servs.\n   </em>\n   , Inc.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1348\">\n    827 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the patents in Groups 1 and 2, the claims of the Group 3 Patents do not shed light on how to \"identify[ ],\" \"request[ ],\" \"analyz[e],\" and \"correlat[e]\" so as to impart an inventive concept.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/\">\n    874 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1338-39 ;\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Plaintiff fails to explain how independent claim 1's instruction to \"pars[e] a referral header\" adds meaningful specificity at step two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 24-25. The claim language itself does not specify how to identify an organic referral, or explain what \"parsing\" entails. Plaintiff fails to cite other dependent claim language that would meaningfully distinguish the Group 3 Patents from the other patents-in-suit. Absent those limitations, the Court likewise concludes that the asserted claims of the Group 3 Patents fail at\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, and are thus invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   As for Plaintiff's motion seeking leave to file a fourth amended complaint, the Court finds that motion appropriate for disposition without oral argument and deems the motion submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 159; Civ. L.R. 7-1(b). The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's motion as moot. The Court finds that granting Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add a new patent would not cure the infirmities discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt No. 159 at 2. Moreover, the efficiency benefits to which Plaintiff points-namely, coordinating case events as to the proposed new claims and the existing claims-no longer exist, because the Court has granted judgment for Defendants as to all of the claims asserted to date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
