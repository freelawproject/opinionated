Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Discrimination in the work place is often covert, and can only be revealed through a full examination of the facts. Juries are unusually well suited to making this determination after weighing the evidence and credibility of the parties. In this case, under the court's examination, Plaintiff's presentation of herself at the hearing on defendant's motion for summary judgement indicates that a jury could find that she did not fail in administering her duties, and that racial discrimination was the reason for her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lyndelle T. Phillips is the former head of the New York City Fire Department's (\"FDNY\") Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Office. Alleging that she was demoted and then fired because of her race, she brings suit against the City of\n   New York, the Fire Commissioner, and the First Deputy Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgement on all claims. The motion is granted on statute of limitations grounds with respect to the Section 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the paper submissions and arguments by both parties, the court was prepared to grant defendants' motion on the Section 1981 claim. After observing plaintiff during her extended examination by the court, defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's Section 1981 claim is denied. A jury could find her to be a credible witness who took her job at the FDNY seriously and performed satisfactorily. Discrimination, and not poor job performance, a jury could conclude, was the reason for her termination by the FDNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff, an African-American female, was appointed on June 5, 2006 Assistant Commissioner for EEO at the FDNY.

Mem\"), ECF No. 99 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants assert that the FDNY had ample non-discriminatory reasons for terminating plaintiff's employment, given her consistent struggle with management during her tenure as Assistant Commissioner. In particular, defendants point to the 2009 DCAS notification of a significant case backlog, the two discrimination complaints lodged against plaintiff by attorneys in the EEO office in 2010, and the findings of the \"Corporation Counsel Report\" written by the Law Department Office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   After the decision to replace plaintiff, she was reassigned to the FDNY Legal Affairs, where she continued to receive her full salary and benefits and the New York City Law Department tried to find another EEO position for plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   When it became clear that she did not intend to resign, the FDNY claims it fired her for reasons of inadequate performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discriminatory Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Once a non-discriminatory reason is articulated, the viability of plaintiff's Section 1981 claim rises of falls on her ability under the third step of the\n   <em>\n    McDonald Douglass\n   </em>\n   framework, to \"point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination\".\n   <em>\n    Mario v. P &amp; C Food Markets, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318199\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/758/#p767\">\n    313 F.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (2d Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff devotes a significant portion of her written submissions to an attempt to establish an inference of discrimination by pointing to comparable employees of a different race who were treated differently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp'n at 9-14. The court was prepared to rule-based on the parties' briefs-that plaintiff had failed to establish an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There are factual dissimilarities between plaintiff and the comparators to which she points-different job titles, different direct supervisors, and a general lack of evidence that plaintiff's own performance evaluation and discipline standards were substantially similar to those of her comparators. For a person in a senior management position proving discrimination by using comparators is difficult. Managers often do not receive formal evaluations and are the only person with their precise job title.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Suzanne B. Goldberg,\n   <em>\n    Discrimination by Comparison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Yale%20L.J.%20728\">\n    120 Yale L.J. 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (noting the general difficulties with the comparator approach to discrimination and in particular the difficulties for \"uniquely situated employees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The December 18, 2017 hearing changed the court's view of the case. Plaintiff was subject to thorough examination by the court. It was clear that a jury could find her a credible witness with a legitimate\n   claim of discrimination. She cogently and persuasively stated several reasons-in addition to the differing treatment of comparators-why a jury could find that there was race based discrimination. She was a thoughtful person, who appears to have taken her job at the FDNY EEO office seriously. It would be hard for a jury to believe that this intelligent, well informed person managed her important office in a lackadaisical manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The timing of plaintiff's termination from the FDNY on March 26, 2012-three days after she met with consultant Professor Rossein to discuss race discrimination at the FDNY-is, a jury could find, not mere coincidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 18, 2017 Hearing Transcript (\"Hr'g Tr.\") 13:17-22. After plaintiff disclosed to Professor Rossein that race discrimination in the FDNY was broader than revealed in the\n   <em>\n    Vulcans\n   </em>\n   litigation, she was terminated. Hr'g Tr. 13:23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There was, as noted in the\n   <em>\n    Vulcans\n   </em>\n   findings of fact, an atmosphere of racial tension and animus within the FDNY. Plaintiff's status as a black female Assistant Commissioner at the FDNY, and the particular scrutiny with which the FDNY approached plaintiff's alleged mismanagement, raises a genuine issue of triable fact as to whether the defendants terminated plaintiff because of her race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 26:6-10 (\"The City Law Department investigated. They said there was no probable cause to believe that you [were] discriminated [against] in this case; however, they went on to access management issues for me, but not for Kay Ellis, not for Rob Wallace, not for Michele Maglione.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine triable issue for trial. A jury could conclude that the plaintiff's claim of discrimination is credible, and that the defendants reason for her termination was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted on plaintiff's Section 1983 claim on the basis of the statute of limitations. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's Section 1981 claim for discriminatory termination is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Trial shall commence on April 16, 2018 in Courtroom 10 B South at 10:30 a.m. Jury selection shall be by a magistrate judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A hearing on motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   and all other pre-trial issues, including whether the issues should be narrowed for trial, shall be held on April 9, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. in Courtroom 10 B South. Plaintiff and individual defendants shall be present with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties shall exchange and file with the court by April 2, 2018, the following: (1) motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   ; (2) lists of pre-marked exhibits proposed for use at the trial, together with copies of the exhibits, and any stipulations regarding admissibility and authenticity; (3) lists of proposed witnesses together with brief summaries of their proposed testimony; (4) stipulations with respect to undisputed facts; and (5) a full proposed charge to the jury with findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The parties shall agree on a briefing schedule. If they cannot agree, all scheduling issues are respectfully referred to the magistrate judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
