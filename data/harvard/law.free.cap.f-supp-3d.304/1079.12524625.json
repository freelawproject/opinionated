The Manner in which Wicks Carried on his Cattle Ranching Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant argues this factor is in its favor because Wicks under-insured his cattle and lacked financial projections, a separate bank account, a business entity, and a written business plan for his cattle operation. Dkt. # 30, at 25-27. This manner of operating stands in stark contrast, defendant asserts further, to the way in which Wicks ran Wicks and Associates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.183-2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.183-2\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs respond that Wicks's cattle ranching business practices-including limiting his record keeping to expense-tracking spreadsheets-were consistent with the practices of other, profitable cattle ranchers in the area and that his willingness to adopt new operating methods evinces a profit motive. Dkt. # 35, at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(1) provides that a profit motive may be indicated where a taxpayer maintains complete and accurate books, carries on an activity in a manner substantially similar to other, profitable activities of the same nature, or adopts new techniques. Certainly, the facts that Wicks under-insured his cattle and lacked financial projections, a separate bank account, a business entity, and a written business plan do not indicate that Wicks was engaged in cattle ranching to make a profit. Neither does his admission at his deposition that he did not, in writing, \"track anything\" related to the profits and losses of his cattle operation. Dkt. # 29-6, at 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the other hand, Wicks's accountant testified that most cattle-ranching clients he services do not have written business plans or income statements, and Hutson's report indicates that, in Hutson's opinion, Wicks has taken all the steps necessary to build a successful cattle-ranching business. Dkt. # 35-2, at 7; Dkt. # 48-1, at 10. Moreover, in utilizing a cross-breeding strategy based on advice from Pat Faulkner, and developing his ranch in response to his cattle's health concerns (by, for example, building loafing sheds and cattle working facilities), Wicks has demonstrated a willingness to change his operating methods and adopt new techniques in an effort to increase his cattle operation's potential profitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ultimately, much of the case law interpreting \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(1) places heavy emphasis on whether the taxpayer carries on an activity in a \"businesslike manner,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   uses \"cost accounting techniques,\" has a business plan, business entity, or corporate bank account, or engages other such practices that allow the taxpayer \"to make informed business transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Keating v.

The record indicates that Wicks, with respect to his cattle activity, failed to do any of these things; instead, he maintained simple spreadsheets to record his expenses, which, objectively speaking, appear to do little more than \"memorialize for tax purposes the existence of the subject transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Moreover, as defendants point out, Wicks is a successful businessman who employs a variety of sophisticated\n   financial practices in running Wicks and Associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, although there is some evidence that the manner in which Wicks operates his cattle ranch is consistent with other local ranchers, and he has demonstrated a willingness to adopt new operating methods, the fact that he employed no sophisticated business practices and his records were so rudimentary suggests that this factor favors defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Expertise of the Taxpayer or his Advisors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This factor is in its favor, defendant argues, because before undertaking cattle ranching in 1997, Wicks's only experience with the activity was milking cows sporadically as a child and, since 1997, Wicks has done no more than informally consult with acquaintances on the topic. Dkt. # 30, at 29. Plaintiffs argue, to the contrary, that since 1997 Wicks has taken many steps to acquire expertise in cattle ranching, including: extensive self-study, attending numerous clinics and seminars, joining professional associations of cattleman, and consulting with a Nowata County field agent and Pat Faulkner, a successful local rancher. Dkt. # 35, at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(2) provides that extensive study of the accepted business, economic, and scientific practices of an activity, as well as consultation with experts, may indicate that the taxpayer has a profit motive. One court found this factor to be in the taxpayer's favor where he \"acquired some expertise in cattle raising through self-education and ... relied upon the expertise of others [with cattle-ranching experience] through regular consultation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullins v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9193674\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/334/1042/#p1053\">\n    334 F.Supp.2d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1053 (E.D. Tenn. 2004). Another court, however, has found this factor to weigh against the taxpayer where his experience with cattle was limited to when he was \"growing up\" and he consulted only with \"acquaintances for informal advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Embroidery Express, LLC v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20T.C.M.%2076\">\n    112 T.C.M. (CCH) 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The record demonstrates that Wicks engaged in self-education (through attending cattle ranching seminars and reading online materials) and received advice from a Nowata County field agent and Faulkner, who had been a successful rancher and advised Wicks to pursue a cross-breeding strategy. Wicks did not, however, pursue any formal cattle ranching education or hire paid consultants or experts, and the regularity with which he consulted Faulkner is unclear. These facts indicate that Wicks neither zealously pursued nor neglected opportunities to gain expertise in cattle ranching. The record, therefore, suggests that this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Time and Effort Expended by the Taxpayer in Carrying on the Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendant contends this factor favors it because Wicks spends most of his week away from his ranch and does not employ anybody to assist him in operating the ranch. Dkt. # 30, at 31. This factor favors them, plaintiffs retort, because Wicks spends thirty percent of his time, and significant energy, performing hard labor on the ranch, including: clearing land; installing and repairing fences; improving the pond; constructing barns and loafing sheds; caring for and maintaining cattle; and storing equipment. Dkt. # 35, at 18. Plaintiff adds that these activities, for Wicks, have no recreational aspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(3) provides that where a taxpayer devotes much of his personal time and effort to carry on an activity, especially where the activity does not have substantial personal or recreational aspects, a profit motive may be indicated. The record indicates that, since 1997, Wicks has devoted, on average, three days per week (and sometimes four) to maintaining and developing his cattle ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Three or four days per week cannot reasonably be considered an insubstantial amount of time. Moreover, the evidence reveals that Wicks devotes his time at the ranch to maintaining and developing it, which entails hard physical labor, and defendant points to no evidence demonstrating that this physical labor has substantial personal or recreational aspects for him. Accordingly, because Wicks spends a substantial amount of time at the ranch performing arduous physical work, and because there is no evidence that he finds substantial recreation in this toil, the record suggests that this factor weighs in plaintiff's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Expectation that Assets Used in Activity May Appreciate in Value\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant argues that this factor weighs in its favor because Wicks's cattle are inventory (not assets he expected to hold and appreciate), his farm equipment has depreciated, and the Court should not consider any appreciation of his real property in its analysis because his purchase of the land and his cattle operation are separate activities. Dkt. # 30, at 34. Plaintiffs respond that this factor favors them because they have presented evidence that Wicks has grown his herd, his land has appreciated in market value and from the capital improvements he has made to it (and the Court should factor this into its analysis because his land ownership and cattle ranching are a single activity), and his accountant believes Wicks could \"probably\" recoup his losses from cattle ranching if he sold his property. Dkt. # 35, at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(4) provides that the term \"profit\" encompasses an appreciation of assets, including land, and, therefore, a profit motive may be indicated where a taxpayer loses money in performing a given activity but expected to compensate for this loss with the appreciation of the land or other assets used in the activity. The Court agrees with defendant that Wicks cannot reasonably be said to have had an expectation of appreciation with respect to his cattle (which he bred to be saleable inventory) or farm equipment (the depreciation of which he claimed as business losses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Wicks's land, however, is a different story. To determine whether land ownership and an activity the taxpayer conducts on the land are a single activity, the Court must look to the \"degree of organizational and economic interrelationship of\" the land and that activity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201.183-1\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.183-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The record indicates that in 2010 and 2011 there was a high degree of organizational and economic interrelationship between Wicks's land and his cattle ranching operation and, for the purposes of summary judgment, the Court treats the two as a single activity. Although the evidence suggests that Wicks might not have committed to developing a cattle ranch prior to purchasing his original eighty acres in 1997, the record reveals that he purchased his additional one hundred and eighty acres in 2002 for the purpose of growing his cattle operation, and, since then, has made substantial capital improvements to the land, all dedicated to expanding his ranch. And there is evidence that Wicks's effort have been fruitful-he acquired the properties for $175,000 and, in 2014, they were appraised at $725,000. The record, therefore, suggests that this factor favors plaintiffs because Wicks's could reasonably be said to have had an expectation of the \"appreciation\n   of ... the value of capital improvements [he] made on [his] land.\"\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

The Success of the Taxpayer in Carrying on Similar or Dissimilar Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant argues that this factor favors it because the stark contrast between the ways in which Wicks runs Wicks and Associates and his cattle ranch indicate that Wicks does not operate the latter with a profit motive. Dkt. # 30, at 36-37. Plaintiffs retort that this factor weighs in their favor, as Wicks runs his cattle ranch with the same work ethic that he runs Wicks and Associates. Dkt. # 35, at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(5) provides that a profit motive may be indicated where an individual has engaged in similar or dissimilar activities in the past and turned them profitable even where the current endeavor is not profitable. The evidence demonstrates that Wicks does not operate his cattle ranch with nearly the type of sophistication that he employs in running Wicks and Associates. Wicks's cattle operation, in contrast to Wicks and Associates, does not have any employees (let alone an accountant), a separate bank account, a business entity, or a business plan. On the other hand, it is evident that Wicks expends a significant amount of time, energy, and money in maintaining and developing his ranch and, in light of his past success in running a highly profitable business, these facts might reasonably be said to lend an inference that he is engaged in cattle ranching for profit.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoyle v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20T.C.M.%201321\">\n    68 T.C.M.

Accordingly, the record suggests that this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. The Taxpayer's History of Income or Losses with Respect to the Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant contends this factor weighs in its favor because Wicks has been involved in cattle ranching for approximately twenty years, never generated a profit, reported $807, 380 in losses, and 2010 and 2011 were more than ten years past the commencement of his cattle operation, making these years beyond what might reasonably be considered a startup phase. Dkt. # 30, at 38. Plaintiff does not dispute any of defendant's contentions but argues that the losses Wicks reported in 2010 and 2011 (and surrounding years) do\n   not indicate a lack of profit motive because these losses were sustained as a result of his decision to start a multi-year, cross-breeding program in 2006, his heart attack in 2009, and drought and a correspondingly depressed cattle market from 2010-2012. Dkt. # 35, at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(6) provides that sustained losses may indicate that an activity is not being engaged in for profit. The impact of this factor against a taxpayer, however, may be mitigated where there are explanations for the losses, such as drought, depressed market conditions, or other circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control. The record is clear that in every year from 1997 through 2015, Wicks has reported substantial losses, and never any profits, from his cattle activity. The evidence, therefore, clearly suggests that this factor weighs in defendant's favor. The evidence also suggests, however, that the degree to which Wicks's losses indicate he lacked a profit motive in 2010 and 2011 are at least somewhat mitigated by his 2006 decision to adopt a multi-year cross-breeding strategy, his 2009 health concerns, and, as Hutson's report verifies, drought and a correspondingly depressed cattle market from 2010-2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    vii. The Amount of Occasional Profits, if any, Which are Earned\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendant argues that this factor cuts in its favor because Wicks has never reported a profit from his cattle ranching activities. Dkt. # 30, at 38. Plaintiffs concede that this factor \"may weigh in favor\" of defendant. Dkt. # 35, at 21. Plaintiffs point out, however, that Courts have noted that \"farming is not the most profitable business in which one can be engaged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20T.C.M.%201321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Faulconer v.

The record clearly suggests that this factor weighs in defendant's favor. The case law, however, also suggests that the degree to which Wicks's failure to turn a profit as a cattle rancher suggests he lacked a profit motive should be at least somewhat mitigated by the fact that small farming operations are not generally speaking, lucrative businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    viii. The Financial Status of the Taxpayer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant argues that this factor favors it because Wicks generates substantial income from Wicks and Associates, which he uses to sustain his cattle operation. Dkt. # 30, at 40. Plaintiffs do not contest this. Plaintiffs argue, however, that this factor \"merely makes the commonsense point that the expectation of [being] able to arrange to have the tax collector share in the cost of a hobby may often induce an investment in such a hobby which would not otherwise occur.\" Dkt. # 35, at 22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Engdahl v.

And, plaintiffs argue further, this concern is not present here because Wicks was not engaged in cattle ranching as a hobby.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6090535\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/72/659/#p670\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(8) provides that substantial income from sources other than the activity at issue may indicate that the activity is not engaged in for profit, especially where losses from the activity generate substantial tax benefits and there are personal or recreational elements involved. The evidence suggests that this factor\n   weighs in defendant's favor because Wicks has substantial income from Wicks and Associates (which funds his cattle operation) and his losses from cattle ranching generate substantial tax benefits. Defendant has not, however, presented evidence demonstrating that, for Wicks, there are personal or recreational elements involved in cattle ranching. And this lack of evidence makes it less likely that Wicks is engaged in cattle ranching as a hobby, which, but for his ability to claim a portion of its costs as business deductions, he would not have taken up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. Elements of Personal Pleasure or Recreation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As defendant concedes, \"courts have stated that raising cattle generally lacks significant recreational aspects.\" Dkt. # 30, at 41 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gardner v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20T.C.M.%2071\">\n    108 T.C.M. (CCH) 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (2014) ). Defendant nevertheless argues that this factor weighs in its favor because Wicks maintains a personal residence on his ranch and has admitted to enjoying the outdoors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20T.C.M.%2071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs respond that Wicks's ranching activity has no personal or recreational aspects, as his work on the ranch consists of bookkeeping, study, and arduous physical labor. Dkt. # 35, at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Section 1.183-2(b)(9) provides that personal or recreational elements may indicate that an activity is not engaged in for profit and, conversely, a profit motivation may be indicated where an activity lacks any appeal other than profit. As established, defendant has presented no evidence that suggests Wicks engaged in cattle ranching for personal or recreational purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And there exists in the case law a common sense presumption against finding cattle ranching, and the arduous labor it entails (which Wicks performs almost entirely on his own), to have significant recreational aspects. The record and the relevant case law, therefore, suggest that this factor weighs in plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.183-2\">\n    Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)'s nine factors, and the totality of the circumstances in this case, the Court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that in 2010 and 2011 Wicks was engaged in cattle ranching for profit. First, Wicks has consistently maintained that this is so. More significantly, the expert report and testimony of A.L. Hutson suggests that Wicks has completed the steps necessary to build a profitable cattle ranching business (despite his lack of sophisticated business practices and record-keeping methods). In addition, the evidence reveals that Wicks attempted to gain expertise in cattle ranching through self-study, seminar attendance, and consultation with a local expert (Pat Faulkner), that he was willing to adopt at least one major new technique (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   a cross-breeding program) in pursuit of greater profitability, and that he has expended very substantial amounts of time, energy, and money in turning what was essentially empty land into a two hundred and sixty acre ranch with one hundred and twenty cows and multiple facilities that, in 2014, was valued at close to three-quarters of a million dollars. Finally, defendant has presented no evidence indicating that cattle ranching had significant personal or recreational aspects for Wicks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that in 2010 and 2011 Wicks was engaged in cattle ranching for profit within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.183-2\">\n    Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 29), therefore, must be\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Dkt. # 30, at 42-44. Plaintiffs dispute this. Dkt. # 35, at 23. Because the Court has denied defendant's motion for summary judgment, and the question of whether it was lawful for plaintiffs to report their losses from cattle activity remains unresolved, the Court reserves judgment on this questions. Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 29) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiffs' motion to strike evidence (Dkt. # 36) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   , and defendant's motion to exclude the report and testimony of A.L.

Moreover, recent authority from the United States Tax Court,\n    <em>\n     contra\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    , states that the \"question is not whether [the taxpayer] would [through asset appreciation] recoup all of [his ranch's] losses but whether he would recoup the losses between the years in issue and the hoped-for profitable future.\"\n    <em>\n     Welch v.
