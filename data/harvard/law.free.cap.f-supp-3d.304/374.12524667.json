For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's federal and NYSHRL claims, which are dismissed with prejudice. Because I dismiss the federal claims before me, and because Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims are governed under a lower threshold of proof than their federal counterparts, I decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Therefore, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims, and Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a Rastafarian, African-American male from Trinidad and Tobago.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) He has also received accreditations from Pennsylvania State University, San Juan Senior Comprehensive School in Metal Work and Technical Drawing, and the American Society of Engineers.

On October 20, 2008, Plaintiff was permanently given the title of Auto Mechanic based on his qualifications in an \"open competitive civil service list.\" (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff's day-to-day responsibilities included \"researching technical information for the creation of specification used in the procurement of capital vehicles and equipment, ensuring that the latest technology complies [with] all current safety standards, rules, and regulations, and inspecting and approving all vehicles to ensure compliance with specification requirements.\" (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2011, Plaintiff was provisionally appointed as the Supervisor of Mechanics and Mechanical Equipment (\"SOMME\") by John Paterno (\"Paterno\"), an Executive Director of the DOT's Fleet Services Division. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 12; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 12; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) In this role, Plaintiff performed duties such as \"insur[ing] that an adequate supply of proper parts is maintained in all stockrooms,\" \"initiat[ing] purchase of parts and equipment,\" \"contact[ing] vendors to ensure that parts, materials and equipment are made to specifications and will be delivered on time,\" and \"develop[ing], recommend[ing], and implement[ing] productivity and cost saving measures.\" (Doc. 75-2, at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the time that he was a provisional SOMME, Plaintiff was supervised primarily by Paterno. (Espinoza Dep. 28:20-23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his deposition, Plaintiff stated that Paterno \"always trie[d] to speak [to him] with a Jamaican accent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:19-37:1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 67 (\"Paterno would often use a Jamaican accent .... He seemed to think I was Jamaican.\").) He also stated that Paterno made \"comments about ^ ganja\" and about \"smoking weed.\" (Espinoza Dep. 36:2-13.) Further, Plaintiff's reviews, which were consistently \"outstanding\" between 2007 and 2010, changed to \"good\" the year in which Plaintiff believes Paterno took over management of his unit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75-6, at 51-54; Doc. 75-7, at 1-6 (exhibiting copies of Plaintiff's evaluations).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     DOT's Appointment of a Permanent Supervisor of Mechanics and Mechanical Equipment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In approximately August 2011, the DOT distributed a \"notice of examination\" notifying\n   DOT employees of the possibility of promotion to a permanent SOMME position. (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75-9, at 5.) The notice stated that the application period was between January 4 and January 24, 2012, that candidates should submit an application online if they believed they were eligible, and that they would be required to sit for a multiple-choice test on April 28, 2012. (Doc. 75-9, at 5.) The notice further stated that in order to qualify to take the examination, the candidate must \"hold[ ] a permanent (not provisional) competitive appointment or appear[ ] on a Preferred List ... for the title of Auto Machinist, Auto Mechanic, Auto Mechanic (Diesel), Electrician (Automobile), or Machinist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Lastly, candidates were notified that \"[i]f [they] pass[ed] the multiple-choice test and [were] marked eligible, [their] name w[ould] be placed in final score order on an eligible list and [they would] be given a list number,\" and that they would be \"considered for promotion when [their] name [was] reached on the eligible list.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff took the exam on April 28, 2012. (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 69.) Thereafter, as stated on the notice, the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (\"NYCDCAS\") created a list of eligible applicants based on the candidates' scores (\"Promotion List\"). (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 13; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 71.) This list was published on February 27, 2013. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 13; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 71.) Out of the fifty-eight total DOT employees who passed the exam and were placed on the list, Plaintiff was ranked number fifty-one. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 73-74;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-8, at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The DOT interviewed fourteen candidates from the Promotion List in order of test score.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 15; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 15.) Ultimately, the list of candidates considered for interviews (the \"Interview List\") included fifteen candidates who were ranked based on test score and were otherwise qualified for the position (i.e., having a qualifying position and a Class A Commercial Driver's License), (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-10, at 6-11), and only reached the candidate who was ranked number eighteen on the Promotion List-at number fifty-one, Plaintiff was not included.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to a copy of the Interview List with a disposition date of June 4, 2013, out of the fourteen candidates who were interviewed, nine were permanently appointed, and the candidate numbered sixteen on the Promotion List was the last candidate that the DOT reached for permanent appointment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75-7, at 17; Doc. 69-10, at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once the promotion decisions were made, Plaintiff was returned to his permanent Auto Mechanic civil service title. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 19; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 87; Doc. 69-10, at 12.) Jean Frankowski, the Director of Personnel at the DOT, sent Plaintiff a letter on May 22, 2013 informing him that he would lose his provisional SOMME title on June 8, 2013 and return to his Auto Mechanic title as of June 9, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 87; Doc. 69-11, at 2.) The letter stated: \"This is to inform you that due to the promulgation of the civil service list for Supervisor of Mechanics (Mechanical Equipment), a title you now hold provisionally, it will become necessary to terminate your provisional services effective June 8, 2013.\" (Doc. 69-11, at 2.) This was, according to Plaintiff, the first time he had learned that he would lose his provisional SOMME title. (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 87.) Out of the seven candidates who were provisional SOMMEs, three, including Plaintiff, were returned to their permanent underlying titles, and the other four were hired as permanent SOMMEs based on their scores on the list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-10, at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Notice of Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 21, 2014, Plaintiff filed a notice of charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\" and \"EEOC Charge\"). (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 4; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-1.) In the EEOC Charge, Plaintiff alleged that he was discriminated against based on his race and national origin because his salary was reduced and his title was changed to Auto Mechanic, while a co-worker who was not African-American maintained his provisional title. (Doc. 69-1, at 2-4, 6.) The co-worker who Plaintiff referenced was employed by the Department of Sanitation (\"DOS\") and did not take the civil service examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) On December 9, 2014, the EEOC issued a determination that it was \"unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violation of the statutes,\" and along with that determination it issued a notice of the right to file a lawsuit in federal or state court within ninety days of receipt. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 6; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-2, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on February 13, 2015. (Doc. 2.) He moved to proceed in forma pauperis, so that he could proceed without prepayment of fees, on the same day. (Doc. 1.) Plaintiff's application to proceed in forma pauperis was granted on February 17, 2015. (Doc. 3.) On February 23, 2015, the case was assigned to me. (Dkt. Entry Feb. 23, 2015.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After granting Defendants' request for extension of time to respond to the Complaint, (Doc. 9), on July 13, 2015, I granted Defendants' request for a pre-motion conference regarding their anticipated motion to dismiss, (Doc. 11). Plaintiff submitted a response to Defendants' pre-motion letter on July 28, 2015, (Doc. 12), and I held the pre-motion conference on August 14, 2015, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Entry Aug. 14, 2015). Shortly thereafter, I granted Defendants leave to file a motion to dismiss the Complaint. (Doc. 16.) Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, memorandum of law, and declaration in support of the motion on October 23, 2015. (Docs. 17-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 23, 2015, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), which was amended for the purpose of including additional defendants. (Doc. 20.) On December 2, 2015, Defendants requested an extension of time to respond, which I granted. (Doc. 23.) Defendants then filed their answer to the FAC on January 20, 2016. (Doc. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on the FAC, on February 18, 2016, I ordered service on an additional\n   three defendants-Michael Krafinski, John Paterno, and Basil Ciraolo (collectively, the \"Individual Defendants\"). (Doc. 27.) The Individual Defendants were served on April 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 30-32.) Thereafter, on June 1, 2016, the Individual Defendants filed their answer to the FAC. (Doc. 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 11, 2015, the Individual Defendants together with the Defendants as defined in the instant Opinion and Order filed a pre-motion letter requesting a conference with respect to their anticipated motion for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. 39), to which Plaintiff replied on August 18, 2016, (Doc. 41). I granted the request for a pre-motion conference and held the conference on October 24, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Entry Oct. 24, 2016.) Pursuant to the conference, I issued an order (1) extending discovery, (2) directing parties to submit an amended case management plan reflecting revised discovery deadlines, and (3) directing the parties to confer and submit a joint letter indicating whether Plaintiff would amend the complaint for a second time. (Doc. 44.) Defendants submitted a proposed amended case management plan on October 27, 2016, (Doc. 45), and a status report on November 14, 2016 informing me that the parties had reached an agreement and that a stipulation was forthcoming, (Doc. 49). On November 23, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation stating that Plaintiff would agree to the dismissal of claims, with prejudice, against the Individual Defendants, and that Plaintiff would file a second amended complaint. (Doc. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed the SAC on November 23, 2016, (Doc. 53), and at Defendants' request I held another pre-motion conference on April 13, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Entry Apr. 13, 2017). Pursuant to that conference, and as discussed on the record, I issued an order directing Defendants to file their motion for summary judgment by May 25, 2017, and setting briefing deadlines for the opposition and reply. (Doc. 64.) After one extension of time, (Doc. 66), on July 13, 2017, Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, along with a memorandum of law and supporting papers, (Docs. 67-70). Plaintiff filed his opposition on October 20, 2017, (Doc. 75), and Defendants filed their reply on November 9, 2017, (Doc. 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the parties' submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Fay v.

First Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093979\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/376/#p381\">\n    251 F.3d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381 (2d Cir. 2001), this case presents different facts because Plaintiff was a provisional\n   SOMME and never permanently gained that title, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 12; Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 12). Because the new positions were for permanent SOMME titles, those that were selected did not directly replace Plaintiff. In addition, Plaintiff states that two African-American males, numbers seven and fourteen on the list, were ultimately promoted to the SOMME position. (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff further fails to show that he was treated differently than someone similarly situated because of his race, color, religion, or national origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGuinness v. Lincoln Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482498\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/49/#p53\">\n    263 F.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"A showing that the employer treated a similarly situated employee differently is 'a common and especially effective method' of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abdu-Brisson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076031\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/456/#p467\">\n    239 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   468 ) ). Although Plaintiff claims that one of the Caucasian candidates who was promoted \"had significantly less experience than those minority candidates who were passed over,\" (Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 85), he does not provide evidence that the Caucasian candidate scored similarly on the exam or that at number fifty-one on the list, Plaintiff himself was passed over for promotion in favor of a Caucasian candidate. In fact, at least two other provisional SOMMEs, both of whom were Caucasian, were returned to their original titles in the same fashion as Plaintiff. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 19; Espinoza Decl. \u00b6 88.) Those who were permanently appointed scored significantly higher on the exam, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-10, at 6-11), and were interviewed and selected based upon their position on the list, which was determined solely by their score once the minimum requirements of being a DOT employee, having a qualifying title, and having the correct type of license were met. Plaintiff's argument that he was treated differently than a Caucasian DOS provisional SOMME employee who did not have to take a civil service exam-and that he was not \"placed into an exempt position, a non-competitive class position, or ... into an appropriate civil service title for which there was no civil service list\" (Pl.'s Opp. 19)-also fails because the DOS and the DOT are separate employers with separate employment requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff claims that there was a \"selective certification list which permitted management to reach a candidate who might not have been reachable on the main list,\" (Pl.'s Resp. 56.1 \u00b6 13), and that his supervisor, Paterno, \"intentionally left [Plaintiff's] name off the Selective Certification List,\" (SAC 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Espinoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-81). Plaintiff, however, has not provided evidence, other than conclusory statements, that he was in fact left off of the Selective List because of a protected characteristic, or that the DOT's decision not to interview him was in any way discriminatory. The Selective List was merely a list of people who passed the civil service exam and had a Class A Driver's License, and as Paterno states in his deposition, he only ever saw the first twenty seven people on the Selective List for the purpose of conducting interviews. (Paterno Dep. 124:14-23.) Only those that had the highest test scores on the Promotion List were interviewed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-10, at 6-11 (listing those that were interviewed based on their rank on the Promotion List); Doc. 75-9, at 10-11 (marking the candidates that were interviewed for the position, and showing that only those at the top of the promotion list were interviewed).) Both the list provided by Plaintiff, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75-7, at 17), and the list provided by Defendants, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69-10, at 6), dated June 4, 2013, include Plaintiff and state that Plaintiff was number fifty-one on the Promotion List. Another copy of the list dated September 13, 2013 provided by Defendants also shows Plaintiff as number fifty-one and is consistent with the June list. (Doc. 69-9, at 2.) Thus, Plaintiff has offered no evidence that there\n   was any discriminatory intent on the part of the DOT or Paterno so as to create an inference of discrimination sufficient for a prima facie showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although Plaintiff is a member of a protected class, was qualified for the permanent SOMME position, and suffered an adverse employment action in the form of lower salary and title, he has not provided sufficient evidence to give rise to an inference of discrimination. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the first stage of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   , and Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect Plaintiff's Title VII and NYSHRL claims is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     NYCHRL Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff also brings discrimination claims under the NYCHRL.
