WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By Decision and Order filed February 22, 2017, this Court granted in part and\n   denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 140). Plaintiffs now move to reconsider, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), 60(b)(1) and (2), and Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7(d)(3), the aspect of the Court's Decision and Order that granted, without prejudice, the Excellus Defendants'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion to dismiss the claims of the four non-misuse Plaintiffs (Matthew Fero, Dwayne Church, Therese Boomershine, and Brenda Caltagarone) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). (Dkt. 142). Alternatively, Plaintiffs ask the Court to deny the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff Matthew Fero's breach of contract and unjust enrichment claim for lack of standing, or provide Plaintiffs \"the right to replead jurisdictional facts, or, at a minimum, give Plaintiffs[ ] permission to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint\" pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Excellus Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' motion. (Dkt. 156).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the motion for reconsideration and, upon reconsideration, denies the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to the extent that it sought dismissal of the non-misuse Plaintiffs' claims. All other aspects of the Court's Decision and Order, including its grant, in part, of the motions filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), remain intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The factual background and procedural history relevant to this motion are set forth in detail in the Court's prior Decision and Order, with which familiarity is assumed. (Dkt. 140). The Court provides only a brief summary, as well as additional background information as relevant to this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arises out of a data breach involving Excellus Health Plan, Inc., a healthcare provider. According to Plaintiffs, on December 23, 2013, hackers gained access to Excellus' computer network systems, which stored the personal information belonging to millions of individuals. (Dkt. 99 (Consolidated Master Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 131, 133) ). During this data breach, the hackers had access to individuals' names, dates of birth, social security numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, member identification numbers, financial payment information (including credit card numbers), and medical insurance claims information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 52, 134). Plaintiffs, who allege various injuries arising out of the data breach, bring a putative class action against eight defendants, including the Excellus Defendants, and assert claims under various federal and state laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the data breach, several potential victims filed lawsuits alleging various injuries. (Dkt. 9-2 at 3). The Court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed interim lead counsel, and directed Plaintiffs to file a consolidated master complaint. (Dkt. 27; Dkt. 28; Dkt. 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 15, 2016, Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Master Complaint (\"CMC\"). On May 31, 2016, the Excellus Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 107). Plaintiffs responded in opposition to the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss on July 7, 2016. (Dkt. 122). On August 8, 2016, the Excellus Defendants filed a reply in further support of their motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 133). Oral argument was held before the undersigned on September 8, 2016. (Dkt. 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 22, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order in which it concluded,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that certain Plaintiffs-the so-called \"non-misuse\" Plaintiffs who did not allege that they had suffered any misuse of their personally identifiable information after the data breach-did not allege an injury-in-fact based on the alleged harm of increased risk of identity theft. (Dkt. 140 at 22-23). The Court reasoned that those Plaintiffs' risk of future harm was not certainly impending because none of those Plaintiffs had alleged any misuse in the three years since the data breach began, and that their alleged injuries depended on a chain of possibilities about the actions of independent actors. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court also pointed out, based on extra-pleading materials submitted by Plaintiffs, that it was unclear whether patient data had been exfiltrated, and, by extension, it was not clear whether cyber attackers breached the Excellus network in order to commit identity fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court further found that the four non-misuse Plaintiffs' alternative bases for standing were insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-28). Therefore, the Court granted the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss the four non-misuse Plaintiffs (Fero, Church, Boomershine, and Caltagarone) for lack of standing on the basis that they did not allege an injury-in-fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). The Court dismissed those plaintiffs' claims without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 22, 2017, Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of that portion of the Court's Decision and Order that dismissed the non-misuse Plaintiffs' claims. (Dkt. 142). On May 3, 2017, the Excellus Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. (Dkt. 156). Plaintiffs filed a reply in further support of their motion on May 17, 2017. (Dkt. 166). The parties have also submitted multiple letters identifying supplemental authority for their respective positions, each of which the Court has considered in rendering this decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 174; Dkt. 175; Dkt. 176; Dkt. 177; Dkt. 178; Dkt. 179; Dkt. 180).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard for Reconsideration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this motion for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b)(1) and (2).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 166 at 15-16). Although Plaintiffs cited\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   as a basis for reconsideration only for the first time in reply, Plaintiffs did so understandably: the Second Circuit issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   on May 2, 2017, just one day before Defendants filed their response to the motion for reconsideration (Dkt. 156) and approximately two weeks before Plaintiffs filed their reply brief (Dkt. 166). Since briefing on the motion for reconsideration concluded, the parties have submitted to the Court several letters identifying supplemental authority in support of their respective positions on reconsideration, all of which have been considered by the Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 174; Dkt. 175; Dkt. 176; Dkt. 177; Dkt. 178; Dkt. 179; Dkt. 180).

Defendants argue that \"\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable in that it is a payment card case,\" and that \"the court denied standing based on an alleged increased risk of identity theft in a case where the plaintiff, unlike the four non-misuse plaintiffs here, was able to actually allege that her own information had fraudulently been misused.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its prior Decision and Order, this Court observed that the Second Circuit had not weighed in on the issue of whether increased risk of identity theft is sufficient for standing in a data breach case but recognized that it was poised to do so in\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   , an appeal that was pending at that time.

That court pointed to\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   as evidence that the Second Circuit would join the Sixth Circuit, Seventh Circuit, and-more recently-the D.C.

The Court recognizes that the issue is unresolved, and reasonable jurists may disagree, as evidenced by the circuit split. Indeed, this Court initially concluded otherwise, and another panel of the Second Circuit squarely addressing the issue might take a different stance, as might the Supreme Court, should it choose to grant the pending petition for certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Attias.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, this Court finds\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   's implications compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When initially confronted with the Excellus Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion directed to the non-misuse Plaintiffs, this Court concluded that resolution of the motion was a close call. With no Second Circuit precedent on point, this Court determined that the non-misuse Plaintiffs' allegations of the threat of future identity theft did not cross the line to establish standing based on what this Court perceived to be the more persuasive reasoning of the other circuits to have addressed the issue. However, had the Second Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   before this Court issued its prior Decision and Order, this Court would have been compelled to resolve\n   the challenge to the non-misuse Plaintiffs' standing differently. Each of the non-misuse Plaintiffs alleged that his or her personal information-including \"names, dates of birth, social security numbers, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, member identification, financial information, credit card numbers, and medical claims information\"-had been \"compromised\" in the data breach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMC at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 17, 30, 33, 36). Moreover, Plaintiffs' allegations suggest that nefarious purposes motivated the cyberattack, given that hackers had been targeting healthcare companies and that the types of personal information stored on the Excellus networks are particularly valuable for committing identity theft and fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 130, 146-67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167(e) (\"All of these injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs and Class Members are a direct and proximate result of the Excellus data breach and include ... the imminent and certain impending injury flowing from fraud and identify theft posed by their PII and PHI being placed in the hands of unknown third parties.\") ).

(Dkt. 143 at 20; Dkt. 44 (\"Matarazzo Decl.\") at \u00b6 14; Dkt. 146 (\"Jones Aff.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). According to Jones, \"[t]he Deep Web is the portion of the internet that is not indexed by standard search engines\" (Jones Aff. at \u00b6 4), while \"[t]he Dark Web is a subset of the Deep Web, and consists of sites that are inaccessible to most users, often requiring specialized encryption software and other tools that mask the locations and identities of their users\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Jones further states that \"[t]he Deep and Dark Web are commonly used for criminal activity\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7) and \"the sale and purchase of PII and PHI compromised in a data breach\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to Jones, his investigation revealed that some non-misuse Plaintiffs' data is being sold on the Dark web. (Jones Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 16). Jones states, \"[s]earching the Deep and Dark Web Data Breach Data Base, leaked documents were found in which PII and PHI about Plaintiff Matthew Fero is exposed,\" that is, his chiropractic medical records. (Jones Aff. at \u00b6 12). Jones also states that the search revealed that Plaintiff Boomershine's email address and password account credentials, dated both October 2013 and June 2016, were on the Dark web, along with the email and password account credentials of six misuse Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(g) ). Moreover, Jones' second search revealed \"additional exposed PII data for fifteen of the twenty Plaintiffs and exposed documents for one other Plaintiff, which included PHI\"; among the exposed information was one plaintiff's social security number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel represents that, \"[o]n August 16, 2016, plaintiffs received a draft report with the results of high level Deep and Dark Web ... searches for named plaintiffs' PII and PHI.\" (Matarazzo Decl. \u00b6 15). At that time, the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss was still pending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 140 (issued February 22, 2017) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mandiant Intrusion Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs point to the Mandiant Intrusion Report (\"Mandiant Report\"), arguing that it shows that \"Plaintiffs' PII was targeted, collected and exfiltrated from Excellus's network by the attackers.\" (Dkt. 143 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-25). In advancing this argument, Plaintiffs rely on the analysis of John Jorgensen, the Chief Executive Officer of Sylint Group, a cybersecurity firm. (Dkt. 145 (\"Jorgensen Aff.\" at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2) ). Plaintiffs retained Jorgensen on October 14, 2015, to provide Plaintiffs with cybersecurity expertise in this matter. (Matarazzo Decl. \u00b6 16; Jorgensen Aff. at \u00b6 10). Jorgensen received the Mandiant Report on May 21, 2016, and discussed the Mandiant Report and its findings with Plaintiffs' counsel in July, August, and December 2016. (Jorgensen Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). Jorgensen's analysis of the Mandiant Report and discussion of the evidence that, in his view, indicates that the hackers exfiltrated PII and PHI for the purpose of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   committing identity theft, are set forth in an affidavit that is, in part, filed under seal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 163 (Sealed Jorgensen Aff.) ). Based on his experience in cybersecurity and his review of the evidence in the Mandiant Report, Jorgensen stated, \"it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that PII and PHI maintained on the Excellus network was targeted, collected, exfiltrated and put up for sale o[n] DarkNet by the attacker for the purpose of, among other things, allowing criminals to purchase the PII and PHI to commit identity theft.\" (Jorgensen Aff. at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Excellus Defendants argue that the evidence summarized above is not new,\n   and, therefore, insufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Court's Decision and Order. (Dkt. 156 at 25). According to Defendants, Plaintiffs adopted a \"wait-and-see approach,\" choosing not to disclose the evidence to the Court until after the Court issued its Decision and Order-even though (1) Plaintiffs retained Jones in July 2016; (2) Jones first reported his findings to Plaintiffs in August 2016; (3) Jorgensen received the Mandiant Report in May 2016; and (4) Plaintiffs' counsel met with Jorgensen about the Mandiant Report in July, August, and December 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants point out that all of those events occurred before the Court issued its Decision and Order, and most of them occurred before oral argument on the motion to dismiss on September 8, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In Defendants' view, Plaintiffs had knowledge of the evidence before argument on the motion to dismiss, and therefore, the evidence is not new.

The cited evidence does not meet that standard. By Plaintiffs' own account, the evidence was available during their briefing on the motion to dismiss, but they did not bring it to the Court's attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yi Xiang v.

However, the procedural question of whether Plaintiffs were required to bring the evidence to the Court's attention is different from whether the evidence was newly discovered for purposes of reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Setting aside the fact that the evidence is not newly discovered-which makes it a procedurally defective basis for reconsideration-the Court acknowledges that it certainly supports an argument that cyber attackers committed the data breach and stole Plaintiffs' information, including that of at least some of the non-misuse Plaintiffs, for nefarious reasons and to commit identity fraud. While not justifying reconsideration in and of itself, particularly because the information was known by Plaintiffs at the time of the argument before this Court on the motions to dismiss and should have been brought to the Court's attention at that time, the existence of this evidence reinforces the Court's conclusion that, based on the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   , reconsideration is warranted in order to avoid a manifest injustice. Had the Court had the benefit of all this additional information when it rendered the Decision and Order, it would have reached a different conclusion-and it does so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Remaining Arguments Based on a Need to Correct Clear Error of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Court's Decision and Order contained certain clear errors of law with respect to the dismissal of the four non-misuse Plaintiffs. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Court committed a clear error of law when it considered extra-pleading materials when resolving the Excellus Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 143 at 5). Plaintiffs also argue that the Court committed a clear error of law when it denied the non-misuse Plaintiffs the opportunity to replead to provide additional jurisdictional facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They argue that the Court, in its application of the test for standing set forth in\n   <em>\n    Khan v. Children's National Health System\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128070\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/188/524/#p531\">\n    188 F.Supp.3d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531 (D. Md. 2016), overlooked an element that confers standing on the non-misuse Plaintiffs, and that it should have found that Plaintiff Fero had an independent source of standing: his breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the Court has already concluded that reconsideration is warranted, it need not address Plaintiffs' remaining arguments\n   in support of reconsideration based on purported clear errors of law. However, the Court notes that, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it was error for the Court to consider the extra-pleading materials, those materials were not essential to the Court's conclusion that the non-misuse Plaintiffs did not have an injury in fact. Separate and apart from those materials, the Court's conclusion was based on the non-misuse Plaintiffs' failure to allege any misuse of their personal information, which undercut their assertion that the harm of future identity theft is certainly impending. The Court also found that the asserted harm was speculative because it relied on a chain of possibilities about the actions of independent actors. The purpose of citing to the extra-pleading materials-which state that it is unclear whether the hackers exfiltrated the data and therefore do not give a clear indication that the hackers breached the network in order to commit identity fraud-was merely to bolster the Court's conclusion that the harm was too speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the end, the Court's conclusion in the Decision and Order, and the Court's conclusion now, is a legal one: whether allegations of the threat of future harm based on misappropriation of personal identifying information such as those of the non-misuse Plaintiffs are sufficient for Article III standing. In its Decision and Order, this Court concluded that they were not-but now, with the\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   decision, this Court concludes that, at least at this stage of the proceedings, the non-misuse Plaintiffs' claims should be allowed to proceed. The Mandiant Report's findings cited in the initial Decision and Order, much like the additional information that Plaintiffs have now brought to light about the Dark web, simply reinforce this Court's conclusion-but in neither case are those factual matters dispositive. Until the Supreme Court or the Second Circuit definitively weighs in, in this Circuit at least, harm based on the theft of personally identifying information, such as a social security number or date of birth, as alleged in the CMC, is sufficient to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is granted (Dkt. 142), and, upon reconsideration, the Excellus Defendants' motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss the four non-misuse Plaintiffs (Fero, Church, Boomershine, and Caltagarone) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As explained in the Court's prior Decision and Order, \"Excellus Defendants\" refers to all defendants except for Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Plaintiffs also cite former Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7(d)(3), which addressed the procedure and time to file a motion for reconsideration: \"A motion for reconsideration or reargument, unless governed by Fed.
