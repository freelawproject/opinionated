BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 22, 2014, the jury in the instant case rendered its verdict, awarding $350,000 in actual damages and $87,500 in bad faith damages to Plaintiff Tamarin Lindenberg (\"Plaintiff\") and her children. (ECF No. 151.) The jury also awarded $3,000,000 in punitive damages. (ECF No. 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 18, 2014, during the jury trial in the instant case, Defendant Jackson National Life Insurance Company (\"Defendant\") moved for judgment as a matter of law. (Min. Entry, ECF No. 139.) Defendant filed a brief in support of its motion on January 5, 2015. (ECF No. 156.) Plaintiff responded in opposition on January 12, 2015. (ECF No. 159.) The Court denied the motion on November 24, 2015. (ECF No. 187.) In the order denying Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the Court deferred ruling on the amount of punitive damages to which Plaintiff is entitled because the constitutionality of the Tennessee statutory damages cap was an unresolved issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-29.) Also on November 24, 2015, the Court certified two questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Do the punitive damages caps in civil cases imposed by Tennessee Code Annotated Section 29-39-104 violate a plaintiff's right to a trial by jury, as guaranteed in Article I, section 6 of the Tennessee Constitution ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Do the punitive damages caps in civil cases imposed by Tennessee Code Annotated Section 29-39-104 represent an impermissible encroachment by the legislature on the powers vested exclusively in the judiciary, thereby violating the separation of powers provisions of the Tennessee Constitution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (ECF No. 188 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 23, 2016, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied certification. (ECF No. 200-1.) The Court held a telephonic status conference on July 1, 2016. (Min. Entry, ECF No. 202.) In the conference it was determined that Plaintiff, Defendant, and Intervenor State of Tennessee (\"the State\") would submit and rely on in the instant case their briefing before the Tennessee Supreme Court and the supporting amicus briefs. The Court would then resolve the remaining issues in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 203-208.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The mandate of the Tennessee Supreme Court issued on June 23, 2016 and was docketed in this Court on July 11, 2016.

Availability of Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court stated in its order declining certification that \"it would be imprudent for it to answer the certified questions concerning the constitutionality of the statutory caps on punitive damages in this case in which the question of the availability of those damages in the first instance has not been and cannot be answered by [it].\" (ECF No. 200-1 at 2.)

The court in\n   <em>\n    Riad\n   </em>\n   found that a plaintiff's damages were \"not statutorily limited to the recovery of the insured loss and the bad faith penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Riad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927757\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/436/256/\">\n    436 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   276 ). Further, this Court has previously determined that Plaintiff was both eligible for punitive damages (ECF No. 187 at 20-25) and entitled to punitive damages (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court must next determine the proper amount of punitive damages Plaintiff may recover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Tennessee Punitive Damages Cap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The jury awarded Plaintiff $3,000,000 in punitive damages. (ECF No. 152.) There exist, however, punitive damages caps in\n   Tennessee; section 29-39-104(a)(5) of the Tennessee Code provides that: \"Punitive or exemplary damages shall not exceed an amount equal to the greater of: (A) Two (2) times the total amount of compensatory damages awarded; or (B) Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tennessee punitive damages statute does not prevent a jury, such as the jury in the instant case, from awarding punitive damages greater than the statutory limit because the punitive damages caps cannot be disclosed to a jury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-39-104\">\n    Tenn.

Defendant argues that there has never been a constitutional right in Tennessee to a jury's punitive damages award such that the right to trial by jury would be infringed by the cap. (Def.'s Br. at PageID 4341, ECF No. 203-1.)

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Tennessee authority and authority from other states demonstrate that the Tennessee statutory punitive damages caps are valid. They do not inhibit a jury's fact-finding role, as guaranteed by the state constitution, nor do they inhibit the jury's ability to determine an appropriate amount of punitive damages in light of the facts of the given case. Rather, the statutory punitive damages caps, applied after any jury determination has concluded, are independent of the right to trial by jury in Tennessee. Further, there exists no right to any specific remedy, including punitive damages. Thus, the Court finds that the statutory punitive damages caps do not violate Plaintiff's right to trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Separation of Powers in the Tennessee Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The original Tennessee Constitution of 1796 gave the General Assembly what some thought to be outsized power, relative to the other branches, so a subsequent constitutional convention amended the framing document to include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an express provision dividing governmental powers across three branches, the text of which has since remained undisturbed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hargett,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 6, at 641;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

A separate section provides that: \"No person or persons belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except in\n   the cases herein directed or permitted.\" Tenn. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 ; Tenn. Const. of 1834, art. II, \u00a7 2 (amended 1870) (same).

The legislature does not adjudicate claims under section 29-39-104. The jury finds general liability in one proceeding, the propriety and level of punitive damages in another proceeding, and enters a separate verdict for each proceeding. In both proceedings, the court adjudicates by entering judgment, after making a determination regarding remittitur or judgment as a matter of law.
