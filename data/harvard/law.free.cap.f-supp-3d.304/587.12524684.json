Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This patent-infringement case involves braking and feedback technology for oil and gas drilling-control systems. Lowering pipe down an oil or gas drilling well puts pressure on the drill bit. Too much weight can damage the bit, costing time and money while it is repaired or replaced. To little weight results in slower drilling and less efficient production, both costly. To maximize efficiency and decrease costs, drillers need to put the \"just right\" weight on a drill bit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Auto-Dril's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C994%2C172\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,994,172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the '172 Patent) claims a system for more precise weight-on-bit measurement and control that achieves a better balance between\n   the goals of increasing drilling speed and reducing damage to drilling components. (Docket Entry No. 21-1). The '172 Patent attempts to solve the problem of finding the Goldilocks \"just right\" weight-on-bit. The '172 Patent claims sensors that produce electronic signals indicating the weight-on-bit. The signals are received by a computer-based drilling system, which transmits them to an electric motor. The motor either increases the amount of brake applied to the drill string, reducing the weight-on-bit, or reduces the amount of brake, increasing the weight-on-bit. The system auto-adjusts by comparing the actual bit weight with an operator-selected weight previously set in the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Auto-Dril alleges that National Oilwell Varco's \"e-Wildcat\" electronic autodrilling system and Canrig Drilling Technology's \"DrillSmart\" automatic drilling system infringes the '172 Patent. (Docket Entry Nos. 21, 45). The parties have asked the court to construe several disputed terms in the '172 Patent. Both parties filed opening claim-construction briefs, responses, and supplemental briefs. (Docket Entry Nos. 134, 135, 141, 142, 168, 171). The court held a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing on November 28, 2017, at which counsel argued their competing constructions. (Docket Entry Nos. 189, 188). Each party filed a posthearing brief. (Docket Entry Nos. 194, 195). The parties have also submitted multiple summary judgment filings on indefiniteness. Auto-Dril filed three motions for partial summary judgment on indefiniteness, the defendants responded, and Auto-Dril replied. (Docket Entry Nos. 175, 176, 179, 180, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the parties' claim-construction and summary judgment motions and briefs, counsels' arguments, the record, and the applicable law, the court construes the disputed claims as set out in detail below.

Auto-Dril alleges that National Oilwell and Canrig infringed the '172 Patent by \"making, using, selling, offering for sale, and/or importing in or into the United States, without\n   authority, products that fall within the scope of one or more claims of the '172 Patent,\" including National Oilwell's \"e-Wildcat\" electronic autodrilling system and Canrig's \"DrillSmart\" automatic drilling system. Auto-Dril alleges that National Oilwell has known of the '172 Patent since at least 2010 and that Canrig has known of the Patent or has been \"willfully blind\" to its existence. Despite this knowledge, Auto-Dril alleges that the defendants have actively promoted sales of their infringing products to, and use by, third parties. Auto-Dril alleges that these third parties have used the defendants' technology to directly infringe one or more claims of the '172 Patent and that the defendants have sold automatic drilling-control system components and accessories to third parties that have been used with other components to assemble an apparatus that falls within and infringes the '172 Patent claims. (Docket Entry No. 21 at 2-4; Case 4:16-cv-293, Docket Entry No. 1 at 2-4). Auto-Dril also asserts claims for fraud and breach of contract against National Oilwell. (Docket Entry No. 21 at 9-11. Against both defendants, Auto-Dril seeks damages and an injunction prohibiting future direct infringement, inducement of infringement, and contributory infringement of the '172 Patent.

(Docket Entry Nos. 1, 21). Auto-Dril also filed separate infringement complaints against Canrig and Pason Systems USA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Nos. 4:16-cv-287, 4:16-cv-293. National Oilwell moved to transfer venue to the Eastern District of Texas; that motion was denied. (Docket Entry Nos. 12, 29). Auto-Dril moved to dismiss National Oilwell's affirmative defense of release, its breach-of-contract counterclaim, and its request for sanctions; that motion was denied. (Docket Entry Nos. 19, 48). Auto-Dril then moved to consolidate the three cases for pretrial purposes; that motion was granted. (Docket Entry Nos. 23, 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The consolidated case was stayed while National Oilwell petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the Federal Circuit, seeking a transfer of venue. (Docket Entry Nos. 46, 51). The Federal Circuit denied the petition and a petition for rehearing en banc. (Docket Entry Nos. 52, 59). After the stay was lifted, National Oilwell moved again to transfer venue, and its motion was granted. (Docket Entry Nos. 70, 71, 77, 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In February 2016, the consolidated case was transferred to the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, and assigned to this court. (Docket Entry Nos. 89, 91). The parties jointly moved to dismiss Pason, (Docket Entry Nos. 105, 106), leaving National Oilwell and Canrig as the defendants. National Oilwell unsuccessfully moved for a partial summary judgment as to noninfringement. (Docket Entry No. 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties then filed claim-construction briefs, responses, and replies. (Docket Entry Nos. 134, 135, 141, 142, 168, 171). The defendants' motions to strike parts of one of Auto-Dril's expert's declaration and one of its expert's report were denied. (Docket Entry Nos. 143, 167, 164, 174). Auto-Dril filed three motions for partial summary judgment on indefiniteness, the defendants responded, and Auto-Dril replied. (Docket Entry Nos. 175, 176, 179, 180, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing was held on November 28, 2017.

The parties must identify each item of extrinsic evidence by production number or produce a copy of any such item not previously produced. With respect to each fact or expert witness a party intends to rely on for claim construction, the party must also provide a brief description of the substance of that witness's proposed testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Rules of Practice for Patent Cases in the Southern District of Texas (effective Jan. 1, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The defendants argue that Auto-Dril \"was required to produce\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   extrinsic evidence it planned to rely on for claim construction purposes\" when it produced its preliminary proposed constructions in the August 2016 exchange. (Docket Entry Nos. 180 at 16; 182 at 12; 183 at 10 (emphasis added) ). But Rule 4-2 does not require that parties exchange, in the preliminary claim-construction stages, all extrinsic evidence that they will rely upon. The rule requires a \"preliminary identification\" of extrinsic evidence. The defendants' interpretation of Rule 4-2 would limit the parties to the extrinsic evidence available when the parties exchanged their preliminary proposed constructions. Under that approach, Auto-Dril could use only the extrinsic evidence it produced on August 15, 2016, more than 15 months before the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing and well before discovery ended. Auto-Dril's reliance on Porche's declaration in the\n   <em>\n    Pason inter partes\n   </em>\n   review does not violate Rule 4-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The defendants argue that Auto-Dril \"further failed to mention it was relying on [Porche's\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration] in its: (1) opening claim construction brief filed on December 12, 2016 ..., and (2) its responsive claim construction brief filed on January 6, 2017 ....\" (Docket Entry Nos. 180 at 16; 182 at 12; 183 at 10-11). The defendants argue that the declaration should be excluded because \"Auto-Dril only informed\n   defendants that it planned to rely on this declaration through its supplemental claim construction brief filed on September 5, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). This argument is also unpersuasive. Porche adopted his\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration as his testimony in this case when he was deposed on May 23, 2017, and the defendants' counsel did not object. (Docket Entry No. 175-3 at 6). Auto-Dril could not have informed the defendants that it would rely on the declaration in its opening or responsive claim construction briefs, which were filed months before Porche was deposed in this case and adopted the\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration as his testimony in this case. Auto-Dril's supplemental claim-construction brief, (Docket Entry No. 171), was the first claim-construction brief that Auto-Dril filed after Porche's deposition. Auto-Dril's disclosure of its reliance on Porche's\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration was not late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The defendants also argue that Porche's\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration is inadmissible hearsay. (Docket Entry Nos. 180 at 17, 183 at 11). A statement is not hearsay if it \"is offered against an opposing party and ... is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true.\" FED. R.

Porche adopted his\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration after he was retained as an expert for one of the defendants in this case. As noted, the defendants did not object when Porche adopted the\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration as his testimony in this case, and the defendants had a full opportunity to examine Porche on the declaration during his deposition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   FED.

(Docket Entry Nos. 180 at 18; 182 at 13; 183 at 12). Porche's\n   <em>\n    Pason\n   </em>\n   declaration is relevant under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

If the current weight on bit is less than the set point then the PLC will ramp up its digital output signal. This digital output signal will range from an output value of 0 to 4095.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   (Column 5, lines 25-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Auto-Dril also cites the parts of Columns 6 and 7 that describe how the \"PLC 70 continuously compares the desired WOB to the extrapolated WOB and adjusts the RPM of motor 82,\" Column 6, lines 6-7, and how \"[t]he precise management of RPM of electric motor 82, and with it, all the desired parameters described above, is achieved by certain functionalities which are products of the software or firmware by which PLC 70 operates,\" (Column 6, lines 20-23). These parts of the specification provide lengthy examples of how the programmable logic controller reacts to the change in actual bit weight:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   The principle operation of the PLC 70's software or firmware is summarized as follows: The program works on X range of weight variance from the setpoint representing the maximum PLC output. For example let us say that at one point in time, the PLC has the range set to 10 which represents 10,000 lbs of variance below the setpoint. If 30,000 lbs is the\n   desired WOB, then 4095 output would be attained at 20,000 lbs WOB. One should never actually reach 4095 in output during normal drilling, because the system would correct for such a variance before reaching that point ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   The PLC is constantly monitoring the relationship between WOB and WOB setpoint. PLC 70 can be set to make adjustments to the range up or down according to that relationship every 0.3 seconds. Returning to our example: suppose the drill bit encounters slightly softer formation and the earth drills away faster causing a loss of WOB. Now, in order to maintain the desired WOB, one needs to drill faster (increase the ROP).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   By repeatedly comparing setpoint WOB to actual WOB, the PCL [sic] 70 will detect this change of circumstance. Let us use a 150 lbs. as a detected variance from setpoint after the softer strata is encountered. PLC 70 will then subtract 300 lbs (as an example, depending on programming) from the above mentioned range of 0-10,000 lb variance range. Now 4095 of output would theoretically happen at 9,700 lbs away from the setpoint, rather than the earlier 10,000 lbs. With the reduction of the overall range, the output at approximately 500 lbs. away may now average 850 in PLC output, resulting in average hz. output of the VFD being 20 hz. This results in more gearbox speed and therefore more ROP. The PLC will continue to decrease the overall range and a reduction in hertz output per lb. away from the setpoint. In this format the WOB will float slightly above and below the setpoint maintaining that constant drilling or \"peel\" but at the same time keep the variance from set point with 500 lbs. to either side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   (Column 6, lines 28-38, 51-Column 7, line 11). The specification states that \"[p]rogramming to achieve the above results are well within the skills of a competent programmer upon reference to this disclosure, and actual code examples or routines are not required for present purposes.\" (Column 7, lines 12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The specification continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   One additional aspect of the PLC logic deserves mention: If one considers the above basic premises, one would suspect that when WOB is at zero variance form the WOB setpoint the PLC output would be zero, and the electric motor 82 and the attached gearbox 89 would, therefore, be stopped and then spin up as the WOB fell below the setpoint....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   Because there should be a certain amount of gearbox rotation to move the brake handle to any degree, one should maintain some degree of output or \"lead\" in the range so that the right gearbox rpm can be attained with minimal variance from the setpoint. In other words, if PLC 70 has determined from the example above that a 9,700 lbs variance range is required to provide the needed hertz and rpm for the given conditions, PLC 70 may shift 2000 lb. of that range above the setpoint and leave the remaining 5700 lb. below the setpoint. That way, one attains the desired 850 PLC output and 20 htz. output to achieve the necessary rpm basically at the set point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   (Column 7, lines 16-21, 25-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Auto-Dril also cites testimony of Porche, Miller, and Stewart.

Auto-Dril argues that the term \"signal input means\" refers to an \"analog-to-digital converter unit\" and its equivalents. (Docket Entry No. 176 at 26). Auto-Dril asserts that an analog-to-digital converter is a \"special-purpose device designed and produced specifically to perform the claimed function,\" and not a general purpose computer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Auto-Dril relies on Miller's expert report, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   [I]t is my opinion that [signal input means] would typically be understood in the industry to be what is called an \"Analog to Digital Converter unit[.\"] This type of unit takes an analog signal and produces a digital representation of said signal available for computer processing. [Programmable logic controllers] will typically have \"modules\" or \"cards\" of various functionality. These cards can be input or output or a mix of either. These cards can also be analog or digital or either. Analog to Digital Converter \"modules\" or \"cards\" were available off-the-shelf in 2002. These off-the-shelf cards provided: (a) the digitization of analog data; and (b) the storage of the representative result into memory for processing without special programming. These were once again an off-the-shelf part, a sub-component, which provided a general purpose operation without the need for special programming. These units could digitize a voltage signal, a current loop signal or other types of analog signals. Now that these non-algorithm requiring claim elements have been addressed, I will continue with an analysis of those claim elements that, in my opinion, require, and are more than adequately supported by an algorithm in the '172 patent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 168-1 at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Auto-Dril does not cite the testimony of Stewart, its other retained expert.
