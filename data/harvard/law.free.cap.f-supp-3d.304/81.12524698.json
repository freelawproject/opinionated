INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from two Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests to the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). Dylan Tokar, a reporter for the publication\n   <em>\n    Just Anti-Corruption\n   </em>\n   , which covers investigations and prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), sought records regarding the selection of corporate compliance monitors for fifteen corporations that had resolved their FCPA cases through deferred prosecution agreements (\"DPA\"). Following discussions with a DOJ attorney, during which Mr. Tokar was warned that DOJ would likely attempt to withhold documents responsive to his first FOIA requests under several FOIA exemptions, Mr. Tokar narrowed his request in an attempt to speed up the production process. Four months after Mr. Tokar narrowed his request, DOJ informed Mr. Tokar that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.8\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), DOJ would need to send notifications to the fifteen corporations identified in his FOIA request in order to give them an opportunity to object to DOJ's proposed disclosures. Following the dispatch of these \"submitter notification\" letters, Mr. Tokar submitted a second FOIA request seeking the disclosure of any objection letters the fifteen corporations submitted in response to the notifications. After months without a production in response to either FOIA request, Mr. Tokar filed this suit. DOJ's ultimate responses to Mr. Tokar's FOIA requests-a table with the information he sought through his first request, and copies of the letters he sought through his second-contained multiple redactions. DOJ moved for summary judgment following these releases, and Mr. Tokar cross-moved for summary judgment, challenging the majority of DOJ's redactions. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that each of DOJ's redactions under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) were improper, but that its redaction pursuant to Exemption 4, which Mr. Tokar did not challenge, was permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Journalist Dylan Tokar, of the trade publication\n   <em>\n    Just Anti-Corruption\n   </em>\n   , has\n   filed two FOIA requests seeking records and information related to DOJ's selection process for corporate compliance monitors in FCPA cases. Corporate compliance monitors are hired at the expense of a company under DOJ scrutiny and are typically responsible for \"(1) investigating the extent of wrongdoing already detected and reported to the government; (2) discovering the cause of the corporation's compliance failure; and (3) analyzing the corporation's business needs against the appropriate legal and regulatory requirements.\" Veronica Root,\n   <em>\n    The Monitor-\"Client\" Relationship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%20523\">\n    100 Va. L. Rev. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531 (2014). Following public controversy regarding the selection of monitors, DOJ launched an inquiry into its monitor selection process and issued the \"Morford Memorandum,\" which formally established principles for monitor selection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. L. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. &amp; Supp. Pl.'s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") at 5, ECF No. 10-1. According to Mr. Tokar, the memorandum \"lays out several mechanisms to achieve the goals of independence and avoidance of conflict-of-interest, including the creation of a 'standing or\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   committee' within DOJ and a reminder to those involved in the selection process that they must comply with DOJ conflict-of-interest regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted). \"More specifically, the Morford Memorandum calls for the selection of monitors through the use of a candidate pool 'of at least three qualified monitor candidates' whenever possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a reporter focused on FCPA enforcement, Mr. Tokar is interested in obtaining records from DOJ that he claims \"would shed light on [corporate compliance monitor selection], including whether DOJ [is] abiding by the principles for monitor selection set forth in the Morford Memorandum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Accordingly, he submitted a FOIA request on April 24, 2015 seeking \"copies of records relating to the review and selection of independent corporate monitors under Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) settlement agreements between the Justice Department and [fifteen specific]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   corporate defendants,\" including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1.

The information should identify which candidate, if any, the company specified as its first choice to serve as monitor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. All Monitor Selection Memoranda, including any files, documents and attachments therein, submitted for review to the Standing Committee on the Selection of Monitors ...[specifically] information about which monitors were approved or disapproved and the reasons therefore, including the recommendations submitted by the committee, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3.

During the summer of 2015, Mr. Tokar spoke on the phone several times with DOJ attorney Peter Sprung, who warned Mr. Tokar that he believed that several FOIA exemptions would be asserted as to the documents he had requested, and therefore that several of those documents would be withheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"Pl.'s SMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 23-27, ECF No. 10-2. Based on these conversations, Mr. Tokar grew worried that he would not be given documents responsive to his first FOIA request unless he narrowed its scope. Decl. Dylan Tokar (\"Tokar Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, ECF No. 10-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Therefore, Mr. Tokar and his editor, Mary Jacoby, agreed to \"narrow [the] request\" to the following for the fifteen corporate defendants named in the original FOIA request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The names of the up to three monitor candidates and their associated law or consulting firms submitted to the [d]epartment by the defendant corporations under the terms of their negotiated resolutions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. The names and titles of members of the Criminal Division's Standing Committee on the Selection of Monitors for the period Jan. 1, 2009 up through the present date.

[and] the names of any temporary designees appointed to the committee and the dates of their service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Compl., Ex. 2, ECF No. 1-2. Even after narrowing the scope of his request, however, Mr. Tokar did not receive a speedy response. In the fall of 2015, Mr. Tokar and Ms. Jacoby reached out to DOJ on two occasions, reminding them that they had still not received a response to Mr. Tokar's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 31-32; Tokar Decl. \u00b6 17. Then, in December 2015, Mr. Sprung informed Mr. Tokar that DOJ would be notifying the fifteen companies of Mr. Tokar's FOIA request and would give the companies a chance to object to the release of the requested information, pursuant to Executive Order 12,600 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.8\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tokar Decl. \u00b6 18. Ultimately, fourteen companies leveled some sort of objection to the release of the information in Mr. Tokar's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tokar Decl. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 12, 2016, Mr. Tokar submitted a second FOIA request to DOJ seeking \"copies of [the]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.8\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) statements submitted by companies in connection with [the] previous FOIA request.\" Compl., Ex. 7, ECF No. 1-7. Eight months later, Mr. Tokar still had not received responses to either FOIA request, and therefore, on December 9, 2016, he filed suit in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Six weeks after Mr. Tokar filed his complaint, DOJ provided him with what it considered to be a response to his first FOIA request: a table containing the information listed in Mr. Tokar's narrowed FOIA request, with certain information-the names of the monitor candidates who were nominated but not selected, the firms these candidates worked for if those firms were small, and the names of two members of the DOJ Standing Committee-redacted pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 (\"personnel and medical files and similar files\") and 7(C) (\"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"Def.'s SMF\") \u00b6 8, ECF No. 9;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6), (7)(C). DOJ had to issue amended versions of this table twice after Mr. Tokar identified errors within it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 46-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the summer of 2017, DOJ provided Mr. Tokar with copies of the response letters that he had sought in his second FOIA request, with certain information withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 4 (\"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\"), 6, and 7(C), though the agency ultimately concluded that Exemption 7(C) did not apply to these letters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Peter C. Sprung (\"Sprung Decl.\") \u00b6 23, ECF No. 9-2. DOJ not only again withheld the names of the monitor candidates who had not been selected, but it also withheld the names of the private attorneys who had responded to the notices on behalf of their corporate clients and the name of two DOJ employees who dealt with the submitter notice process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sprung Decl. \u00b6 30.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   DOJ has moved for summary judgment regarding its responses to Mr. Tokar's FOIA requests. DOJ first claims that Mr. Tokar's first request, as narrowed, was a request for information, rather than documents, and therefore that the agency's response to that narrowed request (a table) was an act of agency grace because DOJ was not \"obligated to conduct a search for responsive documents in the ordinary sense.\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mem.\") at 3, ECF No. 9. It further argues that not only has it demonstrated that its search in response to the request was adequate, but also that its redactions to the table under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) were lawful. Additionally, DOJ argues that it has sufficiently shown that its redactions to the response letters under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 6 were permissible. Mr. Tokar counters that his narrowed FOIA request was a request for documents, not information, and now requests that DOJ turn over the documents that it used to make its table. Additionally, he claims that DOJ's redactions to the documents released in response to his first and second requests pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) were impermissible. However, he does not object to DOJ's single redaction pursuant to Exemption 4. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Mr. Tokar's narrowed request should have been interpreted as a request for documents, not simply information, given that his original request was a similarly worded request for both documents and information. It further finds that DOJ's redactions pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) were impermissible, but affirms DOJ's decision to redact several paragraphs of text pursuant to Exemption 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Narrowing of the First FOIA Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case presents an uncommon situation, in which a request for a wide array of documents was narrowed to a request for the disclosure for certain information, rather than specific, identified documents-information that the requester would have had access to if he had received the documents he had initially sought through the request that the defendant agency had encouraged him to narrow. Therefore, in adjudicating these motions for summary judgment, the Court must first determine the legal effect of the narrowing of Mr. Tokar's first FOIA request. DOJ claims that the language in the email in question \"narrowed [Mr. Tokar's] request in a manner that no longer sought the release of the actual documents identified in the original request, but instead sought only certain information with regard to the 15 FCPA matters identified in his original request.\" Def.'s SMF \u00b6 3. DOJ therefore claims that Mr. Tokar's narrowing was not a legitimate FOIA request, because FOIA requests must seek documents, not simply information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 3. It backs up this claim with a follow-up email Mr. Tokar sent five months after the narrowing of his request, in which he reiterated that he had narrowed his request so that he was \"merely asking for (1) [t]he names and law firm affiliations of the three monitor candidates put forth by each company on our list [and] (2) [t]he names and titles of members of the Standing Committee on the Selection of Monitors, including their dates of service and any temporary designees.\" Def.'s SMF \u00b6 5 (citing Compl., Ex. 6, ECF No. 1-6) (alternations in original). DOJ claims that \"because Plaintiff's narrowed request did not seek underlying documents\n   but instead certain information, DOJ reasonably responded to the FOIA request by creating a table that contained the requested information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Mr. Tokar responds that his request was a proper FOIA request seeking documents, as evidenced by the fact that his narrowed request was an alteration of a clearly permissible FOIA request that had sought documents, as well as the fact that DOJ categorized his narrowed request as a FOIA request with a unique FOIA request case number. Additionally, Mr. Tokar believes that the Court should credit his good faith attempt to narrow his FOIA request and imply from the narrowing of his request that he was seeking records that reflected a narrower scope of information than that in his original request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 12-14, ECF No. 10-1.

For example, Mr. Tokar requested \"[a]ll documents submitted by counsel for the companies at the\n   outset of each monitor selection process, including the names of up to three qualified candidates whom the companies are allowed to recommend.\" Compl., Ex. 1. The goal of this request was clear: Mr. Tokar wanted all of the documents submitted by counsel at the outset of the selection process, and wanted to emphasize that he was especially interested in obtaining documents that indicated which individuals each company nominated to serve as monitors. The two other types of documents he sought in his original request also included this linguistic mix of document and information request.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3605559\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/684/29/#p33\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Tokar's narrowed request asked for some of the exact same information he had asked for in his original request, but without the specification that the information be released in specific records. However, taking both requests together, it can be reasonably inferred that Mr. Tokar sought the same sort of documents in his narrowed request, and was simply informing DOJ that he no longer sought documents from the fifteen companies' attorneys or the standing committee that reflected other information not identified in the narrowed request. And indeed, given that the agency was already on notice of what Mr. Tokar was seeking from his previous request, DOJ, construing the narrowed request liberally, should have reasonably interpreted that Mr. Tokar was now seeking \"documents submitted by counsel for the companies that indicated the names of up to three monitor candidates and their associate law firm consulting firms\" and \"records of the standing committee that indicate the names and titles of its members from January 1, 2009 to August 11, 2015, their dates of service, and the names of any temporary designees to the committee and their dates of service,\" and was simply informing DOJ that he no longer sought documents from the fifteen companies' attorneys or the standing committee that reflected other information. If DOJ could not reasonably interpret from Mr. Tokar's narrowed request what types of records or information he was seeking, it had a duty to confer with Mr. Tokar to clear up any confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.3\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In order to save the agency some time and provide Mr. Tokar the requested information in a more user-friendly format, the agency certainly could have reached an agreement with Mr. Tokar regarding his acceptance of a chart in lieu of the requested documents. But the record does not reflect that such an agreement was reached and the agency cannot unilaterally reinterpret the request in this fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that DOJ is required to search for and release to Mr. Tokar records submitted by the fifteen companies' attorneys that reflect \"[t]he names of [ ] up to three monitor candidates and their associated law or consulting firms submitted to the [d]epartment by the defendant corporation under the terms of their negotiated resolutions,\" and standing committee records that reflect \"[t]he names and titles of members of the Criminal Division's Standing Committee on the Selection of Monitors for the period Jan. 1, 2009 up through the present date,\" as well as those members' \"dates of service ...

Indeed, in response to his second FOIA request, DOJ was able to locate and produce each of the fifteen documents he requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sprung Decl. \u00b6 23. However, he does indirectly challenge the adequacy of the search for records that DOJ used to compile its table in response to his first request by pointing out that \"Defendant has\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   revised [the table] to correct errors, and Plaintiff has no way of knowing whether Defendant's now-third version of its table is accurate.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 2 (emphasis in original). Mr. Tokar now insists that he is entitled to copies of the actual documents responsive to his first FOIA request, and as this Court has explained, the agency is required to produce them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because DOJ has not yet produced to Mr. Tokar the documents responsive to his first FOIA request, the Court cannot yet determine the adequacy of its search. However, DOJ's description of the way it searched for documents that allowed it to create the table it released to Mr. Tokar appears to be a promising start. DOJ has explained its process of searching for records with information responsive to Mr. Tokar's first FOIA request as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) we consulted with individuals in the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division who had knowledge of the subject matter of the request; (2) we identified the custodians of records involving DOJ's review and selection of the monitors in the 15 FCPA matters in question; (3) we determined that there was no single document that listed the information Plaintiff was requesting; (4) upon devising appropriate search parameters, we searched the custodians' email accounts and obtained certain other relevant electronic and paper files; (5) we queried a correspondence tracking system maintained by the Office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division (\"AAG\"); and (6) having obtained the necessary records and loaded the electronic records into a text searchable database, we reviewed the records and extracted the information necessary to prepare the table.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Sprung Decl. \u00b6 9. Replicating this process should bring DOJ well on its way to adequately searching for responsive records and adequately responding to Mr. Tokar's FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Redactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   DOJ has redacted certain information contained in the table and response letters it released to Mr. Tokar under FOIA Exemptions 4, 6, and 7(C). From its response to Mr. Tokar's first FOIA request-a\n   table which contained \"the date the Deputy Attorney General ('DAG') approved the selection of the monitor candidate or other available information when the date of the DAG's approval was unknown, the names of the Standing Committee members, the name of any professional services firm with whom [ ] the nominee was associated, and the name of the appointed monitor,\" Sprung Decl. \u00b6 10 (internal footnotes omitted)-DOJ redacted, pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), \"the names of monitor selection committee members who are not part of DOJ's senior management\" and \"the names and related personal identifying information concerning the individuals nominated but not selected to be monitors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. From its response to Mr. Tokar's second FOIA request-copies of the letters responding to DOJ's submitter notices-DOJ redacted, pursuant to Exemption 4, several paragraphs of text describing certain internal steps one of the companies, Daimler AG, took to evaluate and enhance its FCPA compliance programs, as well as the names of the nominees who were not selected to be monitors, the names of private attorneys who responded to the submitter notices, and the names of two DOJ employees who either received the responses or handled the FCPA cases, all pursuant to Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28, 30. Mr. Tokar does not challenge the redaction under Exemption 4,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but does challenge the redactions under Exemptions 6 and 7(C). For the following reasons, the Court finds that the redacted portions of the table and letters were not properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), and therefore must be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Unselected Candidates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DOJ originally redacted from the table it supplied to Mr. Tokar in response to his\n   first FOIA request \"the names of monitor selection committee members who are not part of DOJ's senior management\" and \"the names and related personal identifying information concerning the individuals nominated but not selected to be monitors.\" Sprung Decl. \u00b6 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also redacted the names of the unselected nominees when those names appeared in a company's response letter to its submitter notice.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Ex.

In the case of the table, DOJ claims that these names were properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) because the records the names were extracted from were \"compiled for law enforcement purposes\" and their release would constitute an invasion of those individuals' privacy.

In the case of the response letters, it originally supported its redactions by citing to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), but has since conceded that 7(C) is not applicable to these letters, as they were not compiled for a law enforcement purpose. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DOJ has since released the names of every individual on the monitor selection committee to Mr. Tokar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply, Suppl. Sprung Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 13-2; Def.'s Reply, Suppl. Sprung Decl., Ex. A, ECF No. 13-2. Therefore, the Court need only determine whether DOJ's decision to withhold from the table and the letters the names of the individuals nominated but not selected to be monitors, as well as their firms when those firms are small, was permissible under either Exemption 6 or 7(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 6. DOJ argues that releasing the names of these individuals, or the release of information that would allow the public to identify them, would be an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" Def.'s Mem. at 6. Mr. Tokar argues in response that \"DOJ has failed to show that these individuals have any privacy interest, let alone a substantial one, that would outweigh the significant public interest in this information.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 16. The Court concludes that while DOJ has demonstrated that these individuals have more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   privacy interest in their anonymity, the\n   public interest in learning these individuals' identities outweighs that privacy interest, and therefore, the individuals' names and firms must be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under Exemption 6, an agency may withhold \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). \"Similar files\" has a \"broad, rather than narrow meaning,\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State v.

Courts in this district have reached different conclusions regarding the magnitude of the privacy interest lower-level government employees have in complete anonymity. For example, to support his contention that the names of the two DOJ employees should be released, Mr. Tokar cites to\n   <em>\n    Leadership Conference on Civil Rights v.

Finding that \"there can be little doubt that these individuals have a 'substantial' privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of their names,\" and finding that the release of these names would bring the plaintiffs no closer to discovering \"what the government is up to\" in any meaningful sense, the court determined that it \"need not linger over the balance\" of the individual privacy interests at stake against the public interest in disclosure, because \"[i]n the end, 'something, even a modest privacy interest, outweighs nothing every time.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In this case, Mr. Tokar has proffered no explanation of how the release of these attorneys' names will allow him to better understand the monitor selection process. As such, the Court must determine whether the attorneys at issue hold \"even a modest privacy interest\" in their anonymity that would warrant the continued withholding of their names. It is difficult to see how they do. The names of government attorneys involved in FCPA and FOIA matters are released in public court filings on a daily basis. Indeed, in this case, one of the names withheld belongs to a DOJ Trial Attorney, who, just like Mr. Sprung, the DOJ's public declarant in this case, must include their name, email address, and phone number on the docket of every case in which they file an appearance. There is no allegation that these attorneys have any particular interest in having their names remain anonymous, apart from the fact that they do not hold any leadership role within the Department of Justice.
