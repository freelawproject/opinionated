For the reasons discussed more fully below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Frontier's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Kerry Fugate (\"Fugate\"), began working for Frontier's predecessor company in 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 42 at 2.) Beginning in 2008, Fugate began to suffer serious health problems resulting in, on at least one occasion, Fugate requesting and receiving leave under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"). (ECF No. 43 at 1.) Fugate also had several unexcused absences during this time period that resulted in Frontier disciplining Fugate on multiple occasions. (ECF No. 42 at 2 (citing ECF No. 41-1 at 96-97 (Fugate Dep.) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Frontier had a step system for disciplining its employees for absences. (ECF No. 43 at 1.) Each time an employee had two unexcused absences, that employee would receive a \"Step\", an adverse employment action that would be removed from the employee's record after six months if the employee did not have additional unexcused absences during that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An employee would be eligible for termination after reaching Step 5. (ECF No. 43 at 1-2.) However, employees would not necessarily move up the Steps in order. (ECF No. 42 at 6 n.3.) For example, if an employee was on Step 1 and had an unexcused absence exceeding three days within six months of the previous incident that placed the employee on Step 1, that employee would move directly to a Step 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in 2011, Fugate had several unexcused absences that caused him to oscillate between Step 3 and Step 4. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42 at 8-9.) Fugate had requested FMLA prior to taking some of these absences, but his requests were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) On January 2, 2014, Fugate was placed on Step 4 for being absent on December 2, 3, 4, and 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41-15 (Employee Contact Mem.).) Fugate had requested FMLA leave for December 2, 3, and 4, but his request was denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42 at 10.) Thus, his absence during this time period was classified as unexcused. Fugate then oscillated between Step 3 and Step 4 due to tardiness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) On December 3, 2014, Frontier placed Fugate on Step 4 for tardiness and informed Fugate that if he had another\n   unexcused absence he could be advanced to Step 5 and thus become eligible for termination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41-17 (Employee Contact Mem.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 2, 2015, Fugate left work early to tend to his sick daughter. (ECF No. 42 at 2.) He did not inform a supervisor or seek FMLA leave for this absence. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) This unexcused absence resulted in him being raised to a Step 5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) As a result, Frontier terminated Fugate's employment on January 14, 2015, citing as the cause Fugate's excessive absences after having been warned that further absences would result in disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fugate, however, argues that he did not know he could not use an \"exempt day\" for this absence under a plan his union created.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fugate filed the present action against Frontier on January 12, 2017, invoking the Court's federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fugate subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on March 16, 2017. (ECF No. 17.) The Amended Complaint alleges the following six counts: retaliatory discharge in contravention of a substantial public policy of the State of West Virginia (count one); interference with FMLA rights and FMLA retaliation (counts two and three); disability discrimination under the West Virginia Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-11-1\">\n    W.

(count four); negligent infliction of emotional distress (\"NIED\") (count five); and outrage (count six).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 24, 2017, Frontier moved this court to dismiss counts one, four, five, and six of the Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 22.) By memorandum opinion and order issued on July 19, 2017, the Court granted Frontier's partial motion to dismiss and dismissed counts one, four, five, and six of the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31.) The case proceeded on Fugate's remaining FMLA interference and retaliation claims. (ECF No. 42 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 12, 2017, Frontier filed the present motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 41.) Fugate filed a timely response, (ECF No. 43), and Frontier filed a timely reply. (ECF No. 44.) As such, Frontier's motion for summary judgment is fully briefed and ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs motions for summary judgment. That rule provides, in relevant part, that summary judgment should be granted if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" Summary judgment is inappropriate, however, if there exist factual issues that reasonably may be resolved in favor of either party.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Frontier argues that Fugate's FMLA interference and retaliation claims were filed outside of the statute of limitations provided in the FMLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Specifically, Frontier argues that the statute of limitations began to run when Frontier last denied Fugate's request for FMLA leave in December of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Fugate, however, contends that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until Frontier terminated him in January of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The FMLA makes it unlawful for employers to \"interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202651\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Plaintiff alleged that her employer improperly denied leave on three occasions which led to the classification of her absences as unauthorized and resulted in her suspension on two separate occasions and the eventual termination of her employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n    at 895, 896-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In analyzing whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, the Seventh Circuit held that, \"[w]hen an FMLA plaintiff alleges that his employer violated the Act by denying qualifying leave, the last event constituting the claim ordinarily will be the employer's rejection of the employee's request for leave.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n    at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Seventh Circuit found that allowing the plaintiff to wait until she was terminated to file her action \"would hold the limitations period in abeyance indefinitely and revive a stale denial-of-leave claim years later.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347566\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/893/#p894\">\n    at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Similarly, here, Frontier had a system of progressive discipline for repeated unexcused absences.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I. Furthermore, similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , Fugate alleges that, had Frontier properly approved his absences, he would not have received additional Steps and been terminated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 at \u00b6 51.) In essence, Fugate's claim is one for denial of leave. Fugate was last denied FMLA leave in December of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41-1 at 105 (Fugate Dep.).) It was not until over a year later that Frontier terminated Fugate's employment due to Fugate's tardiness and unexcused absences unassociated with his previous requests for FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I. Thus, under the facts of this case, the last event for the purpose of determining the statute of limitations was the last denial of leave and not Fugate's ultimate termination. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , to hold otherwise would allow FMLA claims stemming from wrongful denial of leave where the employer has a progressive absenteeism policy to be brought years after the last denial of leave when the employee is terminated, regardless of whether the denial of leave precipitated the termination. This is particularly salient in the present case considering Fugate's termination occurred over a year after the last alleged FMLA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fugate relies on\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   and two unpublished district court opinions from Maryland and South Carolina to argue that the Court should adopt the view that the last event under the FMLA's statute of limitations was Fugate's termination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 6-8.) However, the district court opinions do not analyze or mention the statute of limitations; they simply state that termination is an event for which an interference claim can be brought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edusei v. Adventist HealthCare Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-cv-0157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203345051\">\n    2014 WL 3345051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Md. July 7, 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Applegate v. Kiawah Dev. Partners, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:12-cv-738,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203206928\">\n    2013 WL 3206928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D.S.C. June 24, 2013). Additionally, although\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   cites to the FMLA's statute of limitations, unlike\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , it does not provide an analysis of it and simply finds that the last adverse action against the plaintiff was her termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753119\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/314/#p317\">\n    199 F.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court does not find the authority cited by Fugate persuasive on the issue presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Having found that the statute of limitations began to run when Frontier last denied Fugate's request for FMLA leave, which took place between December 5, 2013 and January 2, 2014, Fugate's Complaint must have been filed, at the latest, by January 2, 2016. However, Fugate filed this action on January 13, 2017, outside of the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Fugate's action is barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Frontier's motion for summary judgment insofar as it asserts that Fugate's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. As this resolves the case, the Court finds it unnecessary to address the rest of the arguments in Frontier's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the reasons discussed more fully above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Frontier's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 41.) A separate Judgment Order will be entered reflecting the Court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Also pending in this case are Frontier's motions in limine. (ECF Nos. 47-50.) As this memorandum opinion and order resolves the case, these motions are\n    <strong>\n     DENIED AS MOOT\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In 2010, Frontier acquired Verizon's landline business and thus Fugate became an employee of Frontier.
