For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this case, as supported by the evidence taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiff Frederick Morhardt, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 3, 2015, Morhardt and his significant other, Theresa Leibig, were passengers aboard Carnival's cruise ship, the Dream. [D.E. 36-1 at 34, 40]. Upon exiting the shower, Morhardt attempted to use the hair dryer in his stateroom for the first time. [D.E. 36-1 at 40, 41]. Immediately after turning on the hair dryer, which he held in his right hand, Morhardt was electrocuted. [D.E. 36-1 at 40-41]. The electric shock radiated through his \"whole body\" causing him to jerk backwards. [D.E. 36-1 at 40-43; D.E. 50 at 2]. Because the hair dryer was hard wired into the ship with a short cord, this jerking motion caused the hair dryer to be pulled out of his hand. [D.E. 36-1 at 40-41, 43]. Morhardt's hand was burned and blackened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [D.E. 36-1 at 42; D.E. 50 at 2]. The incident lasted approximately two seconds. [D.E. 36-1 at 43]. Within a few minutes, Morhardt went to the ship's infirmary to be examined. [D.E. 50 at 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Morhardt filed the subject Complaint alleging a single-count of negligence against Carnival. [D.E. 1]. Discovery commenced on January 12, 2017 [D.E. 12]. Morhardt, however, failed to comply with both the initial expert and rebuttal expert disclosure deadlines set forth in this Court's Scheduling Order [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 12]. His motions to extend those deadlines were denied for untimeliness and lack of good cause, respectively [D.E. 26, 35]. Morhardt's subsequent request to extend the discovery period and to belatedly disclose his treating physicians as experts was also denied for lack of good cause and untimeliness [D.E. 54]. As a result, Morhardt currently has no experts in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 16, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment. During the hearing, Morhardt's counsel stated that the only record evidence available for the Court to consider in deciding the subject Motion is as follows: (1) the deposition of Plaintiff Frederick Morhardt [D.E. 36-1]; (2) the deposition of Carnival's 30(b)(6) representative, Monica Petisco [D.E. 36-3]; (3) Plaintiff Frederick Morhardt's Responses to Defendant's Initial Interrogatories [D.E. 36-2]; and (4) Defendant's Answers to Plaintiff's Initial Interrogatories [D.E. 41-3].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morhardt's counsel also confirmed that Morhardt is claiming only the following injuries: (1) back pain; (2) lower back pain with radiating pain into Morhardt's legs; (3) loss of grip strength and weakness in Morhardt's right (master) hand; (4) vision problems; and (5) a scar on Morhardt's left leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Carnival moves for summary judgment asserting that Morhardt has failed to establish essential elements of his negligence claim. [D.E. 36]. Specifically, Carnival argues that Morhardt cannot prove that Carnival breached a duty owed to him because there is no evidence that Carnival had notice of the allegedly dangerous condition. [D.E. 36 at 5-6]. Carnival also contends that\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ipsa\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    loquitur\n   </em>\n   inference does not apply because Morhardt is unable to establish the requisite elements. [D.E. 56 at 8-9]. Carnival further argues that Morhardt cannot establish that Carnival's alleged breach was the proximate cause for his injuries because Morhardt failed to properly disclose an expert who can testify as to medical causation. [D.E. 36 at 6-8, D.E. 56 at 9-12] Finally, Carnival submits that without expert testimony Morhardt is also unable to prove damages. [D.E. 36 at 8, D.E. 56 at 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his opposition, Morhardt relies on an array of theories under Florida premises liability law-including negligent mode of operation and the duty owed to business invitees-to argue that he is not required to prove notice. [D.E. 49 at 3-16, 23-31]. Morhardt also avers that notice is not required if Carnival created the defective condition that caused the incident or if there is evidence of negligent maintenance. [D.E. 49 at 25-28]. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court has already determined that maritime law governs this action. Therefore, Morhardt's claims must be based on maritime law, not premises liability law or any other theory of negligence under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipkin v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334533\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/93/1311/#p1319\">\n    93 F.Supp.3d 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319 (S.D.

Importantly, the Eleventh Circuit's recent opinion in\n   <em>\n    Pizzino\n   </em>\n   , squarely rejects any exception to the notice requirement.
