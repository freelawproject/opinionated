Jabari himself pleads facts in his Complaint which defeat a reemployment claim. Further pleading or discovery will not alter Jbari's concession that he was reemployed before he was terminated, and therefore the court will grant Defendant's motion to dismiss Jbari's Section 4312 USERRA reemployment claim with prejudice. To the extent Jbari uncovers evidence that MPD planned to terminate him after his return, his Section 4311 claim for discrimination and retaliation provides the basis for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In\n   <em>\n    Townsend,\n   </em>\n   the Court rejected individual liability claims under USERRA Section 4323:\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   USERRA expressly creates only two private causes of action: (1) an action brought by an individual against a State (as an employer)...; and (2) an action brought against a private employer...\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204323\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Despite the plain text of the statute, Townsend argues that USERRA also creates a cause of action against the supervisors, because the Act defines \"employer\" to include \"\n   <em>\n    a person\n   </em>\n   , institution, organization, or other entity to whom the employer has delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(A)(i) (emphasis added), and the supervisors are persons. The USERRA cause of action, however, arises against \"a State (as an employer).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4323(a)(2).

Although the cause of action can be brought against a \"State (as an employer),\" \"as an employer\" describes the capacity in which the State can be sued; it does not create a cause of action against individual state employees even if they exercise supervisory responsibility. Thus, an action under USERRA is available only against the State \"as an employer,\" and not in some other capacity.... Thus, Townsend's attempt to sue individual supervisors under the cause of action which the Act provides against a \"State (as an employer)\" fails. Nor are the individual state supervisors \"private employers.\" While the supervisors may fit under the definition of \"employer,\" we agree with the district court that it would do violence to the language of the statute to consider a state employee-supervisor a \"private employer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825165\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/478/#p486\">\n    543 F.3d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486 (9th Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rimando\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=356%20Fed.%20Appx.%20989\">\n    356 Fed.
