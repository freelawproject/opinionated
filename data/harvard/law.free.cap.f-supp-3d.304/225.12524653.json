(<em>See</em> United States' Mot. to Dismiss the Pet'r's Second <em>Pro Se</em> Pet. for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (ECF No. 10 (\"U.S. Mot.\"), Ex. 1 at 1.) On December 6, 2011, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, petitioner was sentenced to a 48-month term of imprisonment followed by a five-year term of supervised release. (<em>Id.</em> , Ex. 1 at 3.) Petitioner began his term of supervised release on May 12, 2014, and the term was to end on May 11, 2019.

Chutkan, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"226\" href=\"#p226\" id=\"p226\">*226</a>This matter is before the Court on petitioner Jimmie McNair's petition for a writ of habeas corpus (ECF No. 1) and the United States' Motion to Dismiss the Petitioner's Second <em>Pro Se</em> Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (ECF No. 10.) For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES the petition and GRANTS the United States' motion to dismiss.</p><p id=\"p-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p><p id=\"p-11\">The United States Parole Commission (\"Commission\") charged petitioner with seven violations of the terms of his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (<em>See id.</em> , Ex. 3 (Warrant Application) at 1-2.) It issued a warrant for petitioner's arrest on August 5, 2015. (<em>See id.</em> , Ex. 3 (Warrant).) The warrant was executed on October 7, 2016, (<em>id.</em> , Ex. 4,) days after Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested petitioner for distribution of and possession of a controlled substance, (<em>id.</em> , Ex. 5.) The Commission <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"227\" href=\"#p227\" id=\"p227\">*227</a>charged petitioner with an additional violation to reflect this arrest. (<em>Id.</em> , Ex. 6.)</p><p id=\"p-12\">Petitioner's probable cause hearing took place on October 14, 2016, (<em>id.</em> , Ex. 7 at 1,) after which a hearing examiner found probable cause to believe that petitioner committed seven of the eight violations, (<em>see id.</em> , Ex. 7 at 2-6.) Petitioner remained in custody pending a revocation hearing, which took place on November 30, 2016. (<em>Id.</em> , Ex. 7 at 8; <em>see id.</em> , Ex. 8 at 1.) Although petitioner had been represented by counsel at the probable cause hearing, (<em>see id.</em> , Ex. 7 at 1,) he waived counsel for the revocation hearing, (<em>see id.</em> , Ex. 8 at 1, 4.)</p><p id=\"p-13\">The hearing examiner found that petitioner had committed seven of the eight violations charged, (<em>see id.</em> , Ex. 8 at 2-4,) and made no finding with respect to the law violation, (<em>id.</em> , Ex. 8 at 4.) He recommended revocation of supervised release and a new 22-month term of incarceration, followed by a 38-month term of supervised release. (<em>See id.</em> , Ex. 8 at 5.) The Commission concurred with the recommendation to revoke supervised release, and it ordered petitioner to serve a 26-month term of incarceration without additional supervision. (<em>Id.</em> , Ex. 9 at 1.) The National Appeals Board affirmed the Commission's decision. (<em>Id.</em> , Ex. 10 at 1.)</p><p id=\"p-15\">\"A supervised releasee who is retaken and held in custody in the District of Columbia on a warrant issued by the Commission, and who has not been convicted of a new crime, shall be given a probable cause hearing by an examiner of the Commission no later than five days from the date of such retaking.\" <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.214\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.214</extracted-citation>(a). The Court construes the petition as one raising a due process claim arising from the Commission's failure to conduct a timely probable cause hearing. The timeliness of the probable cause hearing is the same issue petitioner presented in a prior habeas action in this Court. <em>See</em> <em>McNair v. U.S. Parole Comm'n</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273694\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/253/280/\">253 F.Supp.3d 280</extracted-citation> (D.D.C. 2017), <em>appeal dismissed</em> , No. 17-5153, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20App.%20LEXIS%2024657\">2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 24657</extracted-citation>, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 6, 2017). Here, as in the prior action, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be denied. Ordinarily, a petitioner could seek relief by requesting a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission's compliance with the applicable regulations. <em>See</em> <em>Sutherland v. McCall</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643196,11332911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/709/730/\">709 F.2d 730</extracted-citation>, 732 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \"Now that [p]etitioner has had both a probable cause hearing and a revocation hearing, he is not entitled to mandamus relief.\" <em>McNair</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273694\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/253/280/\">253 F.Supp.3d at </extracted-citation>282 (citing <em>Colts v. U.S. Parole Comm'n</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3123986\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/531/8/#p11\">531 F.Supp.2d 8</extracted-citation>, 11 (D.D.C. 2008) ).</p><p id=\"p-17\">The petitioner has had a probable cause hearing and a supervision revocation hearing, and his claim is now moot. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus, therefore, is denied. An Order is issued separately.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
