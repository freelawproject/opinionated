In his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he matriculated as a medical student at the John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of Hawaii at Manoa, in July 2005. ECF No. 36 \u00b6 9. Shortly after July 2005, Plaintiff began to experience episodes of anxiety, depression, and inabilities to sleep or focus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Beginning in 2007, Plaintiff was under psychiatric care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was placed on academic probation on January 24, 2009, with the requirement that Plaintiff take a medical licencing exam by the end of May 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. On July 1, 2009, Plaintiff requested a hearing before the Student Standing and Promotion Committee to request an extension of time to take the medical licencing exam to accommodate the episodes of anxiety that he was experiencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The Student Standing and Promotion Committee directed Plaintiff to take the exam by the end of July 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Plaintiff took the medical licencing exam on July 27, 2009, and did not pass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27. Plaintiff's failure on the exam caused a major depressive episode as diagnosed by his treating psychiatrist pursuant to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) criteria for Major Depressive Episode.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2009, Dr. Mary Ann Antonelli, Director of the Office of Student Affairs at the medical school, asked Plaintiff to appear before the Student Standing and Promotion Committee to evaluate his academic progress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. In response, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Antonelli about his depression and disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Dr. Antonelli did not refer Plaintiff to the office for students with disabilities, but accommodated Plaintiff by twice postponing Plaintiff's appearance before the committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff appeared before the Student Standing and Promotion Committee on February 10, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.

Plaintiff then experienced another episode of depression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. In April 2010, Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist advised Plaintiff to take a medical leave of absence from school and not to take the medical licencing exam by the April 28, 2010 deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist wrote a letter to the medical school on June 7, 2010, stating that she recommended a 4-6 month leave of absence to accommodate Plaintiff's depression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Dr. Antonelli approved Plaintiff's medical leave of absence on June 23, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.

In the following months, Plaintiff's episode of depression started to resolve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. By November 2010, Plaintiff's ability to study was not substantially limited anymore, and subsequently he resumed his review for the exam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 1, 2010, the new Director of the Office of Student Affairs at the medical school, Dr. Richard Smerz, ordered Plaintiff to attend a meeting before the Student Standing and Promotion Committee to evaluate his academic progress on January 12, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Plaintiff met with Dr. Smerz on January 5, 2011, and informed him of his medical disabilities, including depression and recently diagnosed hypothyroidism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Plaintiff's episodic depression and hypothyroidism had begun to respond to treatment by January 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 57. Plaintiff asked Dr. Smerz to continue Plaintiff's medical leave to allow time for his treatment to become fully effective, which Dr. Smerz refused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 58. Dr. Smerz encouraged Plaintiff to withdraw from medical school or face almost certain expulsion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Dr. Smerz also told Plaintiff that he needed to learn to cope with his problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Dr. Smerz did not recommend or contact the office for students with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist also contacted Dr. Smerz to ask that Plaintiff be given continuing accommodation to allow time for his treatment to become fully effective, which Dr. Smerz refused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Student Standing and Promotion Committee met on January 12, 2011, to review Plaintiff's case and voted unanimously to dismiss Plaintiff from the medical school for academic malperformance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the committee's decision on January 24, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist submitted a letter regarding Plaintiff's depression and hypothyroidism stating that these conditions \"affected his energy, motivation, concentration and cognitive clarity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. Plaintiff's appeal was dismissed on February 18, 2011, concluding that there were no grounds for a formal hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 1, 2011, Plaintiff appealed the decision to Dr. Jerris Hedges, Office of the Dean of Medicine, asking permission to re-take the licencing exam as an accommodation for his depression and hypothyroidism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-93. Plaintiff met with Dr. Hedges regarding his appeal on April 6, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. Plaintiff received a letter from Dr. Hedges on April 7, 2011, upholding the decision to dismiss Plaintiff from the medical school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December 2011, Plaintiff filed discrimination complaints against Dr. Hedges and Dr. Smerz with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122. A fact-finding report prepared by an investigation team regarding Plaintiff's complaints was submitted to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Students on May 21, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123. As part of that investigation, the\n   team interviewed the Director of the University of Hawaii's Kokua Program, which is the office for students with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124, 44. On June 20, 2012, Reed Dasenbrock, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, issued his decision finding no discrimination by Dr. Hedges and Dr. Smerz.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 21, 2012, Plaintiff appealed the decision finding no discrimination by Dr. Hedges and Dr. Smerz to Vassilis Syrmos, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, acting as the Chancellor's designee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149. Plaintiff's appeal regarding the decision finding no discrimination by Dr. Hedges and Dr. Smerz was denied on September 11, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action four years later on September 11, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1.
