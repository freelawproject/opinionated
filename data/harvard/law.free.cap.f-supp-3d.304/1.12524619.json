ECF No. 49 (Mem. Op.) at 1-7. On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13,780 (\"Executive Order\"), which imposed, in section 2(c), a 90-day suspension on entry into the United States for nationals of six countries-Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n   <em>\n    Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\n   </em>\n   , Exec.

On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay in part of the injunctions \"with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605175\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2080/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the Executive Order and the Supreme Court's stay, the State Department issued a cable advising consular officers to refuse diversity visas to applicants who were not exempt from the Executive Order's suspension of entry provision and who did not qualify for a waiver. ECF No. 2-2 (State Department Cable) at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 3, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Mandamus and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, as well as a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, in which they argued that the State Department's cable unlawfully applied President Trump's Executive Order to diversity immigrant visa applicants for fiscal year 2017 (\"FY 2017\"). In the operative complaint, Plaintiffs allege that: (1) the State Department's practice of requiring diversity visa applicants to provide documentation evidencing a bona fide relationship with the United States was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; and that (2) in applying the policy, consular officers violated their clear, non-discretionary duty to issue diversity visas to applicants who are statutorily eligible. Am. Compl. at 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs asked the court to issue an order: (1) enjoining the State Department from implementing the policy set forth in its cable; and (2) requiring consular officers to process Plaintiffs' applications pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. ECF No. 2 (Injunction Mot.) at 10. Plaintiffs subsequently sought additional relief, requesting that this court order the State Department to: (1) process the diversity visas of, and/or issue diversity visas to, eligible applicants who had previously been refused pursuant to the Executive Order under the program for FY 2017, even in excess of the statutory cap and/or past the statutory deadline; or (2) issue diversity visas to eligible 2017 applicants who had been refused pursuant to the Executive Order under the program for fiscal year 2018. ECF No. 43 at 3-4. Alternatively, Plaintiffs asked the court to order the State Department to \"reserve any unused visa numbers until after the [Supreme Court's decision]\" regarding the legality of the Executive Order. ECF No. 45 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 29, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and emergency mandamus relief. ECF No. 50 (Order, Sept. 29, 2017); Mem. Op. at 17. After reviewing the Fourth and Ninth Circuits' decisions in\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the Supreme Court's June 26 decision permitting the Executive Order's execution with respect to individuals without a bona fide relationship with the United States applied not only to entry into the U.S., but to visa issuance as well. Mem. Op. at 8-11. Given the Supreme Court's June 26 decision and the Court's continuing jurisdiction to consider the legality\n   of the Executive Order-including with respect to visa issuance-the court found that it was precluded from finding the State Department's policy illegal and from ordering the State Department to process and issue visas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605175\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2080/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court did invoke its mandamus jurisdiction to grant Plaintiffs' alternative relief, and ordered the Defendants to: (1) report, by October 15, the number of visa numbers returned unused for FY 2017; and (2) hold those visa numbers to process Plaintiffs' visa applications in the event the Supreme Court found the Executive Order to be unlawful. Order, Sept. 29, 2017; Mem. Op. at 15. On October 15, 2017, the State Department complied with part of the court's order, reporting that 27,241 diversity visa numbers were returned unused and that 49,976 diversity visas were issued for FY 2017. ECF No. 52 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Five days earlier, on October 10, 2017, the Supreme Court found that because section 2(c) of the Executive Order expired by its own terms on September 24, 2017, the appeal in\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   no longer presented a live case or controversy.\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

If the court were to now order the State Department to use the unused visa numbers to process Plaintiffs' visa applications, it would be requiring the State Department to fulfill its obligations under a prior order-the September 29 Order. Under that Order, the State Department was required to not merely reserve the unused visa numbers, but to do so for a specific purpose: the future processing of Plaintiffs' visa applications. As in\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   , the court issued an order directing the State Department to act prior to the September 30 deadline, and if it were to require the State Department's full compliance with its prior order, it would be within its \"inherent power to enforce prior orders\" to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants argue that the prior orders in\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   directed the State Department to\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   visas, whereas this court's order directed the State Department to reserve visa numbers for\n   <em>\n    future processing.\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 12, 14. This difference is immaterial for two reasons. First, the\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   courts did not limit their holdings to situations in which a court's prior order specifically compels the\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   processing of visa applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the difference in wording between this court's September 29 Order and the orders in\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   is attributable, at least in part, to the unique posture of this case on September 29, 2017. On that date, this court was precluded from ordering the State Department to immediately process Plaintiffs' visa applications because the legality of the Executive Order-the ultimate source of Plaintiffs' injuries-was pending before the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 8-11. As in\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs sought relief before the September 30 deadline. But unlike in\n   <em>\n    Paunescu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Przhebelskaya\n   </em>\n   , this court was permitted to order-at most-only the possible future processing of Plaintiffs' visa applications. None of the cases on which Defendants rely suggest that the court is prohibited from ordering and later enforcing the future processing of diversity visas after the statutory deadline in such a situation. Indeed, some of the cases suggest the opposite is true.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coraggioso v.

ECF No. 54 (Opp.) at 19. Plaintiffs further argue that \"even though [the Executive Order] has expired, Defendants' justification for their actions, based on [the Executive Order] persists,\" and therefore their \"claims cannot possibly be moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court's decision to express no view on the challenges to the Executive Order does not moot this case, but instead \"clears the way for this litigation to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The court finds all three arguments unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although Plaintiffs do not challenge the Executive Order directly, their claims challenge a State Department policy that was promulgated pursuant to the Executive Order. If, as the Supreme Court has found, section 2(c)'s expiration moots challenges to the Executive Order, it necessarily follows that challenges to a State Department's policy promulgated pursuant to that section of the Executive Order are moot as well. Defendants' continuing assertion that the State Department's policy was a lawful implementation of the Executive Order does not save Plaintiffs' claims. It is likely that the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   also maintain that the Executive Order was a lawful exercise of the President's power.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court acknowledges the enormous statistical odds Plaintiffs faced and overcame in being chosen to interview and apply for a diversity visa in FY 2017. Millions of individuals enter the diversity visa lottery every year, hoping to have the chance to enter the United States. The fact that Plaintiffs-merely by virtue of their citizenship-are unable to take full advantage of this rare opportunity is unfortunate. Nevertheless, even the most unfortunate of circumstances do not permit this court to rule on the merits of claims for which there is no longer a meaningful remedy available. For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A corresponding order will issue separately.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Defendants expound on their argument that the court lacks authority to override the September 30 deadline on visa issuance, noting that \"[p]rinciples of equity do not override\" section 1154 's statutory deadline. Mot. at 10. Defendants' reliance on this general proposition is contradicted by their failure to specifically argue that the courts in\n    <em>\n     Paunescu\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Przhebelskaya\n    </em>\n    improperly ordered the adjudication of visa applications after the statutory deadline. Instead, Defendants merely \"take issue with the holdings in those cases,\" ECF No. 56 (Reply) at 3, suggest that \"aspects\" of the two cases may have been wrongly decided, Reply at 7 n.4, and argue that a court can override the statutory deadline only when a court orders the adjudication of visas prior to the deadline. Mot. at 14. In the court's view, in so arguing, Defendants concede that under certain circumstances, equity permits a court to order the processing of visas after September 30.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The court's decision is further supported by Plaintiffs' inability to demonstrate a bona fide relationship with the United States.
