On November 10, 2011, plaintiff discovered water entering his residence during a rainstorm and, two days later, he submitted a claim to Safeco for the water damage. What happens next is not completely clear. In their briefs the parties skip to July of 2012. However, it appears from the allegations in the petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Safeco came out soon after the damage was sustained, prepared an estimate for repairs (for less than $2000) but never issued payment, and took the position that the damage was largely caused by faulty construction not covered by the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc.

She wrote that while the insureds had attempted to work with Safeco to resolve the claims \"there ha[d] been no response from your company\" and in the interim the insureds had \"incurred extraordinary out-of-pocket expenses for covered occurrences under their Homeowners' Policy.\" Doc. # 24-3, p. 1. Ms. Gau then asked for the adjuster's name and contact information in order to \"attempt to facilitate a resolution to these claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744018\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/1086/#p1090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rodney McAtee, a property loss specialist with Safeco, responded on August 7, 2012.

Doc. # 26-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over the next few months the parties exchanged emails and, on October 4, 2012, Mr. McAtee asked for additional information \"so we can re-assess the damages to the home.\" Doc. 26-3.

She informed him the parties were going to participate in a mediation on December 5, 2012 and also wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   It is my understanding that SafeCo has notified Mid-Continent Insurance of a subrogation claim relating to the above referenced claim number. As you are aware, SafeCo Insurance HAS NOT PAID OUT any monies relating to the above claim number, or any claims relating to the water damage sustained by the Insured. SafeCo Insurance also sent the Insured a notice of subrogation for any recovery in the arbitration. This is egregious. The Insured is out of pocket a significant amount of money to repair damage caused by the intrusion of water into his home. The Insured has also incurred attorney fees and costs associated with its attempt to recover from MAC Builders, LLC and obtain payment from SafeCo for its covered claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As you are aware, any monies that SafeCo Insurance pays out to the Insured will be the subject of subrogation in any recovery obtained from MAC Builders, LLC. Safeco Insurance would also be responsible for payment of the Zewdies' attorney fees and costs associated with such recovery. Because SafeCo Insurance has refused to act in good faith in the resolution of the Insured's claim and has refused to pay any monies on the Insured's behalf, SafeCo is not in a position to assert a subrogation claim in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If Safeco Insurance desires to participate in the above referenced mediation, please let me know. However, for Safeco to participate in the mediation at this juncture would be disingenuous based on the fact that it has not made any payments to the Insured for his covered claims. Further, it should be clear that the invitation to Safeco to participate in the mediation does not waive any of the Insured's legal rights to recover for claims against SafeCo Insurance based upon their refusal to act in good faith and deal fairly with the Insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Doc. # 24-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a letter sent to Mr. McAtee a couple of weeks later, dated November 16, 2012, Ms. Gau confirmed the December 5, 2012, mediation. She stated that if Safeco elected to attend the mediation it \"should send a representative with full authority to settle\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the lnsured's claims against Safeco,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Insured's claim for the extensive water damage to the Insured's home, as well as the Insured's claim against Safeco for its failure to deal fairly and in good faith with the Insured.\" Doc. # 24-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 29, 2012, Michael Woodson introduced himself by letter to Ms. Gau as counsel retained by Safeco \"to assist in bringing Mr. and Mrs. Zewdie's homeowners insurance claims to an agreeable resolution.\" Doc. # 26-8. He references a meeting scheduled for November 30, 2012, at which \"we can discuss the claims that have been made, the damages incurred, and the status of any repairs or reconstruction.\" Doc. # 26-8. Mr. Woodson also confirmed that he would be attending the mediation scheduled for December 5, 2012, and stated that he hoped they could \"utilize the mediation to work toward the resolution of some, if not all, of the outstanding issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744018\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/1086/#p1090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 7, 2012, two days after the mediation, Mr. Woodson sent Ms. Gau a letter stating that \"[a]s indicated at the mediation, Safeco is tendering an additional payment regarding the Zewdie's flooring in the amount of $25,334.30.\" Doc. # 26-9. And he said he \"would also like the opportunity to visit with you about a convenient time to schedule an additional inspection of the home to address the current condition of the interior and any additional covered damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744018\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/1086/#p1090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Safeco issued the check to plaintiff on December 17, 2012, and conducted an additional inspection of plaintiff's home in early January 2013. Doc. Nos. 26-10; 26-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 16, 2013, Ms. Gau sent Mr. Woodson documents pertaining to the costs the Zewdies incurred to repair and reconstruct the front and rear balconies of their home due to water damage. Mr. Woodson then sent her a supplemental estimate which had been prepared after a January supplement inspection and informed Ms. Gau that Safeco would \"issue payment for the amount reflected in the estimate (which is at RCV with no depreciation).\" Doc. # 26-13. On February 6, 2013, Mr. Woodson sent Ms. Gau an additional check in the amount of $6,319.69, \"representing the amount referenced in SafeCo's recent estimate generated following the supplemental inspection.\" Doc. # 26-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A couple of weeks later, in a letter dated February 27, 2013, Ms. Gau wrote Mr. Woodson, noting his plan to \"participate in the mediation of the matter\n   <em>\n    Zewdie v. MAC Builders, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\" and Safeco's intent to \"have a representative available by telephone if necessary to discuss settlement of certain outstanding coverage claims by the insureds.\" Doc. # 27-2, p. 1. Ms. Gau informed Mr. Woodson that the Zewdies were \"out of pocket approximately $150,000.00 due to SafeCo's failure to process and handle their claims,\" and that it was their position, \"based upon the negligent and/or willful failure of SafeCo to deal\n   fairly and in good faith with the Zewdies, that SafeCo has waived any right to seek subrogation for any future payments of covered losses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Safeco participated in the mediation the next day and on March 12, 2013, it issued an additional payment of $10,000 to plaintiff. In the letter he sent Ms. Gau explaining the payment, Mr. Woodson stated he had \"received Safeco's response to [her] request to waive subrogation as to any payments made under the Zewdie's homeowners policy.\" Doc. # 26-16. He said Safeco not only had \"agreed to waive its contractual right of subrogation as to the payments it ha[d] made to date under the Zewdie's homeowners policy,\" but it would also \"issue an additional payment of the $10,000.00 limit under the additional coverage endorsement for mold, decay and rot\" and would \"waiv[e] subrogation as to this additional payment as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He further explained that it was Safeco's position that plaintiff was \"free to resolve claims with MAC Builders and its subcontractors without regard to any Safeco's right of subrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The next communication between the parties occurred on June 17, 2013. Ms. Gau sent Mr. Woodson an email on that date letting him know that the insured had reached an agreement with MAC Builders, LLC and several subcontractors. She states: \"[a]fter the Global Settlement Agreement is executed by all the parties, we can discuss concluding the outstanding claims the Zewdies have with Safeco.\" Doc. # 27-1. The agreement she referenced-a \"Final Settlement Agreement and Release in Full of All Claims\"-was signed by the Zewdies, MAC Builders, LLC, Safeco and other construction companies and insurers on October 18, 2013. Doc. # 26-18. While it provides for the payment of monies by other entities and the Zewdies release their claims against those entities, it does not include similar provisions pertaining to Safeco. Only two provisions of the agreement affect Safeco. In one, Safeco waives its right of subrogation against the other contractors/insurers \"arising out of any damages allegedly sustained to the Home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13. The other provides: \"\n   <strong>\n    It is Further Agreed\n   </strong>\n   that this Settlement Agreement shall not foreclose the Zewdies from claims for certain damages sought under their homeowners' insurance policy with SafeCo Insurance Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The next interaction between plaintiff and defendant consists of a \"\n   <strong>\n    FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY\n   </strong>\n   letter dated December 12, 2013, which Ms. Gau sent Mr. Woodson. Doc. # 26-19, p. 1. She states the letter is to \"serve to follow up on the outstanding coverage claims relating to the Zewdies' Homeowners Policy.\" Ms. Gau asserts that the water damage to the Zewdie's front and rear balcony structures fell within the coverage of the policy. She then makes a settlement offer which includes an amount for remaining claims related to water damage, the amount the Zewdies expended in attorney's fees and arbitration and mediation costs to recover their damages from MAC Builders and Safeco, and an amount for Safeco's claimed failure to deal fairly and in good faith with the Zewdies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Woodson rejected the settlement demand by letter dated December 30, 2013. He explained that plaintiff's loss was denied because Safeco believed the damage was caused by faulty construction. While the policy did provide limited coverage for certain damages resulting from faulty construction, Mr. Woodson stated that Safeco had already paid the $10,000.00 policy limit under its additional coverage for damages caused by wet rot. He stated that Safeco was not responsible for plaintiff's arbitration fees or its legal expenses and, as Safeco had been reasonable in\n   adjusting plaintiff's claims, it had not breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. He closed the letter with \"As always, if you wish to discuss, please give me a call.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action in state court on March 3, 2015. Defendant now seeks summary judgment on the ground plaintiff's breach of contract and bad faith claims are barred by the applicable two year limitations periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Safeco contends both plaintiff's claims are untimely. It asserts plaintiff's breach of contract claim is barred by the two year contractual limitations period because plaintiff failed to file suit by November 10, 2013, within two years of the loss or damage. It contends plaintiff's bad faith claim is barred by Oklahoma's two year limitations period applicable to torts because plaintiff failed to file suit no later than November 16, 2013, two years after the claim accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to his contract claim, plaintiff responds that the limitations clause in the insurance policy is invalid. If the clause is enforceable, plaintiff argues the limitations period should be equitably tolled because of defendant's conduct of continuing to investigate plaintiff's claim from its submission until the insurer denied coverage on December 30, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that his bad faith claim is timely because it did not accrue until December 30, 2013, and this action was filed less than two years later. If it accrued before then, plaintiff contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because of the insurance carrier's alleged continued assurances that it was Safeco's \"goal to resolve the Plaintiff's claims.\" Doc. # 26, p. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The insurance policy includes the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Suit Against Us.\n   </strong>\n   No action shall be brought against us unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within two years after the inception of the loss or damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Doc. # 24-1, p. 3.

Certain property belonging to the insured plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   was damaged in a fire. The adjustor retained by the insurer to establish the extent of the loss hired several experts to assess the property damage, but they did not complete their investigation until the limitations period was almost over. They determined the property did not sustain any appreciable damage, but that information was not communicated to the insured until the limitations period had expired. The plaintiff sued and the insurer defended on the ground the lawsuit was filed after the contractual limitations period had ended. The Oklahoma Supreme Court concluded that under these circumstances the defendant had waived the limitations period by not denying liability within enough time to permit the plaintiff to bring suit within the policy's limitations period. The court stated that the waiver was \"for a\n   <em>\n    reasonable time\n   </em>\n   \" after the denial of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla/194/394/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 273 Syllabus \u00b6 1 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A similar conclusion was reached in\n   <em>\n    Agric.

Admittedly, defendant did for a time, after it had initially either refused coverage or ignored plaintiff's claim, engage in conduct which could have led plaintiff to believe his claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   might be paid. Safeco requested information in October 2012, so it could \"re-assess the damages to the home\" and in December 2012, two weeks after its counsel participated in a mediation, Safeco paid plaintiff approximately $25,000. In January 2013 it had the home reinspected to address additional covered damages and it issued another check in early February. Then, in March 2013, Safeco waived its subrogation rights as to any payments it had made under the homeowners policy and made another $10,000 payment to plaintiff. After that, though, plaintiff has not offered any evidence which creates a fact question as to whether defendant, by its conduct, lead plaintiff to believe his loss would be further adjusted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The last direct communication in the record between the parties before the contractual limitations period expired on November 10, 2013, was an email dated June 17, 2013, from plaintiff's counsel to defense counsel. Ms. Gau advised Mr. Woodson that plaintiff had reached an agreement with MAC Builders, LLC and several contractors and that, after a Global Settlement Agreement was executed by all parties, they could \"discuss concluding the outstanding claims the Zewdies [had] with Safeco.\" Doc. # 27-1. Plaintiff has not shown that Safeco responded to the email, much less indicated its willingness to pay or even to discuss any outstanding claims. Plaintiff has offered no evidence that Safeco, like the insurer in\n   <em>\n    Iglehart\n   </em>\n   , ever admitted liability or, like the insurers in\n   <em>\n    Lay\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    McSwain\n   </em>\n   , told him that they would \"settle it up\" or that \"repairs would be made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Safeco may not have provided plaintiff with a \"formal\" denial of coverage until December 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the limitations period is triggered by the \"inception of the loss,\" not the denial of coverage unless, like the situation in\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   , the denial follows an investigation or negotiations which consumed the entire limitations period. The evidence does not support an inference that such a circumstance occurred here. Any conduct by Safeco which might have misled plaintiff as to its intentions regarding payment of his claim concluded in the spring of 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff argues, though, that defendant, by signing the Settlement Agreement, \"acknowledged that claims were still pending against it by Plaintiff.\" Doc. # 26, p. 9. He also contends \"it can be reasonably inferred that Defendant also acknowledged that the policy's time limitation would not be a hindrance to the Plaintiff's claims as the agreement was not executed by Defendant until approximately three weeks prior to the policy's stated limitations clause deadline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the Settlement Agreement, the Zewdies released their claims against some parties. By signing the document, Safeco simply agreed that the Zewdies were not releasing any claims they sought to pursue against it under the homeowners' policy. It cannot be inferred from the language regarding the preservation of the Zewdies' claims that Safeco is agreeing to a waiver or extension of the limitations period. And plaintiff cites to no other provision in the Agreement which would support such an inference. To the contrary, the agreement itself recited there were no other agreements beyond those explicitly included in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff had three weeks after the Settlement Agreement was executed to file suit before the limitations period ran. He did not sue during the remaining time period and he offers no evidence of any communication from defendant or any actions taken by defendant during those three weeks, which would warrant an extension of the contractual statute of limitations. Having determined that the limitations period is valid and enforceable and that defendant did not, by its actions extend the period, the court concludes that plaintiff's contract claim is barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Bad Faith\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The parties agrees the limitations period for plaintiff's bad faith claim is two years under Oklahoma law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 Okla. Stat. \u00a7 95(3). They do not agree, though, as to when it accrued. Defendant asserts it commenced on November 1, 2012, the date plaintiff's counsel sent Safeco a letter asserting that Safeco had both breached the parties' contract and its duty to deal fairly and in good faith with its insured. Safeco argues that \"[i]n describing Safeco's conduct as 'egregious,' Plaintiff's counsel specified acts of alleged Safeco bad faith and damages allegedly incurred by her client.\" Doc. # 24, p. 6. It contends that the November 1 letter, plus one sent on November 16, 2012, which identifies plaintiff's bad faith claim \"as an open topic for the approaching mediation\" confirms that the claim accrued no later than mid-November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff responds that as of November 2012, defendant \"had not yet denied the claim, nor had it meaningfully participated in the investigation of the claim.\" Doc. # 26, p. 10. Plaintiff asserts that Safeco, over the course of the next year, issued payments under the policy amounting to approximately $41,000 over the course of the next year and that \"discussions continued\n   between the parties until the formal denial letter from Defendant dated December 30, 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11. He claims \"a jury could reasonably infer that the entirety of the facts\" underlying his bad faith claim did not accrue until December 30, 2013, when defendant's \"drawn out illusory settlement discussions were abruptly concluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, plaintiff asserts that defendant is precluded or estopped by its behavior from asserting the statute of limitations defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In Oklahoma, the statute of limitations \"begins to run when the cause of action accrues\" and \"[a] cause of action accrues when a litigant could first maintain an action to a successful conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephens v.

As evidenced by his attorney's letters, plaintiff was aware of the facts on which his bad faith claim is based as early as November 2012, and certainly no later than February 27, 2013. On that date his attorney sent a letter to Safeco's counsel confirming Safeco's participation in a mediation \"to discuss settlement of certain outstanding coverage claims by the insureds.\" Doc. # 27-2, p. 1.

She informed defendant on November 16 that if it elected to attend the December mediation it should \"send a representative with full authority to settle\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the lnsured's claims against Safeco,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the lnsured's claim for the extensive water damage to the lnsured's home, as well as the lnsured's claim against Safeco for its failure to deal fairly and in good faith with the Insured.\" Doc. # 24-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff relies on the same conduct which Ms. Gau discussed in her letters as the basis for his bad faith claim in his petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1-2, pp. 5-6, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33 (failure to \"timely investigate the claim, process the claim, and make payment\" and \"[a]s a result of SafeCo's failure to deal fairly and in good faith\" with the insured he was required to pay for covered repairs and for attorney's fees in the underlying arbitration action). As both Safeco's conduct and the injury to plaintiff, as detailed in Ms. Gau's letters, had occurred by November 2012, the limitations period for plaintiff's bad faith claim commenced at the latest by November 16, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10342512\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/905/797/#p799\">\n    905 P.2d at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] negligence claim accrues when any injury to the plaintiff, for which an action could proceed, is certain and not merely speculative.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).

Plaintiff has offered no evidence of conduct by defendant that falls within categories (b) or (c). Safeco neither expressly and repeatedly admitted liability nor engaged in some type of misconduct. As has been discussed previously, plaintiff also has offered no evidence that might have led plaintiff to believe Safeco was still negotiating regarding his claims after March 2013, which was well before November 11, 2014, the date the limitations period ran on his bad faith claim.
