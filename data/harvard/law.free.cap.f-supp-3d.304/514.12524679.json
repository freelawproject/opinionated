No. 8] the Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The matter is now ripe for review. Upon due consideration, the Court finds that the motion should be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiff Will McRaney (\"McRaney\") is the former Executive Director of the nonparty General Mission Board of the Baptist Convention for Maryland/Delaware (\"BCMD\"). Pl.'s Comp. [Doc. No. 2] at 2. The BCMD is a self-governing group of 560 separate, autonomous churches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is one of 42 separate state conventions that work in cooperation with the non-party Southern Baptist Convention (\"SBC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Defendant NAMB is a constituent board of the SBC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. While McRaney was never employed by the NAMB, he was employed by the BCMD, which partnered together with the NAMB under a \"Strategic Partnership Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Aside from the obligations of this agreement, the BCMD are NAMB are separate and autonomous from each other. The BCMD is self-governing with its own boards and member churches, and the NAMB operates pursuant to its own Board of Trustees selected at annual meetings of the SBC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under their partnership agreement, the BCMD and NAMB had eight jointly funded staff positions that were overseen by McRaney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2014, the NAMB developed\n   a revised partnership agreement that eliminated the jointly-funded staff positions and gave the NAMB greater control over other staff positions of the BCMD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The NAMB was unsuccessful in persuading McRaney to accept the new partnership agreement on behalf of the BCMD. NAMB President Dr. Kevin Ezell and Vice President Jeff Christopherson thereafter gave notice to the BCMD that the NAMB intended to cancel the partnership agreement between the NAMB and the BCMD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2015, following meetings between Dr. Ezell and other board members of the BCMD, McRaney was terminated from his position as Executive Director of the BCMD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to McRaney, this was because Ezell threated to withhold all NAMB funds from the BCMD unless the BCMD terminated McRaney and agreed to enter into the new partnership agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McRaney alleges that, after his termination from employment with the BCMD, NAMB leadership continued to interfere with business and contractual relationships that McRaney had with third parties. For instance, McRaney avers that, in October 2016, he was scheduled to speak at a mission symposium in Louisville, Mississippi, until NAMB employees allegedly spoke to organizers of the event and had him uninvited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, in November 2016, McRaney alleges that he was scheduled to speak at the Florida Baptist Convention Pastor's Conference. In early November, the Pastor's Conference President informed McRaney that Dr. Ezell had attempted, unsuccessfully, to get McRaney's appearance canceled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, McRaney alleges that his photo was posted at the NAMB headquarters welcome desk with a caption that stated he was not to be trusted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McRaney then filed this action in the Circuit Court of Winston County, Mississippi, alleging three claims of intentional interference with business relationships, one claim of defamation, and one claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The NAMB then removed the case to this Court based on federal diversity jurisdiction, and after filing its answer, filed the present motion seeking to dismiss McRaney's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard for Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\"are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Kocurek v.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   declined to apply a \"rigid formula\" to determine which employees qualified as a minister. Instead, the Court looked a totality of the circumstances analysis to find that the plaintiff, a teacher at a religious school, was a minister to whom the exception would apply. The factors the court considered included \"the formal title given [the teacher] by the Church, the substance reflected in that title, her own use of that title, and the important religious functions she performed for the Church\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There the Fifth Circuit found that the ministerial exception applied to a church music director. The Fifth Circuit considered the \"integral role in the celebration of Mass\" the plaintiff played by selecting music, teaching the choir, and playing piano during the service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638086\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/169/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638086\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/169/\">\n    at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Turning to the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , NAMB argues that because McRaney was the Executive Director of the BCMD, his duties included \"ministry direction,\" and that because McRaney was thus the employee tasked with directing the ministry efforts of the BCMD, he qualifies as a \"minister\" to whom the exception applies. The Court agrees, and finds that McRaney is indeed the type of ministerial employee to whom the exception potentially applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   That does not end the Court's analysis, however, because before the exception can be applied the Court must also determine whether McRaney's pending claims are the type to which this exception applies. The Court holds they are not, and thus his claims are not subject to dismissal under this exception. Specifically, every case the Court has reviewed in which the ministerial exception was applied involved a plaintiff who had been previously employed by the defendant religious organization\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   (and not just employed by a\n   related or affiliated organization). For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   , the dispute was one between a religious school and a former teacher at that school itself.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Cannata\n   </em>\n   , the dispute was between a church and its former music director.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638086\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/169/\">\n    700 F.3d at 170-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, every case cited by the NAMB in support of its motion involves a dispute between employer and employee.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conlon v. InterVarsity Christian Fellowship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984946\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/829/#p831\">\n    777 F.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (6th Cir. 2015) (dispute between college missionary organization and \"spiritual director\" for the organization\");\n   <em>\n    Rweyemamu v.

Md., Aug. 15, 2016) (dispute between Seventh-Day Adventists school and teacher). Further, even within the employer-employee relationship, this exception only prevents claims that arise out of actual employment decisions\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   , and not just related conduct. For example, the Ninth Circuit held that a pastor terminated for complaining of sexual harassment by her superiors could not sue her former church employer for retaliatory termination without running afoul of the exception, but could sue for the harassment itself.\n   <em>\n    Elvig v. Calvin Presbyterian Church\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376415\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/951/#p966\">\n    375 F.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 966 (9th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , because McRaney was indisputably not employed by NAMB, this is not a claim between employer and employee, is not a claim that arises out of employment decisions made by the sole Defendant NAMB, and thus the ministerial exception does not apply to mandate dismissal of any of McRaney's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The Ecclesiastical Abstention Doctrine\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, the NAMB argues that the doctrine of \"ecclesiastical abstention\" prevents the Court from resolving McRaney's claims and mandates their dismissal. First, the Court notes that while the parties equate the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine with the ministerial exception, they are in fact separate, albeit related, principles.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregorio v.

First, unlike the court in\n   <em>\n    Klagsbrun\n   </em>\n   , this Court would not need to decide matters of pure religious doctrine such as what constitutes a valid religious divorce or a rabbinical court order. Second, while this case is much more similar to\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , the nature of the alleged harm would not require this Court to decide any parameters or issues of proper church governance. In\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff pastor alleged that the defamatory statements subjected him to \"humiliation, ridicule, contempt, and emotional distress and caused his ministry as pastor to suffer suspicion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2233271\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/264/145/\">\n    589 S.E.2d at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because he did not allege any \"special harm,\" but rather only general damages, those statements would only be actionable if they constituted defamation\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   Thus to determine whether the statements were defamatory, the\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   court was required to determine whether the statements about the pastor were \"injurious on their face.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellemead, LLC v.

Accordingly, to determine whether McRaney's claim has merit, the Court need only decide whether the statements about McRaney were false and whether they caused his termination, neither of which will require the Court to delve into any religious practices or matters of internal church governance. Thus, on the face of the complaint, the Court can adjudicate this claim without delving into impermissible religious inquiries, the ecclesiastical exception therefore does not apply,\n   and NAMB's motion to dismiss this claim on this basis is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

That claim shall be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As for McRaney's remaining claims, the ministerial exception \"precludes application of [employment] legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the relationship between McRaney and the NAMB was not one of employee-employer, that exception is inapplicable to McRaney's remaining claims and does not subject the claims to dismissal. Further, McRaney's claims, as stated on the face of the Complaint, will not require the Court to impermissibly inquire into religious doctrine and practice, although the factual development of this case may later prove otherwise. Thus, the Court will not apply the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine to dismiss McRaney's remaining claims at this time. Finally, the Court finds that McRaney has adequately pled two claims for intentional interference with contractual relations, as set forth above, and has adequately pled a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Those claims are not subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), and the Defendant's motion to dismiss those claims shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   An order in accordance with this opinion shall issue this day.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Though not discussed by the parties, it is not clear to the Court whether Florida or Mississippi law should apply to McRaney's Florida-based claim. In any event, because it is also a requirement under Florida law that the plaintiff suffer damages, dismissal of this claim is warranted under both Mississippi and Florida law.\n    <em>\n     Farah v.
