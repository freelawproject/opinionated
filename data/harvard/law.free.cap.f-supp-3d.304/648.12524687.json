Indeed, only in the labyrinth of the law, where words are often\n   stretched, strained and tortured beyond recognition, it is possible for a locomotive to be \"in use\" even though it is motionless and not on the main track.\n   <em>\n    Stierwalt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203046456\">\n    2007 WL 3046456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, without wading into the muck of myriad analyses outside this circuit, the undersigned finds basis upon which to decide the \"in use\" conundrum based upon the undisputed facts of this case. The 99 railcars loaded with coal, which were coupled to three locomotives, were tied down on siding. [Docket No. 40-5, Deposition of Michael Coleman at p.316]. They had sat, motionless, for at least 8 hours prior to Plaintiff's arrival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183-184. Plaintiff could not operate the locomotives and pull the coal-filled cars until the handbrakes on the locomotives and the brakes on the railcars had been released. At the time he sustained injury, he had not completed the pre-departure inspections. [Docket No. 39-6, Deposition of Derek Erwin, p. 58]. Nor had Plaintiff or Erwin been given permission to move the locomotives and/or the cars from the siding to the branch line. [Docket No. 39-6, Deposition of Bill Honeycutt, p. 258]. The locomotives were not moving, nor were they ready to move away from the remote siding. Based upon the undisputed facts, it cannot credibly be said that these locomotives were \"in use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff maintains otherwise. He argues that two facts warrant a conclusion that the subject locomotive was \"in use.\" First, he agues that the locomotive was not undergoing scheduled service or repair and, as such, was \"in use.\" Second, he contends that because on the day of the incident, he was a transportation employee, as opposed to a mechanic and that this, somehow, precludes a finding that the locomotive was \"in use.\" Yet, this two factor analysis ignores other, obvious facts, such as the fact that these cars had been motionless, tied to a remote siding, for at least eight hours prior to Plaintiff's arrival and that, at the time he sustained injury, the cars had not been cleared for departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff's unduly narrow view also seems out of step with the purpose of the LIA, which affords the railroad an opportunity to have its locomotive engineer or other employee inspect for any defects or unsafe conditions prior to placing the locomotive in use on the railroad's line of road without being exposed to strict liability for such conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stierwalt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203046456\">\n    2007 WL 3046456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, in an attempt to avoid summary judgment, Plaintiff urges that factual issues abound. Yet the facts he emphasizes have no relevance to the issue of whether the locomotive in question was \"in use\" for the purposes of the LIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, both parties agree that whether a locomotive is \"in use\" is a question of law to be decided by the trial court judge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203046456\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20229.45\">\n     49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 229.45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and 229.119(c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In Paragraphs 17(1-n), Plaintiff alleges that NSRC failed to comply with certain Locomotive Safety Standards, as codified in 29 C.F.R.

And we arrive at the labyrinth once again. Plaintiff's argument that naturally occurring snow, rainwater, or sleet which falls from passing clouds during inclement weather constitute \"other leaks\" referenced in the regulation is, at best, a strained and illogical. Nor is there case law or legislative history which supports his definition of \"other leaks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Section 229.119(c) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Floors of cabs, passageways, and compartments shall be kept free from oil, water, waste or any obstruction that creates a slipping, tripping or fire hazard. Floors shall be properly treated to provide secure footing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20229.119\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This regulation pertains \"cabs, passageways and compartments\", all areas which are located in interior areas of the locomotive. There is absolutely no mention of exterior walkways in this regulation. Moreover, there is no mention in this regulation of any requirement that the railroad keep locomotive exterior walkways (which do not have a roof and are open to the elements and precipitation) completely free of naturally occurring precipitation such as rainwater, snow, ice or sleet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Notably, Plaintiff's liability expert witness, Michael O'Brien, candidly admitted the word \"walkways\" does not appear in the title or the text of this regulation. [Docket No. 39-10, Deposition of Michael O'Brien, p. 283-285].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based upon the plain reading of the regulations, precipitation is not within their purview. Therefore, Plaintiffs claim that NSRC violated these regulations is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff's contention that the locomotives were unsafe and even treacherous, begs the question of why he failed to report these conditions and why he proceeded to board, work on and attempt to operate them. Indeed, NSRC's Operating Rules speak to this directly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Employees must not do any work in a manner that will jeopardize their own safety or the safety of others. They must know that appliances, tools, supplies, and facilities used in performing their duties are in proper condition. If not, they must have them repaired or replaced before using them. It is the duty of every employee to examine them to determine their condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [Docket No. 39-7, Portions of Operating Rules].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Yet, Plaintiff chose to disregard this Rule and board the equipment he now claims was \"treacherous.\" Instead notifying the Railroad via radio or phone of the allegedly defective condition of the locomotives, and awaiting his supervisor's instructions with respect to handling, the Plaintiff grabbed his personal gear and his travel bag, and dismounted from the pusher unit. [Docket No. 36-2, Deposition of Michael Coleman, p. 243]. He Plaintiff climbed the steps of the lead locomotive, NS 6706, walked down the walkway, and entered the\n   cab of the lead locomotive, the NS 6706, without incident although he now describes the locomotive steps as snow and ice covered and \"treacherous\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff has not come forward with any credible evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact that locomotive NS 6729 was \"in use\" on the Railroad's line of road at the time of his alleged slip on an exterior walkway of the locomotive on January 22, 2014 and has provided no admissible evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact to support his contention that NSRC violated the provisions of the Federal Locomotive Inspection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020701\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or the federal regulations codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20229.45\">\n    49 CFR \u00a7 229.45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20229.119\">\n    49 CFR \u00a7 229.119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).
