Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PCORI is an independent, non-profit organization established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%20119\">\n    124 Stat. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Mot., Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s SOF\") \u00b6 1. The organization's mission is to help patients, clinicians, and others make informed health care decisions by, among other things, funding \"patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research\" and disseminating the results of that research to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. PCORI's in-house communications department is responsible for publishing research results, interfacing with the media, and keeping the organization's staff members apprised of any relevant news.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; ECF No. 23-1 (\"Stencel Decl.\") \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2014, PCORI hired Walden to serve as the communications department's \"Senior Media Relations Specialist,\" a position it created to reduce the amount of work it typically outsourced to an external communications firm. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The position's responsibilities included assisting in the day-to-day management of media relations activities, responding to press inquiries, preparing staff for interviews, and monitoring news coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; ECF No. 26-1 (\"Walden Dep.\") at 24-25. The position paid an annual salary of $75,000. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 9. Walden was expected to \"complete assignments with sufficient levels of accuracy on or before deadlines.\" Stencel Decl. \u00b6 125. As a full-time employee, she was entitled to 240 hours of paid time off (\"PTO\") per year, accruing semi-monthly, to use on vacation, sick leave, medical appointments, or for other reasons. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2014, prior to starting her job at PCORI, Walden was involved in a car accident, resulting in injuries to her neck, back, and spine. Opp., Statement of Disputed Facts (\"Pl.'s SOF\") \u00b6 2. These injuries limited her ability to \"work, walk, stand, drive and sit for long periods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After starting work on June 16, 2014, Walden informed her direct supervisor, Christine Stencel, that she needed to attend regular medical appointments and physical therapy sessions as part of her rehabilitation. Walden Dep. at 43-44; Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12. During Walden's first two weeks, Stencel allowed her time off to attend medical appointments and to move into a new apartment, despite the fact that she had not yet accrued any PTO. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From June through November 2014, Walden took time off to go to medical appointments and physical therapy sessions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31. During this time period, according to her medical records, she attended at least twenty-four such sessions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 28 (\"Pl.'s Med. Rec.\") at 29-30, 33-34, 36-39, 41, 43-44. But Walden asserts that Stencel occasionally denied her requests to use PTO to attend to these matters. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 10. Stencel claims that Walden was often given permission to leave for medical reasons during normal working hours without having to use her PTO. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Stencel also claims that she made \"every effort\" to grant Walden's requests for PTO, whether her reasons were medical or non-medical. Stencel Decl. \u00b6 110. In any event, Walden also asserts that Stencel was \"uncomfortable\" with her disability, Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 8, and sent her a \"barrage of emails to distract her\" while she attended these appointments,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Walden also claims that Stencel told her to \"skip\" medical appointments \"multiple times,\" and that this happened on \"at least ten\" occasions. Walden Dep. at 76-77. In particular, Walden cites one incident where Stencel allegedly stated that she should \"probably skip\" her physical therapy session because a project was due the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79. Walden states that \"most of the time\" she was not able to make up the physical therapy appointments she skipped and was sometimes \"charged a fee for not showing up\" or \"a late fee for arriving there late.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78. For her part, Stencel denies ever asking Walden to skip medical appointments and, in fact, claims to have discouraged her from doing so. Stencel Decl. \u00b6 113. According to Walden's medical records, during her tenure at PCORI, she missed seven physical therapy sessions (in August and September 2014), at least four of which she appears to have cancelled to complete work assignments. Pl.'s Med. Rec. at 36, 38-39, 41, 43; Def.'s SOF \u00b6 32. But Stencel asserts that, at the time, she was not aware that Walden missed these sessions for that reason. Stencel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 114-115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Walden asserts that when she began working at PCORI, the amount of work she was assigned was manageable. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 5. But according to PCORI, at that time Walden was assigned discrete tasks that comprised only a subset of her position's full responsibilities. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 51. Stencel asserts that she intended to-and did-assign Walden additional responsibilities over time as Walden became more familiar with PCORI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. One of Walden's job responsibilities was tracking news coverage about PCORI, which the parties call \"media monitoring.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 48; Walden Dep. at 144. Around \"the July timeframe,\" Walden received additional media-monitoring tasks that she characterizes as duplicative. Walden Dep. at 141-142. For example, Walden asserts that she was asked to track media mentions of PCORI using two different electronic formats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142-43. According to Walden, after she had already completed the assignment in one of the two formats, Stencel said that \"it was no longer needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PCORI asserts that Walden did not demonstrate proficiency in the tasks that were assigned to her in her first few months, and that Stencel was dissatisfied with Walden's performance. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 45-50. Stencel often rewrote documents Walden drafted, identified mistakes Walden made, and sent Walden detailed feedback about how to improve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stencel Decl., Exs. 2-18, at 17-123. Nonetheless, Walden asserts that, during this time period, Stencel \"on occasion\" told her that she \"was doing a good job.\" Walden Dep. at 189; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 11. PCORI admits that, throughout the course of her employment, Walden received \"some positive comments about her work,\" but asserts that much of the feedback she received was negative. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In early October 2014, Walden met with PCORI's Director of Communications, William Silberg, and Director of Human Resources, Mitch Eisman, to voice several concerns, including that Stencel had unduly increased her workload and required her to skip medical commitments. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 13. Later that month, on October 28, Walden met with Eisman and Stencel to request accommodations for her disability: an arrangement where she could work at home part-time, and an ergonomic chair and standing workstation for her use when she was in the office. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Walden Dep. at 45. Walden's doctor had recommended that she work at home three days per week for at least eight weeks. ECF No. 26-4; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 16; Walden Dep. at 45. Eisman and Stencel agreed to Walden's requests, but authorized her to work at home only two, not three, days per week. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 13, Stencel and Walden discussed the work-at-home arrangement in greater detail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Walden claims that Stencel used this discussion to \"interrogate\" her and demand that the arrangement include \"periodic check-ins.\" Opp. at 19-20. But in any event, the next day, Stencel formally approved the arrangement, and it went into effect three days later. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. The arrangement was originally scheduled to end in January 2015, but PCORI allowed it to continue indefinitely, and it remained in effect until Walden's last day working there in April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37; Walden Dep. at 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once the work-at-home arrangement began, Walden was generally able to attend her physical therapy sessions, which were usually twice per week. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 18. However, Walden alleges that after the meeting to discuss her accommodation, she began receiving an increased workload, including assignments\n   that were duplicative. Walden Dep. at 139-141. But, during her deposition, the only example of such duplicative work that she could recall-additional media-monitoring tasks-occurred in the July timeframe.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 141-42. At other times, Walden described an increased workload interfering with her medical appointments before her work-at-home arrangement was implemented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-77. In addition, she claimed to have discussed her increased workload at the very meeting in which she requested her work-at-home arrangement in October.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. Again, at least according to PCORI, Walden's increased workload over time was a result of the fact that she was being eased into her job. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PCORI asserts that, after the work-at-home arrangement began, Walden continued to struggle to complete her work in a timely fashion, and her written work product frequently contained errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-55. Walden claims that this criticism was new-a marked contrast to the earlier, positive feedback she had received from Stencel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about November 25, 2014, one week after the arrangement began, Walden and Stencel met to discuss Stencel's concerns about Walden's performance and Walden's concerns about her workload. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 52. Shortly after the meeting, Stencel suggested that they revisit these issues again, once Walden had spent about six months working at PCORI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Although this sort of \"six-month review\" is not mandatory, PCORI states that its managers are encouraged to conduct them where appropriate. Stencel Decl. \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 16, 2015, Stencel conducted Walden's six-month review. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 25. During this discussion, Stencel again stated specific reasons why Walden's performance was lacking, and Walden again expressed concerns about her increased workload.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s SOF \u00b6 58. After the discussion, and at Walden's request, Stencel sent Walden a list of specific errors that she had made that month. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 26, 2015, Stencel conducted Walden's annual performance review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 26. Walden had been working at PCORI for less than a year at that point, but annual performance reviews for all employees were conducted at around the same time, regardless of the employee's start date. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 62. In her evaluation, Stencel rated Walden's performance at 2.19/5.00 (a rating between \"Inconsistent\" and \"Proficient\"), and expressed concerns about Walden's time management, the quality of her work product, and the fact that she often left tasks incomplete before taking time off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. In contrast, Walden rated her own performance at 3.42/5.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   About a month after receiving her annual evaluation, in mid-March 2015, Walden was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. The PIP called for Walden to: (1) assume the full responsibilities of her position as Senior Media Relations Specialist; (2) improve her accuracy and eliminate errors in her work product; and (3) improve her time management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. In a meeting with Eisman, Stencel, and Silberg to discuss the PIP, Walden claims that Silberg \"indicated to Walden ... that they had 'done enough in providing accommodations for [her] disability.' \" Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 27. Moreover, Walden claims that Eisman, Stencel, and Silberg all \"threatened [her with] termination\" if she did not comply with the PIP within four weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Soon afterward, on March 25, 2015, Walden resigned. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 67. In her resignation letter, Walden accused Stencel of giving her low performance reviews and placing her on a PIP because Stencel \"dislike[d\n   ] that [she had] a serious medical condition and required accommodations for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. Upon receiving Walden's email, Stencel immediately forwarded it to Eisman, who tried to speak with Walden about her allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68; Mot. at 27. Walden, however, declined to speak with him. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 69. Walden's last day of work at PCORI was April 7, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During her time at PCORI, Walden took a substantial amount of time off, both for medical and non-medical reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28. By her last day at PCORI, she had fully utilized her accrued PTO and, in fact, had overdrawn her PTO by thirty-four hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Moreover, aside from Walden's regularly scheduled work-at-home days, she was absent from the office for some or all of the workday for approximately half of the total days she worked at PCORI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 31, 40, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After Walden resigned, PCORI posted advertisements for two open positions in the communications department: \"Senior Media Relations Specialist\" (Walden's former position) and \"Media Relations Specialist\" (a newly created position). Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 28; ECF No. 26-11 at 4-7. Some of Walden's responsibilities as Senior Media Relations Specialist were reassigned to this new position.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26-11 at 4-7,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26-2 (\"PCORI Offer Ltr.\") at 7-8.

Significantly, however, Walden does not assert that these denials kept her from ultimately using\n   all the PTO that she accrued, even if she was not able to use it precisely as she preferred. In fact, the uncontroverted documentary evidence shows that, by the time she left her job at PCORI, Walden had used thirty-four\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   PTO hours than she had accrued. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 25; ECF No. 23-3 (\"Eisman Decl.\") at 10-11.

Opp. at 16. Walden testified that she was told by Stencel to skip physical therapy sessions \"multiple times,\" and later clarified that this occurred on \"at least ten\" occasions. Walden Dep. at 76-77. But she describes only one of those occasions, on which Stencel told her that she should \"probably skip\" a physical therapy session to finish a project due the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76, 79. It is not clear from her testimony how many times she actually heeded Stencel's requests to skip therapy. Walden's uncontroverted medical records show that she missed seven physical therapy sessions (all in August and September 2014) during her almost ten months working at PCORI, although they do not, of course, show what portion of the seven were missed at Stencel's urging. Pl.'s Med. Rec. at 36, 38-39, 41, 43; Def.'s SOF \u00b6 32. The documentary evidence also shows that, from June until mid-November 2014, prior to the start of her work-at-home arrangement, Walden attended at least twenty-four physical therapy sessions. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31; Pl.'s Med. Rec. at 29, 30, 33-34, 36-39, 41, 43-44. And Walden concedes that, after her work-at-home arrangement began in mid-November 2014, she was generally able to attend her physical therapy sessions through the end of her employment in April 2015.

PIPs are not typically adverse employment actions without some additional effect on an employee's grade or salary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Beyond the mere fact that she was placed on a PIP, Walden claims that Silberg, Stencel, and Eisman all threatened to terminate her if she did not comply with it within four weeks.

It is not uncommon for a PIP to include a warning that non-compliance could lead to termination-but such warnings alone do not give rise to an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

She points to the following: (1) two statements by PCORI that it had \"done enough\" in providing her with accommodations for her disability; (2) Stencel's \"behavior\" during two discussions about her disability; (3) Stencel's denials of PTO requests and orders to \"skip PTO;\" (4) Stencel's refusal to agree to Walden's request to work at home three days per week; (5) her \"substantially increased workload;\" (6) Silberg's \"behavior\" after meeting with Eisman and Walden; (7) her preliminary six-month review and six-month review; and (8) her \"unfair performance assessments\" after her request for accommodations. Opp. at 17-24. The Court will consider each of Walden's arguments, and the record evidence supporting them, in the light most favorable to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, Walden asserts that in a meeting to discuss her PIP, Silberg told her that PCORI had \"done enough in providing accommodations for [her] disability,\" Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 27, and her PIP stated that, \"PCORI [had] made every reasonable effort to accommodate [her] requests for an alternative work schedule as well as frequent PTO requests,\" ECF No. 26-9 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 18. However, these statements-made in the context of evaluating Walden's job performance-merely reflected PCORI's belief that it had provided Walden with the accommodations she had\n   requested in accordance with the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rashad v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231646\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/945/152/#p163\">\n    945 F.Supp.2d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (D.D.C. 2013) (finding that employer's statement that \"[d]espite the burden ... [it] has granted [plaintiff's] accommodation request\" did not support claims of discrimination and retaliation). These statements would not permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Walden's PIP, or any of PCORI's actions, was the result of discriminatory animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, Walden claims that Stencel's \"behavior\" while discussing her disability is evidence of pretext. Opp. at 19. In particular, she asserts that Stencel appeared \"uncomfortable\" and \"squirmish\" on two occasions-when she first disclosed her disability and when she requested a work-at-home arrangement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231646\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/945/152/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Walden Dep. at 97-100.

Cir. July 1, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Third, Walden claims that Stencel \"at times denied and ordered Walden to 'skip' PTO.\" Opp. at 19. But there is nothing about this allegation that a reasonable factfinder could find demonstrates discriminatory pretext. In terms of her PTO use, as already discussed, the evidence shows that Walden was permitted to use thirty-four more PTO hours than she actually accrued. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 25; Eisman Decl. at 10-11. Moreover, Stencel's denial of Walden's PTO request in December 2014 (the only denial of her PTO that Walden identifies with specificity) is wholly unconnected to Walden's disability; that request was apparently for a vacation, not for a physical therapy appointment. Walden Dep. at 160-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To the extent that Walden suggests that Stencel's telling her to skip her medical appointments (whether or not she had to use PTO to attend them) was a pretext for disability discrimination, Opp. at 19, she stands on even weaker ground. Walden herself testified that Stencel's actions in this regard were not motivated by disability discrimination. She testified that Stencel generally told her to \"skip\" physical therapy for work-related reasons, such as the completion of \"priority assignments.\" Walden Dep. at 75-77. For example, on the one occasion she described, Stencel told her that she should \"probably skip\" her physical therapy session \"because this [project] is something that's due tomorrow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79. Walden has not called into question PCORI's evidence showing that her job required her to meet these deadlines. Stencel Decl. \u00b6 125. Accordingly, on this record, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that Stencel's alleged requests for Walden to miss these physical therapy appointments give rise to an inference that PCORI was motivated by discriminatory animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, Walden points to the way in which PCORI accommodated her disability as evidence of pretext. Opp. at 19-20. As mentioned above, PCORI granted Walden's request for an ergonomic chair and a standing workstation. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Walden Dep. at 45. And for purposes of the work-at-home arrangement, Stencel permitted Walden to work at home two days per week, rather than the three days per week that her doctor recommended. Def.'s SOF \u00b6 36. This accommodation is plainly not evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that PCORI's actions were pretext for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swann v. Office of Architect of Capitol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223484\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/73/20/#p30\">\n    73 F.Supp.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30-31 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding that employer's decision to place a lock on a unisex locker room, in place of providing the separate female locker room requested by plaintiff, could not be considered pretext evidence for discrimination or retaliation),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-5001,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205210251\">\n    2015 WL 5210251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. Aug. 18, 2015). In fact, as already described, PCORI's accommodation was in some ways more generous than what was recommended by Walden's doctor. The doctor recommended that the arrangement last eight weeks, yet PCORI allowed it to continue for approximately five months, up until Walden's last day working there. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Walden also asserts that Stencel endorsed this work-at-home arrangement only after \"interrogating\" Walden and insisting that the arrangement be accompanied by \"periodic checkins.\" Opp. at 20. She suggests that this is a \"departure from established procedures,\" which can be probative of a pretext for discrimination,\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290043,6786275\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/34/\">\n    795 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (D.C. Cir. 2015), but she utterly fails to produce evidence of what those procedures were. For its part, PCORI asserts that holding such discussions preceding the establishment of a work-at-home arrangement, and having \"periodic check-ins,\" are standard protocol. Reply at 16. PCORI's claim finds confirmation in the agreement memorializing Walden's arrangement, which specifically states that \"[t]he most successful flexible work arrangements occur when the manager and employee discuss and work through the details of the proposed arrangement in advance.\" Stencel Decl., Ex. 42 at 241. It also states that the \"employee's role\" is to \"[r]egularly evaluate the arrangement with [his or her] supervisor and implement agreed upon changes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 240. In the end, of course, Stencel approved the work-at-home arrangement. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. There is simply no basis here from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that PCORI's actions were pretexts for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Fifth, Walden claims that, after she had requested a work-at-home arrangement, she was given a \"substantially increased\" workload that \"one person could not handle.\" Opp. at 20. She asserts that this increased workload included additional media-monitoring tasks, and that such tasks were duplicative. Walden Dep. at 143. To demonstrate that this added workload was overly burdensome, Walden points to the fact that, shortly after her departure, PCORI created a second position to assume several of the responsibilities originally assigned to Walden's position. Opp. at 22-24. For its part, PCORI responds that the new position was created to account for the additional work PCORI would take on to fully \"reduce and eliminate\" its reliance on its external communications firm. Reply at 18; Stencel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to a pretext analysis, Walden fails to show how her allegations of increased workload-which she describes only in the most opaque way-suggest that PCORI was motivated by discriminatory animus. The only example of increased workload that Walden described involved performing media-monitoring tasks that were included in the description of her job when she applied for it. Walden Dep. at 141-42, 144. Simply put, she provides no evidence that would cast doubt on PCORI's explanations for (1) her increased workload (that she was given additional media-monitoring assignments over time because she had been performing only a fraction of her assigned duties), or (2) the creation of a new position after she resigned (to fully eliminate its reliance on an external communications firm).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To the extent that Walden argues that the timing of this increased workload is significant, \"[t]iming standing alone is not sufficient absent other evidence of pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Burton v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333010\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/222/#p240\">\n    798 F.3d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. State Farm Ins. Cos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667880\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/326/#p330\">\n    158 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 (5th Cir. 1998) ). Moreover, Walden disclosed her disability to PCORI immediately after the start of her employment in June. Walden Dep. at 43-44. So there is little, if any, temporal link between PCORI's knowledge of her disability and Walden's allegation of increased workload after she requested a work-at-home arrangement in late October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In fact, the evidence does not even support Walden's claim that she received an increased workload only after requesting a work-at-home arrangement. Opp. at 20-21. She did make this claim at one point during her deposition. Walden Dep. at 139-141. But the only specific example of her increased workload she recalled-the duplicative media-monitoring tasks-occurred in the \"July timeframe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142. At other times, Walden described an increased workload interfering with her medical appointments\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   her work-at-home arrangement was implemented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-77. In fact, she claims to have discussed her increased workload at the very October meeting she now claims precipitated her increased workload.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. Taken as a whole, her testimony is broadly consistent with PCORI's assertions that her workload was increased gradually over time, to permit her to learn about PCORI. There is simply no basis to conclude that the timing of her increased workload in relation to her request for a work-at-home arrangement suggests discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Sixth, Walden claims that Silberg's \"behavior\" after she met with him and Eisman in early October 2014 is evidence of a discriminatory motive. Opp. at 21. Walden asserts that she voiced concerns about Stencel at the meeting; in particular, she relayed that Stencel had increased her workload and required her to skip medical appointments. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 13. But there is nothing about Silberg's subsequent conduct from which a reasonable juror could infer discriminatory intent. Walden points to two instances that took place after the meeting-one where Silberg revised her draft \"media update,\" Stencel Decl., Ex. 15 at 108-11, and another where Silberg stated that Walden had circulated the wrong draft \"e-alert,\" Stencel Decl., Ex. 18 at 119-23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 10. But Silberg had revised Walden's written work prior to the meeting as well. Stencel Decl., Ex. 8 at 73-75. That is hardly surprising: Silberg was the head of PCORI's communications department. Therefore, Silberg's supposedly improper \"behavior\" consisted merely of doing his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Seventh, Walden asserts that she was subjected to a preliminary six-month review and six-month review that no other employees were required to undergo. Opp. at 21-22. A \"departure from established procedures\" can be probative of a pretext for discrimination,\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290043,6786275\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/34/\">\n    795 F.3d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but on the record here no reasonable factfinder could conclude that such a departure occurred. Walden claims that her employment offer letter from PCORI states that she was only subject to an annual review. Opp. at 21. But, as already discussed, the letter merely states that annual reviews will be conducted, leaving open the possibility of additional performance reviews. PCORI Offer Ltr. at 5. Walden's only other evidence showing a departure from established procedures is her own statement that certain unnamed colleagues had \"never heard of a 6-month review, only an annual review.\" ECF No. 26-7 at 5. However, this evidence cannot be credited at summary judgment because it is\n   hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861272,3566566\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/1306/\">\n    505 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1315 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Cir. 2013) (finding plaintiff's \"own statement claiming two colleagues told her about the openings\" to be \" 'pure hearsay\" that \"counts for nothing in an opposition to summary judgment\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Of course, Walden could have deposed the colleagues who had \"never heard of a 6-month review,\" but she declined to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v. George Wash.

Opp. at 24. Walden states that, after this meeting, Stencel \"became severely critical\" of her work and gave her \"unfair\" evaluations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. According to Walden, before that time, PCORI was satisfied with her job performance. Walden Dep. at 193. She asserts, and PCORI admits, that Stencel occasionally praised Walden's work during her tenure at the organization. Opp. at 24; Def.'s SOF \u00b6 66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In response, PCORI provides \"uncontradicted evidence in the record that [it] harbored concerns about the quality of [Walden's] performance\" both before and after the October meeting.\n   <em>\n    Glass v.

Cir. Dec. 8, 2011). PCORI points to numerous examples, from June through early October 2014, where Stencel rewrote Walden's work or identified mistakes that Walden had made. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 45-50;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stencel Decl., Exs. 2-13, at 17-105. Both parties agree that Stencel was critical of Walden's work after the October meeting, and that Walden received low marks on her annual performance review and was subsequently given a PIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 36; Opp. at 21. Even viewing this record in the light most favorable to Walden, the evidence simply does not support her claim that PCORI became dissatisfied with her work only after Walden met with Eisman and Silberg in early October 2014. The record is replete with documentary evidence showing Walden's performance deficiencies before October, none of which she specifically contests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In the end, none of the evidence Walden cites suggests that PCORI's stated reasons for its actions-in particular, its dissatisfaction with her work-were pretext for disability discrimination. She has not, for example, contravened the specific evidence documenting PCORI's concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waterhouse v.

With respect to Walden's retaliation claim, PCORI offers the same legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions as it did in connection with her discrimination claim: mainly, that Walden performed poorly throughout the course of her employment. And in support of her retaliation claim, Walden relies almost exclusively on the same evidence that she proffered to show pretext in connection with her discrimination claim. Opp. at 29-30. Here too, and for the same reasons already discussed in the discrimination context, the Court finds that Walden fails to create a material dispute as to whether PCORI retaliated against her.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Walden offers one new argument, but it adds little to her case.
