INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Becky Wesberry and Jim Wesberry bring this personal injury action against the United States. The Wesberrys, a married couple from Texas, allege that Becky Wesberry fell and sustained serious injuries when leaving Ford's Theatre, the historic site of President Abraham Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865. The United States National Park Service, an agency of the United States Department of the Interior, is responsible for administering the Theatre. The Wesberrys assert a negligence claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 2671, and also seek damages for Jim Wesberry's loss of consortium due to his wife's injuries. This matter now comes before the Court\n   on the Government's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the Court's prior opinion. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the United States' decisions at issue in this case fall within the FTCA's discretionary function exception and that it therefore lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Op. at 2, ECF No. 19. Indeed, the Court found that, if the National Park Service's decisions with regard to warning signs, handrails, and other safety features at Ford's Theatre were discretionary, they would be of the kind that the discretionary function was designed to protect because those decisions are based on a weighing of various public policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. However, the Court found that it could not fully resolve the jurisdictional inquiry because it was still premature to determine whether the decisions at issue were, in fact, discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. That is, whether there was any binding mandate that governed the agency's decision-making process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court permitted the Plaintiffs to conduct limited, jurisdictional discovery on that question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Plaintiffs have now taken jurisdictional discovery and both the Government and the Plaintiffs have filed new motions addressing the jurisdictional questions under the FTCA.

Dismiss or Summ. J. at 1-2, ECF No. 26. According to the Government, the decisions concerning stairway safety features were indeed protected by the discretionary function exception and thus not subject to suit under the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-18.

Plaintiffs have opposed the Government's motion and have filed their own motion for reconsideration of the Court's prior decision. Plaintiffs argue that \"two newly available pieces of evidence\" cast doubt on this Court's prior holding and, in fact, suggest that the decisions not to install handrails alongside the stairs at Ford's Theatre were not judgments so grounded in public policy as to be protected under the discretionary function exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The Government argues that, despite having been afforded an opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery,\n   Plaintiffs can identify no mandatory directive that controlled the National Park Service's decisions concerning safety features on the exterior steps of Ford's Theatre.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Dismiss or Summ. J. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, however, that the National Park Service was, in fact, constrained by Director's Order # 58 (\"DO-58\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. P. &amp; A. at 7-9, ECF No. 28. DO-58 is an order that was issued by the Director of the National Park Service and was intended to provide a \"more detailed interpretation of the structural fire policy articulated in National Park Service Management Policies 2006 by setting forth operational policies and procedures necessary to establish and implement structural fire management programs.\"\n   <em>\n    See Director's Order # 58: Structural Fire Management\n   </em>\n   , Nat'l Park Serv. at \u00a7 I (Apr. 22, 2010) (\"DO-58\"). Plaintiffs point out that, under DO-58, the National Park Service announced that it would \"adopt National Fire Protection Association ('NFPA') codes and standards and recommend practices for fire prevention, protection and life safety, with exceptions and modifications as adopted in [Reference Manual # 58].\" DO-58 at \u00a7 IV.H;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. P. &amp; A. at 7-8. Although not explicitly stated in DO-58, Plaintiffs contend that this adoption of NFPA codes and standards necessarily implied an espousal of certain sections of NFPA's Life Safety Code that they claim required handrails to be installed on stairs and ramps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mem. P &amp; A. at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    NFPA 101: Life Safety Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7.2.2.4.1.1, 7.2.2.4.1.6 (2012 ed.), ECF No. 28-3. Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that the discretionary function exception does not bar their claims because there was a specific, mandatory policy requiring the National Park Service to install handrails on the stairs on which Ms. Wesberry fell. Pls.' Mem. P. &amp; A. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But Plaintiffs read too much into the language of DO-58. Nothing in DO-58 specifically adopts the NFPA provisions cited by Plaintiffs nor is there any language indicating that the National Park Service intended to strictly adhere to each and every NFPA code provision without alteration. Indeed, the document itself expressly states that the National Park Service\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   make \"exceptions and modifications\" to NFPA standards. DO-58 at \u00a7 IV.H. Thus, it unsurprisingly recognizes that \"not all structures will be in full compliance\" and notes that deviations from code compliance may be \"acceptable.\" DO-58 \u00a7 IV.I. Furthermore, even the NFPA codes and standards are not as inflexible as Plaintiffs would have this Court believe. Indeed, while Plaintiffs focus on two NFPA provisions that concern handrails, they entirely ignore NFPA provisions that discuss historic structures. Those codes and standards explicitly state that, in the context of historic buildings, strict compliance with its provisions is not necessarily required in every instance.\n   <em>\n    NFPA 101: Life Safety Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.6.4.2 (\"The provisions of this\n   <em>\n    Code\n   </em>\n   shall be permitted to be modified by the authority having jurisdiction for buildings or structures identified and classified as historic buildings or structures where it is evidence that a reasonable degree of safety is provided.\");\n   <em>\n    NFPA 914: Code for Fire Protection of Historic Structures\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.4.2 (2010 ed.)

It is not intended to require\n   modifications for conditions that do not represent a significant threat to life, even though such conditions are not literally in compliance with the prevailing code.\"). Indeed, the NFPA codes themselves appear to recognize that, in the context of historic buildings, decisions about code compliance will necessarily require balancing considerations of safety with concerns over preservation of heritage.\n   <em>\n    NFPA 914: Fire Protection of Historic Structures\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2 (stating that, in the context of historic structures, the goal is to both \"[p]rovide protection and life safety from the effects of fire\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to \"[m]aintain the historic fabric and integrity of the building\"). That is to say, they involve matters of judgment and discretion. And most importantly, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate how DO-58 predominates over the higher-level policy of historic preservation being balanced with public safety found in the Organic Act, the National Park Service Management policies, and different Director's Orders.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; National Park Service Management Policies \u00a7 8.2.5;\n   <em>\n    Director's Order # 28: Cultural Resource Management\n   </em>\n   , Nat'l Park Serv.

Apr. 2, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that reconsideration is warranted in this case based on two purportedly new pieces of evidence. First, Plaintiffs assert that it was revealed during jurisdictional discovery that Ford's Theatre was renovated between 2007 and 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot Reconsideration at 4. These renovations included the addition of: \"elevators; modern heating; ventilation, and air-conditioning systems; up-to-date sound, lighting, and stage-rigging systems; wheelchair-accessible restrooms; and more comfortable seating.\" Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 12. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that, during that same period, a \"new, contemporarily designed glass-and-steel lobby was added\" along with a \"new 'parlor' for special events.\" Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 9, 12. Second, Plaintiffs claim that they learned, after filing their Complaint, that handrails were installed alongside the stairs where Ms. Wesberry fell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 13. Plaintiffs argue that \"[t]he newly available evidence about the modernization of Ford's Theatre and the installation of handrails alongside the stairs where [Ms.] Wesberry fell ... show that the failure to put those handrails in place before the accident does not involve policy decisions of the sort that the FTCA's discretionary-function exception protects from litigation.\" Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' characterizations, it is far from clear that either of these \"newly available pieces of evidence\" were \"not previously available\" to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215821\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/11/7/#p8\">\n    11 F.Supp.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (D.D.C. 2014). Indeed, Plaintiffs' motion elicits no reason why they could not have made their arguments concerning Theatre improvements in their prior briefs. To start, the renovations cited by Plaintiffs were apparently completed in 2009-five years before the Plaintiffs visited the Theatre-and Plaintiffs make no claim that these updates were somehow secreted from view or otherwise unapparent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, most of Plaintiffs' characterizations\n   about the project were drawn-not from any documents produced by the Government in discovery-but from a 2014 book, entitled\n   <em>\n    Images of America: Ford's Theatre\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Reconsideration at 7-11. This hardly counts as evidence that was previously unavailable to Plaintiffs. With respect to the new railings, Plaintiffs claim only that they \"learned\" about the addition sometime \"after the filing of their complaint.\" Pls.' Mot. for Reconsideration at 4. They do not claim that the railings were installed after the prior briefing or even that they were unaware of the railings at the time of the Government's prior motion. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to provide this Court with any basis upon which to find that the evidence that they now cite was previously unavailable to them. Moreover, Plaintiffs' motion simply seems to be an extension of the same legal arguments that this Court rejected over a year ago. Thus, it appears that Plaintiffs primarily seek an \"opportunity to reargue facts and theories upon which [this] [C]ourt has already ruled\" and \"present[ ] theories or arguments that could have been advanced earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20973197\">\n    2009 WL 973197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 n.2. On this basis alone, Plaintiffs' motion could properly be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nevertheless, even considering Plaintiffs' arguments anew, their motion fails. At the outset, the Court must note that Plaintiffs' factual predicate appears to be somewhat inaccurate. While it is true that the National Park Service renovated Ford's Theatre between 2007 and 2009, the Government has provided evidence showing that the renovations to the Theatre were not as extensive as Plaintiffs claim. Indeed, the National Park Service's principle project manager for the 2007-2009 renovations attests, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertions, that the improvements at Ford's Theatre did not include a parlor or a modernized, glass-and-steel lobby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Mike Giller \u00b6 9, ECF No. 34-1. Rather, those renovations were undertaken by a private organization at an adjacent building that is neither part of the Ford's Theatre National Historic Site nor managed by the National Park Service in any way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Mike Giller \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The 2007-2009 renovations at Ford's Theatre were decidedly more modest. They included upgrades to the building's ventilation and climate systems, restroom renovations, and certain theater improvements, all of which were intended to enhance visitor experience without degrading the historical character of the Theatre.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Mike Giller \u00b6 3; Def.'s Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 5, ECF No. 34. Despite having the opportunity to do so, Plaintiffs have not replied to these assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that consideration of the historical improvements to Ford's Theatre should alter this Court's prior determination for two reasons. First, Plaintiffs claim that the developments at Ford's Theatre \"call into serious question the importance of ... the goal of preserving Ford's Theatre and leaving it unimpaired for future generations.\" Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 12 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). That is to say, Plaintiffs challenge whether the National Park Service has a preservation interest in Ford's Theatre at all because the Government has undertaken certain improvements of the structure over the years. This contention is patently wrong. To start, the significant value of Ford's Theatre to the heritage of\n   the United States should be obvious to anyone with even a basic understanding of American history and is clearly evinced by the fact that the structure is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. Under the Organic Act, the National Park Service is required \"to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects ... and to provide for the enjoyment of the scenery, natural and historic objects ... as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Other National Park Service guidelines state that park superintendents must \"balance public recreation and safety with preservation of the protected natural, historic, or cultural setting.\"\n   <em>\n    See Director's Order 50C\n   </em>\n   :\n   <em>\n    Public Risk Management Program\n   </em>\n   , Nat'l Park Serv. at \u00a7 1.1 (May 7, 2010). And the National Park Service officials have declared that the National Park Service manages Ford's Theatre in a manner consistent with those objectives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cucurullo Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As this Court previously explained, the discretionary function exception \"is not limited to historical, cultural, or natural sites maintained in their pristine state.\" Mem. Op. at 17. Thus, an historic building need not necessarily eschew electricity, running water, or certain other modern conveniences to remain worthy of preservation. In the case of Ford's Theatre, the renovations and improvements cited by Plaintiffs have not so fundamentally altered the structure that its historic fabric has been torn asunder. Rather, the National Park Service has sought to improve and enhance the visitor experience without degrading the Theatre's historic character. Thus, the National Park Service continues to balance the legitimate public interests of safety and historic preservation, which are precisely the kind of public policy based \"decisions which Congress intended to shield from judicial second-guessing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chantal v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632080\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/207/#p212\">\n    104 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (8th Cir. 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But Plaintiffs also make another argument. Plaintiffs suggest that, even if the National Park Service has a preservation interest in Ford's Theatre, there is no such interest at play with regard to the addition of handrails at the 10th Street fa\u00e7ade because, not only did some of the exits already have handrails at the time of Ms. Wesberry's fall, but the National Park Service later decided to add handrails at the exit that Ms. Wesberry used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 13. This argument, too, is misguided. The question that the Court must resolve is whether the decisions at issue \"implicate social, economic, or political policies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p323\">\n    499 U.S. at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p323\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the specific question is whether the decisions at issue involved weighing an interest in historic preservation of Ford's Theatre. The ultimate\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of that weighing at any point in time, however, is irrelevant. All that is required is \"some support in the record that the decisions taken are 'susceptible' to policy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Terbush v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640217\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/1125/#p1134\">\n    516 F.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (9th Cir. 2008). Based on the record, the Court is convinced that the National Park Service has a legitimate preservation interest in Ford's Theater, including the 10th Street fa\u00e7ade. Indeed, the National Park Service officials have declared that the fa\u00e7ade remains within the historical fabric of the Theatre and that \"any construction or alteration thereto must be considered within the interests of preservation as required by law and [National Park Service] policy.\" Decl. Mike Giller at \u00b6 4. The mere fact that the National Park Service may or may not ultimately decide to install handrails in no way diminishes the fact that the decision itself is the type that requires a judgment about public policy. Similarly, the applicability of the discretionary\n   function exception does not turn on what the decision maker was actually thinking or what the government actually considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169659,3435620\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/155/\">\n    393 F.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that, after Ms. Wesberry's injury and with additional information in hand to balance the interests of historic preservation and public safety, the National Park Service drew the line in a different spot by installing additional handrails in no way suggests that the discretionary function exception does not protect the very process of the line-drawing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that this is a case like the one addressed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    350 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20L.%20Ed.%2048\">\n    100 L.Ed. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955)\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 15. In that case, a ship allegedly ran aground because the U.S. Coast Guard failed to maintain a lighthouse in good working order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    350 U.S. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held that, even though the initial decision to undertake the construction and operation of a lighthouse might have involved a discretionary decision, the discretionary function exception did not apply because the failure to maintain the lighthouse in good working condition did not involve any permissible exercise of policy judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031304\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/61/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Berkovitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220398\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/531/#p536\">\n    486 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   538 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220398\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/531/#p536\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Analogizing to\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs argue that, although the National Park Service's decision to convert a window into the door where Ms. Wesberry fell and to install stairs between that door and the sidewalk might have been a permissible exercise of discretionary judgment, having made these determinations, it was incumbent upon the Government to install handrails in order to make those stairs safe. Pls.' Mot. Reconsideration at 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   illustrates, and as later cases have emphasized, \"garden-variety\" maintenance is not the kind of discretionary judgment that is protected by the discretionary function exception.\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616113,7413555\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/445/\">\n    45 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, the steps at Ford's Theatre were not alleged to have been in disrepair and Ms. Wesberry's injuries were not alleged to have been caused by any alleged failure to\n   <em>\n    maintain\n   </em>\n   those steps. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that the National Park Service should have added other, additional and different safety features. That is the difference between arguing that the lighthouse in\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   was not being properly maintained versus arguing that the lighthouse should have been taller, brighter, or placed in another location. In short,\n   <em>\n    Indian Towing\n   </em>\n   presents no impediment to the Court finding that the Government exercised discretion that was \" 'fraught with' economic, political, or social judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616113,7413555\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/445/\">\n    45 F.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The decision whether to install handrails along the fa\u00e7ade of Ford's Theatre very clearly impacts the outward appearance of the Theatre and therefore requires the National Park Service to carefully weigh concerns of safety with considerations for the historic preservation of the structure.
