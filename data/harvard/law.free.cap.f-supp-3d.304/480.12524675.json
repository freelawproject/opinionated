McCray's 56(d) motion should be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435701\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/214/#p244\">\n    302 F.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that nonmovant was entitled to 56(d) protection in part because it \"was not dilatory in pursuing discovery\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant's main argument against allowing plaintiff an opportunity for discovery is that \"Plaintiff had ample opportunity to obtain the discovery she now seeks during the administrative proceedings below [provided for by Educ. \u00a7 6-202 ] but chose not to pursue it.\" ECF 10 at 13. At the hearing following plaintiff's notice of termination, defendant asserts, \"Plaintiff invoked her right to a full evidentiary hearing before the Board.... Prior to that hearing, Plaintiff's attorney filed a request for documents on Plaintiff's behalf ... which the Superintendent responded to prior to the commencement of her hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Defendant emphasizes that \"approximately twenty (20) witnesses, including Plaintiff, testified under oath, and approximately sixty (60) exhibits were entered into evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, defendant contends that plaintiff \"had an opportunity to conduct\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   extensive discovery\" had she chosen to appeal her termination to the Maryland State Board of Education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Because plaintiff chose not to appeal, defendant asserts, she \"waived her right to access the discovery mechanism that was then available to her. She cannot now complain that she needs discovery in order to oppose the Board's motion in this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In support of this argument, defendant cites (and quotes extensively from) this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mackall v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , ELH-12-1153,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20412922\">\n    2015 WL 412922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. Jan. 29, 2015). In that case, I granted summary judgment to the defendant even though the plaintiff had not conducted discovery in the case, because the plaintiff had ample opportunity for discovery during administrative proceedings before the EEOC on the same discrimination claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12-13. I compared the\n   <em>\n    Mackall\n   </em>\n   case to a case assigned to Judge Blake,\n   <em>\n    Kowalewski v. Gates\n   </em>\n   , CCB-12-3288,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201212972\">\n    2014 WL 1212972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. Mar. 24, 2014), in which a plaintiff was similarly denied discovery because he could have obtained all the information he sought during the earlier EEOC proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Kowalewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201212972\">\n    2014 WL 1212972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant's argument based on\n   <em>\n    Mackall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kowalewski\n   </em>\n   overlooks an important factual distinction, which plaintiff astutely points out in her surreply: Although plaintiff was entitled to obtain documents and question witnesses at her Educ. \u00a7 6-202 hearing, that hearing was focused on the grounds for her\n   <em>\n    termination\n   </em>\n   , and not on her claims of\n   <em>\n    employment discrimination. See\n   </em>\n   ECF 11 at 7. At the hearing, the issue was whether defendant's decision to discharge plaintiff was justified on the basis of misconduct, incompetence, and willful neglect of duty, under Educ. \u00a7 6-202(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 6-1 at 19. In contrast, this Court is now presented with the issue of whether defendant violated state and federal law by discriminating against plaintiff on the basis of her disability and interfering with the exercise of her rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These separate proceedings require plaintiff to prove different elements, and likely call for different discovery strategies. For example,\n   in the termination hearing, plaintiff would have little reason to seek extensive discovery on defendant's treatment of other teachers, since that issue did not bear directly on the question of whether plaintiff's termination was justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The circumstances here are more similar to\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   than to\n   <em>\n    Mackall\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff should not be precluded from conducting discovery in this case simply because she had opportunities to conduct different discovery in a different matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant next argues in its Reply that summary judgment is not premature because even if plaintiff were granted discovery, she would be unable to create a genuine issue of material fact. ECF 10 at 14. But, because plaintiff has had no opportunity for discovery, I cannot conclude as a matter of law that the evidence defendant offers constitutes the full story. At least with respect to plaintiff's discrimination and FMLA claims, it seems entirely plausible that, with adequate discovery, plaintiff could raise a triable issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As for Count One, plaintiff's claim that defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations under the ADA, it is true that plaintiff did not identify in her Complaint any specific accommodation that she requested and was denied. Defendant has not filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Count One, but rather a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. Some courts, including the Fourth Circuit, have suggested that a motion for summary judgment made on the basis of the pleadings may be considered as a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Wards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694492\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/607/\">\n    738 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615 n.5 (4th Cir. 2013),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 22, 2013) (citing 10A Wright &amp; Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2713 (3d ed. 2013) ). However, defendant's motion for judgment on Count One rests on defendant's argument that \"the undisputed facts demonstrate that Plaintiff received every accommodation she requested.\" ECF 6-1 at 27. According to plaintiff, the facts are not undisputed (ECF 9 at 4), and the fact that plaintiff has not produced contrary evidence prior to discovery does not mean that such contrary evidence does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Therefore, I shall deny defendant's motion for summary judgment as premature, without prejudice to its right to renew the motion at a later time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons stated above, I shall DENY defendant's Motion to Strike plaintiff's surreply (ECF 12); DENY plaintiff's Motion for a Supplemental Surreply (ECF 14); DENY, as moot, defendant's Second Motion to Strike, as to plaintiff's supplemental surreply (ECF 16); GRANT defendant's motion to dismiss Count Two, without prejudice; and DENY, as premature, defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   An Order follows, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The factual allegations are derived from the Complaint (ECF 1), with additional background drawn from the exhibits attached to the Motions.
