There is no evidence from which a jury could conclude that OPM discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her race, color or age, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity when it denied a within grade increase and a promotion.

Even if the plaintiff's relationship with Ferguson had been free of conflict,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, the mere fact that the plaintiff clashed with Briggs does not demonstrate discrimination on the part of OPM.

As discussed above, the plaintiff's FY 2008 performance appraisal and the Quality Management Group's independent review of the plaintiff's work supported the conclusion that the plaintiff's overall performance was unacceptable.

Again, the plaintiff fails to demonstrate any connection between her termination to her race, color, or age, or shows that OPM terminated her in retaliation for having engaged in protected EEO activity. The plaintiff proffers no evidence upon which a reasonable jury might find that OPM's proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating her employment\n   are not the actual reasons, and that OPM intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff because of her race, color, or age, or for having filed EEO charges against OPM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Lastly, the Court concludes that OPM has not subjected the plaintiff to a hostile work environment. Accordingly, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.
