DAVID PROCTOR, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is before the court on the Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 15) filed by\n   Defendant Nucor Steel Birmingham Inc. (\"Nucor\"). The parties have fully briefed the Motion to Dismiss. (Docs. # 15, 17, 18). For the reasons explained below, the Motion to Dismiss (Docs. # 15) is due to be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Defendant Nucor intentionally retaliated against him for opposing Nucor's discriminatory practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). (Doc. # 9 at 3-4). Plaintiff alleges that, as a part of its hiring process, Nucor requires applicants to undergo a \"psychological evaluation,\" where a psychologist asks applicants questions about their age, marital status, children, parents, and family life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Plaintiff claims that the psychologist subsequently shares this information with Nucor employees involved in the hiring process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff claims that he was concerned that Defendant was using psychological evaluations to circumvent federal laws protecting personal information from disclosure during the application process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-9). Approximately twenty days prior to his termination, Plaintiff alleges that he raised his concerns about the psychological evaluations with Controller Susan Grahs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Grahs\") and other unnamed supervisors at Nucor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). On July 13, 2015, Plaintiff notified the EEOC of his concerns regarding Defendant's hiring process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Plaintiff alleges that he notified Nucor that he had contacted the EEOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 15, 2015, Grahs gave Plaintiff a \"coaching for the month end\" document, which detailed work areas where Plaintiff needed to improve his performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Plaintiff claims that, prior to receiving this coaching document, he had never been provided with any formal negative feedback from Nucor and had only received \"exceed expectations\" evaluations from Grahs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(b) ). The coaching document stated that Plaintiff had until the end of the next month to improve his performance in the identified areas; however, Plaintiff was terminated sixteen days later, on July 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13(c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 21, 2016, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC against Defendant, alleging retaliation in violation of Title VII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 15-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint against Nucor in Jefferson County Circuit Court on May 16, 2017. (Doc. # 1-1). On June 15, 2017, Nucor removed the case to federal court. (Doc. # 1). On July 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which dropped Plaintiff's (1) claim of retaliation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), (2) state law fraud claim, and (3) state law claim of outrage and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1-1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 9). Nucor moved to dismiss this action on July 17, 2017. (Doc. # 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. # 15-1). The charge of discrimination form had instructions to \"[c]heck [the] appropriate box(es)\" that the alleged discrimination was based on, and the boxes for \"age\" and \"disability\" discrimination were located immediately to the right of the \"retaliation\" box that Plaintiff marked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nevertheless, those two boxes were left unchecked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Of course, the mere failure to check a box is not dispositive here. But even more importantly, Plaintiff's charge of discrimination description makes no mention of age or disability discrimination; rather, it merely states that Plaintiff \"expressed to management that [he] thought some of the employment practices used when interviewing individuals might be in violation [of] the laws enforced by the EEOC. [He] did contact EEOC by email asking for clarification but [he] did not give the name of the company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff concluded his charge by asserting that he \"was discharged and discriminated against in retaliation for protesting acts made unlawful, in violation of the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As such, Defendant argues that the scope of Plaintiff's judicial complaint should be limited to his Title VII claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the claim actually referenced in his EEOC charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mulhall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509187\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/586/\">\n    19 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   589 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Courts have broadly interpreted the scope of administrative charges filed by unrepresented parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregory v.

Plaintiff argues that his EEOC charge should be liberally construed to include \"any of those laws enforced by the EEOC that might be implicated\" or \"ensnared\" by Defendant's hiring practices because \"Plaintiff was not certain what precise law had been violated.\" (Doc. # 17 at 4).

The court disagrees.
