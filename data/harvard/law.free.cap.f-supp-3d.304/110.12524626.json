COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Vikki Mitchell was terminated after serving 12 years as a detention officer\n   with the District of Columbia Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (\"DYRS\"). In this case, Mitchell brings two distinct sets of employment discrimination claims against the District of Columbia arising from her tenure with DYRS. One relates to sexual harassment she allegedly experienced at the hands of a supervisor at the agency's Oak Hill youth detention facility in 2007, while the other challenges her termination by DYRS in 2014. The Court previously dismissed one of Mitchell's state-law claims due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and she has conceded that the other was untimely. The District now moves for summary judgment on all of her remaining federal claims, which are brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\") and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"). As explained further below, the Court will deny the District's motion with respect to the claims arising from Mitchell's alleged sexual harassment and the FMLA claim arising from her termination, but will grant summary judgment for the District on Mitchell's Title VII termination-based claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services operates a network of secure juvenile detention and treatment facilities in the Washington, D.C. area. Vikki Mitchell began working for DYRS in 2002 as a Youth Development Representative (a euphemistic detention officer) at the Oak Hill Youth Center, which was closed in 2009. She later worked at DYRS's Youth Services Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As noted above, this drama proceeds in two acts. The first centers on Ms. Mitchell's treatment by a former Oak Hill shift commander named Jerome Parkinson in 2007 and the ensuing retaliation she claims she suffered as a result of reporting his misbehavior. The second involves her termination from DYRS in 2014, which the agency attributed to a string of violations of the agency's time and attendance policies, but which Mitchell maintains was engineered to retaliate against her for taking too much time off work, including approved family medical leave to care for a relative. The facts relevant to each episode follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Harassment and Retaliation: 2007-2008\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 9, 2007, Mitchell lodged a written complaint with DYRS's Deputy Director, David Brown. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. C. In it, Mitchell stated that since July 12, 2007 her shift commander Jerome Parkinson had been repeatedly touching her, including her breasts, badgering her to accompany him on vacation, and summoning her to his office alone on a daily basis.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Mitchell further indicated that on July 29, 2007 she reported Parkinson's inappropriate touching to Oak Hill's Deputy Superintendent David Thomas, who failed to intercede.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Upon receipt of Mitchell's written complaint, Deputy Director Brown granted her request for a transfer to DYRS's Youth Services Center and commenced an internal investigation of Parkinson's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. A, D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 15, 2007, about a week after Mitchell was transferred from Oak Hill, a \"barring notice\" addressed to all staff from Oak Hill's Superintendent, Dextar Dunbar, was posted at the main entrance to the facility. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. E. The notice stated in bold print: \"please do not allow Ms. VICKI MITCHELL\" on the premises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E. When Mitchell arrived at Oak Hill for a previously scheduled training session that day, staff members questioned her about the notice and she was not able to attend the training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, Ex. F (memorandum scheduling\n   training). Although Dunbar issued a retraction five days later asking staff to disregard the notice and apologizing to Mitchell for issuing it, nothing in the record indicates why the notice was issued in the first place. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3. Based on these events, the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights determined that there was probable cause to believe that Mitchell had been subjected to unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex pursuant to the D.C. Human Rights Act. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Sum. J. Ex. H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Parkinson resigned from his position in December 2007. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. H. The next day, Mitchell was transferred back to Oak Hill and placed under the supervision of Deputy Superintendent Thomas, the person to whom she had originally complained about Parkinson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. J. On September 22, 2008, Mitchell filed another complaint with DYRS Deputy Director Brown, alleging that Thomas was harassing and retaliating against her for the original complaint against Parkinson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She specifically complained that Thomas denied her a uniform, chided her about how her car was parked, changed her post assignments, ignored her complaints, showed preferential treatment to other employees, and threatened her job because of time she took off for approved medical appointments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The District disputes that these actions took place and, if they did, that they were retaliatory. Def.'s Mot. Summ.

In December of that year, Mitchell requested and was approved for up to 640 hours of unpaid, intermittent FMLA leave to care for a family member, to be taken over a 24-month period. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. V. She took this leave on 28 separate days throughout 2013. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 22 (documenting FMLA leave from January to September 2013). At some point on or prior to November 13, 2013, Matthew Stern, Mitchell's supervisor at the time, prepared a \"Human Resources Personnel Request Form\" recommending to his supervisors that Mitchell be terminated for being absent without leave (\"AWOL\") and late to work several times. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 8, 2014, Stern sent Mitchell a letter providing 45-day advance notice of DYRS's proposal to remove her from her position. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4. The Notice specifically listed five \"facts in support of the determination\": (1) in September 2013, Mitchell was late to work three times by two, three, and one minute, respectively; (2) on October 3, 2013 Mitchell called in sick less than one hour before her shift and was charged with AWOL; (3) on October 23, 2013 Mitchell left her post to attend a doctor's appointment (the parties dispute whether this was pre-approved); (4) on October 24, 2013 Mitchell again called in sick under an hour before her shift and was charged with AWOL; and (5) on November 4, 2013 Mitchell was more than 15 minutes late to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mitchell was provided a copy of the proposed removal notice mid-January 2014. Mitchell Dep. 112:7-13. Per District policy, the day she received the notice, Mitchell turned in her ID and did not return to work. She continued to be paid, however.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:6-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mitchell challenged her proposed termination before a hearing officer, who issued\n   a final determination sustaining the proposal on February 27, 2014. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 15. Mitchell received the final determination on March 18, 2014 and the hearing officer set her official termination date for April 4, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After pursuing both sets of claims through the EEOC administrative process, Mitchell filed suit in this Court on August 12, 2015 and amended her complaint on November 4, 2015. The amended complaint included claims under Title VII, the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (\"DCHRA\"), and the District of Columbia Family and Medical Leave Act (\"DCFMLA\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Complaint. The Court dismissed Mitchell's DCHRA claims as untimely,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   March 9, 2017 Minute Order, and Mitchell has conceded that her DCFMLA claims are also untimely, Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. at 1. However, the Court declined to dismiss Mitchell's Title VII claims on timeliness grounds. With respect to her Title VII claims stemming from the events that took place in 2007 and 2008, the Court found her hostile work environment claim was subject to a more lenient exhaustion standard and thus was timely filed with the EEOC. March 9, 2017 Minute Order; March 7, 2017 Hearing Tr. And as for her Title VII claim stemming from her 2014 termination, the Court found that the existence of a work sharing agreement between the EEOC and DCOHR extended the time for Mitchell to contact the EEOC from 180 to 300 days, and that Mitchell filed her claim within that period. April 25, 2017 Order. The District now moves for summary judgment on those Title VII claims, along with Mitchell's FMLA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Employers are vicariously liable under Title VII for \"the acts of a supervisory employee whose sexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work environment amounting to employment discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

The District does not contest that Parkinson's behavior, if established, would create a hostile work environment under Title VII. February 27, 2018 Hearing Tr., 4:6-15. Instead, the District argues that it should be relieved of liability under the affirmative defense recognized by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   , which accounts for both the \"reasonableness\n   of the employer's conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n    524 U.S. at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   defense requires that (1) the \"employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior\" and (2) the \"employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Abundant evidence in the record suggests that Mitchell reasonably attempted to avoid harm by availing herself of the District's anti-sexual harassment policies. The parties do not dispute the essential chronology set forth in Mitchell's August 9, 2007 written statement to DYRS's Deputy Director, David Brown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Mot.

Mitchell stated that Parkinson's harassment began on July 12, 2007 and that she reported it 17 days later, on July 29, 2017, to Oak Hill's Deputy Superintendent, David Thomas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mitchell further asserted that Thomas failed to take any corrective action and that the harassment continued,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p780\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   thus requiring her to elevate her complaints to Deputy Director Brown. This series of events alone could convince a reasonable juror that Mitchell properly sought protection under the District's policies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

It first claims that Mitchell \"advances no evidence that she ever reported the harassment to her department's EEO counselor, as required by [District] policy.\" Reply at 8. Yet the District's government-wide policy on sexual harassment allows employees to report harassment to \"the Equal Employment Office (EEO), an EEO counselor, an EEO representative,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an office manager or supervisor.\" Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 25 at 2 (emphasis added). And Mitchell did just that: she first reported Parkinson's conduct verbally to a superior, Deputy Superintendent Thomas, and then in writing to DYRS Deputy Director Brown after Thomas apparently failed to take corrective action. Recognizing as much, the District goes on to suggest that Mitchell unreasonably delayed reporting Parkinson's conduct to a supervisor, claiming that she \"only complied with the policy when she reported the harassment [to Brown] 'on or about August 9, 2017.' \" Reply at 8. As noted, however, her written statement indicates that she complained verbally to Deputy Superintendent Thomas on July 29, 2017, about two weeks after the harassment reportedly began. That timing is close enough to support a conclusion that Mitchell promptly reported the alleged harassment to a supervisor as envisioned by the policy.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

It contends, however, that Mitchell did not suffer any materially adverse action in retaliation for her complaint. Mitchell alleges two sets of retaliatory actions on the part of DYRS: (1) the \"barring notice\" issued by the Oak Hill Superintendent that prevented her from entering the premises about five days after her transfer from the facility; and (2) various acts of retribution taken by her supervisor David Thomas after Mitchell returned to Oak Hill in December 2007. The District counters that none of these alleged events constitute materially adverse actions and that, in any case, none of the actions were taken in retaliation for Mitchell's complaints about Parkinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As for the barring notice, the District argues that it was a \"trivial slight\" that did not rise to the level of an adverse action.

Sometime on or before November 13, 2013, Stern also prepared a \"Personnel Request Form\" recommending to his superiors that Mitchell be relieved of her duties, based principally on the October 23 incident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382721,5865433\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/670/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 16.

She counters that Stern \"concocted violations where none existed\" because she was \"taking too much time off work.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. at 14-15. The question for the Court, then, is whether Mitchell has \"produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that [DYRS's] asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that [DYRS] intentionally discriminated against\" her.\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Although it is somewhat of a close question, the Court finds that she has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, Mitchell raises legitimate questions as to whether the three instances of tardiness in September-where she was under three minutes late each time-are even sanctionable under the applicable DYRS time and attendance policy. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. L (DYRS disciplinary policy listing sanctions for tardiness violations only when employees are over five minutes late). And even if they are technically sanctionable under the policy, the \"gotcha\" quality of the minor violations could suggest that the policy was being applied especially strictly against Mitchell. Regardless, Stern did not prepare an incident report for the three September tardiness incidents until over a month later, on November 4, which could suggest that the infractions were not serious enough to report at or near the time they occurred. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Mitchell has raised a material factual dispute regarding the validity of Stern's October 23, 2013 AWOL finding. The record shows that she disputed the finding at the time, insisting that Stern gave her permission to see a doctor to receive treatment for her injury. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 8. She has also produced a sworn statement by a co-worker who witnessed her conversation with Stern about seeking medical care and accompanied her to the doctor. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Summ. J. Ex. Q. Ordinarily, the Court would not examine the facts behind a facially legitimate reason offered by an employer to reach a personnel decision. As the District notes, the question usually is not whether the underlying basis for the action is correct, but rather whether the employer \"honestly believes in the reasons it offers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). In situations like this, however, where the decision-maker is directly involved in the incident giving rise to the employment action, some testing of the facts is appropriate. After all, if a juror were to believe Mitchell's account of the October 23 incident and disbelieve Stern's, she would be right to question whether Stern \"reasonably believed\" that the incident warranted Mitchell's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, in addition to the September tardiness incidents, Mitchell offers evidence that Stern documented several of the other infractions in the notice of proposed termination after the fact, around the time he initiated the termination process in November 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 20 (incident form for the October 24 AWOL signed by Stern on November 5); Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. Q (incident form for the October 23 AWOL signed by Stern on November 2). This runs contrary to DYRS's incident reporting policy, which states that all incidents, including staff discipline, shall be reported \"immediately\" during normal business hours. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 23. These delays could suggest that Stern used reasons that he did not consider serious enough to memorialize promptly per District policy as pretext for Mitchell's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Taken together, the Court finds that the above-described evidence is sufficient to support a fair inference that the reasons cited in the removal notice are not the true reasons for Mitchell's termination. But that alone does not defeat summary judgment because Mitchell must also introduce evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the true reason was\n   <em>\n    retaliatory\n   </em>\n   . On this score, Mitchell alleges she was fired because she was \"taking too much time off work,\" some of which was authorized family medical leave. And the record confirms that Mitchell had repeatedly taken authorized leave prior to her termination, including family medical leave. DYRS time records indicate that she took 28 days of family medical leave prior to November 2013, including 10 days in September. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 22. This uptick in FMLA leave shortly before Stern took steps to terminate Mitchell could be indicative of retaliatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772317,4331661\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1085/\">\n    798 F.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\"The temporal proximity between an employee's protected activity and her employer's adverse action is a common and often probative form of evidence of retaliation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The District correctly notes that employers can require that employees taking FMLA leave comply with reasonable leave policies and insists that Mitchell was terminated for violating a number of those policies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Butler County Com'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20Fed.%20Appx.%20389\">\n    331 Fed.Appx. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that a county's \"internal call-in policy neither conflicts with nor diminishes the protections guaranteed by the\n   FMLA.\"). But the timing between her authorized absences and her termination-coupled with evidence undermining the credence of DYRS's reasons for the termination-supports a reasonable inference that Mitchell was fired for taking too much family medical leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, a reasonable jury could well determine that Mitchell's tardiness and long history of time and attendance infractions were the genuine reason for her termination. This history included suspensions and leave restrictions imposed before she even requested and started taking FMLA leave. But it could also determine that these reasons were a guise for unlawful retaliation for the reasons described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will therefore deny summary judgment to the District on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Discrimination on the basis of gender in violation of Title VII\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In Count II of her complaint, Mitchell alleges that DYRS discriminated against her on the basis of gender in violation of Title VII. As a threshold matter, the District argues that Mitchell's Title VII termination claim is time barred because she did not raise her claim with the EEOC soon enough. Not so. The Court has already ruled that Mitchell had 300 days to contact the EEOC after she was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   April 25, 2017 Order. But the District raises a new timeliness argument here: that the clock for EEOC filing started running mid-January, 2014, when Mitchell received the January 8 notice of proposed removal, rather than on March 18, when she learned she had actually been terminated, or on April 4, her official termination date. Def.'s Mot. Sum. J. at 12. If the clock started running in mid-January, Mitchell would have had only until sometime in early November (300 days later) to file her complaint. And because Mitchell first submitted an intake form to the EEOC regarding her termination on December 17, 2014, her claim would be untimely. Supp. to Opp'n to Mot. for Judgment on Pleadings Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But the clock did not start running in mid-January. This is because a notice of\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   removal is not the employment action Mitchell is challenging. Rather, she is challenging her\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   termination, when she stopped receiving pay. The District argues that\n   <em>\n    Chardon v. Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    454 U.S. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), compels the Court to start the statute of limitations clock in January. But that case held that the limitations period begins to run when notice of\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   termination is given, not when notice of\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   termination is given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182311\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/6/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the clock started running on March 18, 2014, when Mitchell received\n   notice of her official termination, putting her December 17, 2014 EEOC intake form squarely within the 300-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Turning to the merits, Mitchell alleges that her termination was unlawful gender discrimination under Title VII. Title VII makes it an \"unlawful employment practice\" for employers \"to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Again, the Court must resolve \"one central question: Has the employee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on the basis of ... sex?\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The District proffers legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Mitchell's termination-two AWOLS, four instances of tardiness, and one instance of abandoning her post. As explained in the previous section, Mitchell does offer evidence to support her argument that these reasons were pretextual; however, in order to survive summary judgment on her Title VII claim, the \"evidence of record must be such that a reasonable jury could not only disbelieve the employer's reasons, but conclude that the real reason the employer took a challenged action\" was gender discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772317,4331661\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1085/\">\n    798 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1093 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burton v.

Mitchell fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To support an inference that the employer's proffered reason is pretext for discrimination, a plaintiff may point to the \"employer's better treatment of similarly situated employees outside the plaintiff's protected group.\"\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290814\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/13/#p58\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here the only evidence Mitchell offers is that a male colleague was charged with 47 hours of AWOL in a six-month period yet was not terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Ex. W. But in order to show that she is similarly situation to this male employee, Mitchell must demonstrate \"that all of the relevant aspects of her employment situation were 'nearly identical' to\" his.\n   <em>\n    Neuren v.

Cir. 1995). Mitchell fails to create a material dispute on this point. Mitchell's termination was based on more than the times she was classified as AWOL-it was also based on several instances of tardiness, post-abandonment, and past discipline. And without a fuller picture of this male employee's discipline record, one could only speculate that she was treated unfairly as compared to him. With just this evidence, a reasonable jury could not find that the District terminated Mitchell because of her gender.

For purposes of summary judgment, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could infer that as Mitchell's immediate supervisor, Stern was aware that she had taken family medical leave, especially given his direct involvement in enforcing her compliance with DYRS's leave policies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382721,5865433\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/670/\">\n     557 F.3d at 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding that \"circumstantial evidence\" that a supervisor knew about protected activity before taking an adverse employment action will suffice to survive summary judgment).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    In fact, courts have found that suspension\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    pay (which was essentially Mitchell's status while she awaited a final determination), is not an adverse employment action at all.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Brown v.
