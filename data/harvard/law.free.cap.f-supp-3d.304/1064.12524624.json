Factual Background\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Employment Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1997, Plaintiff was hired by a predecessor company of Defendant Phillips 66 Company (\"Phillips\") as an engineer. In 2008, Plaintiff was transferred from New Jersey and began working in the procurement group in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Plaintiff's job responsibilities included assisting various company employees, business units, and refineries with negotiating contracts for supplies and services. In December of 2013, Plaintiff was promoted to Lead of the Strategic Sourcing Group. In 2014, Plaintiff became the direct supervisor of Michelle Tarter (\"Tarter\"), then a Strategic Sourcing Analyst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September of 2014, Plaintiff was removed from a supervisory role over Tarter; however, throughout the remainder of his employment he continued to work with Tarter and another employee, Mike Siegfried ('Siegfried\"), in the Bartlesville office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also in September of 2014, Rebeca\n   Ginyovszky (\"Ginyovszky\") became Plaintiff's supervisor. When Plaintiff was reporting to Ginyovszky, Ginyovsky's job title was Strategic Sourcing Director in procurement and her office was located in Houston, Texas. Ginyovszky also supervised Tarter and other employees working in Houston in the procurement group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was a salaried employee and had no published work shift or timekeeping requirement. (Manna Aff., Pl.'s Ex. 1, at \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff was able to perform work duties remotely from his laptop computer. Plaintiff's position required approximately 30 percent to 40 percent travel. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 9.) When Plaintiff was not traveling, his weekday work hours at the office began around 8:30 or 9:00 a.m. and ended around 5:30 p.m. Plaintiff periodically worked after-hours or on weekends at home, depending upon his workload. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ginyovszky Dep., Pl.'s Ex. 4, at 80-81.) Tarter stated in deposition testimony that she had received communications concerning business from Plaintiff, including phone calls, text messages, and emails, on weekends and on weekdays after 5:00 p.m. (Tarter Dep., Pl.'s Ex. 3, at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Review and Discipline\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before 2015, Plaintiff's overall performance ratings were at or above the \"Met Standards\" level, including \"Exceptional\" ratings in 2005 and in 2008 through 2011. (Pl.'s Ex. 5.) In 2010 and 2013, Plaintiff received salary grade promotions as the \"corporate winner\" for the procurement department. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 5.) Ginyovszky stated in deposition testimony that Plaintiff was \"very knowledgeable in terms of the technical aspect,\" \"was a valuable asset,\" \"took a lot of pride in his work,\" and \"had done a good job.\" (Ginyovszky Dep. at 75-76.) On March 3, 2015, Ginyovszky completed a 2014 Performance Agreement on Plaintiff. Ginyovszky rated Plaintiff's overall job performance for 2014 as 3.6 out of 5, which was rounded up to 4, or \"Below Expectations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 21, 2015 Ginyovszky issued to Plaintiff a written warning for \"routine late arrival to the office\" (the \"May Warning\"). (Pl.'s Ex. 7.) She instructed Plaintiff to be \"at the office no later than 9:00 a.m.\" and \"communicating with [Ginyovsky] when [Plaintiff] would not be in the office or not able to make the designated time frame.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to the May Warning, Plaintiff had never been disciplined for attendance or tardiness. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 7.) Ginyovszky testified she became aware that Plaintiff was coming into work late in Bartlesville from an anonymous letter which she has never seen. (Ginyovszky Dep. at 44:9-21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ginyovszky did not instruct anyone to keep a log of Plaintiff's arrival to work in Bartlesville. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71:2-72:2.) In mid-June of 2015, Plaintiff met with Ginyovszky and Turner regarding\n   Plaintiff's performance. In this meeting, Plaintiff did not receive performance criticism and was not issued further corrective discipline. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. July 2015 Trip to Houston\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 14, 2015 Plaintiff worked part of the day and then traveled to Houston to meet with members of the procurement group, including Ginyovszky. Plaintiff's mid-year review with Ginyovszky was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on July 15. The morning of July 15, Plaintiff worked on his computer at his hotel room in Houston and arrived at Phillips headquarters around noon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) While Plaintiff was meeting with a colleague named Erin Powers, Rupert Turner (\"Turner\") arrived and escorted Plaintiff to an office. Plaintiff had not previously seen or spoken to Ginyovszky or Turner that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff was then escorted to the office of Dr. William Parsons (\"Parsons\"), Chief Medical Director, where he underwent an alcohol test, a five-panel urine test, and a blood sugar test. The results of the tests were negative. Plaintiff had never before met Parsons, and Parsons had never been involved in evaluating Plaintiff's work performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Leave of Absence and Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During Plaintiff's examination on July 15, Parsons indicated that something \"was wrong\" with Plaintiff and told Plaintiff that he was removed from work. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 26.) Phillips placed Plaintiff on short-term disability and Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") leave and sent him home. Plaintiff's return to work was conditioned upon the results of additional exams and drug/alcohol tests by his primary physician in Oklahoma and with Phillips' staff physician at the company's Bartlesville facility. (Ginyovszky Dep. at 39:11-40:9; Pl.'s Ex. 10.) Phillips sent Plaintiff a letter dated July 16, 2015, stating that his short-term disability would extend \"until you are fully released to return to work and our medical team has reviewed and approved the Employee Health Report.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 11.) Plaintiff returned to Bartlesville by jet and drove himself home that night. (Miller Dep. at 19:3-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although Plaintiff had passed all examinations and tests, Parsons was also concerned that there was \"something else there\" in relation to Plaintiff's health, according to Linda Miller (\"Miller\"), an HR employee in Houston. (Miller Dep., Pl.'s Ex. 2, at 15.) Ginyovszky was concerned that Plaintiff was impaired \"health-wise,\" \"alcohol-wise\" or relating to a \"substance.\" (Ginyovszky Dep. at 38:2-5.) However, Ginyovszky did not complete a Supervisor's Checklist to support additional tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:6-15.) Parsons instructed Plaintiff's personal physician to complete an \"Employee Health Report\" on Plaintiff. (Miller Dep. at 20:21-22:17; Pl.'s Ex. 11.) After Plaintiff saw his personal physician, Parsons reported that all additional lab tests were negative and that Plaintiff's physician had deemed him \"completely 'normal.' \" (Pl.'s Ex. 12.) Parsons noted that \"if he is now 'normal,' he discontinued using whatever substance that could have given him these symptoms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was instructed to undergo a third examination with Dr. Karen Ryan (\"Ryan\"), Associate Medical Director for Phillips, to clear Plaintiff prior to his return. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 24, 2015, a Friday, Plaintiff was examined by Ryan and was released to work without restrictions. (Pl.'s Ex. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Plaintiff arrived at work on Monday, July 27, 2015, he met with Tom Schroeder (\"Schroeder\"), an HR employee in Bartlesville. After meeting with Plaintiff, Schroeder completed a summary of his assessment of Plaintiff, noting that Plaintiff denied any drug or alcohol use and stating that \"if he had anything going on in the outside impacting his behavior now is the time to come forward and see [the\n   employee assistance program (\"EAP\") ],\" and that \"we want to ensure that he is clean.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 15.) The same day, Miller noted in an email that Plaintiff \"is acting 'clean' at the moment\" and that Schroeder had \"essentially given him the EAP speech.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff worked for approximately one week then took a previously scheduled three-day vacation. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 29.) When Plaintiff returned from vacation, Phillips terminated his employment on August 6, 2015. Plaintiff was given a document signed by Ginyovszky stating that Plaintiff had \"repeated the same or similar conduct for which [he was] warned.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 17.) After his return from leave, Plaintiff was not counseled or disciplined. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 35.) The only specific dates identified by Ginyovszky that Plaintiff violated the May Warning are July 14 and July 15, 2015. (Ginyovszky Dep. at 55:8-56:17.) At his termination, Plaintiff had worked at Phillips for approximately eighteen years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under company policy, Ginyovszky was required to complete a mid-year review of Plaintiff by July 31, 2015. Plaintiff submitted to Ginyovszky a draft of his portion of the mid-year review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) However, Ginyovszky never issued Plaintiff's mid-year review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Before Plaintiff's termination, Ginyovszky had seen Plaintiff in person approximately five or six times. (Ginyovszky Dep. at 29:10-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff had never failed any drug or alcohol test during his eighteen years of employment with Phillips. (Manna Aff. at \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff maintains that he does not and has not had a mental infirmity or illness and has not been treated for alcohol or substance abuse. Since his termination, he is gainfully employed within his field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Substance Abuse Policy and Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the last year of Plaintiff's employment, Phillips' \"US Substance Abuse Policy\" and \"U.S. Substance Abuse Company Non-DOT Procedures\" were in place and applicable to Plaintiff. The US Substance Abuse Policy provides in part that employees are prohibited from using any substance that \"may alter an individual's mood, perception, coordination, response, performance or judgment\" while on the job or company property. The US Substance Abuse Policy and U.S. Substance Abuse Company Non-DOT Procedures provide that employees may be subject to drug and alcohol testing in cases where at least two supervisors observe physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance abuse or unsatisfactory work performance. Follow-up drug and alcohol testing by Phillips is prescribed only after the employee has successfully completed a required drug treatment program. (Drug &amp; Alcohol Testing Policy, Defs.' Ex. 9, at \u00a7\u00a7 II. E-F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 27, 2016, Plaintiff filed this action, asserting claims against Phillips for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), discrimination by association under ADA, violation of the Oklahoma Testing Act, and retaliation under FMLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff sought and was denied benefits under the Phillips 66 Severance Pay Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is governed by ERISA. On\n   July 25, 2017, with leave of Court, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (Doc. 33) adding a claim against the Plan seeking review of the denial of ERISA benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Phillips filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Brief in Support (Doc. 49) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (\" Rule 56\"), seeking summary judgment in its favor on all of Plaintiff's claims. On October 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a response brief (Doc. 53) in opposition to the motion. In his response, Plaintiff confessed his ADA discrimination by association and FMLA interference claims. Pursuant to the Court's July 26, 2017 ERISA Scheduling Order, Plaintiff and the Plan submitted briefs on Plaintiff's ERISA benefits claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In its summary judgment analysis, the Court resolves all factual disputes and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5409565\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/1106/#p1112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the party seeking to overcome a motion for summary judgment \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Phillips admits that on July 15, 2015, its employees observed that Plaintiff appeared impaired, having slurred speech and difficulty standing. Parsons observed Plaintiff had slowed affect and slurred speech that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff's blood and urine tests were negative, Parsons believed that Plaintiff might be suffering from an unspecified medical condition or under the influence of some substance. Ginyovszky was concerned that there \"was maybe another reason why he seemed impaired\" and that he may have a physical or mental \"health issue.\" (Ginyovszky Dep. at 35.) In addition, Schroeder suggested Plaintiff needed to \"come clean\" and accused him of defeating tests for drugs and alcohol. Therefore, Plaintiff has shown that a reasonable jury could find that Phillips considered Plaintiff to be impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court would normally consider next the second and third elements of a prima facie claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether Plaintiff qualifies for the job and whether he was terminated because of a perceived disability. However, Plaintiff's response brief fails to set forth the basic elements of a claim of ADA discrimination or to directly address the second and third prongs of a prima facie ADA discrimination claim. Because Phillips does not challenge Plaintiff's qualifications to perform his job, the Court assumes for the purpose of this analysis that Plaintiff satisfies the second prima facie element. However, by failing to address the causation element, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie claim of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff could establish the prima facie elements had he addressed them in his response brief, the Court finds that Plaintiff nonetheless has not met his burden to show that Phillips' proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination was pretextual. Phillips has produced evidence that in May of 2015, Plaintiff was warned for late arrivals and unreported absences; that on July 15, 2015 he did not arrive at the Houston office until after noon; and that on his final performance review, he was rated \"Below Expectations.\" Therefore, Phillips has articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , unsatisfactory job performance, including attendance-for terminating Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not met his burden to show these reasons are pretextual. \"To support an inference of pretext ... a plaintiff ... must come forward with evidence that the employer didn't really believe its proffered reasons for action and thus may have been pursuing a hidden discriminatory agenda.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Weld County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522348\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/1202/#p1211\">\n    594 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1211 (10th Cir. 2010). While Plaintiff cites evidence to suggest his performance was not poor enough to warrant termination, he has cited no evidence at all that Phillips' proffered reason was pretextual. Therefore, even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie claim of discrimination, he has not met his burden to support an inference of pretext by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In summary, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie claim of disability discrimination under ADA because he failed to present evidence showing causation. However, even if Plaintiff had established causation, he has failed to rebut Phillips' evidence that he was terminated based on attendance and performance, and not for any discriminatory reason. Accordingly,\n   Phillips is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

However, because OTA prescribes conduct for both the employer and employee and permits an action for lost income damages, Plaintiff argues that he can recover damages under OTA for conduct that is not expressly prohibited. Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State ex rel.

The employee had two negative drug tests before her termination. However, it is far from clear in the facts set forth in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   that the negative tests were connected to the employee's termination. Moreover, the court there focused on the narrow question of whether an employee was required to exhaust administrative remedies under Oklahoma law. Indeed, the court expressly disavowed any opinion on the merits of the plaintiff's cause of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984197\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984197\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/72/\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   lends little, if any, support to Plaintiff's theory of recovery under OTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff contends Phillips violated its own alcohol and drug testing policy by ordering additional drug and alcohol tests after Plaintiff left Houston on July 15, 2015, and failing to produce a required Supervisor Checklist for the second set of tests. Plaintiff argues that Phillips's violation of its own policy shows that it willfully violated OTA. However, Phillips's alleged violation of its drug testing policy by testing Plaintiff is not the cause of Plaintiff's lost income; rather, Plaintiff's alleged loss of income is due to his termination. In Oklahoma, \"an employer may discharge an employee for good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong, without being thereby guilty of legal wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Burk v.

Plaintiff contends the Plan Administrator operated under a conflict of interest because the Plan is self-funded by Phillips, Phillips appointed and compensated\n   the Plan Administrator, and the Plan had access to the value of Plaintiff's benefit claim during its review. The Plan disputes that these elements are sufficient to warrant greater scrutiny. However, the level of deference given to a plan administrator's decision may be \"decrease[d] in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict,\" creating \"in effect a sliding scale of judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Fought v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff contends that his job was eliminated, and therefore his termination was a \"Layoff\" as defined in the Plan, rather than a termination for cause, entitling him to severance pay under the Plan. An employee benefit plan must afford a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial of benefits to any participant.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2)(iv). The Committee Decision states Plaintiff was not laid off but instead was terminated for his \"continued failures following the [May 21, 2015] written warning.\" (AR at 284.) The Committee Decision states in general terms that Plaintiff \"failed to demonstrate any significant improvement in [his] performance and did not demonstrate the commitment necessary to ensure the timely completion of several projects and goals\" after being given the May Warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, it cites no documentation of this alleged failure, either with regard to work performance, timely completion of projects, or hours. Both the Administrator's Decision and Committee Decision cite Plaintiff's 2014 performance review, but because Phillips never issued a 2015 mid-year review to Plaintiff before terminating him, the Plan may have placed undue weight on the 2014 review. Moreover, the record lacks evidence of noncompliance with the May Warning other than on July 14 and 15, 2015, when Plaintiff was traveling to or in Houston. Significantly, neither the Administrator's Decision nor the Committee Decision cites or refers to any item in the record dated later than May 21, 2015 indicating that Plaintiff failed to comply with the May Warning. Both decisions also fail to acknowledge that Ginyovsky, worked in the Houston office and did not keep time records for Plaintiff's work hours or require Plaintiff to report time, and fail to address that Plaintiff was not placed on a formal performance improvement plan before being terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Furthermore, the Committee Decision ignores evidence in the record that Plaintiff complied with the May Warning. In his March 27, 2017 appeal letter, Plaintiff submitted documentation including communications informing Ginyovsky of times when Plaintiff would be out of the office. The Committee Decision does not acknowledge or otherwise address these records. In addition, the Committee failed to respond to Plaintiff's requests for information, including dates on which Plaintiff was allegedly absent without notice and any supporting documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Plan also contends Plaintiff did not qualify for severance pay because Plaintiff did not receive a written Notice of Layoff, as required by the Plan. To the extent the Plan seeks to rely on formal designations or actions entirely within the employer's control, the Court finds greater scrutiny under the \"sliding scale\" is warranted. The\n   Court is unwilling to find Plaintiff ineligible for benefits under the Plan based only on circumstances under Phillips' control. Additionally, the Committee Decision is not based on the absence of a formal Notice of Layoff but on the determination that Plaintiff was terminated for cause. In noting that Plaintiff did not receive a Notice of Layoff, the Committee emphasized that it was\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was terminated for cause that he did not receive a Notice of Layoff. However, as noted, the record lacks adequate evidence supporting the employer's justification for terminating Plaintiff. Accordingly, Plaintiff's supposed termination for cause does not itself excuse the employer's failure to provide Plaintiff with a Notice of Layoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For these reasons, the Plan's decision to deny Plaintiff's claim for severance pay was arbitrary and capricious. The Administrator's Decision and Committee Decision therefore are reversed, and Plaintiff's claim for benefits is remanded to the Plan for further findings and explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiff contends such evidence is not relevant because the notice of termination he was given only mentions Plaintiff's attendance record, and argues that the probative value of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Plaintiff. However, as Phillips notes in its opposition to the Motion in Limine, Plaintiff himself has suggested several different theories in this case as to why he was terminated. The Court will consider such evidence where it may be relevant, as Plaintiff has not shown that any unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of evidence of other reason(s) for his termination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Plaintiff admits this fact but contends it is not material.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    According to Plaintiff, this letter was not produced in discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    In their briefs on this motion, both parties also address a claim of interference under FMLA.

Accordingly, Phillips is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff also alleges that he had a record of an impairment as defined in \u00a7 12102(1)(B).
