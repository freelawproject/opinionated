Plaintiffs are twenty-eight individuals who object to various actions allegedly taken by Israel or Israeli citizens against Palestinians. They bring this case against the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State, and those Departments' Secretaries in their official capacities. Plaintiffs argue that U.S. support-primarily in the form of foreign aid and charitable donations administered or facilitated by Defendants-has helped Israel commit various crimes against Palestinians and that continued aid violates an amalgam of international and domestic laws. They request that the Court \"order agency defendants to stop providing any and all financial and military assistance to Israel.\" Dkt. 2 at 68. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion and will dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must \"accept [Plaintiffs'] well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in ...

Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The nub of Plaintiffs' claim is a \"concern[ ] about the fact that ... American aid dollars ... are going to fund\" Israel, which they allege is responsible for numerous harms to Palestinians. Dkt. 2 at 23 (Compl. \u00b6 19). Primarily, Plaintiffs take issue with the $200 billion they say the United States \"ha[s] given to Israel over the last thirty years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. They contend that this money has funded a \"Master Plan\" to colonize land owned by Palestinians, to \"confiscate Palestinian homes,\" to \"rid[ ] the West Bank and Jerusalem of all non-Jews,\" and to \"permanently annex\" Jerusalem and what Plaintiffs refer to as the \"Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, 26, 33 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28, 44). They argue that this \"Master Plan\" is abetted by U.S. \"financial and military aid\" and that withdrawing this aid would \"exert pressure on Israel\" to cease its unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 28 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that, beyond this \"Master Plan,\" Defendants' aid to Israel has facilitated \"wholesale violence like arson, ethnic cleansing, arms trafficking, [and] the maiming and murdering of Palestinians living near illegal [Israeli] settlements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (Compl. \u00b6 56). The complaint enumerates a litany of offenses the Israeli army has purportedly committed and claims that \"[w]ithout the $200 billion provided by [Defendants,] the Israeli armed forces ... would have lacked sufficient funding to ... commit these horrendous war crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-46 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-68). Of particular relevance to the pending motion, Plaintiffs allege that U.S. aid has helped support the confiscation of property belonging to Plaintiffs Ali Ali and Linda Kateeb; they allege that they \"lost their private property\" after it was \"seized and [later] occupied by belligerent settlers who are protected by the Israeli army,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   which they argue was funded by U.S. aid dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (Compl. \u00b6 4). This seizure, moreover, was allegedly made \"without due process\" and \"[b]ecause of their national Palestinian heritage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 17 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants' decisions to continue to provide aid to Israel are arbitrary and capricious because they have \"adopt[ed] a pro-Israel double standard and ... [have] not adher[ed] to their own regulations which prohibit funding ethnic cleansing, genocide and the de-nationalization of a civilian population.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-68 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-103).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' theory of standing relies on two distinct groups of injuries. First, twenty-six of those bringing suit assert injuries based on their concerns as taxpayers about U.S. government decisions that purportedly facilitate Israeli actions detrimental to Palestinians. Second, Plaintiffs Kateeb and Ali allege that Israeli settlers took their property with the support of the Israeli military. The Court concludes that the former group lacks standing because it has failed to assert a sufficiently particularized and concrete injury in fact and that the latter group lacks standing because Kateeb and Ali have not adequately alleged either a sufficient causal link between the challenged actions and their injuries or that any deprivation of property they suffered would be redressable by a favorable decision. The Court discusses these defects in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Injury in Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The only injury the majority of the plaintiffs allege is their shared \"concern[ ]\" as \"American taxpayers\" that Defendants' conduct violates various laws, treaties, norms, and policies. These twenty-six plaintiffs argue that they are concerned about how U.S. foreign aid is used; whether that aid violates any \"clear congressional mandates,\" the Constitution, or executive orders; whether the United States is supporting the commission of \"war crimes;\" and how the aid impacts America's \"image ... especially in the Muslim world and the Middle East,\" thereby potentially \"encourag[ing] violent attacks on American citizens travelling or performing military services abroad.\" Dkt. 2 at 23-24, 27 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 29). None of these concerns amounts to an Article III injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To suffice for standing purposes, an injury must be particularized; that is, the plaintiff must be \"affect[ed] ... in a personal and individual way.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

In particular, Plaintiffs allege that both Ali and Kateeb \"lost their private property\" after it was \"seized and [later] occupied by belligerent settlers who are protected by the Israeli army,\" an army funded in part by U.S. aid dollars. Dkt. 2 at 14-15 (Compl. \u00b6 4).

The deprivation of property, even when that property is held abroad, constitutes a concrete and particularized injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardenas v.

The Court, accordingly, turns to whether Ali and Kateeb have carried their burden with respect to the remaining two elements of Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Causation and Redressability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite having alleged an injury in fact, Ali and Kateeb nevertheless lack standing because the causal link between Defendants' actions in providing or facilitating foreign aid and other assistance to Israel and Plaintiffs' injury is too attenuated. For substantially the same reasons, moreover, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden with respect to redressability. The Court considers these elements together because when, \"as in this case, a plaintiff's asserted injury arises from the government's allegedly unlawful\" behavior directed at \"someone else, ... causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or inaction-and perhaps on the response of others as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the theory of standing advanced in\n   <em>\n    Abulhawa\n   </em>\n   and repeated here falls outside this general rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The allegations advanced for the first time in this case, which focus on U.S. foreign aid, fare no better. To establish that the purely prospective injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs would redress their alleged injuries requires some version of the following chain of reasoning: (1) Defendants directly or indirectly distribute aid to the Israeli military or Israeli settlers; (2) those recipients directly or indirectly use that assistance to aid those who actually confiscated Ali's and Kateeb's property; (3) the Israeli military or the settlers would stop assisting those who actually confiscated Ali's and Kateeb's property if Defendants' conduct were enjoined; (4) in the absence of that assistance, those who actually confiscated Ali's and Kateeb's property would find no other source of assistance and would be forced to abandon the confiscated property; and (5) that property would then be returned to Ali and Kateeb. This chain of reasoning is too remote and too speculative for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the complaint vaguely refers to the \"direct and indirect\" provision of aid to often-unidentified entities, requiring that the Court speculate about the actual path of the funds, the various intermediate steps, the ultimate recipients, and their relationship to the control of Plaintiffs' property. The complaint also makes no effort to identify the specific source of the\n   funds that are allegedly being used to prevent Ali and Kateeb from recovering their property, whether those funds are administered by any of the Defendant agencies, and whether those agencies have any discretion to withhold the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, as in\n   <em>\n    Abulhawa\n   </em>\n   , this is not a case in which Defendants confiscated or currently hold Ali's and Kateeb's property. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that third parties assisted (or indirectly assisted) by Defendants were responsible for confiscating the property and that enjoining U.S. aid would mean that \"settlers and Israeli army personnel would be unable to maintain and support the settlements that encompass Plaintiffs' stolen land.\" Dkt. 25 at 9-10. Plaintiffs' injury and any relief from that injury, accordingly, ultimately flow from the responses of third parties to Defendants' actions.

Most notably, Plaintiffs describe\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   sources of assistance as contributing to the deprivation of their property: direct aid from the U.S. government and contributions from private individuals (made either directly or through charitable organizations). Although Plaintiffs at times state that the seizure of their property could not continue in the absence of direct government support, they elsewhere allege that a key ingredient in aggression against Palestinians, including Ali and Kateeb, has in fact been private contributions that support the efforts of \"violent militia members\" to do things like \"acquire Kalashnikovs, sniper scopes, percussion grenades, guard dogs, [and] night vision goggles.\" Dkt. 2 at 65 (Compl. \u00b6 97).

Thus, to allege standing, they must allege facts-and not merely conclusions-sufficient to establish that the settlements would \"likely\" be abandoned, and the property would \"likely\" be returned to Ali and Kateeb, if U.S. aid to Israel were curtailed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator Indep.
