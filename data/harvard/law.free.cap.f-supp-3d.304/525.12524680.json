After careful consideration of the motion, response, reply, appendixes, record, and applicable law, the court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the employment of Plaintiff Christina Holmes (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Holmes\") by Defendant North Texas Health Care Laundry Cooperative Association, d/b/a North Texas Health Care Laundry (\"NTHCL\" or \"Defendant\"). Holmes alleges that shortly after she began working at NTHCL she was subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by David Hernandez (\"Hernandez\"), NTHCL's general manager, culminating in numerous sexual encounters over the course of several months. Holmes commenced this action on June 23, 2015, asserting federal claims against NTHCL for sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"), as well as state law claims of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, battery, assault, gross negligence, and negligent investigation. She seeks compensatory and exemplary damages, as well as prejudgment and postjudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. NTHCL has filed a\n   motion for summary judgment, contending that no genuine disputes of material fact exist with respect to Holmes's asserted claims, and that it is, therefore, entitled to entry of judgment as a matter of law. NTHCL also seeks summary judgment on its\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   affirmative defense with respect to Holmes's Title VII claims. The court now sets forth the facts upon which it relies to resolve the summary judgment motion. In setting forth the facts, the court applies the summary judgment standard as set forth in the following section. The facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   NTHCL is a specialty laundry service based in Grand Prairie, Texas, and provides clean linens to numerous hospitals and clinics in Texas. Foussard Montague Associates, Inc. (\"FMA\"), NTHCL's management company, provides it with a general manager to work out of its Grand Prairie facility. At all relevant times, Hernandez held the general manager position at NTHCL and was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 15, 2013, NTHCL hired Holmes to work as a customer service representative. On her first day, Holmes met with Mary Khan (\"Khan\"), NTHCL's human resources manager, to review and complete her employee paperwork and review safety videos. As part of her orientation that day, Holmes received a copy of NTHCL's Employee Handbook \"outlin[ing] the policies and work rules of the company and [her] responsibilities as an employee.\" Def.'s Summ. J. App. 46. Together, Holmes and Khan reviewed portions of the Employee Handbook. Holmes also signed an acknowledgment page confirming that she received the Employee Handbook and would read it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Employee Handbook contains a \"Policy Against Harassment,\" which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   North Texas Health Care Laundry Cooperative Association is committed to providing a work place that is free of unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, age or citizenship. Unlawful harassment, including that of a sexual nature, is also prohibited. Sexual harassment is strictly prohibited. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favor, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute[ ] sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is either explicitly or implicitly made a condition of employment, used as a basis for employment decisions, or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with work performance or creates a hostile atmosphere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Employment means anything that affects the employment relationship. Examples include promotions, disciplinary actions and work assignments. Sexual harassment also includes, but is not limited to, unsolicited and unwelcome sexually related comments or jokes, touching, art work, magazines or calendars. If you believe you have been sexually harassed, you are expected to report it promptly to your manager or supervisor or General Manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   An investigation will follow. Any warranted corrective action will be taken. Retaliation against any employee who has reported a sexual harassment complaint is strictly prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Initially, Holmes was supervised by Jake McCuiston (\"McCuiston\"), NTHCL's Customer Service Manager. In or around September 2013, McCuiston found another job and tendered his resignation. FMA made the decision to transfer another NTHCL employee, Will Chavez (\"Chavez\"), into the Customer Service Manager position, and he became Holmes's direct supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In or around October 2013, Holmes and Hernandez began exchanging text and e-mail messages of an informal nature using their work e-mail accounts. Beginning in March 2014, e-mail and text messages became more frequent and more personal. On March 12, 2014, for example, Holmes sent Hernandez a text message containing a link to \"Gorilla,\" a sexually graphic song by Bruno Mars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holmes also referenced romantic songs in her communications with Hernandez, such as \"All of Me\" by John Legend,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating her belief that \"every verse of that song applies to us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At around this time, Holmes and Hernandez began to use private g-mail accounts to communicate with each other, rather than their work e-mails. Holmes created her own g-mail account under the name \"missevasive1@gmail.com,\" which she only used for purposes of communicating with Hernandez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. On March 13, 2014, Holmes sent a g-mail message to Hernandez at his g-mail address, \"dalyd72@gmail.com,\" stating \"I am incredibly attracted to you. I don't know what it is. I feel safe when I am around you but you also make me feel sexy. I haven't felt that way, ever.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After this e-mail, Holmes and Hernandez exchanged hundreds of e-mails, many of which were sexually graphic and lascivious in nature, many initiated by Holmes, others initiated by Hernandez, and many in which Holmes stated that she missed Hernandez, wanted to be with him, and loved him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70, 81-381. Among the hundreds of e-mails are the following excerpts authored by Holmes and sent to Hernandez:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 March 13, 2014\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I look forward to each morning that I get to see you and don't want this time with you to end.

My favorite is doggy style. I want you to be in control, that's what I like. I am not a big fan of oral, has to do with my messed up head (part of my story that has yet to be told).

These e-mails are just examples of the voluminous e-mails exchanged by Holmes and Hernandez between March 2014 and the beginning of May 2014, that are sexually graphic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Holmes also sent e-mail messages to Hernandez stating that she did not want their relationship to end. For example, she e-mailed him and said: \"I am so thankful I have found you and you have found me to bring my emotions alive. I love this feeling. I don't ever want it to stop[ ]\"; and \"I will have this memory locked away for the rest of my life. It is such a sexy and intimate memory. I want more. I thought I was addicted before, now I don't even know how to describe it[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84, 119, 135, 166. Holmes also sent Hernandez photos of herself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 259, 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to these e-mails, Holmes informed Hernandez in many other e-mails that she missed him, wanted to be with him, and loved him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86, 101, 111, 145, 156, 159, 162, 179, 180, 185, 200-03, 212-13, 215, 221, 227, 241, 244, 273, 276-77. Some examples are the following e-mails sent by Holmes to Hernandez:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 March 15, 2014\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   When he [sic] is gone, I am checking this email like crazy!

Holmes also stated in an e-mail that it scared her to think of what they had ending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Hernandez similarly sent voluminous e-mails to Holmes during the same time period, many containing playful banter and stating he was attracted to her, and many that were sexually graphic or described sexual fantasies and sexual acts he wanted to perform with her or had performed with her.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-381. For example, after receiving the link Hernandez sent him to Bruno Mars's sexually graphic song titled \"Gorilla,\"\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 3, Hernandez e-mailed Holmes stating: \"I just listened to the Gorilla song. I still find that song very sexy ... like you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92. As part of the same e-mail chain, he later stated: \"I can't wait to see what fate has in store for us. Do you like it when I kiss you?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. On March 16, 2014, Hernandez sent Holmes a series of e-mails answering certain questions she had posed to him in a prior e-mail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Ok my angel here goes the rest. [Y]our 5th question was what was my favorite position? I am very passionate when it comes to making love. l wasn't [sic] to see and feel everything.

I do not like one position because during one sexual encounter you must be in several positions. I don't have a favorite[.] I guess the one that makes you cum the best is my favorite position. If I had to choose I would say that any position where I can hold you tightly and be able to see your eyes are [sic] my favorite. Does that answer your question[?] You will find out Tuesday morning ... lol\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   question 7: blush blush-this must have been a hard question for you to ask.

The next day, Hernandez sent Holmes an explicit e-mail saying: \"I love\n   cumming when you are on top. The reason: because I get to see you and feel you [sic] expressions ... mmmh. [P]ut it on the list.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. Hernandez also sent many e-mails describing his sexual fantasies about Holmes, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   We both are walking into a hotel room very businesslike ... We walk down the hallway toward 214 and kissing as we walk. We open the door, rush inside and continue the intense kissing. Slowly pieces of your clothes start coming off. I push you against the door from the inside and proceed to raise your skirt and I go to one knee. I then start licking your p***y so good[.] I placed one leg on the couch near by and was kissing you through your underwear[.] I play with my tongue on your p***y licking you getting you wetter.... mmm ... I can hear you enjoying these crazy moment [sic.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   To be continued ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131. The record contains e-mails from Hernandez to Holmes of this nature through May 1, 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 257, 259-64, including an e-mail asking Holmes to tell him \"her wildest fantasies\" so he could \"make them come true.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266. In that same e-mail, in addition to detailing sexual activities graphically, he stated: \"This might not be very romantic but you have to understand that there is a piece of our chemistry that has absolutely nothing to do with Romance or pretty. There is a part of our relationship that is just wild[,] free[,] animalistic[,] sexual desire in its purest form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition to the voluminous e-mail exchanges between Holmes and Hernandez described above, Holmes and Hernandez's relationship became physical beginning on March 14, 2014, when they had their first sexual encounter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 448. In March 2014 and April 2014, Holmes and Hernandez met and engaged in sexual relations on numerous occasions in various locations, including parking lots, hotels, and at NTHCL's facility in the early morning hours before other employees arrived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 448-50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   During this time, Holmes was living with her fianc\u00e9 Gary Dutchover (\"Dutchover\"). The two were planning to be married in October 2014. Dutchover found out about the affair between Holmes and Hernandez in the beginning of May 2014. On May 3, 2014, he confronted Holmes and she admitted to her affair with Hernandez. Dutchover called off the wedding and took back the engagement ring. On May 3, 2014, Dutchover called Hernandez's wife to tell her about her husband's relationship with Holmes and also called one of FMA's principals, Tim Montague (\"Montague\"), to inform him about the affair. After speaking with Dutchover, Montague conversed\n   briefly with Holmes on the telephone to set up a meeting in Grand Prairie on May 5, 2014, to discuss the matter. On May 5, Montague, Khan, Dutchover, Holmes, and Holmes's mother held a meeting at a restaurant near Holmes's residence. Montague advised Holmes at the meeting that she would be permitted two weeks paid leave while NTHCL investigated the allegations. After being notified of the affair between Hernandez and Holmes, FMA hired a third-party investigator and instructed Hernandez to stay away from the NTHCL facility pending the investigation. Although FMA's investigation found no evidence of sexual harassment by Hernandez, citing a \"breach of trust\" and a loss of confidence in Hernandez, FMA demanded that Hernandez resign or he would be terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 402. Hernandez submitted his resignation effective May 9, 2014. Although the term \"resignation\" is used, Hernandez was effectively discharged or fired because he was \"forced\" to resign. Had he not resigned, he would have been discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   By letter dated May 15, 2014, NTHCL informed Holmes that Hernandez was no longer employed or associated with NTHCL, and that: \"Your position as Customer Service Representative is still available to you. As such, we look forward to you returning to work on Monday, May 19, 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42. Holmes did not return to work after the two weeks of paid leave, did not communicate with NTHCL about its May 15, 2014 letter inviting her to return to her position, and never returned to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 25, 2015, more than a year later and after retaining Holmes on its group health insurance plan, NTHCL formally separated Holmes's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Holmes never reported Hernandez's alleged sexual harassment to anyone at work or outside work and came forward only after Dutchover found out about the affair and reported it to Montague on May 3, 2014. Holmes filed a Charge of Discrimination\n   with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), complaining of sexual harassment. Holmes received her right-to-sue letter on April 20, 2015, and filed this lawsuit on June 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On November 18, 2016, NTHCL filed its motion for summary judgment. The court now considers this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Holmes's repeated failure to identify competent summary judgment evidence in the record to support her arguments in opposition to NTHCL's Motion for Summary Judgment has made the court's job more onerous. In many instances, although the court has conducted a close review of Holmes's appendix, the court has been unable to find any evidence to support her conclusory assertions. In these instances, and where Holmes has failed to meet her duty to identify evidence in the record to support her assertions, as set out more fully below, the court concludes she has failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact on that particular issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In her response, however, Holmes only responds to NTHCL's arguments with respect to her sexual harassment claim. She fails to address her remaining claims for retaliation under Title VII or her state law claims, much less respond to any of NTHCL's arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment on these claims. The court concludes that Holmes has abandoned or waived her claims against NTHCL for retaliation under Title VII and her state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   When a party fails to pursue a claim or defense beyond the party's initial pleading, the claim is deemed abandoned or waived.\n   <em>\n    Black v.

While the court recognizes that, in many instances, the question of whether particular conduct was unwelcome presents problems of proof and can turn on credibility determinations committed to the trier of fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p64\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that does not preclude summary judgment in cases like this when, accepting as true the plaintiff's sworn assertions, it cannot be reasonably disputed that, based on her own conduct, Hernandez's interactions with Holmes were welcomed and encouraged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zhao v.

His conduct is no cause for approbation. His conduct was ignominious, reprehensible, and showed a total lack of judgment on his part, as he was the general manager of NTHCL. The record, however, shows that Holmes\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Hernandez were mutual and willing participants in the sexual banter and conduct, and no competent summary judgment evidence indicates otherwise.

Regarding this fourth element of a prima facie case for a Title VII sexual harassment hostile work environment claim,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [h]arassment affects a term, condition, or privilege of employment if it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.

This includes the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.

With respect to the first element, which focuses on the company's conduct, it is undisputed that NTHCL had a detailed \"Policy Against Harassment.\" It is further undisputed that as part of her orientation on her first day on the job, Holmes received a copy of NTHCL's Employee Handbook \"outlin[ing] the policies and work rules of the company and [her] responsibilities as an employee.\" Defs.'

From this uncontroverted evidence, the court concludes that it is undisputed that NTHCL exercised reasonable care to prevent and to promptly investigate and address the reported sexual harassment of Holmes. In response, Holmes cites to one case-a case in which the court held that an employer's policy was deficient in a way that would negate the employer's\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   affirmative defense-to support her argument that NTHCL's \"Policy Against Harassment\" was deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp.

After comparing NTHCL's policy with the policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    Boh Brothers\n   </em>\n   , the court agrees. In addition, NTHCL's Policy Against Harassment was contained in the Employee Handbook, which Holmes acknowledged receiving and agreed to read. Further, although Holmes asserts that \"[t]he policies and procedures of NTHCL were clearly a farce[,]\" Pl.'s Resp. Br. 19 (Doc. 76-1), it is undisputed that, after receiving its first report about Hernandez's alleged harassing conduct, Hernandez was instructed not to return to the Grand Prairie facility pending the investigation, and ultimately ordered to either resign or be terminated, after which he resigned, all within less than one week of the first report of his alleged sexual harassment. Finally, the policy unambiguously specifies that an employee was expected to report any sexually harassing conduct to her manager, supervisor, or general manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With regard to the second element of the\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   affirmative defense, which focuses on whether the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of an employer's preventative or corrective opportunities, the record demonstrates that Holmes never reported the harassment of which she complains, notwithstanding that she acknowledged receiving the Employee Handbook and the \"Policy Against Harassment,\" until after Dutchover informed Montague of Hernandez's alleged harassment on May 3, 2014. From this evidence, the court concludes that Holmes failed to avail herself of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by NTHCL, and she has failed to offer any legitimate reason for her failure to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 807,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/#p786\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11510955\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/278/#p283\">\n    213 F.3d at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of employer-provided preventive or corrective opportunities when he suffered at least fifteen propositions over a four-month period but never reported any of the incidents until months after the last one);\n   <em>\n    Scrivner v.

Further, Holmes's statement in her Affidavit that it was not clear to her to whom she should report Hernandez's conduct is not supported by the record. The policy itself explicitly stated that the conduct was to be reported to either her manager or supervisor. Further, the undisputed facts show that on May 3, 2014, Hernandez's conduct was reported to FMA's principal, Montague. On this record, the court concludes that NTHCL has satisfied the second element of the affirmative defense. No reasonable trier of fact could find that Holmes has raised a genuine dispute of material fact that she took\n   advantage of NTHCL's preventive or corrective opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the court determines that, even had Holmes presented evidence creating a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the alleged sexual harassment was unwelcome or whether it affected a \"term, condition, or privilege\" of her employment, her claim nevertheless fails because NTHCL has demonstrated, under these facts, that it is entitled to summary judgment on the\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   affirmative defense. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that no genuine disputes of material fact exist regarding the\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   defense, and because NTHCL has established both requirements of its affirmative defense, NTHCL is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Holmes's sexual harassment hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   NTHCL has filed various objections to Holmes's summary judgment evidence, and Holmes has filed various objections to NTHCL's evidence. To the extent the court has relied upon any evidence to which an objection was made, the court has ruled on the objection in the footnotes to this decision. Holmes has also included with her appendix an affidavit from her expert witness, Shari Julian, Ph. D., a licensed professional counselor\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Summ. J. App. 116-213 (Affidavit and attachments). Holmes does not identify for the court the capacity in which Dr. Julian will be providing expert testimony. In her response brief, Holmes cites to Dr. Julian's Affidavit\n   <em>\n    once\n   </em>\n   , namely, to support her assertion that not being allowed to work from home caused her to be subjected to ridicule in the workplace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Br. 18 (Doc. 76-1). Holmes fails to identify a specific page in her appendix to support this assertion and, as previously noted by the court, it is not incumbent upon the court to scour the record for evidentiary support. Further, under the \"sham affidavit\" doctrine, the court previously sustained NTHCL's objection to Holmes's statement in her Affidavit that after Hernandez resigned, she was not permitted to work from home and was fired by NTHCL, as these statements contradicted her sworn deposition testimony that she was not terminated or fired, but just never went back to work, notwithstanding NTHCL's open invitation for her to return to work.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 7. As the only basis for which Holmes cites Dr. Julian's Affidavit has been rendered moot by the court's ruling, Dr. Julian's testimony is not relevant to any matter at hand and, therefore, will not be considered. On this basis alone, the court\n   <strong>\n    sustains\n   </strong>\n   NTHCL's objection to the Affidavit of Dr. Julian submitted with Holmes's appendix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In addition, the court agrees with NTHCL that Holmes has failed to meet her burden of showing how Dr. Julian's testimony satisfies Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides guidance on the admissibility of expert testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Supreme Court has held that Rule 702 requires the district court to act as a \"gatekeeper\" to ensure that \"any and all scientific evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

J. Evid. 3 (Doc. 76-3). The court\n    <strong>\n     overrules\n    </strong>\n    her objections. As an initial matter, Holmes fails to specify which statements in the record are unauthenticated or contain inadmissible hearsay but merely lodges a general objection to all the e-mails contained in pages 78-381 of NTHCL's appendix. The court is not under a duty to parse through the evidence, determine which evidence forms the basis of Holmes's objection, and consider and rule on the objection. For this reason alone, the court overrules Holmes's objection. In any event, the e-mails are properly authenticated and are not hearsay. \"To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims.\" Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). E-mails and other electronic records are authenticated under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(4), under which evidence may be authenticated by its \"appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances.\" Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4). Pages 78-381 of NTHCL's appendix are comprised of printouts of e-mail messages exchanged between Holmes and Hernandez, using their g-mail accounts, between mid-March 2014 and early May 2014. Each message indicates the sender, recipient, and date and time of transmission. Further, Holmes does not dispute NTHCL's contention that most of these e-mail messages were initially produced by her counsel to NTHCL's counsel in June 2014, and again during the litigation in response to NTHCL's discovery requests. In addition, at her deposition, while Holmes stated she did not recall certain e-mail exchanges, she did not deny the conversations took place or that the e-mail messages to which she now objects were what they purported to be.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Summ. J. App. 32, 66, 69-70, 79, 81-82. With respect to Holmes's objection that the e-mails are inadmissible hearsay, the court concludes that the e-mail printouts are excluded from the hearsay rule under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A), as they are statements made by Holmes, a party opponent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) (excluding from the definition of hearsay an admission offered against an opposing party that \"was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity[.]\"). Alternatively, the statements contained in the e-mails are not hearsay because they are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    that Holmes, in fact, entertained sexual fantasies about Hernandez in the bathtub), but to show that the alleged sexual harassment was not unwelcome.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2) (An out-of court statement is hearsay when it is \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Holmes objects to Hernandez's affidavit testimony that he and Holmes had a sexual relationship as inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Obj. to Def.'s Summ. J. Evid. 2 (Doc. 76-3). As previously stated,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 4, because Holmes's objection is not made with the requisite specificity, the court is under no duty to consider it. In any event, the court\n    <strong>\n     overrules\n    </strong>\n    this objection. Hernandez's affidavit testimony that he and Holmes met in parking lots, hotels, and at work to engage in sexual relations is based on his personal observations, which are not classified as hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Alternatively, to the extent any of Hernandez's statements regarding their sexual encounters are hearsay, the court concludes they are nevertheless admissible under Rule 803(3) as evidence attempting to show his then-existing state of mind.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) (creating an exception to the hearsay rule when the proponent of evidence is attempting to prove \"the declarant's then existing state of mind.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    In her Affidavit filed in support of her response, Holmes states that after Hernandez's resignation, NTHCL \"would not accommodate [her] request to work from home\" and fired her.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Summ. J. App. 115, 117 (Doc. 76-2). Again invoking the \"sham-affidavit\" doctrine, NTHCL objects to these statements, arguing they are inconsistent with Holmes's sworn deposition testimony and, therefore, should not be considered by the court in evaluating whether she has raised a genuine dispute of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Obj.

Tex. 2011) (Under the \"sham affidavit\" doctrine, a \"nonmovant cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment by submitting an affidavit [that] contradicts, without explanation, [her] previous testimony.\") (citations omitted). At her deposition, Holmes testified that she was not fired or terminated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Summ. J. App. 8. Further, she never asserted that she asked her employer to allow her to work from home. Rather, she admitted receiving NTHCL's letter informing her that Hernandez no longer worked for the company and inviting her to return to her position as customer service representative after her two-week paid leave of absence, and that, thereafter, she simply did not return to work and never responded to NTHCL's letter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 8, 10, 42. The court concludes that Holmes's affidavit testimony is not merely supplementing and clarifying her deposition testimony, but it contradicts her prior sworn deposition testimony that she was not fired or terminated by NTHCL but simply did not return to work. Further, Holmes offers no explanation for this inconsistency. Accordingly, the court will not consider Holmes's statement in her Affidavit that NTHCL would not accommodate her request to work from home and fired her in addressing NTHCL's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    In addition to arguing that Holmes has waived or abandoned many of her claims, NTHCL notes that although Holmes identifies as Count One of her Complaint \"Harassment and Retaliation,\" \"there are no allegations of retaliation in that section or elsewhere.\" Def.'s Summ. J. Br. 14 n.113. To allege a prima facie case of retaliation, a Title VII plaintiff must set forth allegations to show, or from which the court can reasonably infer, that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal nexus between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Perez v.

The court has carefully reviewed the Complaint and finds no allegations that would support a retaliation claim. To the extent Holmes intended to assert a retaliation claim, the court concludes that, in addition to abandoning or waiving this claim, she has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and her retaliation claim will be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), as well as under Rule 56 for failure to provide any summary judgment evidence in support of a retaliation claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    In her response brief, Holmes includes a list of what she deems \"tangible employment actions.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp.
