(\n  <em>\n   See generally\n  </em>\n  ECF No. 2.)\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  On or about November 14, 2014, the\n  stone cutting machine was shipped from the Port La Spezia; it arrived at the Port of Newark, New Jersey on or about December 13, 2014. (ECF No. 2 at \u00b6 20.) Two days later, Xpertfreight, a \"motor carrier,\" arranged for World Distribution Services (\"WDS\"), to pick up the stone cutting machine. (ECF No. 80-1 at 4.) WDS arranged for Harbor Freight Transport Corp. (\"Harbor Freight\") to transport the stone cutting machine from the Port of Newark Container Terminal to its facilities in Newark-the total transport was two miles and took about ten minutes. (ECF No. 102-1 at 3.)\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Two bills of lading were issued for the shipment of the stone cutting machine. There was a port-to-port bill of lading covering the shipment from Port La Spezia to Port Newark (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 133-1.) and a separate bill of lading issued by U.S. Express in Port Newark to cover the inland travel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 133-2.) The inland bill of lading governs in this case.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about December 18, 2014, US Express picked up the stone cutting machine from Harbor Freight's facilities to transport it to Heber, Utah. (ECF No. 2 at \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 102-1 at 7.) At the time of pick up, US Express' driver, Rafik Nazarov, signed an Invoice/Pick-up Receipt provided by Harbor Freight which contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Customer agrees that when HARBOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT CORP releases goods to customer or its authorized representative, including any common carrier or bailee engaged by Customer, that HARBOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT CORP will have no further obligation or responsibility to Customer or the goods.

Upon delivery, US Express' driver added the following hand-written note to the Invoice/Pick-up Receipt provided by Harbor Freight:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   US Express/Seran Salomon recognizes and acknowledges that they have bent and broken this machine and not limited to other unseen or undetected damage upon delivery. US Express accepts all responsibility to fix and replace if Delta Stone is not satisfied with machinery per the original and new agreement with manufacturer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (ECF No. 102-1 at 8.) Sometime thereafter, Vericlaim conducted a Marine Cargo Survey Report of the transport of the stone cutting machine and concluded: \"Damages were caused when US Express[sic] truck driver, Mr. Seran Salamon, utilized ratchet cargo straps over the top of the machine to secure the protective tarp during inland transit.\" (ECF No. 102-1 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result of the damage to the stone cutting machine, Delta Stone alleges it was delayed in performing its obligations for a government project, incurring approximately $386,170 in damages, as well as $44,441 in repairs. (ECF No. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-5.) Delta Stone filed suit in May 2016, alleging the following claims: 1) Carmack Amendment Liability against Xpertfreight, US Express, Seran Salamon, Rakiv Nazarov, Embassy Cargo, and Harbor Freight; 2) Breach of Contract against Xpertfreight, US Express, Seran Salamon, Rakiv Nazarov, Embassy Cargo, and Harbor Freight; 3) Negligence against Xpertfreight, US Express, Seran Salamon, Rakiv Nazarov, Embassy Cargo, and Harbor Freight; and 4) Breach of Insurance Contract against RSA-Sun Insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS (ECF No. 79)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Xpertfreight moved to dismiss Delta Stone's second and third causes of action for breach of contract and negligence pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \"To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead sufficient allegations 'to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brokers' Choice of Am., Inc., v.

Under those circumstances, where plaintiff asserted control over the cargo, the court concluded a factfinder could find plaintiff served as a \"motor carrier\" and thus denied summary judgment on Plaintiff's Carmack Amendment claim. Here, the record does not show Delta Stone exerted that type of control over the cargo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, as the evidence relied upon to dispute the facts referenced above, Delta Stone cited Bill of Lading DS000042 and Invoice XI004, both documents which list Xpertfreight as a \"carrier.\" (ECF No. 97 at 3.) As discussed previously, Delta Stone acknowledged at the hearing there is no evidence in the record Xpertfreight prepared either of these documents. Moreover, documents prepared by third-parties listing Xpertfreight as a \"carrier\" cannot create a genuine issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chubb Group of Ins. Co. v. H.A.

But the statements in paragraph 20 of Xpertfreight's Declaration do not address the material facts alleged above. In the Declaration it is simply averred that on December 15, 2014, Xpertfreight arranged for WDS to pick up/transfer the stone cutting machine from the Port of Newark Container Terminal to WDS' facilities in Newark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80-1. On the other hand, the evidence cited by Xpertfreight, especially the transcript of US Express' deposition, supports each of these two factual assertions.

Accordingly, Delta Stone's conclusory allegations of dispute, without supporting evidence on the record, do not create a genuine issue of fact with respect to these two facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Delta Stone disputes the following alleged fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   29. On a brokered load, it is not uncommon for a shipper or other third party to list the broker's name in the carrier identification box on a bill of lading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Xpertfreight Dec. \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   US Express Depo.

The assertion must be rejected. The evidence cited by Xperfreight, US Express's testimony provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. In your experience in the transportation industry, is it common on a brokered load for the broker's name to appear in the carrier box on a bill of lading?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US Express Depo.

Shipping Document Execution: Carriers are to be named on the bill of lading as the 'carrier of record[.]' \" (ECF No. 80-1 at pg. 12.) Given the provision in the Broker/Carrier Agreement, and US Express' testimony, it was not unfounded for Xpertfreight to allege that \"the shipper or a third-party\" were the ones who listed its name on the carrier identification box on the bill of lading. \"When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.... Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there\n   is no 'genuine issue for trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

Here, Delta Stone proffered no evidence to dispute this fact. It simply averred that the fact \"assume[s] facts not in evidence.\" This alone is not enough, when the record is taken as a whole fails to create a genuine issue for trial. Ultimately, it is undisputed by Delta Stone that the Broker/Carrier Agreement between US Express and Xpertfreight lists US Express as the \"licensed motor carrier\" and Xpertfreight as the \"licensed property broker.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80-1 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97 at pg. 4.) Accordingly, the court likewise concludes this is not a \"genuine dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In reviewing the record, other evidence supports Xpertfreight's motion. Delta Stone did not dispute that the Broker/Carrier Agreement states Xpertfreight's role as broker was to \"negotiate and arrange for transportation of their shipments in interstate commerce.\" (ECF No. 80-1 at pg. 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97 at 4.) This acknowledgment by Delta Stone fits squarely with the statutory definition of a \"broker,\" meaning a \"person, other than a motor carrier or an employee or agent of a motor carrier, that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale,\n   <strong>\n    negotiates\n   </strong>\n   for, or holds itself out by solicitations, advertisement, or otherwise as selling, providing, or\n   <strong>\n    arranging for\n   </strong>\n   , transportation by motor carrier for compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (emphasis added). Likewise, Delta Stone did not dispute the Invoice/Pick-Up Receipt identifies US Express, not Xpertfreight, as the \"trucker\" who transported the stone cutting machine to Heber. (ECF No.97 at p.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Taking these undisputed facts, and the record as a whole, the evidence before the court is that Xpertfreight negotiated and arranged for the transportation of the stone cutting machine from New Jersey to Utah by motor carrier US Express, but it did not take possession of the stone cutting machine, nor transport it at any time. Thus, Xpertfreight's role in this transaction fits the statutory definition of a broker, not \"(A) the receiving carrier, (B) the delivering carrier, or (C) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States[,]\" as required to find liability under the Carmack Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Because Carmack Amendment liability applies only to carriers, and since brokers are not carriers, brokers like Xpertfreight are not liable for damage to property under the Carmack Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AIG Europe (Netherlands), N.V. v.

Cal. Nov. 29, 2010) (\"brokers are not carriers for purposes of the Carmack Amendment\"). Based on this precedent, the court grants Xpertfreight's motion for summary judgment on the claim for Carmack Amendment liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Delta Stone argues that if Xpertfreight is a broker, rather than a carrier, its claim for breach of contract should survive summary judgment. Even if Xpertfreight's preemption argument were to fail, which it does not, Delta Stone's breach\n   of contract claim fails. In the first place, there are no facts pleaded which would support a contract between Delta Stone and Xpertfreight. The contract was between Xpertfreight and US Express. Recognizing this flaw in its claim, Delta Stone argues that Delta Stone is a third part beneficiary of that contract. (ECF No. 97, at 10-14.) Delta Stone claims that it was the intended beneficiary of the agreement for US Express to transport the equipment to Heber. Even accepting that Delta Stone may be able to prove it was the intended beneficiary of the shipping contract, its claim nevertheless fails. Delta Stone alleges no facts from which the court could infer any breach of the contract by Xpertfreight or any facts from which the court could infer that Xpertfreight's actions caused damage to the stone cutting machine. Thus, Delta Stone's contract claim against Xpertfreight fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT-Cross-Claim (ECF No. 81)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Through this motion Xpertfreight moves for summary judgment against Defendant/Cross-Claimant US Express on its claims for contribution, and allocation and/or apportionment for claims of 1) breach of contract; 2) negligence; and 3) liability under the Carmack Amendment.

Xpertfreight also requests attorneys' fees and costs against US Express under Rule 37(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract &amp; Negligence Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court will summarily address this motion. As addressed more fully above, US Express' claims against Xpertfreight for breach of contract and negligence are preempted by the Carmack Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   49 U.S.C. 14706.

Accordingly, the court grants Xpertfreight's motion for summary judgment against US Express for contribution and/or allocation with respect to Delta Stone's claims from breach of contract and negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Carmack Amendment Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to liability under the Carmack Amendment, Xpertfreight alleged the same thirty-two \"undisputed facts\" in support of this motion as it did in the motion against Delta Stone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 80. US Express disputed ten of these facts-numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99. But the court likewise finds none of US Express' \"disputes\" are genuine. For example, for its response to \"undisputed fact\" 6, US Express acknowledged the Broker/Carrier Agreement referred to US Express as the \"carrier\" and Xpertfreight as the \"broker,\" but then averred that because Bill of Lading DS000042 listed Xpertfreight as a \"carrier\" this creates a material fact; this was the same response provided for \"undisputed facts\" 3, 25, and 27.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99. As previously addressed, US Express acknowledged at the hearing there is no evidence in the record that Xpertfreight prepared the Bill of Lading; moreover, documents prepared by third-parties cannot create a genuine issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chubb Group of Ins.

The\n   \"MUST BE TARPED\" argument was also raised at the hearing. US Express argued that the instruction creates an issue of fact because it shows Xpertfreight did more than just arrange for transportation of the cargo, but actually \"gave special handling instructions\" to US Express. Unlike Delta Stone, however, US Express only cited cases related to multiple carriers to support its apportionment argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99 at n. 1. The court is not persuaded that an instruction to \"tarp\" a 17,000 pound stone cutting machine being transported cross-country in late December alone changed Xpertfreight's status as a \"broker\" to a \"carrier\" in the transaction. Ultimately, the evidence in the record shows that Xpertfreight meets the statutory definitions of a broker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Likewise, the court is not persuaded by US Express' \"objections\" over the use of the word \"provide\" in a dispositive motion.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Pursuant to Carmack Amendment, liability of carriers under bills of lading for \"actual loss or injury to the property\" applies to \"(A) the receiving carrier, (B) the delivering carrier, or (C) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014706\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it undisputed that Harbor Freight transported the cargo from \"the Port of Newark Container Terminal to its facility in Newark, New Jersey.\" ECF No. 102 at \u00b6 6, and ECF No. 102-1at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. On a Carmack claim, \"the shipper establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case against either the initial carrier or the delivering carrier by proving: (1) delivery of the property to the carrier in good condition; (2) arrival of the property at the destination in damaged or diminished condition; and (3) the amount of its damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Mercer Transp.

Here, it is also undisputed the cargo arrived damaged to its destination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 102 at \u00b6 15. Section 14706 of the Carmack Amendment plainly provides \"the carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service is subject to jurisdiction ... [and is] liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   49 U.S.C. 14706(a). Thus, as a matter of law, it is of no consequence to this motion whether the damage did not occur at the hands of Harbor Freight. \"Conclusory allegations will not create a genuine issue of material fact necessitating trial.\"\n   <em>\n    White v. York Int'l. Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413096\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/357/#p360\">\n    45 F.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (10th Cir. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, Harbor Freight argues Delta Stone is not entitled to consequential damages because it did not provide notice, and thus damages, if any are limited to the $500 limitation in the agreement with US Express. The court is not persuaded by these arguments for the following reasons. First, contrary to the legal argument and authority cited by Harbor Freight, the Tenth Circuit has held that \"special and consequential damages may be recovered under the Amendment,\" including damages for delay, lost profits and reasonably foreseeable consequential damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlas Aerospace LLC v. Advanced Transp., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201767943\">\n    2013 WL 1767943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , No. 12-1200-JWL, *4 (D.Kan. April 24, 2013). Moreover, with respect to \"release value provisions,\" like the $500 limitation Harbor Freight is seeking to enforce against Delta Stone, the Tenth Circuit has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A carrier may limit its liability by taking four steps: (1) maintain a tariff within the prescribed guidelines of the Interstate Commerce Commission (\"ICC\"); (2) obtain the shipper's agreement as to his choice of liability; (3) give the shipper a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability; and (4) issue a receipt or bill of lading prior to moving the shipment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Norton v. Jim Phillips Horse Transp., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535133\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/901/821/#p827\">\n    901 F.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827 (10th Cir. 1989). Since the ICC no longer exists, \"the first requirement has been replaced with the requirement that 'a carrier ... provide a shipper with the carrier's tariff if the shipper requests it, instead of the shipper filing its tariff with the now-defunct ICC.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bullocks Express Transp., Inc. v. XL Specialty Ins., Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217292\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/1246/#p1253\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255 (D.

Here, no facts in Harbor Freight's motion, the party carrying the burden of proof, address any of these factors; there are also no facts in the record addressing any of these factors. The moving party bears the initial burden of showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v. Catrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    477 U.S. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). An invoice, or Standard Terms and Conditions, signed by US Express (another carrier), without more, is not enough to provide adequate notice to Delta Stone of a limitation on liability regarding consequential damages. (ECF No. 102-1 at 7.) Based on the foregoing, the court denies Harbor Freight's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     HARBOR FREIGHT'S MOTION FOR LEAVE (ECF No. 134)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Following the close of discovery and the court's hearing on the motions addressed above, Harbor Freight filed a Motion for Leave in support of its motion for summary judgment as to Delta Stone's Carmack Amendment claim based on newly acquired evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 134. The crux of this motion is Harbor Freight's contention that during a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, US Express admitted its driver caused the damage to the stone cutting machine, and thus US Express' admission requires Harbor Freight's immediate dismissal from this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First of all, this is not \"newly acquired evidence,\" the record shows the driver for US Express admitted to damaging the cargo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 80-6, 81-4, 102-1 at 9, and 102-1 at 17. Moreover, as discussed more fully above, for purposes of Carmack Amendment liability, it is of no consequence which carrier damaged the cargo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   49 U.S.C. 14706(a). Thus, although the court reviewed both ECF No. 134 and Delta Stone's response, ECF No. 137, and grants Harbor Freight's motion, the end result is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The court orders as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   1.

Both Delta Stone and US Express conceded during the hearing, however, there is no evidence Xpertfreight prepared either document.

Opposing counsel, however, never raised this issue. Moreover, this alone does not preclude the court from conducting its analysis because at the hearing the parties argued their positions and made proffers regarding whether Xpertfreight should be treated as a \"carrier\" or \"broker,\" Rule 56(c)(1) allows the court to consider all materials in the record in making its decision, and the information in the declaration would become admissible if this matter went to trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Notably, DUCivR56-1(c)(1)(B) specifically provides, \"If a fact is disputed, so state and concisely describe and cite with particularity the evidence on which the non-moving party relies to dispute the fact (without legal argument).\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
