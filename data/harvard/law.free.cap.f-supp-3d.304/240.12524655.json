Morgan, a prisoner who is currently incarcerated at the Hazelton Federal Correctional Institution in Bruceton Mills, West Virginia, has filed the instant action against the United States Parole Commission (\"the Commission\") and Commission Hearing Examiner Paul R. A. Howard (\"Howard,\" and collectively, \"Defendants\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 2008, the Commission revoked the parole period that Morgan had been serving upon his release from prison for two 1988 District of Columbia convictions for armed robbery and carrying a pistol without a license. Howard was the official who presided over Morgan's parole revocation hearing; the Commission adopted Howard's recommendation that Morgan's parole be revoked following new convictions for weapons offenses in North Carolina, and the presumptive reparole date was set based on the Commission's then-current revocation guidelines. Morgan's complaint claims, in essence, that the Commission violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution by applying the parole guidelines that were in effect in 2008, when Howard conducted the revocation hearing, rather than guidelines that were in effect in 1988, when Morgan committed the underlying offenses. (Compl., ECF No. 1, at 3.) Morgan seeks money damages against the Commission and against Howard (in his official and individual capacities) for \"subject[ing] him to a longer period of incarceration\" upon revocation than would have been the case if the 1987 regulations had been applied, as well as an order that the Commission afford him \"a new parole hearing with instructions to the [Commission] to exercise its discretion within the framework created by the 1987 Regulations[.]\" (Compl. at 3; Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Compl. (\"Pl.'s Compl. Mem.\"), ECF No. 1-2, at 5; Am. &amp; Suppl. Compl., ECF No. 13, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is Defendants' motion to dismiss Morgan's complaint. (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 15.) In this motion, Howard and the Commission argue, among other things, that they are immune from the claims for monetary damages that Morgan has brought in this action, and that the doctrine of res judicata bars all of Morgan's claims relief because, in the context of a habeas action that he filed in federal district court in West Virginia, he previously litigated (and lost) the legal argument that his parole sentence violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. (Defs.' Mot. at 10-11.) For the reasons explained below, this Court has concluded that Defendants are, indeed, immune from Morgan's damages claims, and that res judicata bars all of his claims, including those for injunctive relief. Therefore, as set forth in the Order that this Court issued on March 31, 2016, Defendants' motion to dismiss has been\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Morgan's complaint has been\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Morgan's District Of Columbia Sentence And Parole Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September of 1998, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia convicted Morgan of armed robbery and carrying a pistol without a license and sentenced him to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 15 years to life on the robbery charge and one year on the firearms charge. (Pl.'s Compl. Mem. at 7.) Morgan was released on parole in March of 2003 to the Western District of North Carolina, and in 2007, while under supervision in North Carolina, he was arrested for and charged with discharging a weapon into occupied property and assault with a deadly weapon causing serious injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Shortly thereafter, the Commission submitted an application for a parole violation warrant, alleging that Morgan had violated the conditions of his parole as a result of these new offenses and also that he had used illegal narcotics while under supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

(Pl.'s Compl.

As a result of the hearing, Howard found that Morgan had violated the conditions of his parole and determined, under the Commission's 2000 parole revocation guidelines, that Morgan's guideline range was 78-110 months of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205040432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Howard recommended that the Commission revoke Morgan's parole and a set presumptive reparole date of July 24, 2016, which would result in Morgan serving an additional 110 months in prison.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205040432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On September 19, 2008, the Commission issued a \"Notice of Action,\" in which it implemented Howard's recommendations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205040432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Morgan subsequently appealed that determination, and the National Appeals Board affirmed the Commission's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Morgan's West Virginia Petition For A Writ Of Habeas Corpus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 25, 2009, Morgan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\n   United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His petition included a claim that the Commission's \"retroactive application of new federal reparole guidelines\" in his case established a \"[p]rima facie ex post facto claim\" because there was \"a significant risk that his punishment [was] increased\" due to the application of those guidelines, when compared to the reparole guidelines that were in effect when he committed his original offenses in 1988.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that Morgan's habeas petition be dismissed in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Regarding the ex post facto claim, the assigned magistrate judge found in the first instance that Morgan \"failed to establish[ ] that the 2000 Guidelines were retroactively applied during his parole revocation proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The magistrate judge also found that, even if the Commission had improperly applied the 2000 Guidelines, this did not amount to an ex post facto violation because this purported error \"did not ... create a significant risk of prolonging [Morgan's] incarceration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

Cir. 2006) (holding that \"a retroactively applied parole or reparole regulation or guideline violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it creates a significant risk of prolonging an inmate's incarceration[ ]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The West Virginia district court judge adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, expressly rejecting Morgan's objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation regarding his ex post facto claim, and dismissed Morgan's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205040435\">\n    2011 WL 5040435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The court explained that the Commission's application of year 2000 guidelines to evaluate the parole consequences of conduct that Morgan has engaged in 2007 was not a \"retroactive\" application of the guidelines, and in any event, \"[Morgan's] objection that he was subjected to a significant risk of prolonging his incarceration [through application of the 2000 Guidelines] is without merit\" because the 1987 Regulations afforded the parole board \"discretion to depart from the guidelines\" and permitted it to set whatever reparole date that it deemed appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205040435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Board of Parole's 1987 regulations. (Compl. at 3.) The complaint also alleged that Howard further violated the Ex Post Facto Clause \"by incorrectly imposing a term of imprisonment exceeding the sanction imposed for the crime that occurred in North Carolina.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relief, the complaint requested \"a rehearing with reconsideration of his parole eligibility\" under the former D.C. Board of Parole's 1987 regulations. (Compl. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December of 2014, Defendants moved to dismiss Morgan's complaint based on res judicata (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 7); this Court denied the motion without prejudice after Morgan requested leave to file a supplemental and amended complaint-a request that the Court granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Mar. 3, 2015.) In the new pleading, Morgan continued to press the core ex post facto allegation; the only substantive addition was a demand for $250,000 in monetary damages as a result of the alleged violation of his constitutional rights. (Am. &amp; Suppl. Compl. at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 20, 2015, Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss in which they argue that res judicata bars Morgan's complaint in its entirety because Morgan previously litigated the question of whether or not his parole sentence violates the ex post facto clause in the context of his West Virginia habeas suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-16.) Defendants also contend that they are immune to lawsuits for money damages under the circumstances presented here.

They further assert that Morgan has failed to state a claim upon which declaratory or equitable relief can be granted (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30), and that this action is otherwise plagued by a number of procedural defects including a failure to effect proper service (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19), lack of personal jurisdiction (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-23), and improper venue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24).

He alleges (1) that both the Commission and Howard improperly applied parole regulations from the year 2000 when his parole was revoked in 2008, rather than the regulations in effect at the time of his underlying offense, and (2) that Howard \"incorrectly impos[ed] a term of imprisonment exceeding the sanction imposed for the crime [that led to revocation of his parole].\" (Compl. at 3.) However, as explained below, this Court concludes that Morgan's damages claims cannot proceed because both defendants are entitled to immunity, and furthermore that all of the claims that Morgan has brought in this action are entirely precluded based on the doctrine of res judicata.

There appears to be no factual basis for Morgan's conclusory assertion that Howard was wearing some other \"hat\"-something other than one worn by a parole hearing officer-when he decided to recommend revocation of Morgan's parole, and he provides no support for his contention that negligence divests judicial officers of immunity.

Defendants point to this habeas decision and argue that res judicata prevents Morgan from raising his ex post facto claim in the instant case. (Defs.' Mot. at 10-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This Court agrees. The doctrine of res judicata includes the principle of issue preclusion, which generally prevents a litigant from relitigating \" 'an issue of fact or law necessary to [a] judgment' \" where that issue was previously adjudicated on the merits \" 'in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ficken v.

Cir. 1992) (other citation omitted) ). As noted above, and contrary to Morgan's assertions, issue preclusion undoubtedly applies when the prior action was a habeas proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823042\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/772/246/#p264\">\n    772 F.Supp.2d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As for the third requirement, this Court concludes that preventing Morgan from relitigating the ex post facto question is not obviously unfair because Morgan had every opportunity-and incentive-to litigate this question fully before the West Virginia court. Moreover, to the extent that Morgan is here asserting an unfairness-type argument\n   related to the fact that the West Virginia federal magistrate judge who initially considered his habeas petition relied on authority \"that\n   <em>\n    predates\n   </em>\n   the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act, which vested the [Commission] with the sole authority to administer the District of Columbia Parole system,\" (Pl.'s Traverse to Defs.' Reply to Pl.'s Reply to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 10, at 5), this Court sees nothing inherently unfair or untoward about the application of past precedent to address a constitutional question; after all, adherence to precedent is venerated practice of the state and federal courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kimble v.
