Plaintiffs allege that defendants knowingly, recklessly, or negligently sold these contaminated products without disclosing their presence on the labels, which make certain health claims and safety assurances. They now bring suit on behalf of themselves, a nationwide class, and a California subclass for negligent misrepresentation, violations of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"), violations of California's False Advertising Law (\"FAL\"), violations of California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), breach of express and implied warranty, and violation of California Health and Safety Code Section 113095. Defendants move to dismiss all claims against them on several grounds. For the foregoing reasons, I GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   WellPet is a subsidiary of Berwind.

The Products contain \"material and significant levels of arsenic and lead,\" \"known dangerous toxins for both humans and animals, including dogs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The CORE Ocean product also contains \"material and significant levels of BPA,\" \"an industrial chemical that is an endocrine disruptor\" and \"has been linked to various health issues, including reproductive disorders, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and neurological problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants knew or should have known of the presence of these contaminants, but the Products do not contain any warning label or disclose the presence of these contaminants. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 38-39, 53. Instead, the Products' labels contain various health claims and promises, such as \"Unrivaled Quality Standards,\" \"Optimal Health\" \"with Nothing in Excess and Everything in Balance,\" and \"natural, safe and pure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 20.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 25. Zeiger alleges that he saw defendants' false and misleading nutritional claims and marketing materials, and relied on them in deciding to purchase the Products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 50-52. He was unaware that the Products contained any level of lead, arsenic, or BPA, and would not have purchased the Products if their presence had been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Danz, a citizen of California, is a dog sitting business that used the Products as one of the primary foods for its clients' dogs. Am. Compl. \u00b6 26. It purchased the Products approximately monthly from October 2014 to July 2017, when it discovered that the Products were contaminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It bought the Products in reliance on the false and misleading claims and marketing materials, and would not have purchased them had the presence of lead, arsenic, or BPA been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 50-52. Similarly, Freeborn is also a citizen of California, who purchased the Products approximately monthly from January 2010 to July 2017 when she too discovered that the Products were contaminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. She alleges that in reliance on defendants' false and misleading claims and marketing materials, she was unaware that the Products contained any level of lead, arsenic, or BPA, and would not have purchased the Products had that been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 50-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs each allege that they were economically injured when they paid the purchase price or a price premium for the Products, assuming \"that it was healthy, clean, and safe for dogs to ingest, as well as natural and pure.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. They would not have paid this money had they known of the presence of the contaminants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They do not allege any physical injuries. They now bring suit individually and on behalf of two nationwide classes and two California subclasses, one for the Products collectively and another for CORE Ocean only, asserting several claims under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants contend that the facts in these documents should be judicially noticed because they \"can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,\" Fed.

The FDA documents are not regulations, guidelines, or even studies that conclusively establish that arsenic, lead, or BPA are safe at any level. Instead, the Target Animal Safety Review is a study that purports only to establish estimated maximum tolerable limits of certain metals in dog and cat food products in the absence of \"FDA guidance, action levels, or tolerances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex.

The contents of the Target Animal Safety Review themselves are the result of a reasonable scientific dispute; plaintiffs provide further evidence that other professionals have disputed those conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to RJN at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Exhibit D, the memorandum on BPA, is not specific to the dog or cat food context, nor does it establish that BPA is necessarily safe or an acceptable contaminant in pet food products. Instead, it affirms the \"no observed adverse effect level\" for BPA in general food contact applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex. D, at 4. As plaintiffs show, however, these findings are hotly disputed by various sources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to RJN at 3-4. Finally, Exhibits E and F appear even less authoritative, as they are not studies but simply Question and Answer documents on the FDA website that are not specific to dog or pet foods. While Exhibit E claims that BPA is safe,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex. E, at 2, plaintiffs show that this contention is very much in dispute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. to RJN at 3-4.

Cal. 2005) (finding the phrase \"most stringent quality control tests\" was actionable and not mere puffery). WellPet's claim that their food is \"undoubtedly safe,\" or \"safe\" and \"pure,\" for example, is neither objectively true, according to plaintiffs, nor a subjective opinion about the Products. These are measurable claims that plaintiffs indeed seek to prove are false through this very suit. Plaintiffs thus sufficiently point to express mirepresentations in their Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether Plaintiffs Plead a Concealment or Omission Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   WellPet also argues that plaintiffs fail to plead a concealment or omissions claim because they do not plead that WellPet knew the facts it allegedly failed to disclose. Plaintiffs point to their allegations that because WellPet made claims that their Products were made up of \"Uncompromising Nutrition\" \"that ha[ve] nothing in excess\" and \"Unrivaled Quality Standards,\" \"Defendants knew or should have known that the Contaminated Dog Foods included concerning and higher levels of arsenic and lead.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. Likewise, because they marketed CORE Ocean as \"natural, safe, and pure,\" and represented\n   \"that the quality control over the manufacturing of their Wellness dog food products was a rigid process that monitored temperature,\" \"Defendants knew or should have known that higher temperatures coupled with the type of containers used in manufacturing create a real risk of significant levels of BPA in their products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. These are not merely conclusory allegations, but provide the basis for plaintiffs' theory of WellPet's knowledge that they should have known of the presence of contaminants in their Products based on their affirmative representations. Finally, plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants have, and had, exclusive knowledge of the physical and chemical make-up of the Contaminated Dog Foods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. While I agree that plaintiffs' allegation that \"Defendants were put on notice by the Clean Label Project of the inclusion of heavy metals in its dog food products,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , is too vague because it does not explain what the Clean Label Project is or why its existence is sufficient to put WellPet on notice, the other allegations in the Amended Complaint are nonetheless pleaded with reasonable particularity and can sustain an omission-based claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether Plaintiffs Properly Allege the Products Are Misleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   WellPet's final theory as to why plaintiffs' misrepresentation allegations are insufficient is that plaintiffs do not allege that the Products are misleading beyond a merely speculative level. Put another way, WellPet argues that plaintiffs have not satisfied the \"reasonable consumer standard,\" which requires that they \"show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012495\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/934/#p938\">\n    552 F.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs premise their claims on the theory that WellPet's Products' labels are misleading because they fail to disclose that they contain arsenic, lead, or BPA, all the while claiming that they are healthy, safe, pure, and/or natural. While WellPet claims that plaintiffs cannot establish that the levels of arsenic, lead, or BPA in their foods are unsafe or unhealthy for dogs, that issue is in dispute and is inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss. Likewise, plaintiffs' allegation that a reasonable consumer would understand \"natural, safe and pure\" to mean that CORE Ocean did not contain the chemical BPA is plausible. Plaintiffs have provided an actionable theory why the Products are unsafe and why the labels are misleading; whether plaintiffs can prove their theory is a separate question that I cannot resolve at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege Claims Under the UCL's \"Unfair\" or \"Unlawful\" Prongs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   WellPet also moves to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under the \"unfair\" and \"unlawful\" prongs of the UCL on the grounds that plaintiffs have failed to state with reasonable particularity that WellPet has violated any law or public policy, as required by these prongs. Plaintiffs have, however, stated claims for violations of the CLRA and FAL, so these claims may serve as predicate violations for a claim under the UCL's \"unlawful\" prong. With respect to the \"unfair\" prong, plaintiffs argue that they need not show that WellPet's conduct violated any public policy, but instead only that it is \"immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits.\" Opp. at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nagrampa v.

Assuming the truth of plaintiffs' allegations, I cannot conclude as a matter of law that defendants' allegedly misleading and deceptive labeling practices are not unfair, as the harm to the consumer outweighs the utility of this practice.

In\n   <em>\n    MyFordTouch\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, Judge Chen reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Clemens\n   </em>\n   did not explicitly address the third-party beneficiary exception, nor was it clear whether the plaintiff argued for its application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p983\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given that\n   <em>\n    Clemens\n   </em>\n   did not directly address the third-party beneficiary exception, nor did it address\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , it need not be read to foreclose the third-party beneficiary exception to privity under California law. Because\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   provides the authority for plaintiffs to plead the third-party beneficiary exception, I will allow them to proceed on their implied warranty claim in the absence of privity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   WellPet argues that plaintiffs' claim must nonetheless fail because plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the Products are not fit for their ordinary purpose. Plaintiffs, however, proceed under\n   the theory that WellPet's Products are not merchantable because they fail to \"[c]onform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202314\">\n    Cal.

[including that] the product must conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.\") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Plaintiffs adequately allege that WellPet made certain affirmations of fact on its Products, including that they were \"pure,\" \"safe,\" or \"natural,\" but that WellPet's Products failed to conform to these affirmations because they contained arsenic, lead, and/or BPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 122-25. For these reasons, I DENY WellPet's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' implied warranty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Whether Plaintiffs Have a Private Right of Action Under\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Section 113095\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   WellPet moves to dismiss plaintiffs' claim for violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code Section 113095 on the grounds that they have no private right of action under that statute. Plaintiffs argue that because other provisions of the Health &amp; Safety Code explicitly bar a private right of action or vest the power to pursue civil or administrative actions exclusively with the state,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20110597\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 110597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I should not infer that such a right is barred in this provision. The statute specifies that it \"shall be administered by the department,\" however, which \"may bring an action\" for \"temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating\" the chapter,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20113085\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 113085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and provides for criminal penalties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20113080\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 113080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, plaintiffs have not pointed to a single example of a case that allowed a private right of action under this section to proceed. For these reasons, I agree with WellPet that Section 113095 confers no private right of action, and I therefore GRANT WellPet's motion to dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Whether Plaintiffs' Claims for Damages and Restitution Under the CLRA Should Be Dismissed for Failure to Comply with the CLRA's Mandatory Notice Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   WellPet's final argument is that plaintiffs' CLRA claim must be dismissed for failure to comply with the CLRA's mandatory notice requirement, as required by California Civil Code Section 1782(a). Section 1782 requires that a plaintiff provide \"thirty days or more prior to the commencement of an action for damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It further states that \"[a]n action for injunctive relief brought under the specific provisions of Section 1770 may be commenced without compliance with subdivision (a),\" and explicitly allows a plaintiff to \"amend his or her complaint without leave of court to include a request for damages\" \"[n]ot less than 30 days after the commencement of an action for injunctive relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs have plainly complied with this provision. Their original complaint sought only injunctive relief and attorney's fees in connection with the CLRA claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, neither of which constitute damages for purposes of Section 1782(a). Plaintiffs then provided notice to Defendants on July 19, 2017 of their intent to file a CLRA claim for damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RJN Ex. G, which plaintiffs filed more than 30 days later on October 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. WellPet's motion to dismiss the CLRA claim for damages is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For these reasons, I GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Defendant Berwind is dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and plaintiffs' Count VII for violation of California Health and Safety Code Section 113095 is dismissed for lack of a private right of action. While plaintiffs may not proceed on their nationwide class claims, named plaintiffs' remaining claims may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Defendants also seek judicial notice of three additional exhibits, which plaintiffs do not oppose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RJN Exs. A, B, &amp; G. Because Exhibits A and B, the Products' labels, are incorporated by reference in the Amended Complaint and form the basis of plaintiffs' claims, I take judicial notice of them. I also take judicial notice of Exhibit G, a July 19, 2017 letter concerning notice of a CLRA claim from plaintiffs' counsel to defendants, because the parties agree that its contents are not subject to reasonable dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
