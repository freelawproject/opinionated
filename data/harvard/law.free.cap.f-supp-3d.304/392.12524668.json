NATHAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this diversity action, Plaintiff Holborn Corporation asserts that Defendant Sawgrass Mutual Insurance Company breached its contract by failing to pay premiums to Holborn in exchange for Holborn acting as Sawgrass's reinsurance broker. Sawgrass asserts counterclaims against Holborn, alleging first that Holborn acted negligently and breached its fiduciary duty by failing to recommend a particular type of reinsurance, and second that Holborn breached its contract by failing to repay certain sums to Sawgrass. Before the Court is Holborn's motion to dismiss Counts I and II (negligence and breach of fiduciary duty) of Sawgrass's Amended Counterclaims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because the Court concludes that New York law applies and that Sawgrass has failed to sufficiently allege facts that would support Sawgrass's claims under New York law, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the allegations contained in the Defendant's Amended Counterclaims, as required in deciding this motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/229/#p237\">\n    496 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (2d Cir. 2007). Defendant Sawgrass is a mutual insurance corporation existing in and organized under the laws of the state of Florida. Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff's Amended Counterclaims (\"Counterclaims\"), Dkt. No. 22, \u00b6 1. It writes homeowners insurance policies in the state of Florida. Counterclaims \u00b6 4. Plaintiff Holborn is a reinsurance intermediary organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, with offices in New York, Minnesota, and Kansas. Counterclaims \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, Holborn had a series of conversations with Sawgrass's then-President and CEO, James Esse, aimed at convincing Esse to let Holborn procure reinsurance for Sawgrass. Counterclaims \u00b6 5. During these conversations, Esse advised Holborn that it would need to \"carefully analyze\" Sawgrass's potential risk exposure under its homeowners policies, as well as \"design a specific reinsurance program custom tailored to Sawgrass' unique business needs.\" Counterclaims \u00b6 7. Given the magnitude of Sawgrass's risk, any reinsurance deal would likely require Sawgrass to pay nearly $10 million in annual reinsurance premiums for nearly $100 million in coverage. Counterclaims \u00b6 8. Holborn was likely to receive nearly $1 million in annual commissions. Counterclaims \u00b6 8. As a result, Sawgrass alleges, Holborn \"understood that if Sawgrass retained it as its reinsurance intermediary that the relationship would be one of trust and confidence, and that Holborn would have a duty to counsel and advise Sawgrass on the reinsurance program that would be most advantageous to its particular business needs.\" Counterclaims \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition, according to Sawgrass, Holborn made \"a series of representations concerning its expertise in an effort to induce Sawgrass to retain its services,\" which were \"substantially the same\" as the representations currently made on Holborn's website. Counterclaims \u00b6 10. These representations include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. Holborn is an independent reinsurance brokerage offering advanced analytic tools, global market access, and responsive account services to clients across the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. Holborn is \"committed to understanding each clients' needs, corporate culture, risk tolerance and overall business approach.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   c.

Holborn \"take[s] a comprehensive approach to reinsurance structure design and placement by understanding each client's business philosophy and risk appetite.

Sawgrass considered these representations material to its decision to retain Holborn and alleges that Holborn knew or should have known this. Counterclaims \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 14, 2012, Sawgrass executed a Broker Authorization Contract (the \"2012 BAC\"), which designated Holborn as Sawgrass's reinsurance intermediary from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015. Counterclaims \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2012 BAC, Dkt. No. 29-1. On November 6, 2013, Holborn and Sawgrass executed a superseding Broker Authorization Contract (the \"2014 BAC\"), which designated Holborn as Sawgrass's reinsurance intermediary from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017. Counterclaims \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2014 BAC, Dkt. No. 29-2. In addition, the parties signed two other agreements: a \"Consulting Agreement\" that amended the 2012 BAC and specified that Holborn would provide consulting services for a period of time even if the contract were terminated, Counterclaims \u00b6 14, and a contract authorizing Sawgrass to use Holborn's proprietary Portfolio Optimization Tool,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Portfolio Optimization Tool Use Agreement, Dkt. No. 29-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Sawgrass, Holborn recommended a specific program of reinsurance coverage that it represented was the most advantageous for Sawgrass. Counterclaims \u00b6 16. Based on these representations, Sawgrass purchased the recommended reinsurance. Counterclaims \u00b6 17. At some point thereafter, Sawgrass learned that Holborn had failed to recommend \"Top and Drop\" reinsurance coverage, a multi-layer insurance product which allows the insured to reuse the top excess-of-loss layer of reinsurance if it is not breached by the first loss event. Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Sawgrass alleges that if Holborn had recommended Top and Drop coverage, Sawgrass would have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars. Counterclaims \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sawgrass subsequently terminated Holborn pursuant to paragraph 2 of the 2014 BAC, which allowed Sawgrass to terminate Holborn at any time for cause. Counterclaims \u00b6 27; 2014 BAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. On November 23, 2016, Holborn filed a complaint against Sawgrass alleging breach of contract. Complaint, Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6 1. Specifically, Holborn alleged that Sawgrass \"prematurely terminat[ed] the Contract without cause and fail[ed] to pay Holborn its full share of brokerage on all reinsurance procured or placed\" during the period of time covered by the 2014 BAC. Complaint \u00b6 1. In response, Sawgrass brought three counterclaims against Holborn alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 34-55. Sawgrass alleges that Holborn's failure to recommend Top and Drop insurance constituted a breach of its duty of care, Counterclaims \u00b6 40, and a breach of its fiduciary duty, Counterclaims \u00b6 47. It also alleges that Holborn breached the terms of the 2014 BAC by failing to remit a percentage of the brokerage earned by Holborn as required. Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 11, 2017, Holborn filed a motion to dismiss Sawgrass's first and second counterclaims. Dkt. No. 27. Holborn argues that the tort-based claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty are barred by the economic loss doctrine under New York law and therefore must be dismissed.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before the Court are Sawgrass's Counterclaims alleging the torts of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty based on money Sawgrass lost due to Holborn's alleged failure to secure Top and Drop reinsurance for Sawgrass. Holborn argues that these claims are legally improper under New York's economic loss doctrine. \"New York law holds that a negligence action seeking recovery for economic loss will not lie.\"\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57491\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/52/#p62\">\n    728 F.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (2d Cir. 1984). In particular, if the parties have a remedy in contract, they may not also bring claims sounding in tort that claim only economic damages independent of physical injury or damage to property. This principle seeks to \"prevent[ ] the encroachment of tort law into the domain of contract\" and \"protect[ ] parties' abilities to allocate risk by mutual agreement and thereby form reliable expectations about their potential financial exposure with respect to the duties and liabilities that they have contractually assumed.\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur.

However, an exception to the economic loss doctrine exists \"where the defendant has a duty independent of contractual obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Nebraskaland, Inc. v. Sunoco, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. 10-cv-1091 (RJD) (CLP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206131313\">\n    2011 WL 6131313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D.N.Y.

Dec. 8, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the relationship between Holborn and Sawgrass is governed by the contracts they executed (namely, the 2012 BAC and 2014 BAC), the economic loss doctrine would generally bar Sawgrass's tort-based counterclaims. To avoid application of the economic loss doctrine, Sawgrass makes two arguments. First, it argues that this case should be governed by Florida law rather than New York law. Because Florida recognizes only a much narrower economic loss doctrine that applies only to product liabilities cases, Sawgrass's counterclaims may be properly brought if Florida law governs. Second,\n   Sawgrass argues that Sawgrass and Holborn formed a special relationship giving rise to duties \"independent of contractual obligations,\"\n   <em>\n    Nebraskaland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206131313\">\n    2011 WL 6131313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citation omitted), and that Sawgrass may bring legal theories alleging breaches of those independent obligations.

While it is undisputed that Sawgrass suffered injury in Florida where it is domiciled, the Court finds that the actual tortious conduct alleged in Sawgrass's counterclaims occurred in New York. The wrongful conduct alleged in Sawgrass's counterclaims is a failure to recommend Top and Drop insurance. Sawgrass alleges that Holborn was negligent because it \"breached its duty of care by failing to use reasonable skill and care to recommend and secure appropriate reinsurance for Sawgrass, including Top and Drop coverage.\" Counterclaims \u00b6 40. Likewise, Holborn \"breached its fiduciary duty by failing to recommend and secure the reinsurance products appropriate for Sawgrass' particular business\n   needs, including Top and Drop coverage.\" Counterclaims \u00b6 47. Sawgrass repeatedly characterizes Holborn's tortious conduct as a \"failure to recommend and secure\" Top and Drop coverage, Counterclaims \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Counterclaims \u00b6 18 (\"Sawgrass learned that Holborn, contrary to its duties and fiduciary obligations, failed to recommend a reinsurance product known as 'Top and Drop' reinsurance coverage ('Top and Drop').\"). This failure occurred when Holborn considered, recommended, and secured reinsurance for Sawgrass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds that Sawgrass has failed to plausibly allege that this failure occurred in Florida. Specifically, Sawgrass does not allege with particularity that Holborn's agents were in Florida when they were considering and selecting reinsurance or when they recommended a particular reinsurance plan to Sawgrass. Rather, Sawgrass only specifically states that Holborn agents traveled to Florida \"to meet with Sawgrass during the course of negotiations\" and more generally alleges that Holborn agents traveled to Florida during the course of \"the ensuing relationship.\" Counterclaims \u00b6 28. It does not specifically allege that any of these meetings concerned Holborn's choice of a reinsurance plan or its recommendation of that reinsurance plan to Sawgrass. Similarly, in its opposition to Holborn's motion to dismiss, Sawgrass does not allege that any of Holborn's actions other than its alleged pre-contract representations about the services it would provide took place in Florida:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, Holborn traveled to Florida, and while in Florida made representations to Sawgrass that it would custom tailor a reinsurance program to meet its unique business needs. Holborn then drafted and presented a Reinsurance Contract to Sawgrass that itself contained a Florida choice of law provision, which Holborn recommended Sawgrass execute because it met its business needs, and which Sawgrass executed in Florida.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Opp. at 10. Sawgrass specifically avoids asserting that Holborn was in Florida during the consideration, drafting, or presentation of the proposed reinsurance contract. Further underscoring the dearth of specific allegations that the purportedly tortious conduct took place in Florida is Sawgrass's argument in its opposition to the motion to dismiss that the allegedly tortious conduct may have occurred in Minnesota or Kansas. In arguing against application of New York law, Sawgrass states that \"Holborn also maintains offices in Minnesota and Kansas, and is incorporated in Delaware,\" and that \"there is no record support for what activities occurred at any of Holborn's varied locations.\" Opp. at 10. In effect, Sawgrass admits that it does not know where Holborn was when it acted but that Holborn's allegedly tortious conduct took place at one of its locations rather than in Florida during any meeting between Sawgrass and Holborn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court concludes that Sawgrass's allegations fail to rise above the level of \"bare assertions\" that tortious conduct occurred in Florida, which cannot be credited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that the allegedly tortious actions of Holborn occurred in New York.

Counterclaims \u00b6 2; Support at 3; 2012 BAC at 2, 3; 2014 BAC at 3; NY License, Dkt. No. 29-4.

Holborn's failure to recommend a specific policy therefore is centered in New York under\n   <em>\n    GlobalNet Financial\n   </em>\n   (and absent contrary specific allegations by Sawgrass), and the Court concludes that New York has the greatest interest in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Licci,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084682\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/45/\">\n    739 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   50-51 ;\n   <em>\n    GlobalNet Financial,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5409266\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/377/#p382\">\n    449 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Sawgrass argues that even if Holborn's failure to recommend Top and Drop insurance occurred in New York, Florida law should nevertheless govern this case because Holborn made fraudulent misrepresentations during meetings with Sawgrass in Florida. Opp. at 8. Specifically, Sawgrass states that its claims \"relate to the misrepresentations Holborn made that it would carefully analyze Sawgrass' potential exposure and recommend a specific reinsurance program custom tailored to its needs, and then failed to do so resulting in damages.\" Opp. at 8. This claim is unavailing. Sawgrass has not sued Holborn for fraud or alleged that Holborn knowingly made misrepresentations to Sawgrass. Rather, Sawgrass claims that Holborn's\n   <em>\n    later failure to fulfill these promises\n   </em>\n   was negligent and a breach of fiduciary duty. As a result, the tortious conduct at issue in Sawgrass's counterclaims is that subsequent failure, not the initial representations. Because Sawgrass has not sufficiently alleged that Holborn's failure occurred in Florida, and against the backdrop of\n   <em>\n    GlobalNet Financial,\n   </em>\n   the Court concludes that the alleged failure occurred in New York and thus is governed by New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court likewise sees no merit in Sawgrass's argument that Florida law applies in this case because the reinsurance contract Sawgrass ultimately signed with third parties was executed in Florida and governed by Florida law. Opp. at 8. Holborn was not a party to that contract, nor did that contract implicate Holborn's contractual relationship to Sawgrass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reinsurance Contract, Dkt. No. 35-1. Rather, the contract merely governed the obligations between Sawgrass and its many reinsurers. As a result, although that contract has a choice-of-law provision stating that Florida law governs the contract, Reinsurance Contract at 22, that contract has no bearing on where Holborn's allegedly tortious conduct occurred or which state has the greatest interest in the actions by the reinsurance broker rather than the actions of the reinsured and reinsurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GlobalNet Financial,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5409266\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/377/#p382\">\n    449 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a state did not have the greatest interest in a tort arising from an insurance relationship merely because the ultimate insurance risk would be borne in that state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Sawgrass next argues that, despite the normal rule that the state in which a conduct-regulating tort occurred will generally have the greatest interest in the case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White Plains Coat &amp; Apron Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674519\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/281/#p284\">\n    460 F.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Florida has the greatest interest in this case, Opp. at 11. In support of this position, Sawgrass states that it is domiciled in Florida, Holborn traveled to Florida to negotiate its relationship with Sawgrass, the reinsurance Holborn secured covered exclusively Florida risks on Florida-issued insurance policies, and the ultimate reinsurance contract secured by Holborn had a choice-of-law provision applying\n   Florida law. Opp. at 11. This argument is largely foreclosed by the Second Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    GlobalNet Financial.\n   </em>\n   In that case, the plaintiff likewise argued that Florida had the greater interest because the plaintiff was domiciled in Florida and the defendant had provided insurance coverage \"for a risk that was primarily located in Florida.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5409266\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/377/#p382\">\n    449 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court's determination in this case does not require a fact-intensive inquiry: even treating all of Sawgrass's allegations as true and viewing all facts in the light most favorable to it, it has failed to allege any facts that would cause Florida law to govern this case. Because the failure is one of pleading rather than one of factual support, the Court sees no reason to allow the choice-of-law issue to become the subject of extensive discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201883529\">\n    2012 WL 1883529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (deciding the choice of law question at the motion to dismiss stage because plaintiff had not plausibly alleged that the locus of the tort had been anywhere other than Georgia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court thus concludes that New York law governs Sawgrass's counterclaims. As a result, New York's economic loss doctrine will foreclose Sawgrass's claims absent application of an exception to that general rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Under New York law, insurance brokers \"have a common-law duty to obtain requested coverage for their clients within a reasonable time or inform the client of the inability to do so\" but \"have no continuing duty to advise, guide or direct a client to obtain additional coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

In this case, Sawgrass has failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that a special relationship was created between itself and Holborn that would require Holborn to recommend Top and Drop reinsurance.
