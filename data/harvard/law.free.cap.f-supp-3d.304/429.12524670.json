PAULEY III, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and Fox News Network LLC (\"Fox\"), Dianne Brandi, Irena Briganti, and Charles Payne move to dismiss the Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") for failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations of the Complaint are presumed true for purposes of this motion. This action is one of many in a cavalcade of sexual harassment suits plaguing Fox. It arises from a sexual relationship between Charles Payne-a Fox anchor, contributor, and host-and Scottie Nell Hughes, a conservative political strategist and pundit. After meeting in the spring of 2013, Payne\n   took an interest in Hughes and sought out opportunities to spend time with her. The two reunited in New York in the summer of 2013. As they made their way to Fox's studios, Payne pressured Hughes into providing him with her hotel room information. Under the guise of mentoring her, Payne persuaded Hughes to agree to a private meeting in her room. But instead of discussing work and career opportunities, Hughes alleges that Payne sexually assaulted and raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While humiliating and traumatizing, Hughes, like many sexual assault victims, chose not to report the incident. Rather, invitations to appear as a guest contributor on various Fox programs, including Payne's, began flowing in. She began making regular appearances on Fox's program circuit, at one point appearing nearly every day of the week on Payne's show. But Hughes' ability to pursue these opportunities were significantly constrained by a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   relationship with Payne. That is, Fox and Payne offered her appearances on these nationally televised shows as long as she continued to maintain a sexual relationship with Payne. Indeed, whenever the boundaries of that relationship were tested through Hughes' attempts to sever the affair, she was invariably presented with the threat of losing her program appearances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By June 2015, however, Hughes ended her relationship with Payne. The fallout was swift. Once a regular guest on a panoply of Fox programs, Hughes found herself appearing as a panelist on only five occasions over the following ten months. As Fox and Payne stymied the flow of work to Hughes, Hughes also found it difficult to secure opportunities with other networks. Hughes and her manager later learned that Fox had blacklisted her across the industry, casting her as \"not bookable\" due to her affair with Payne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2017, amid the various sexual harassment scandals engulfing Fox, Hughes reported the 2013 rape to Fox and its outside counsel. In an attempt to find a business solution, Hughes hoped that Fox would remove her from the blacklist. To her surprise, Fox appeared uninterested in helping her, instead assuming a hostile position toward her and aggressively seeking additional details about her report. Mere hours after that conversation, Fox disseminated a prepared statement from Payne to the National Enquirer, a tabloid that had planned on running a story about Payne's affair. While the statement did not expressly identify Hughes as Payne's paramour, it revealed Fox's strategy of undermining Hughes' report that she had been a rape victim. Hughes asserts that the National Enquirer story led reporters to deduce that Hughes was the woman in question. A few days after the publication of the article, a cache of emails detailing the lascivious nature of her communications with Payne were leaked to the public, definitively casting doubt on Hughes' credibility and subjecting her to widespread scorn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on these events, Hughes now brings an assortment of employment and gender discrimination claims predicated on Title VII, the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"), and the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"). She also asserts three separate causes of action for defamation, seeking damages arising from Fox's alleged disclosure of her identity to the National Enquirer. Finally, Hughes invokes a seldom used New York City law-the Gender-Motivated Violence Act-against Payne seeking damages arising from the sexual assault and rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The Alleged Rape and Sexual Assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2013, Hughes met Charles Payne, a Fox Business Network anchor\n   and contributor. They appeared together on a number of Fox programs. (Amended Complaint, ECF No. 29 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 26, 75.) After their first meeting, Hughes and Payne again appeared together on\n   <em>\n    Hannity\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6 75.) Over the next several months, Hughes and Payne corresponded with each other. Payne expressed his willingness to mentor Hughes and help advance her career. (Compl. \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2013, Hughes accepted Payne's invitation to accompany him to a Manhattan museum, after which they shared a cab back to Fox's headquarters. During this ride, Payne asked Hughes for her hotel room information. She refused. At Fox's studios, Payne persisted in his efforts to obtain Hughes' hotel room number. Hughes ultimately relented and agreed to meet privately with Payne in her room. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that night, Payne sexually assaulted and raped Hughes. Although Hughes had rebuffed Payne's advances multiple times, Payne refused to listen, telling Hughes \"you know you want this.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-81.) He intensified his overtures and tightened his grip on her, saying, \"You have a bright future but you're not acting like you have the priorities I thought you did ... you know you want it.\" (Compl. \u00b6 81.) Payne overpowered Hughes, who eventually stopped resisting. After raping Hughes, Payne announced on his way out, \"This changes things.\" (Compl. \u00b6 81-82.) Despite this harrowing incident, Hughes was too shocked, humiliated, and afraid to report the rape. (Compl. \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the rape and sexual assault, Payne began inviting Hughes to appear on Fox programs on a more frequent basis. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 84-85.) Hughes attributes her increased appearances to her sexual relationship with Payne. She alleges that \"Payne did little to hide his romantic interest in [her],\" and that Fox employees were \"aware of his sexually motivated favoritism.\" (Compl. \u00b6 86;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-92, 94.) But as easily as Payne gave Hughes these valuable on-air opportunities, he could take them away. He had \"the discretion to have [ ] Hughes appear more or less frequently on his show, decide what topics he wanted her to discuss, and determine for what length of time she would appear on any given show.\" (Compl. \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As their sexual relationship continued, Payne began to exhibit violent tendencies, including \"forcibly grabb[ing] [ ] Hughes in such a way that he bruised her arms.\" (Compl. \u00b6 92;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 95-97.) When Hughes attempted to sever the affair, he \"refused and responded angrily and violently.\" (Compl. \u00b6 92.) Payne also subjected Hughes to verbal abuse, making clear that without him, Hughes had no chance of obtaining a full-time contributor position at Fox. (Compl. \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Hughes' Work for Fox\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 2013-just a month before meeting Payne-Hughes made her first appearance on\n   <em>\n    Fox and Friends\n   </em>\n   providing commentary on an assortment of political issues. According to Hughes, Fox asked her to appear as a political analyst because she \"provided insights and commentary on current political and financial issues that Fox considered important to its viewers.\" (Compl. \u00b6 37.) Over the next three years, Hughes appeared regularly on multiple programs, including\n   <em>\n    Fox and Friends\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The O'Reilly Factor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Varney &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hannity\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Making Money\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6 38.) In total, she appeared more than 240 times on Fox programs, working on 110 full-hour appearances and more than 130 segments for almost every program aired on Fox News and Fox Business Channel. (Compl. \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fox and Payne dictated the terms of Hughes' appearances. She was often asked to appear on less than twenty-four hour notice, and expected to be present at Fox's\n   studios just hours before a scheduled program. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) If Fox canceled a particular program at the last minute, it directed Hughes to remain available for the next twenty-four hours in case the network decided to run the program. (Compl. \u00b6 48.) The terms that Fox imposed on Hughes were onerous-if she declined the opportunity to appear, Fox told her that she would not be offered another appearance for months. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) Fox and Payne further represented that if Hughes was not willing to acquiesce to their terms, they would have no problem filling her position with other female commentators vying for the same opportunities. (Compl. \u00b6 49.) As a result, Hughes accepted every opportunity Fox gave her. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) Because these opportunities were extended on an irregular basis and on short notice, Hughes was precluded from accepting invitations to programs on other networks, such as Newsmax, The Blaze, and NRATV. Fox made it clear that it disapproved of her appearances as an on-air contributor for competing networks. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fox and Payne also controlled the scope of Hughes' work. All of Hughes' appearances took place at Fox's studios in New York, Washington, D.C., or Nashville, Tennessee. (Compl. \u00b6 54.) Fox and Payne dictated the topics on which Hughes could provide commentary, and provided her with specific talking points and substantive responses. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) Before live shows on\n   <em>\n    Making Money\n   </em>\n   , Hughes was required to provide Payne and the show's producers a draft of her talking points for their review. (Compl. \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Aside from content, Hughes was beholden to a rigid set of requirements regarding her physical appearance. Fox told her that she must physically look like she belonged on Fox, which meant spurning pants for short, above-the-knee, and solid color dresses that had a low cut neckline. She also had to keep her hair long and blonde, maintain a tanned skin tone, have \"nice legs,\" wear attractive high heels, and do her hair and makeup in a style that gave her the \"Fox look.\" (Compl. \u00b6 59.) Payne separately insisted that Hughes wear heels at all times, even when she was not on a program. (Compl. \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When on air, Fox controlled Hughes' performance, directing her to refrain from challenging the host or posing questions that appeared disrespectful. (Compl. \u00b6 64.) Fox often revised Hughes' talking points, rehearsed her the night before shows, and conducted a final follow-up meeting prior to the program. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) Hughes was reprimanded if she ever deviated from Fox's instructions regarding her performance. For example, on one occasion, program host Lou Dobbs berated Hughes for challenging his point of view during a live segment, admonishing her not to \"ever question me on my show again.\" Thereafter, Dobbs banned Hughes from appearing on his program. (Compl. \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Hughes was never paid for her appearances, but Fox covered expenses associated with her transportation to and from its headquarters in Manhattan. It also incurred the costs of doing her hair and make-up for appearances on\n   <em>\n    Making Money\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Hughes' Relationship with Payne\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Hughes had suffered a traumatic rape at Payne's hands in 2013, Payne managed to coerce Hughes into a long-term sexual relationship in exchange for career opportunities and benefits. Though the relationship appeared consensual on the surface, Hughes claims that she felt pressured by the imbalance of power between a \"male employee in a position of authority\" and a \"female subordinate in the workplace\" to engage in an affair with Payne. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Payne made clear that he would withdraw Hughes' opportunities to appear on Fox programs if she refused his sexual advances. (Compl. \u00b6 33.) When Hughes attempted to terminate the affair, Payne became enraged and physically violent. (Compl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Hughes' Attempts to Secure Full-Time Employment at Fox\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As Hughes' on-air appearances increased, she intensified her efforts to secure a full-time contributor position with Fox. She was told on several occasions, both by Fox and Payne, that she would be considered for a full-time contract. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 103-105.) Based on those representations, Hughes' agent contacted Fox executives, including Bill Shine, who repeatedly told her \"agent that Fox need[ed] to 'wait' a little longer and that they could discuss it 'next month.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By March 2014, after inquiring several times, Hughes was told that Fox was \"not going to be in a position to offer a contributorship but if that changes\" she would be informed. (Compl. \u00b6 107.) Fox, however, did not definitively rule Hughes out of contention for the position. By the end of 2014, Shine signaled his willingness to discuss the issue \"in early 2015,\" and noted that he \"appreciate[d] all the time and travel that [she was] doing for the show.\" (Compl. \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Hughes Terminates the Affair and Fox Blacklists Her\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In June 2015, Hughes \"summoned the courage\" to tell Payne that she was no longer willing to continue her relationship with him. (Compl. \u00b6 33.) Although Payne threatened to take away her appearances on Fox, Hughes ended the affair. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The consequences of Hughes' decision to terminate her relationship with Payne were devastating. Hughes saw her appearances on Fox programs decline precipitously. In essence, she went from appearing \"four or five times a week to only appearing five times in total over a ten-month period.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In March 2016, Hughes made her final appearance on Fox. (Compl. \u00b6 122.) Thereafter, Fox refused to schedule her for any appearances. Hughes' booking agent later learned that Fox had told other bookers-and networks-that Hughes was blacklisted from future appearances because of her affair with Payne. (Compl. \u00b6 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In January 2017, Hughes' booking agent redoubled her efforts to get Hughes booked on Fox programs. Each time she contacted Fox, however, she was repeatedly told that Fox \"does not have anything for Ms. Hughes right now.\" (Compl. \u00b6 132.) Other major networks followed suit, informing Hughes' agent that they had no appearances available despite the fact that they had previously made requests for Hughes to appear on their programs. (Compl. \u00b6 132.) According to Hughes, Fox labeled her \"not bookable,\" a designation that had not only precluded her from appearing as a guest contributor on other networks, but removed her from consideration for several high profile positions in the Trump administration. (Compl. \u00b6 134.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   VI.\n   <em>\n    Hughes Reports the Rape to Fox\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Fox and its executives were aware of the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   relationship between Hughes and Payne. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86, 91.) But in the aftermath of several public reports concerning the culture of sexual harassment at Fox-and after learning that she had been blacklisted by Fox-Hughes directed her manager to contact Fox's outside counsel to report Payne's rape. (Compl. \u00b6 136.) Instead of formally investigating Hughes' claims, however, Fox's outside counsel proposed a \"business solution,\" to avoid \"open[ing] a\n   can of worms.\" (Compl. \u00b6 137.) Outside counsel said they would contact the programming organizers and Fox's newly hired head of human resources, who would in turn reach out to Hughes' manager. (Compl. \u00b6 137.) Hughes hoped for a productive discussion about removing her name from Fox's blacklist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fox's head of human resources never contacted Hughes. Rather, on June 26, 2017, Hughes' manager received a phone call from Defendant Brandi, who interrogated him about the facts underlying Hughes' report. (Compl. \u00b6 138.) Sensing that their interests were not aligned, Hughes' manager refused to divulge any details. (Compl. \u00b6 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   VII.\n   <em>\n    National Enquirer Story\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Approximately five hours after the call with Brandi, Hughes' manager received a call from a National Enquirer reporter seeking comment about a \"breaking story\" involving the affair between Hughes and Payne. Hughes' manager learned that Defendant Briganti leaked Hughes' identity to the reporter. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 139, 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The reporter also informed Hughes' manager that Briganti provided a prepared statement from Payne in response to the impending story. (Compl. \u00b6 139.) Payne's statement mischaracterized the nature of the sexual relationship as consensual. (Compl. \u00b6 141.) In view of this inaccuracy, Hughes' manager asked the National Enquirer to delay publishing the article, including Hughes' identity. According to Hughes, Fox and Payne knowingly drafted a false statement about her involvement in the affair to preempt any actions she would have taken to expose Payne's rape, as well as the discrimination and blacklisting that she suffered. (Compl. \u00b6 155.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The delay was short-lived. On July 5, 2017, the National Enquirer ran the story, including Payne's false account of the events. The article reported that Payne had engaged in a \"romantic affair that ended two years ago.\" (Compl. \u00b6 141.) Hughes' identity was never revealed, but it took \"reporters mere hours to confirm that [ ] Hughes was the woman referred to in Payne's statement.\" (Compl. \u00b6 143.) The story was reported on for days nationally and internationally. (Compl. \u00b6 144.) By advancing a narrative crafted from their own perspective, Fox and Payne cast Hughes in a negative light and made her the subject of public contempt, ridicule, and disgrace. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 157-165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Three days later, on July 8, 2017, a select group of personal emails between Payne and Hughes was leaked on social media. The emails, read in isolation, supported Payne's narrative that the affair was consensual, leading media outlets to publish additional stories styled \"[l]eaked emails cast doubt on Hughes's allegations against Charles Payne.\" (Compl. \u00b6 145.) With these indiscretions out in full view, Hughes \"endured horrific humiliation and criticism,\" and found her ability to secure employment greatly diminished. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/229/#p237\">\n    496 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (2d Cir. 2007). \"To survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff's pleading must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(Opp. at 14.) She alleges that \"Fox encouraged [her] to continue appearing on its many programs, and she did so, based on Fox's promises to retain her contractually.\" (Compl. \u00b6 103.) Hughes separately argues that \"Defendants provided remuneration to [her] outside of traditional compensation arrangements,\" like the valuable opportunities\n   to appear on nationally televised programs, which burnished her reputation as a political commentator.

The\n   <em>\n    Consolmagno\n   </em>\n   court found that the plaintiff may have been promised a \"stipend or health insurance like the rest\" of her colleagues \"as a matter of school policy,\" and that there was a genuine factual issue as to whether the plaintiff had waived her right to receive such remuneration.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223916\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/72/367/#p378\">\n    72 F.Supp.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this is different from what Hughes alleges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Hughes' reliance on Fox's purported assurances regarding a full-time contributor contract is misplaced. First, the allegations are too general. That Payne once told Hughes that \"he would secure her as a 'regular panelist' \" on his show does not mean he had promised her the type of financial benefits recognized as remuneration. (Compl. \u00b6 104.) This allegation merely suggests that Hughes would have appeared on Payne's program with greater regularity and frequency without the guarantee of a salaried contract or long-term benefits. Second, any allegations concerning Fox's promises to retain her contractually were prospective. The Complaint does not allege that Fox promised to pay her for prior appearances. Thus, as Hughes herself concedes, allegations regarding the \"offer of a contract to coerce [her] into continued performance subject\" to Fox and Payne's \"control and will\" are more relevant to a failure-to-hire claim. (Opp. at 17-18 (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, 103-104, 106-107).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, Hughes' allegations that her nationally televised appearances were a valuable benefit because it increased her influence and \"broaden[ed] her impact\" on audiences, (Opp. at 15), are akin to the vague benefits-like the networking opportunities in York-that courts have excluded from the financial benefit analysis. If such allegations were deemed a financial benefit for purposes of determining employee status, virtually every commentator on a national television network could satisfy the remuneration requirement. In any event, an incidental benefit of appearing on a nationally televised program is widespread publicity and name recognition, and may not be considered under the financial benefit analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Hughes contends that Defendants' arguments address only her federal claim, and that the issue of remuneration is a \"factor that likely holds substantially less weight when assessing her relationship with Defendants\" under the more lenient standards of the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. (Opp. at 14.) Hughes relies on 2014 amendments to the NYSHRL and NYCHRL, which she claims protects unpaid interns from sexual harassment and discrimination. (Opp. at 14.) While that may be true, Hughes never alleged that she was an intern at Fox. The 2014 amendments were designed to protect college students who took internships as a valuable learning experience and a steppingstone to the job market.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20296\">\n    N.Y.

A \"failure-to-hire claim is distinguishable from other employment discrimination claims in that it necessarily applies in most circumstances to non-employees seeking employment positions rather than current employees.

But those allegations, considered together with others, such as Payne's assurance that Hughes would receive a position as a regular panelist on his show,\n   <em>\n    Making Money\n   </em>\n   , (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 103-104), and that \"Fox executives such as Shine continuously evaluated [Hughes'] performance for purposes of offering a contract,\" (Compl. \u00b6 109), lend credence to Hughes' argument that Fox had considered her candidacy as a full-time contributor on an ongoing basis. That Fox foreclosed Hughes from appearing on competing networks amplifies the notion that Hughes was auditioning exclusively to be a Fox contributor. (Compl. \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, at oral argument, Fox seemed to acknowledge that it had no formal application process for full-time contributor positions. Fox's counsel suggested that absent a formal process, the law could not provide a failure-to-hire claim. (Hr'g Tr. dated February 23, 2018, ECF No. 57 (\"Tr.\"), at 10:19-20.) This Court disagrees. It is undisputed that Fox extends contributor contracts to certain candidates. Despite the opaque process of determining who becomes a contributor, the \"only way that Fox can winnow people and consider people ... is to put them on [a program].\" (Tr. at 9:14-18.) And if Fox routinely puts an individual on a program-signaling to that individual that he or she is qualified enough to appear with regularity-it cannot then seek an end-run to a failure-to-hire claim simply because no formal application process exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Fox used the lure of a full-time contributorship as a carrot and a stick to secure Hughes' continued appearances. On one occasion, Payne threatened to remove her from consideration for the position, telling her to leave his office if she thought \"someone else can get you the contributorship.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.) On other occasions, Fox and Shine strung Hughes and her agent along, deferring discussion of the position until a later time, yet creating the impression that it was only a matter of time until Hughes would be hired as a full-time contributor. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62; 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants further argue that even if \"there were an open position for which [Hughes] applied, [Hughes] has not made even a conclusory allegation that she was qualified to fill an open position at Fox,\" or that the contributor position \"that she claims to have wanted was ever available and remained open at Fox\" to other applicants. (Opp. 19.) But the Complaint's\n   allegations belie those arguments. Over the course of two years, Hughes was repeatedly invited back on an assortment of Fox programs. Fox regularly evaluated her performance, and molded her in the network's image. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.) Fox treated her as a qualified candidate, gladly showcasing her \"conservative views and political connections,\" to \"increas[e] its bottom line.\" (Compl. \u00b6 63.) Moreover, the Complaint alleges that there was a long line of other candidates who would have \"no problem filling in [Hughes'] role.\" (Compl. \u00b6 49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-70.) This suggests, at the very least, that Fox kept Hughes' specific contributor position open to test out other candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having satisfied the four elements required to make out a failure-to-hire claim under the applicable statutes, this Court finds that the alleged \"circumstances could reasonably be read as supporting an inference of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaffney v.

But in this Court's view, those positions overlook the complex dynamics underlying a work environment fraught with power disparities. Sexual harassment can manifest itself in many forms. Some are less obvious than others but just as invidious. Formally reporting an incident of sexual assault is one form of protected activity, but it is not always available. An individual who is sexually harassed by her supervisor, or someone with clout within the company, faces a Hobson's choice-she is either forced to endure her supervisor's unwanted overtures, or file a complaint that will inevitably bruise his ego and jeopardize her job and career.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Complaint adequately pleads the second and third elements of the retaliation claim. In addition to Payne's obvious knowledge of Hughes' decision to terminate the sexual relationship, Bill Shine \"decided that [Hughes] must be to blame for the alleged affair.\" (Compl. \u00b6 117.) Payne, with Shine's assistance, then followed through on his threats to end her career at Fox. \"[A]fter June 2015, [ ] Hughes' appearances on Fox programs dramatically decreased.\" (Compl. \u00b6 118.) Suddenly, her \"appearances were reduced to a mere five appearances on the\n   <em>\n    The O'Reilly Factor\n   </em>\n   over the course of the following ten months.\" (Compl. \u00b6 118.)

Hughes also asserts that Fox told other networks that she was \"not bookable,\" thereby precluding her from similar opportunities. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 123, 205.)

Further, the precipitous decline in her appearances on Fox programs, along with allegations that Fox had blacklisted her across the industry, bolsters the notion that Hughes' \"protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse [employment] action.\"\n   <em>\n    Gorman-Bakos v.

The temporal proximity in this case is undisputed-after terminating her relationship with Payne, Hughes saw her appearances \"reduced to a mere five appearances\" over the next ten months.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 184, 200, 219.) But this aspect of Hughes' retaliation claim fails for two reasons. First, the statement peddled to the National Enquirer does not reference Hughes by name. And even if Defendants disclosed her name to the National Enquirer, it was not published.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, an employer is entitled to undertake reasonable defensive measures against an employee's charge of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

The \"defensive measure\" here-preemptively releasing a statement to the National Enquirer-did not \"result in differential treatment\" because Hughes' name was not published.

(Mot. at 20.) Defendants also maintain that the NYSHRL and NYCHRL's three-year statutes of limitation bar any claims stemming from alleged misconduct occurring before September 18, 2014-three years before Hughes filed her complaint-which would exclude the July 2013 rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The statute of limitations under Title VII and its state and city counterparts bars claims for any discrete acts of discrimination occurring outside of the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l R.R.

Hughes does not appear to contest this point. Rather, she argues that at the pleading stage, this \"Court need not identify the specific allegations that may or may not be time barred.\" (Opp. at 23.) Indeed, even if some of the acts are untimely, they may be used as \"background evidence in support of a timely claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p114\">\n    536 U.S. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p114\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while certain acts of misconduct preceding December 2016 may be time-barred for purposes of bringing a Title VII failure-to-hire or retaliation claim, they nevertheless contextualize the discrete acts that fall within the limitations period. The same is true with respect to Hughes' NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims for alleged acts arising prior to September 2014.

Hughes does not allege that either defendant had the power to grant or rescind a contributor contract. Moreover, it is unclear whether Brandi or Briganti ever interacted with Hughes during her time at Fox, nor is there any indication that they actually participated in the decision to terminate her candidacy and blacklist her. The only allegation remotely specific to Brandi and Briganti-their role in providing a false story to the National Enquirer-falls short of establishing liability because this Court has already concluded that such actions were not retaliatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Payne, on the other hand, faces individual liability for his actions following Hughes' termination of their sexual relationship.

The National Enquirer article reported that Payne's paramour was a \"married colleague\" and \"former CNN and Fox News contributor.\" (Declaration of Linda Goldstein in Support of Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 36, Ex. A.) While this description may encompass a broad spectrum of Payne's colleagues, an average reader could have deduced that Hughes was Payne's mistress. The Complaint alleges this: \"Although the statement published on July 5, 2017 did not use [ ] Hughes's name ... [i]t took reporters mere hours to confirm that [ ] Hughes was [the] woman referred to in Payne's statement.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.) Hughes' allegations that one point during her two-year run at Fox she appeared on Payne's show on a near daily basis undermines Defendants' position that \"[n]o National Enquirer reader could have figured out that Payne's 'romantic affair' was with [Hughes].\" (Mot. at 29.) At a minimum then, the question of whether Defendants' false statements to the National Enquirer were made with Hughes in mind is a question of fact better suited for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Nevertheless, Hughes' defamation claims fail because the Complaint does\n   not sufficiently allege the actual malice and damages elements. Here, Hughes admits that she is a public figure. (Opp. at 5 (\"It is uncontested that [ ] Hughes is a public figure.\"), 33 n.8.) Therefore, in order to survive a motion to dismiss, Hughes is required to allege \"specific facts that plausibly evidence actual malice in a clear and convincing manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Palin v. N.Y.

(Compl. \u00b6 138.) In that conversation, Hughes' manager declined to provide any details about Hughes' allegations. (Compl. \u00b6 138.) Brandi also relied on Payne's version of the events, which was eventually provided to the National Enquirer. (Compl. \u00b6 6.) With these facts, and in view of Brandi's fiduciary position as Fox's general counsel, it is no surprise that she credited Payne's story. But even if this Court credited Hughes' allegation that Payne coerced her into an affair, the Complaint does not adequately state that Brandi was aware of that fact and acted with a \"high degree of awareness of [the statement's] probable falsity.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrison v.

But the Complaint's allegations ultimately fail to satisfy the lofty standard of actual malice even as to Payne.
