INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") case alleging a breach of fiduciary duties in the management of a defined contribution plan. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint (Doc. No. 37) is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are alleged in the Amended Class Action Complaint. (Doc. No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are current and former employees of Exxon Mobil Corporation (\"Exxon\") who were participants in and beneficiaries of the Exxon Mobil Savings Plan (the \"Plan\") and who were invested in Exxon company stock during the period of November 1, 2015 through October 28, 2016 (the \"Class Period\"). (Doc. No. 36 at 1, 11.) Defendants are Exxon and senior corporate officers of Exxon who were fiduciaries of the Plan during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The corporate officers are referred to as \"Trustee Defendants\" and, collectively, Exxon and the Trustee Defendants are referred to as \"Defendants.\" Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"knew or should have known that Exxon's stock had become artificially inflated in value due to fraud and misrepresentation, thus making Exxon stock an imprudent investment under ERISA and damaging the Plan and those Plan participants who bought or held stock.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan is an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") and a defined contribution benefit plan sponsored by Exxon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Eligible employees can contribute up to 25% of their compensation to the Plan, and Exxon will make a matching\n   contribution of 6%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the Class Period, the Plan was managed by Trustee Defendants Beth Casteel, Suzanne McCarron, Malcolm Farrant, Daniel Lyons, and Len Fox, all of whom were appointed by Exxon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Exxon stock represented the single largest holding of the Plan, \"approximately $10 billion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Plaintiffs allege that the Plan purchased at least $800 million in Exxon stock during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Exxon is a publicly-traded, multinational oil and gas company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Plaintiffs allege that Exxon made materially false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period when Exxon highlighted its strong business model, transparency, and reporting integrity, especially with regard to its oil and gas reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege the public statements were materially false and misleading when made because they failed to disclose: (1) that Exxon's own internally-generated reports concerning climate change recognized the environmental risks caused by climate change; (2) that, given the risks associated with climate change, Exxon would not be able to extract all of the hydrocarbon reserves Exxon claimed to have and it therefore should have written down those reserves as \"stranded\"; and (3) that Exxon used an inaccurate \"price of carbon\" in evaluating the value of its future oil and gas reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") reporting rules require \"proved\" reserves to be oil and gas that is economically producible based on a backward-looking 12-month price average; other reserves are \"stranded.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During 2014, oil prices fell by nearly 50%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Exxon's competitors all reported impaired reserves; Exxon did not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) From June through August 2015, oil prices fell again, but Exxon again reported no impact on its reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) For example, in an October 30, 2015 earnings release, Exxon did not indicate there had been any impact on its reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) On February 19, 2016, Exxon issued a release announcing that it had increased its reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) In its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016, Exxon boasted about its rigorous methods for calculating reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25.) Exxon representatives made similar remarks throughout March, April, and July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-33.) Exxon's stock reached a Class-Period high of $95 per share in mid-July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In fall of 2015, news articles reported that Exxon had understood for decades the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels, despite having funded climate change denial research, think tanks, and publications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 18.) State attorneys general announced climate change litigation against Exxon, and Exxon retaliated by countersuing Massachusetts Attorney General Healey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) On August 19, 2016,\n   <em>\n    The New York Times\n   </em>\n   reported that New York Attorney General Schneiderman was investigating whether Exxon was then potentially defrauding its investors by overstating the value of its reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) Share prices dropped $1 that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) In September,\n   <em>\n    The Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   made similar reports, adding that the SEC was investigating Exxon for securities fraud, and again Exxon share prices dropped about $1 with each new report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 28, 2016, before trading opened, Exxon disclosed that it might need to write down nearly 20% of its oil and gas assets if energy prices remained low for the rest of 2016, and that 4.6 billion barrels of reserves may need to be written down or were not profitable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.) Exxon share prices fell more than $2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege three alternative actions that Trustee Defendants should have taken. First, Plaintiffs allege Trustee Defendants should have made, or caused others to make, corrective disclosures regarding the valuation of Exxon's oil and gas reserves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) Plaintiffs allege that the longer a fraud persists, the more harm there will be, so earlier corrective disclosures would lead to a milder stock price correction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) Second, Plaintiffs allege that Trustee Defendants should have halted all new investments or contributions to Exxon stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) Third, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants should have invested a \"small but significant portion of the Plan's holdings into a low-cost hedging product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) They describe the hedging products as irrevocable trusts that are managed by an independent third party and that pool funds together from a group of financially-healthy and diverse companies for a fixed period of time, during which the pooled funds are invested \"typically in United States Treasury securities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs bring two claims: (1) failure to prudently and loyally\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   manage the Plan's assets pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D) and 1109(a), and (2) failure of Exxon, as an appointing fiduciary, to monitor or remove the individual fiduciaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 57-61.) Defendants have filed a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, urging the Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint with prejudice because it does not meet the heightened pleading standard the Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit have set out for ERISA breach of fiduciary duties actions. (Doc. No. 37.) Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint also fails to allege the existence of material information Exxon misrepresented/failed to disclose or that Exxon had a duty to monitor, which it failed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A court may dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

This Court first assesses whether Plaintiffs have alleged the existence of, and Trustee Defendants' knowledge of, insider information and false or misleading statements that were inconsistent with the information.

(Doc. No. 36 at 16, 18.) News articles and reports that Defendants filed with their motion to dismiss corroborate this disconnect between what Exxon knew about climate change science internally and what it presented externally. (Doc. No. 37-2 at Exh. G (an October 9, 2015\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   article), Exh. H (a September 16, 2015\n   <em>\n    Inside Climate News\n   </em>\n   article).) These investigative reports note, for example, that between 1986 and 1992 researchers looked at the effects that a warming Arctic would have on oil operations and reported their findings to Exxon headquarters in Houston and New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exh. G at 4.) Exxon was \"at the forefront of climate change research, funding its own internal science as well as research from outside experts\" since the late 1970s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exh.

(Doc. No. 37 at 17-18.) Defendants point to Exxon's publicly available 2015 Corporate Citizenship Report, which acknowledges \"risks of climate change\" (Doc. No. 37-2 at Exh.

The two investigative reporting articles that Defendants cited and that purport to show Exxon's deceit regarding climate change relied on archival materials in Calgary's Glenbow Museum, the University of Texas, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the American Academy for the Advancement of Sciences, as well as interviews with Exxon employees. (Doc. No. 37-2 at Exhs. G, H.) Plaintiffs argue that interviews and archival materials in various institutions are not public information of which a plaintiff alleging fraud is expected to be aware.

Hydrocarbon reserves\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, on the basis of Exxon's knowledge about climate change, Exxon should have known that worldwide use of fossil fuels would need to be reduced and that it was highly unlikely that Exxon would be able to extract all of its hydrocarbon reserves, rendering some assets stranded. (Doc. No. 36 at 18.) Exxon's competitors all reported impaired reserves in 2014 and, at that time, Exxon did not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Exxon announced it might write down the value of its assets in late 2016, and after this announcement stock prices fell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants advance three arguments to explain why Exxon's statements about its reserves were not misleading or false: (1) Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requirements bound them to consideration only of existing conditions and regulations; (2) Exxon had no way of knowing that future regulatory developments would render assets stranded; and (3) there are no alleged facts to explain why Exxon's estimated proved reserves should have \"mirrored\" its competitors. (Doc. No. 37 at 18-20.) The Court will address each of the three arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the SEC requires calculations of proved reserves to be \"those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.4-10\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.4-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties disagree about both whether Exxon legally could anticipate future impacts on reserves and whether Exxon did take the future into account when calculating reserves. Defendants place emphasis on the SEC's phrase \"existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations\"; Defendants argue that Exxon was legally bound not to anticipate future regulatory developments. (Doc. No. 37 at 18-19.) Plaintiffs counter that Defendants' position is inconsistent with Exxon's actual practice because, in January 2017, Exxon wrote down the value of its reserves based in part on its expectations regarding future energy prices. (Doc. No. 38 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As Plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint: in late October 2016, Exxon announced it \"might be forced to write down nearly 20% of its oil and gas assets if energy prices\n   <em>\n    remained\n   </em>\n   low through the end of 2016. Specifically, the Company acknowledged that it might have to write down 3.6 billion barrels of oil sand reserves and one billion barrels of other North American reserves that Exxon now conceded were not profitable to produce under\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   prices.\" (Doc. No. 36 at 38 (emphasis added).) On January 31, 2017, Exxon did write down its reserves, and it quantified the write-down at $2 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Thus, it appears Exxon did take into consideration what the reserves would be if prices remained low-which implies some consideration of future prices. Defendants clarify that a write-down of assets, not quantities, is \"entirely consistent with the governing SEC regulations, which permit such reductions in appropriate circumstances.\" (Doc. No. 39 at 8.) But the misrepresentation Plaintiffs allege is of the monetary value of the reserves: Plaintiffs allege that Exxon \"materially overstate[s] the value of its reserves.\" (Doc. No. 36 at 19.) Without more information, the SEC regulations argument that Exxon raised appears to be a non sequitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegation that future regulatory developments are likely to leave Exxon assets stranded is conclusory and inconsistent with independent experts. Exxon points to a report from the International Energy Agency acknowledging that the majority of the world's total primary energy supply will continue to come from carbon-based sources through at least 2040. (Doc. No. 37-2 at Exh. I.) But the Court need not rely on a single report that was not in the Amended Complaint and that was published in September 2016-near the end of the Class Period-to support an argument about what Exxon could have known throughout a Class Period that began a year earlier. Similar facts were incorporated in the Complaint: Plaintiffs allege that, in public statements, Exxon made clear that it believed the \"transition of the global energy system to lower-emissions sources will take many decades\" and therefore \"none of our proven hydrocarbon reserves are, or will become, stranded.\" (Doc. No. 36 at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that, just because its principal competitors were writing down their proved reserves due to declining energy prices does not mean that Exxon also should have. The Amended Complaint alleges that Exxon's competitors\n   reported impaired reserves in 2014 after oil prices fell by nearly 50%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Throughout the Class Period, Exxon explicitly compared itself to its competitors. For example, then-CEO Rex Tillerson reported that, unlike its competitors, Exxon's reserves were not impaired because of the Exxon's \"disciplined investment approach, effective project management, and innovative technologies.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.4-10\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.4-10\">\n    at 26-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It takes some sleuthing to determine the misinformation alleged here. The competitors' write-downs were public knowledge and were precipitated by a drop in oil prices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   An efficient market could consider whether competitors' write-downs and low oil prices should also impair Exxon's stock price. Exxon said that it had superior investing, management, and technology compared to its competitors, and therefore it would not need to write down the reserves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But for Plaintiffs' ESOP claim to work, there must be \"insider\" information leading the Plan fiduciaries to know that Exxon's superiority was a hoax. The only such \"insider\" information alleged is that Exxon was using an inaccurate price of carbon, which takes us to the next section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Price of carbon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Exxon employed an inaccurate \"price of carbon\" when evaluating the value of its reserves. (Doc. No. 36 at 19.) Plaintiffs define the price of carbon as \"the cost of regulations such as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to push down emissions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) By downplaying the cost of carbon, Exxon could underestimate the impact emissions-based regulations would have on the company's bottom line. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs reproduce language from Exxon's 2015 Corporate Citizenship Report, which explains that Exxon estimates a \"proxy cost of carbon\" which \"may approach $80 per ton by 2040.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege any facts to show why this particular price of carbon was a misrepresentation or did not account for the current or an anticipated regulatory landscape. Plaintiffs seem to believe that the estimated price of carbon was wrong, but they do not plausibly link inaccuracies about the price of carbon to the eventual write-down in reserves or stock price decline. Nor do they allege a regulatory landscape that would change the price of carbon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There is a disconnect between future regulatory developments and likelihood that oil will be extracted. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Exxon knew about climate change and the way that the oil and gas industry contributed to it. But Plaintiffs have not plausibly linked the realities of climate change to future health of an oil and gas company, especially as it relates to the Class Period. It may be inconsistent with ethical norms for a company to know that its business contributes to global harm and at the same time to expect to continue to profit from that business, but ERISA stock-drop claims do not provide a mechanism for relief from that inconsistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Defendants' knowledge and misstatements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is true that Exxon eventually marked down its reserves. Was it plausibly alleged that any of the Defendants knew they needed to be marked down before they were?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the Trustee Defendants knew that Exxon's statements were materially false or misleading. The Trustee Defendants were not responsible for Exxon's financial reports and public disclosures. (Doc. No. 37-1 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that they alleged (1) the research regarding the risk climate change posed to Exxon's business was circulating among senior executives at Exxon, including the Trustee Defendants, for years (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 36 at 16, 37); (2) Defendant Casteel ran the business segment that was \"directly responsible for Exxon's oil and gas exploration and extraction\" and \"most responsible for knowing the 'price of carbon' and its impact on its operations and reserves\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38); (3) Defendant McCarron was \"responsible for monitoring the activities of\" regulatory agencies and was \"responsible for Exxon's research regarding sociological, political and economic risks as well as strategy and communications over public affairs issues\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). Those allegations are in addition to the inferences that Plaintiffs argue a court may make based on Trustee Defendants' jobs and responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the link between the risks that climate change poses and write-down of the reserves is alleged to be causal. But it is not the logical causal link based on the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint or the Class Period. It is more natural to infer from the alleged facts that the write-down of the reserves was due to a sustained dip in oil prices combined with a public relations campaign to counter the actions of the state attorneys general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Amended Complaint does include other reasons for the write-down, and why it was or should have been known earlier. The following facts were known by the market and certainly by Defendants: the price of oil was in decline, the decline led Exxon's competitors to announce write-downs of their reserves, and the oil industry and climate change are inter-related (i.e., the burning of fossil fuels contributes to climate change and so regulatory programs to address climate change could affect the oil industry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, the Court will assume that it is plausible that Trustee Defendants, by virtue of their positions in the company and the job responsibilities alleged by Plaintiffs, knew that the reserves were overvalued before they wrote them down.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jander v.

But, Plaintiffs argue, no court has declared ESOP duty of prudence claims \"extinct,\" and this case demonstrates why. (Doc. No. 38 at 12.) Plaintiffs allege three alternative actions: (1) Trustee Defendants should have made, or caused others to make, corrective disclosures regarding the valuation of Exxon's oil and gas reserves; (2) Trustee Defendants should have halted all new investments or contributions to Exxon stock; and (3) Trustee Defendants should have invested a \"small but significant portion of the Plan's holdings into a low-cost hedging product,\" such as United States Treasury securities. (Doc. No. 36 at 43-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Corrective disclosures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The first alternative action Plaintiffs allege Trustee Defendants should have taken was to cause earlier corrective disclosures about the oil and gas reserves.

Defendants argue that imposing a corrective disclosure requirement on the Trustee Defendants would require disclosures outside of the statutory framework for securities laws and that these particular individuals are not alleged to be responsible for Exxon's financial reporting. (Doc. No. 37-1 at 15.) The Court need not delve into the first part of Defendants' objection because Plaintiffs allege that the corrective disclosure-a write down of the reserves-could have occurred in an earlier disclosure, not necessarily in a separate disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 36 at 22, 45.) As for the latter part, Plaintiffs have carefully worded the Amended Complaint to allege the Trustee Defendants \"should have sought out those Company executives with responsibility for making disclosures under the securities laws and entreated them to make the necessary corrective disclosures regarding Exxon's valuation of its oil and gas reserves.\" (Doc.

Plaintiffs allege that Exxon had a duty to monitor because Exxon was a Plan fiduciary; Exxon was a Plan fiduciary because Exxon was responsible for the appointment of the Trustee Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   A person is a fiduciary with respect to an ESOP to the extent \"he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or...he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\" 29 U.S.C. 1002(21)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has \"never recognized [a] theory of ERISA fiduciary liability\" that holds corporate directors personally liable for failing to monitor fiduciaries appointed by the directors.\n   <em>\n    RadioShack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415164\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/137/#p146\">\n    882 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   150 (citing\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Bruister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919569\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/250/\">\n    823 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 n.10 (5th Cir. 2016) ). \"Even if the court were to adopt such a theory, duty-to-monitor claims recognized by other courts inherently require a breach of duty by the appointed fiduciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The same analysis applies here. A Plan description from 2012 states that Exxon appoints Plan fiduciaries. (Doc. No. 36 at 13.) Plaintiffs argue that Exxon had the discretion to appoint new fiduciaries\n   when these fiduciaries were not taking action. (Doc. No. 38 at 22.) No other facts about Exxon's role, discretionary or otherwise, with respect to the Plan are alleged. The Amended Complaint does not reference any individuals at Exxon who would be doing the appointing. Most convincingly, even if the court were to adopt a theory requiring the appointing entity to monitor the fiduciaries, because there has been no sufficiently-alleged breach of duty by the appointed fiduciaries, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court wishes to emphasize what the instant Memorandum &amp; Order does not decide. It does not decide whether Exxon or any of its affiliates engaged in false advertising, concealed negative financial or environmental information, or contributed to climate change. The Court decides only the issues raised by Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint in this ERISA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they should be given leave to file an amended complaint. In response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs cited as new facts: (1) \"on May 31, 2017, Exxon shareholders passed a resolution asking the Company to evaluate and disclose to the public how climate change could affect its business going forward, including with respect to measures like the 2015 Paris climate change agreement\"; and (2) \"on June 2, 2017, in a filing in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the New York Attorney General's Office alleged that its office 'has uncovered significant evidence of potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon about its application of a proxy cost of [greenhouse gas emissions] to its investment and impairment decisions...' \" (Doc. No. 38 at 23.) Defendants argue that neither of these new allegations would cure the above deficiencies. The first-about a shareholder resolution that passed after the Class Period-certainly would not because it is temporally separate from this case. The second is too vague for the Court to assess at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although the complaint being evaluated here is an \"amended\" complaint, it is the first complaint that has been tested by a motion to dismiss and analyzed by the Court in this case. If Plaintiffs wish to amend and cure the defects in this Amended Complaint, they must do so by April 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Plaintiffs have clarified that they do not bring a separate duty of loyalty claim. Instead, Plaintiffs identify Defendants' duty of loyalty \"as one of several factors\" that required Defendants to \"put an end to Exxon's fraud and tell the truth.\" (Doc. No. 38 at 9 n.4.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    National and international scientific organizations and government organizations had researched and published information about climate change before the Class Period.
