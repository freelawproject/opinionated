Presently before the Court is the Commissioner's motion, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), for judgment on the pleadings (Def.'s Notice of Mot., ECF No. 14) and accompanying Memorandum of Law (ECF No. 15). Plaintiff has not responded to the Commissioner's motion, and the time to do so has\n   passed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, dated July 14, 2017, ECF No. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Polanco filed her applications for benefits on April 30, 2014 alleging a disability onset date of July 1, 2009. (Administrative R. (\"R.\") 113-15, 116-24, ECF No. 11.) Her applications were initially denied and Polanco requested a hearing, which was held on November 12, 2015 before Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Michael Friedman. (R. 29-46.) ALJ Friedman denied Polanco's benefits applications on December 9, 2015. (R. 11-18.) At the hearing, Polanco was represented by a non-attorney representative. (R. 11.) ALJ Friedman's decision became the Commissioner's final decision when the Appeals Council denied review on September 23, 2016. (R. 1-5.) This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Non-Medical Evidence And Polanco's Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Born on December 23, 1959, Polanco was forty-nine years old at the alleged onset of her disability and fifty-five years old at the time of the 2015 hearing. (R. 116.) Polanco completed the seventh grade in school and can speak, read and understand English (R. 137-39.) From at least 1994 until July 1, 2009, Polanco worked as an embroiderer in a clothing factory. (R. 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the administrative hearing, Polanco testified that she stopped working as an embroiderer in 2009 because of knee pain, incontinence and depression. (R. 37.) She further testified that she sees a therapist once a week and a psychiatrist, who prescribes her medicine, once per month. (R. 38.) Polanco agreed that medicine sometimes helped her mental condition, but stated that it is hard for her to concentrate and focus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Polanco testified that she lives in an apartment with her daughter and does not cook, but sometimes will help clean the apartment. (R. 34, 39.) At other times, she does not feel like doing anything and will stay in her room sleeping. (R. 40.) Polanco also testified that she does not have an active social life. (R. 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In terms of her physical condition, Polanco testified that she can stand for ten to fifteen minutes before needing to sit down, and can sit comfortably for half an hour. (R. 38-39.) She testified that she could not lift a grocery bag weighing five to ten pounds, but could lift approximately one pound and could use public transportation. (R. 39.) She also testified that she had problems with frequent urination, which was worsened by lifting, carrying and walking long distances, but that she wore adult diapers to address the problem. (R. 41-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A vocational expert, Miriam Green, also testified at the hearing. (R. 35-36.) Ms. Green testified that Polanco's past work fell under the specific title of \"embroidery machine operator\" and explained that there are two different Dictionary of Occupational Titles\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   codes for that job depending on the specific tasks performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ALJ asked Polanco what she did generally at her job and Polanco said that she \"made the symbol embroidery.\" (R. 36.) The ALJ asked if she \"generally just [did] the same thing over and over again,\" to\n   which Polanco answered \"yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on that description of Polanco's work, Ms. Green determined that Polanco's past relevant work was in the light exertional category and had a Specific Vocational Preparation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"SVP\") of two. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Green also testified that one unscheduled work absence per month would be the maximum permitted for competitive employment and that an employer for competitive employment would permit an employee to be off-task up to ten percent during an average workday. (R. 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Medical Evidence Before The ALJ\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Medical History Prior To Alleged Onset Date\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As of January 2007, Polanco reported problems with feeling an urgency to urinate, though her treating physician at Bellevue Hospital Center (\"Bellevue\"), Dr. Esther Butler, indicated that the condition had been stable over the previous few months. (R. 202.) In February 2009, Dr. Butler assessed Polanco with, among other things, stress incontinence and moderate depression. (R. 335-36.) In March 2009, Dr. Butler referred Polanco for a urology evaluation due to persistent microscopic hematuria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 2009, Polanco complained of increasing depression. (R. 215.) She reported quitting her job because she did not feel good there, had increased stress and back pain, and her new manager yelled a lot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that time, she was noted as having a PHQ-9\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   score of 22, which suggested severe depression, and was started on Lexapro. (R. 216.) Dr. Butler also noted that follow-up care had been scheduled to address Polanco's stress incontinence. (R. 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Bellevue Hospital Center\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August 2009, Polanco underwent a flexible cystoscopy to examine her bladder. (R. 212-13.) She continued to report feeling urgency to urinate and was prescribed Vesicare. (R. 213.) During a follow-up urology visit in November 2009, Polanco reported improvement in urgency on Vesicare and a workup for microscopic hematuria was negative. (R. 326.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2009, Polanco visited the medicine clinic at Bellevue for a routine follow-up appointment with Dr. Butler. (R. 209-10.) Polanco reported that she felt well and that Lexapro was helpful for her depression, but she was still interested in counseling. (R. 209.) Dr. Butler recommended continuing Lexapro and referred Polanco to the \"depression team.\" (R. 210.) Dr. Butler also noted that Polanco's PHQ-9 score had dropped from 22 to 8 and that her stress incontinence had improved with Vesicare. (R. 210-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During her next visit with Dr. Butler in April 2010, Polanco told Dr. Butler that she had not followed up with the depression team, but that she was feeling well\n   with Lexapro and going to the gym and going out more. (R. 206.) Based on a PHQ-9 score of 8, Dr. Butler diagnosed mild depression and decided to continue medications. (R. 207.) Polanco saw Dr. Butler again on September 16, 2010 and reported mild depression. (R. 204-06.) Dr. Butler's notes indicate that Polanco had stopped taking Lexapro for depression and did not want to restart the medication. (R. 205.) Her physical examination was normal. (R. 204.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 6, 2011, Polanco was seen by Dr. Arthur Robin Williams at Bellevue. (R. 224-25.) She reported right knee pain when climbing stairs or walking more than three blocks, and that she could not bear weight on her right leg. (R. 224.) On examination, Polanco displayed full strength and range of motion in the lower extremities and had no tenderness to palpation in either knee, though she walked cautiously with an abnormal gait. (R. 224.) Dr. Williams assessed general knee pain and advised ice, rest and Ibuprofen. (R. 224.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At a follow up visit with Dr. Butler on May 19, 2011, Polanco reported that her knee pain had improved with Motrin, though she still experienced pain when using stairs. (R. 221.) Dr. Butler noted that Polanco's depressive disorder was improved with no medication. (R. 222.) An August 2011 rehabilitation note from Dr. Rudy Malayil at Bellevue noted that Polanco had right knee weakness after walking up more than two flights of stairs or on prolonged ambulation. (R. 218.) On examination, she had no obvious deformity, atrophy or swelling. (R. 218.) She displayed full strength, normal reflexes, full squatting and normal gait. (R. 218.) A knee X-ray suggested early osteoarthritis. (R. 249.) As of September 2011, Dr. Butler noted that her knee pain was relieved with Tylenol. (R. 234-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In February 2012, Polanco returned to the Bellevue medicine clinic for a routine visit, where she reported continued bilateral knee pain and requested to see a physical therapist and a podiatrist for orthotics. (R. 232-33.) Dr. Muhibur Rahman provided the referrals requested. (R. 233.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 5, 2012, Polanco had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Butler where she reported that she was still depressed, with symptoms that waxed and waned, but that she had no suicidal ideations. (R. 229.) Dr. Butler noted that Polanco still was not working after being laid off over three years ago, and this contributed to her depression. (R. 229.) Polanco said she otherwise felt well. (R. 229.) On examination, Polanco had a PHQ-9 score of 11, suggesting moderate depression. (R. 230.) She agreed to start Lexapro again and was referred to the depression team. (R. 230.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 6, 2013, Polanco had a psychiatry visit with Dr. Christina Sekaer at Bellevue, where she was tearful through much of the session. (R. 237-38.) A mental status examination showed that Polanco was fully oriented and had a normal thought process, but suffered from mild to moderate depression. (R. 238.) Polanco complained of difficulty sleeping and an ongoing depressed mood in spite of taking Lexapro for several weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Sekaer prescribed Trazodone, and suggested Polanco start psychotherapy with the depression team. (R. 238.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 22, 2013, Polanco visited Dr. Butler, reporting that she had stopped taking Lexapro and was taking only Trazodone for her depressive disorder, but that she did not want to increase the dosage as she felt it was working okay. (R. 227.) For her knee pain, Dr. Butler suggested that she continue Tylenol as needed and ice her knee two to three times a day. (R. 227.) Polanco had a September 2013 radiograph of both knees, which showed osteoarthritis in the right knee. (R. 533.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At a follow-up visit on October 21, 2013, Polanco told Dr. Butler that her knee pain had improved somewhat with physical therapy at an outside facility. (R. 242.) She reported that her depression was a little worse and that she was taking Trazodone only intermittently. (R. 242.) She had a PHQ-9 score of 13, indicating moderate depression, and was encouraged to restart Trazodone nightly. (R. 243.) On March 27, 2014, Polanco returned to Dr. Butler and reported that she began taking a higher dose of Trazodone, which seemed to help her with sleep and depression. (R. 239.) She had a PHQ-9 score of 7, indicative of mild depression. (R. 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 4, 2014, Polanco reported to Dr. Butler that her knee pain had returned, noting increased pain with stairs, and said she wanted to try physical therapy again. (R. 358.) Polanco felt her mood was a little better and did not want to see a psychiatrist. (R. 358.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In January 2015, Polanco returned to Bellevue, reporting a chronic low level of depression that was unchanged for many years and indicating that she was interested in a psychiatric follow-up. (R. 355.) On physical examination, Polanco was directed to take Tylenol as needed for her knee pain and was referred for psychiatric treatment. (R. 356.) During a follow-up visit in April 2015, Dr. Butler noted that Polanco was pursuing psychiatric therapy and that her sleep had improved with Trazodone. (R. 352.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 16, 2015, Polanco attended a psychiatric walk-in appointment at Bellevue with Dr. Sheen Chenthitta. (R. 371-73.) On mental examination, Polanco was cooperative and displayed a normal mood, but had a constricted affect. (R. 372.) Dr. Chenthitta noted that Polanco's insight and judgment were not grossly impaired. (R. 372.) Dr. Chenthitta diagnosed depressive disorder, assigned a global assessment of functioning (\"GAF\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   score of 55.3, and referred Polanco to the outpatient psychiatry clinic. (R. 372.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 9, 2015, Polanco visited the outpatient psychiatric clinic and was seen by Dr. Judy Greene. (R. 374-90.) Polanco said she wanted to be alone and not around people. (R. 374.) She reported her primary stressors as conflict between her daughters, loss of her job and sleep difficulties. (R. 375.) She said that she had not had active suicidal thoughts in the past month. (R. 381.) On mental status examination, Polanco had distant relatedness, blunted affect and depressed mood. (R. 382-83.) Dr. Greene diagnosed Polanco with depressive disorder and assigned a GAF score of 56. (R. 383.) Polanco declined medication and said she was seeking only individual therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Polanco reported feeling comfortable conversing in English and understanding English very well, but Dr. Greene wrote that Polanco's expressive English language skills appeared limited and the physician had trouble understanding her at times due to Polanco's accent. (R. 385-86.) Therefore, Dr. Greene recommended Spanish-speaking treatment. (R. 387.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In April 2015, Polanco started her psychotherapy sessions with Irene Rosenthal, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (\"LCSW\"). (R. 392-94, 399-415, 418-25.) During her first session on April 6, Polanco\n   presented with a depressed mood as well as passive suicidal ideation. (R. 393.) Polanco confirmed low mood, frequent crying spells, anhedonia\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , low energy, social isolation and occasional anxiety. (R. 392.) Polanco reported that this episode began after she left her factory job due to a supervisor's harsh treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She indicated a passive wish to die, but denied any active social ideation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Polanco saw LCSW Rosenthal again on April 27, 2015 for her second therapy session. (R. 399-404.) Polanco's mood and suicidal ideation remained the same. (R. 399-400.) She further discussed her work and social history and reported a \"lifelong difficulty\" with trusting others given that she saw others gossip at her job. (R. 399.) Polanco reported wanting to return to work as long as \"no one yells at\" her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   During a session at the walk-in clinic on May 12, 2015, Polanco reported that she cried all the time and did not leave the house. (R. 395.) A mental status examination included an \"okay\" mood and full affect. (R. 395.) Polanco had a PHQ-9 score of 19, suggestive of moderately severe depression. (R. 396.) The provider noted that Polanco \"continues to be at risk given social isolation and passive [suicidal ideation ] and severe anhedonia.\" (R. 395.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In June 2015, Polanco reported no suicidal ideations, but continued to have a depressed mood. (R. 422.) LCSW Rosenthal noted that Polanco \"was depressed but without acute risk.\" (R. 423.) Polanco's condition was similar during sessions held in July 2015. (R. 405-15, 418-25.) At an appointment with Dr. Greene on July 16, 2015, Polanco said that she was still depressed, and that she was taking Prozac daily, but had not noticed any improvement in mood. (R. 427.) Polanco presented as tearful and depressed. (R. 428.) Dr. Greene advised tapering off Prozac and starting Cymbalta. (R. 429.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Dr. Ted Woods-Physical Consultative Examination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dr. Ted Woods performed a physical consultative examination for Polanco in June 2014. (R. 258-61.) Dr. Woods noted that Polanco walked with a normal gait, but had some difficulty walking on her heels and toes and had pain in her left knee. (R. 259.) Polanco used no assistive device and had a normal stance. (R. 259.) Her squat was full but she held on to the exam table. (R. 259.) She had a full range of motion in her spine and in all joints and displayed full strength in all extremities. (R. 260.) Dr. Woods noted that an X-ray of Polanco's left knee showed no significant abnormality. (R. 260.) Dr. Woods diagnosed Polanco with left knee pain, hypertension and depression, all by history. (R. 261.) He opined that Polanco had no limitations in sitting, standing, pushing, pulling, climbing or carrying objects. (R. 261.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Dr. T. Inman-Dundon-State Agency Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dr. T. Inman-Dundon reviewed the evidence of record in July 2014 and submitted a Disability Determination Explanation report. (R. 50-51.) He wrote that Polanco had mild limitations in activities of daily living, social functioning, and concentration, persistence, or pace. (R. 50.) He thought that she had no repeated episodes of decompensation. (R. 50.) Dr. Inman-Dundon opined that Polanco's psychiatric impairments were no more than mild. (R. 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Dr. Haruyo Fujiwaki-Psychiatric Consultative Examinations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. Haruyo Fujiwaki completed two psychiatric consultative examinations for Polanco, one in June 2014 and a second in\n   July 2015. (R. 253-56, 269-72.) In June 2014, Dr. Fujiwaki noted that Polanco presented with a mildly dysphoric affect\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   , dysthymic mood\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and clear sensorium\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and had an adequate manner of relating and social skills. (R. 254.) Her attention and concentration were intact; she was able to count and do simple calculations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Fujiwaki found that Polanco displayed mildly impaired recent and remote memory skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He further noted that Polanco displayed fair insight and judgment, but her cognitive functioning appeared to be below average. (R. 255.) Dr. Fujiwaki diagnosed unspecified depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder and opined that Polanco could follow and understand simple directions and instructions, perform simple tasks, maintain attention and concentration and maintain a regular schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He believed that she was moderately impaired in performing complex tasks, relating adequately with others and appropriately dealing with stress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During the second psychiatric consultative examination in July 2015, Polanco reported difficulty falling asleep, loss of appetite and sometimes having thoughts of suicide without any plan or intent. (R. 270.) She also reported loss of energy, loss of interest and crying spells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Polanco complained of anxiety with palpitation and breathing difficulty, and at times seeing shadows in a room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She indicated that she could perform self-care, but did not take public transit alone, did not have friends, and had poor family relationships. (R. 271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On examination, Dr. Fujiwaki noted that Polanco was cooperative but evasive with an adequate manner of relating. (R. 270.) He found that she presented with coherent and goal-directed thought processes, anxious affect, dysthymic mood and clear sensorium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Fujiwaki also noted that Polanco appeared to have impaired attention, concentration, and recent and remote memory skills, and her cognitive functioning appeared to be below average. (R. 271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dr. Fukjwaki opined that Polanco could follow and understand simple directions; perform simple tasks independently; maintain a regular schedule; make appropriate decisions; and learn simple tasks. (R. 271, 282.) However, he found that she was mildly impaired in relating adequately with others and was moderately limited in maintaining attention and concentration, performing complex tasks and dealing with stress. (R. 271.) In a medical source statement, Dr. Fujiwaki elaborated that Polanco had mild limitations in understanding and remembering complex instructions, and moderate limitations in making judgments on complex work-related decisions. (R. 282.) He believed that she had no issues interacting appropriately with the public, but had mild problems interacting with supervisors and co-workers, and moderate issues with responding appropriately to usual work situations and to changes in a routine work setting. (R. 283.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Dr. Aurelio Salon-Internal Consultative Examination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dr. Aurelio Salon performed an internal consultative examination on Polanco in\n   July 2015. (R. 264-67.) Polanco reported pain in both knees. (R. 264.) Dr. Salon found that Polanco was mildly obese, but walked with a normal gait and appeared to be in no acute stress. (R. 265.) She declined to walk on her heels and toes and squatted one-third of full. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She used no assistive device, needed no help changing for the examination or getting on or off the examination table, and could rise from her chair without difficulty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She displayed full range of motion in her spine, shoulder, elbows, forearms, wrists, hips, knees and ankles. (R. 266.) She had no sensory deficit and full strength in all extremities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Salon diagnosed a history of depression, history of hypertension, history of knee pain, history of hypercholesterolemia and mild obesity. (R. 267.) He opined that Polanco had no restrictions in sitting, standing, climbing, pushing, pulling or carrying heavy objects.

The ALJ then assessed Polanco's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), and determined that she had the RFC to perform medium work, except that she was limited to jobs involving simple, routine, repetitive type tasks, requiring only occasional contact with supervisors, coworkers and the public.

However, the ALJ did not make any findings regarding the mental demands of working as an embroidery machine operator and, in particular, did not consider whether such work was compatible with his own determination that Polanco was limited to jobs with only occasional contact with supervisors and coworkers.

The vocational expert testified that Polanco's past work was at the light exertional level and had an SVP of 2. (R. 35-36.) However, she did not testify as to the\n   <em>\n    mental\n   </em>\n   demands of the work or how often someone working as an embroidery machine operator would have to interact with coworkers or supervisors. Nor did the ALJ ask Polanco any questions regarding these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The ALJ's failure to adequately develop the record regarding the mental demands of Polanco's previous work, including the amount of time she was required to interact with coworkers and supervisors, makes his step-four determination the result of legal error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Without such evidence, neither the ALJ nor this Court can assume that Polanco's previous work was compatible with the ALJ's RFC determination. This is particularly true because there is evidence in the record suggesting that Polanco had experienced problems with harsh treatment by a supervisor in the past.

The ALJ's decision simply is devoid of any analysis of the mental demands of Polanco's past work. Thus, remand is required.
