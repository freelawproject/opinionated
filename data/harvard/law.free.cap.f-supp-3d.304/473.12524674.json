Trump for President, Inc. (\"Campaign\" or \"Defendant\") and the Maryland State Police, stemming from his removal from a campaign rally in April of 2016 for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff subsequently filed an Amended Complaint, dropping the Maryland State Police as a defendant. (ECF No. 26.) Accordingly, the Maryland State Police's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 10) is MOOT. Currently pending is Defendant Campaign's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 28.) The parties' submissions have been reviewed, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the following reasons, Defendant Donald J.

On April 20, 2016, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (\"Campaign\") held a ticketed campaign rally for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 26 at \u00b6 5.) The tickets for the event, however, were free. (ECF No. 29-1 at 3.) Thaler received a ticket for the rally. (ECF No. 26 at \u00b6 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ticket stated \"no posters, banners, or signs,\" \"professional cameras with a detachable lens\" or \"tripods, monopods, selfie sticks, or GoPros.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Thaler did not bring any of these items into the event, and he did not \"at any time during the event, raise his voice, use obscene language, disrupt the peace or engage in any harassing or unlawful conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Nonetheless, he claims he was excluded from the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.4.) Specifically, he asserts that he was told to leave, and when he did not, someone associated with the Campaign told a police officer that he was trespassing and ordered the officer to search his person\n   and remove him from the rally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) The officer subsequently searched, arrested, and detained Thaler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Thaler claims that the officer used more force than necessary to remove him, causing \"a disgraceful and embarrassing scene,\" \"roughly escorting Mr. Thaler from the premises,\" and \"caus[ing] bruising on Mr. Thaler's body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) The officer also issued Thaler a criminal citation for trespass under Md. Code, Crim.

Plaintiff bases his detrimental reliance claim on similar grounds as his breach of contract claim, asserting that the ticket was a clear and definite promise that he could attend the rally, and that promise could only be revoked for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As stated above, Plaintiff does not indicate who gave him the ticket or the circumstances surrounding receiving it. Accordingly,\n   this Court evaluates the ticket itself to determine if there was a clear and definite promise that Plaintiff could only be removed for cause. The ticket does not indicate such a promise. It states \"general information\" including that there was not a dress code, ID was not required, and certain items were prohibited. The ticket neither indicates what would occur if someone brought one of the prohibited items to the rally, nor contains an exhaustive list of reasons why an attendee could be asked to leave. Accordingly, there was not a clear and definite promise that Plaintiff could only be asked to leave for cause.
