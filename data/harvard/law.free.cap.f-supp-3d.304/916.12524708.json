CWC \u00a7 13260(a)(1). Federal Defendants maintain that the Forest Service \"merely issues grazing permits pursuant to its federal mandate\" and aver that Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to show that the Forest Service qualifies as a discharging person. Mot. at 18. Neither side cites controlling case law. Federal Defendants cite a case for the general (and unremarkable) proposition that a person who discharges or proposes to discharge waste must file a permit with the appropriate board, but it offers no clarity on whether a landowner who allows others to engage in activities on its land that result in discharges meets that definition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tahoe-Sierra Pres.

In other words, the fact that direct discharger falls within the definition does not necessarily mean a permitting authority does not.

The subtext to this argument is that because the Forest Service has issued individual permits that each requires compliance with state and local regulations, any violations of those state and local regulations fall squarely on the shoulders of the permittees. The SAC does not allege that any individual permittee has acted in violation of state regulations or that the terms of any single permit led to violations of state standards; it instead alleges that the Forest Service has administered the entire grazing program on the BEH allotments in a manner that results in violations of state water quality regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 18 (\"The Forest Service has issued Annual Operating Instructions ('AOIs') to the permittees for the BEH allotments to establish conditions for cattle grazing on the BEH allotments for each year.

Federal Defendants have cited no authority for the proposition that Plaintiffs must identify specific provisions of the permits that allegedly violate state and local requirements.

Reply at 10. Plaintiffs' allegations that the Forest Service has administered the grazing program on the BEH allotments in a manner leading to violations of state water standards are sufficient to state a claim. The Forest Service's issuance of the permits, along with AOIs-which govern on an annual basis the levels of grazing permitted-form a sufficient causal link between the agency action and the harm alleged. The\n   SAC alleges that between 2011 and 2017, individual and average concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria in surface waters at control sites and at sites within the BEH allotments where grazing would occur were below threshold concentrations prior to the arrival of cattle for grazing. After cattle were released onto the BEH allotments for grazing, according to the SAC, fecal coliform concentrations increased and \"in places exceeded the established state standards for recreational contact with water.\" SAC \u00b6 46. This is a clear and direct causal connection, where the injury is \"fairly traceable to the challenged action\" and not the result of an \"independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

The discussion immediately preceding this statement provides important context. The Policy explains that the regional boards typically regulate \"individual dischargers, rather than groups of dischargers who are represented by or coordinated through third parties. Individual dischargers,\n   <em>\n    including both landowners and operators\n   </em>\n   , continued to bear ultimate responsibility for complying with a RWQCB's water quality requirements and orders.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Policy draws a distinction between parties with decision-making authority and,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , lobbying or trade groups that themselves are mere third parties representing or coordinating dischargers. The Policy also makes clear that \"both landowners and operators\" are ultimately the responsible parties.

They contend that the Central Valley Regional Water Board, which has jurisdiction over the region that includes the BEH allotments, \"has not yet concluded that a formal regulatory permit scheme is needed for grazing\" within the region and instead relies on non-regulatory efforts and enforcement options like notices of violation and cease-and-desist orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

Ex. A (State Water Resources Control Board, Policy for Implementation and Enforcement of the Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program (May 20, 2004) ) at 3). Moreover, another regional water quality\n   board has adopted a general waiver of waste discharge requirements for nonpoint source pollution, including livestock grazing, an act that would arguably be unnecessary if livestock grazing were not subject to an over-arching permit requirement under the California Water Code. Opp. at 23 (quoting ECF No. 46-4, Pltfs.' Ex.

Plaintiffs view grazing as a source of nonpoint discharges that, in the absence of a specific waiver, is subject to general rules bringing the discharge under ordinary regulations.

Regional boards are tasked with \"prescrib[ing] requirements as to the nature of any proposed discharge, existing discharge, or material change in an existing discharge.\" CWC \u00a7 13263(a).

The state and regional boards also hold the power to waive the requirements that dischargers file a report of waste discharge pursuant to \u00a7 13260 and that they comply with waste discharge requirements pursuant to \u00a7 13263 if either board determines that the waiver is \"consistent with any applicable state or regional water quality control plan and is in the public interest.\" CWC \u00a7 13269(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The SAC alleges that \"[t]he Forest Service did not obtain a waste discharge permit or a waiver from the waste discharge permit requirement before issuing permits and AOIs that authorize or allow cattle grazing on the BEH allotments,\" in violation of the Porter-Cologne Act.

As discussed above, those provisions require dischargers to file\n   <em>\n    reports\n   </em>\n   of their discharges, leave it to regional boards to determine the regulatory requirements that dischargers must meet, and provide for waivers by the state or regional boards. The SAC discusses the proposed statewide waiver for certain nonpoint source activities, including grazing, on Forest land. SAC \u00b6 42. The failure to enact this statewide waiver left it to the regional boards to regulate these activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CWC \u00a7\u00a7 13263, 13269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The SAC cites CWC \u00a7 13260 but nowhere discusses whether the Forest Service was required to file or did file a report of waste discharge. It also cites CWC \u00a7 13263 but nowhere states that the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board has instituted a regulatory scheme that requires that dischargers apply for discharge permits for livestock grazing. The SAC thus fails to state a claim with respect to its allegation that the Forest Service acted in violation of CWC \u00a7\u00a7 13260, 13263, and 13269 when it authorized grazing without first obtaining a permit or a waiver.

Therefore, at least one aspect of Plaintiffs' CWA claim is unaffected by the dismissal ordered above. Defendant-Intervenors raise one argument that pertains independently to Plaintiffs' remaining CWA claim. Specifically, Defendant-Intervenors argue that this Court is powerless to order the\n   <em>\n    relief\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs seek: an order that livestock grazing permits for the BEH allotments be modified to prevent violations of state water quality standards. They argue that the CWA does not directly regulate nonpoint source pollution and that enforcement under the Porter-Cologne Act rests with the California water boards. Intervenor Mot. at 5. This is true as far as it goes, but, as discussed above, Plaintiffs' nonpoint source claims arise under the APA and include an APA allegation that approval of the BEH permits in violation of the CWA is not in accordance with the law. This claim is properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Idaho Sporting Congress\n   </em>\n   , 137 F.3d at 1153 (\"Under the Clean Water Act, all federal agencies must comply with state water quality standards....Judicial review of this requirement is available under the Administrative Procedure Act.\").

In\n   <em>\n    Great Old Broads For Wilderness v.

Plaintiffs respond that this case was wrongly decided. They argue that the Forest Service has discretion to determine the NEPA schedule, but that discretion must operate within the bounds provided by Congress: it should be based on environmental significance and available funding. The only information the Forest Service provided in connection with the schedule change, Plaintiffs allege, is that the withdrawal of the draft ROD was done to \"allow more interactions with stakeholders on the issues.\" ECF No. 41-3, Fed. Defs.' Ex. A-1, Aug. 29, 2016 letter withdrawing draft ROD. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that neither the decision to withdraw the ROD nor the decision to issue a revised NEPA schedule was supported by the two factors that Congress commanded the Forest Service to consider when exercising its discretion. Opp. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The bounds on the exercise of discretion are drawn broadly in Section 325, and even if Plaintiffs were to prevail on their Rescissions Act claim, the potential remedies include an order requiring the Forest Service to revise its explanation for why it withdrew the draft ROD or to complete its NEPA analysis by a date earlier than 2019. This is thin relief. Nevertheless, the Court is not persuaded that Section 325 was drawn in a manner that divests district courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the exercise of discretion. The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that Section 701(a)(2) is a limited exception and has commanded that \"although\n   <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) insulates from judicial review agency discretion where there is no law to apply, the APA itself commits final agency action to our review for 'abuse of discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pinnacle Armor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740196\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/708/#p719\">\n    648 F.3d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mot. at 30. Read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the SAC does allege that the Forest Service did not have reason for delay based on funding availability. The Forest Service had issued a final EIS and draft ROD, meaning that the great bulk of the analysis had already been completed. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service has failed to keep Congress apprised of funding levels needed to ensure timely NEPA review of outstanding allotments, as required under Section 325.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the facts as pled belie Plaintiffs' theory that the Forest Service failed to consider environmental considerations when it altered the NEPA schedule and exercised its discretion in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The withdrawal of the draft ROD occurred after two meetings with objectors between May and July of 2016, where the Forest Service heard objections based on environmental concerns and encouraged the objectors to \"strongly consider accepting improved adaptive management and increased monitoring as the management direction for the three allotments\" before finally withdrawing the draft ROD. SAC \u00b6 37. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from these facts is that the Forest Service's decision to withdraw the draft ROD was based on the environmental concerns\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   that objectors raised and that the Forest Service will continue its analysis and decision-making pursuant to the revised NEPA schedule. Taking into account the many competing priorities and comments on the draft ROD, taking it under advisement, and scheduling the completed analysis for 2019 was a reasonable exercise of \"discretion [to] determine the priority and timing for completing required environmental analysis of grazing allotments based on the environmental significance of the allotments and funding available.\" Pub.

If the Forest Service decided to permit a third party to graze cattle on the BEH allotments, however, then the same agency decision to permit the same action, on the same land, with the same environmental consequences, would be unreviewable. This result is justifiable only if the waiver of sovereign immunity in Section 313 draws a distinction between governmental and nongovernmental functions, as Federal Defendants argue that it does. As explained in text, however, the reference to \"nongovernmental entit[ies]\" in Section 313 does not imply that classes of governmental actions are to be treated differently depending on whether they are traditional governmental functions; it instead simply commands that federal entities are to comply with state pollution control requirements just as nongovernmental actors are.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201323\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

In the section on the alleged violation of the CWA, the SAC quotes California's Nonpoint Source Plan: \"The SWRCB and RWQCB may not delegate their [nonpoint source] authorities and responsibilities to another agency...Another agency's actions pursuant to an MOU or MAA do not fulfill the RWQCB's obligation to use its administrative tools to address the relevant NPS discharges.\" SAC \u00b6 59.

Defendant-Intervenors argue that to the extent that this portion of the SAC alleges that the state and regional water boards have failed to discharge their statutory duty, this claim is not properly brought in federal court in the first instance. The Court, however, reads the above-quoted portions of the SAC to constitute an effort to show that the state water boards have jurisdiction over nonpoint source pollution and that any violation of state and regional water board regulations is a violation of state law. Nevertheless, the Court agrees that to the extent that the SAC intended to include a claim that the state water boards have improperly delegated their enforcement authority, the Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    In addition to petitioning the state board to set aside or modify the regional board's order, Shell also concurrently filed two federal lawsuits, in federal district court and the Ninth Circuit.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 411.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    The SAC also alleges that the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board wrote in its March 12, 2014, comment letter on the Draft EIS that \"it possessed evidence of water quality violations in streams on the BEH allotments.\" SAC \u00b6 35.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The opinion quoted the first count of the complaint to specify that \"the Supervisor's failure to carry out his mandatory duties under NFMA...has...rendered any decisions under the [Forest Plan] to harvest old growth arbitrary.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1068.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Challenges to monitoring and management practices, standing alone, are not reviewable without a connection to a particular final agency action.
