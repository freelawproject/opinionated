[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83\n   </em>\n   .] Specifically, they argue that good cause existed for the default, that they acted quickly to correct the default, and that they have asserted a meritorious defense to the Complaint. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83 at 4-12\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants also argue that they have \"demonstrated their ongoing commitment to defending this case,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83 at 12-13\n   </em>\n   ], and that the NCAA is not entitled to a finding that this is an exceptional case such that it would be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83 at 12-14\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In reply, the NCAA argues that \"Defendants seek to reargue, without justification or leave, the settled issue of whether they should be held in default,\" and \"[t]he Court should give those arguments no consideration.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 85 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] It again asserts that it has shown that the factual allegations in the Complaint, which are deemed true for purposes of establishing liability, state claims for relief under the Lanham Act and Indiana common law. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 85 at 2\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes that the issue of whether Defendants are liable is separate and apart from whether the NCAA is entitled to certain relief, such as a permanent injunction. The Court first addresses whether Defendants are liable for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In connection with liability, Defendants reassert the arguments they set forth in response to the NCAA's Request for Entry of Default. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83 at 4-12\n   </em>\n   .] The Court considered those arguments thoroughly in connection with the NCAA's Request for Entry of Default, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 73\n   </em>\n   ], and will not do so again here.

The confusion that could result from Defendants' use of the marks FINAL 3 and APRIL MADNESS is also obvious due to their significant similarity to the NCAA's marks.

As the Seventh Circuit has noted, when there is a likelihood of confusion, \"irreparable harm is especially likely in a trademark case because of the difficulty of quantifying the likely effect on a brand of a nontrivial period of consumer confusion (and the interval between the filing of a trademark infringement complaint and final judgment is sure not to be trivial).\"\n   <em>\n    Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC v.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] It contends that \"Defendants have not yet launched the offending contest and, pursuant to the requested injunction, would be free to launch any other contest that does not use the infringing marks.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Because the offending contests have not yet launched, the NCAA argues, \"any claimed loss of value would be pure speculation (and may even benefit Defendants).\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79 at 6-7\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants argue in response that the NCAA \"will proceed in all respects with its own marks untouched in value, recognition, or viability if a permanent injunction is denied,\" but \"Kizzang will be unable to proceed in any respects with any of its intended business plans if a permanent injunction is granted against it.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 22\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants argue that their damage is much greater if the injunction is granted than the NCAA's damage would be absent an injunction. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 22\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In its reply, the NCAA reiterates its arguments and contends that Defendants' argument that the NCAA's marks will be untouched in value absent an injunction is \"repugnant to trademark law and should be disregarded.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 86 at 6-7\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds that the balance of hardships here favors the NCAA.

Irreparable harm is presumed to have occurred in this situation. The Court finds that, absent an injunction, the NCAA faces damage to its goodwill caused by Defendants' infringing marks. Conversely, if an injunction issues, Defendants will not be able to launch contests that are premised on marks the Court has already found are infringing. Defendants also have not demonstrated what harm, if any, they would suffer from an inability to launch the contests. The harm the NCAA would face absent an injunction outweighs any harm Defendants might face if an injunction issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, the NCAA argues that issuing an injunction would serve the public interest because it would prevent consumer confusion in the marketplace.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 23\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants also argue that \"Kizzang is a small vendor[,] NCAA is a gigantic vendor[,] [and i]t is not in the public interest to permit large companies to control trademarks beyond the limits they are entitled to merely because they can afford to go after any small vendor they perceive as a potential threat.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 23\n   </em>\n   .] The NCAA reiterates its arguments on reply.

An \"exceptional case\" is also one where defendants willfully violated the Lanham Act or disregarded legal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    MetroPCS v. Devor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271870\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/215/626/#p638\">\n    215 F.Supp.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638 (N.D. Ill. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court finds that this case falls within the category of \"exceptional cases\" that warrant the award of attorneys' fees under the Lanham Act. Defendants' marks are obviously similar to the NCAA's marks, and Defendants planned to use the marks in connection with contests and events related to NCAA basketball games. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1 at 5-7\n   </em>\n   .] This indicates willful infringement. Additionally, while Defendants readily agreed to the Stipulated Order in which they agreed not to use the FINAL 3 or APRIL MADNESS marks, the agreement lasted only through the end of 2017. In the meantime, Defendants ignored the litigation and missed their deadline to answer or otherwise plead. All the while, Defendants have not set forth any substantive defenses to the NCAA's claims. Indeed, their only argument related to the similarity of their marks to the NCAA's marks is that a Google search of their marks does not yield any results related to the NCAA. This argument is unavailing. The NCAA's Motion for Default Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 76\n   </em>\n   ], is granted to the extent that the Court finds this is an \"exceptional case\" which entitles the NCAA to an award of its attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    4. Other Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, the NCAA requests an order requiring Defendants to \"immediately recall from all distribution channels all products, services, advertising, and promotional materials bearing the NCAA Marks and any colorable imitations of them, including FINAL 3 and APRIL MADNESS,\" and to \"file with this Court and serve on the NCAA a report in writing under oath within 30 days of the entry of Judgment setting forth in detail the manner and form in which Defendants have complied with the terms of any injunction entered by this\n   Court, in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201116\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77 at 22-23\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants did not address these two components of relief in their response to the Motion for Default Judgment. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 83\n   </em>\n   .] The Court must still ensure, however, that the scope of relief the NCAA seeks in connection with its Motion for Default Judgment does not exceed the scope of relief requested in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c) (\"A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings\");\n   <em>\n    WMS Gaming Inc. v.

Here, the NCAA requested both components of relief in its Complaint. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1 at 12\n   </em>\n   .] The Court finds the relief requested appropriate, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the NCAA's Motion for Default Judgment to the extent that it includes those components in its order.
