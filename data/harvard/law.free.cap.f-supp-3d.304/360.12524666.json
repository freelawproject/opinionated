Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is employed by the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") as a Computer Specialist Level III. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff began her employment with the NYPD in September 1989 as a civilian employee, and her office was originally located on the seventh floor of One Police Plaza. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.) However, in October 2011, Plaintiff's unit-the Network Design and Standard Section (\"NDSS\")-was moved to the eighth floor of One Police Plaza. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's claim that she suffers from acid reflux disease that is exacerbated by dust and, specifically, was exacerbated by dust on the eighth floor, Defendants offered to purchase an air purifier for Plaintiff's workstation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) Although Plaintiff disputes whether or not she initially rejected the offer to purchase the air purifier, she admits that she told her employer that the air purifier that was offered could not eliminate the dust that had been triggering her acid reflux. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants then scheduled Plaintiff for a medical examination, and Plaintiff ultimately refused to attend the medical examination, (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18), although Plaintiff states that she ultimately refused to attend because her request to have her lawyer present during the exam was denied, (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). In addition to offering to purchase an air purifier, Defendants also offered to clean and vacuum the eighth floor to address Plaintiff's dust complaints. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each party retained experts to perform air quality tests. Plaintiff's expert, Kenneth S. Winberg of Safdoc Systems, LLC, collected \"total dust and respirable dust samples\" from the eighth floor in May 2016 and found that the \"samples did not demonstrate excessive levels of either type of dust.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Defendants' expert, Amir Rasheed of the NYPD's Occupational Safety and Health Section reported that in December 2011, the highest concentration of dust particles on the eighth floor measured 0.001 mg/m, which is within permissible limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Mr. Rasheed also measured the dust levels on the eighth floor in September 2013 and September 2014, and the measurements taken in those months also were within permissible limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's desired accommodation was to be moved back to the seventh floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5.) The parties disagree about the viability of this proposed\n   accommodation, with Defendants maintaining that they could not move Plaintiff to the seventh floor because it would involve her sitting apart from her unit and her supervisors, would prevent face-to-face communication with her colleagues, and would be inefficient, and Plaintiff contending that it was possible to supervise her work on the eighth floor and that her duties and responsibilities did not require constant, in-person supervision. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6 20.) However, Defendants offered Plaintiff the option of moving back to the seventh floor and changing units to the Local Area Network (\"LAN\") group, which would have entailed giving Plaintiff a supervisory role. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff turned down this suggested accommodation claiming (1) the position involved \"desktop support\" rather than the \"internet content filtering\" she performed in NDSS, (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6 21), and (2) the position \"would be less challenging and essentially function as [a] demotion-or a step backwards in Plaintiff's career,\" (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff remembers her supervisor, Wayne Scibelli, talking about her NYPD EEO Complaint \"out loud by [her] desk so anybody that was around or would walk by could have heard him.\" (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff does not remember her supervisor, Andrew Krimsky, ever making any disparaging remarks about her alleged disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on July 31, 2012 and received a Notice of Right to Sue letter dated May 23, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Complaint on August 28, 2013. (Doc. 1.) The case was referred to mediation on January 10, 2014, (Doc. 16), and I held a pre-motion conference to address the parties' anticipated motions for summary judgment on April 23, 2015, (Dkt. Entry Apr. 23, 2015). Briefing was thereafter adjourned to satisfy the parties' desire to test the air quality on the eighth floor at One Police Plaza, as well as to address an alleged spoliation issue and related motion for sanctions. (Docs. 42, 43, 60, 64.) I held a second pre-motion conference on November 28, 2016, (Doc. 75; Dkt.

Plaintiff filed her opposition on March 27, 2017, (Docs. 85), as well as the affirmation of Marshall B.

D, at 163:16-21). Plaintiff, on the other hand, in support of her claim that her work duties do not require constant, in-person, supervision, also cites to Scibelli's testimony noting that it would be possible for Plaintiff to be called up to the eighth floor as needed, (Bellovin Aff.

These disputes make it possible for a reasonable trier of fact to determine that Plaintiff's request was reasonable.
