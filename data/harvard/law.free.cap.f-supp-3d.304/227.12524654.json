Adamski was an active duty enlisted soldier from 1970 until 1973, when he was involved in a harrowing parachute-jumping incident and voluntarily requested early separation from military service. In 1988, Adamski applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (\"ABCMR\" or \"the Board\") seeking to have his separation status changed from \"voluntary\" to \"disability\" in order to reflect what Adamski alleges is the real reason that his military service came to an end: previously undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). The Board denied Adamski's application to correct his records in 1989; and then, nearly two decades later, Adamski requested in writing that the Board reconsider this denial in light of purportedly new evidence regarding his condition. The Board allegedly responded to Adamski's request for reconsideration by refusing to act on it, citing a regulation promulgated in 2006 that requires all such reconsideration requests to be submitted to the Board within one year of the initial denial. Adamski has filed the instant action against the Secretary of the Army (\"Defendant\" or \"the Secretary\") to challenge the Board's application of the 2006 regulation to his request for reconsideration. Adamski alleges that the Board acted \"ultra vires\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   in excess of its statutory authority-when it relied on that regulation to reject his reconsideration request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 22, at 1, 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is Defendant's motion to dismiss Adamski's amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 23, at 1.) Defendant argues that the six-year statute of limitations for actions against the federal government set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) bars Adamski's claim against the Secretary, and that, in any event, Adamski has failed to plead adequately the elements of an ultra vires claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) As explained fully below, this Court finds that the statutory limitations period does not bar Adamski's challenge, and thus that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the amended complaint. However, it appears\n   that the doctrine of prudential exhaustion (which is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a pleading requirement in this context) may apply under the circumstances presented here. Thus, Adamski may have needed to exhaust available administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in federal court, but the amended complaint is silent regarding whether or not Adamski actually challenged the Board's application of the one-year regulation to him under the administrative process. Consequently, this Court concludes that additional submissions are required to resolve the exhaustion issue, as explained below. Accordingly, the Secretary's motion to dismiss will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the Court will order the parties to engage in a period of limited discovery on the issue of administrative exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts that are related in this memorandum opinion and order appear in Adamski's amended complaint and are largely undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Adamski's Military Service, Separation, And Subsequent Health Problems\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Adamski enlisted in the Army in 1970 and was trained as a paratrooper. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.) During a training jump in November of 1972, Adamski had a \"near-death\" experience-his primary chute failed to open and his auxiliary chute did not open until the very last moment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Shortly after this distressing training-jump incident, Adamski allegedly developed eye twitches and nervous tics. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, he began to receive negative performance reports with respect to his work, and he was eventually terminated from jump status. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) A few months later, in March of 1973, Adamski requested early separation from the Army. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Adamski alleges that, at the time of his separation request, he \"omitted reporting\" any physical, mental, or emotional health concerns as a reason for ending his military service; instead, the justification he provided for requesting early separation was that he needed to return home to help with his family's farm work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the amended complaint, the Army granted Adamski's request and released him from military service in June of 1973. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that, as a direct result of the training-jump incident, Adamski has suffered from debilitating PTSD and has had to undergo long stretches of hospitalization and medical treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The amended complaint also explains that PTSD was not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\") until 1980, and that the Veterans Administration (\"VA\") did not formally recognize PTSD as a medical condition until 1982. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Furthermore, the doctors at the VA who were treating Adamski for chronic emotional and mental health problems did not diagnose him with PTSD until 1986. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of his PTSD diagnosis, the Social Security Administration allegedly granted Adamski \"total disability\" status in 1990, retroactive to 1986. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Adamski also alleges that, in 2004, the VA formally recognized that his PTSD is \"service-connected\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that it stems from the 1972 training-jump incident-and that, as a result of this medical condition, Adamski is effectively unemployable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) According to the amended complaint, the VA's 2004 recognition reversed an earlier VA determination (made in 1987) in which the agency initially declined to characterize Adamski's condition as PTSD, relying on an older, more limited DSM definition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Adamski asserts that, with its 2004 decision, the VA finally acknowledged\n   that he has received \"continuous treatment for what amount[s] to\" PTSD since he left the Army in the early 1970s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Proceedings Before The ABCMR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although both the Social Security Administration and the VA purportedly have recognized that Adamski suffers from service-related PTSD stemming from the 1972 parachute debacle, Adamski has thus far been unsuccessful in his attempts to have the Army change his military records to reflect his contention that he sought discharge due to PTSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    a. Adamski's Initial Application In 1988\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Adamski asserts that he first applied to the ABCMR in 1988 seeking to change his military separation status from \"voluntary\" to \"disability\" or \"retirement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The amended complaint states that, \"[d]ue to his deteriorating mental condition[,]\" Adamski submitted relatively few records to the Board in support of this initial application for records correction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Adamski alleges that the Board denied his application in 1989, finding that the statutory clock for Adamski's application had started to run in 1973, and that it would not be in the interest of justice to waive the general three-year statutory time limit in Adamski's case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In so concluding, Adamski claims that the Board relied in part on the VA's 1987 decision that declined to characterize Adamski's health problems as service-related PTSD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Adamski maintains that the Board indicated in its 1989 denial that-in accordance with then-current Army regulations-the Board would be willing to reconsider Adamski's application if he could present \"newly discovered relevant evidence not previously considered by the Board.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17 (citing A. Reg. 15-185, \u00b6 22 (1977)).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    b. Adamski's Request For Reconsideration In 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Adamski alleges that, in 2010, he filed a request for reconsideration of the Board's denial of his records correction application, and that he attached various \"Army health and personnel records\" as supporting evidence, including the VA's 2004 decision recognizing his service-connected PTSD and the Social Security Administration's 1990 decision granting him disability status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) According to Adamski, in 2011, the Board sent him a letter in which it stated that it was refusing to consider his request based on a regulation enacted in 2006 that requires all requests for reconsideration to be filed within one year of the Board's initial decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 (citing A.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Adamski initiated the instant civil action on January 23, 2014 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1), and filed his amended complaint with leave of Court on November 19, 2014 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order dated Nov. 19, 2014). The amended complaint contains a single count alleging that the Board's \"particular application of\" the 2006 regulation to Adamski's request for reconsideration \"was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   agency action exceeding the limits of [the Board's] authority under 10 U.[S.C.] \u00a7 1552(a)(1)[.]\" (Am. Compl. at 10.) Adamski seeks an order from this Court remanding his case to the Board and instructing the Board to process and consider his request for reconsideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on December 5, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.) Defendant argues, first, that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the amended complaint under\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) because Adamski's claim is untimely under the jurisdictional six-year statute of limitations for actions against the federal government that is found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. (\"Def.'s Br.\"), ECF No. 23, at 8-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. Hr'g Tr., May 26, 2015, at 13:11-14:9.) Defendant further argues that the amended complaint fails adequately to allege an ultra vires claim for relief-and is thus subject to dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) -because, according to Defendant, Adamski has failed to point to any specific, mandatory statutory duty that the Board purportedly violated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 11-19.) Adamski responds that his challenge is timely under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and therefore within this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, because Adamski initiated the instant action within six years of 2011, which is when the Board applied the 2006 regulation to his request for reconsideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 26, at 20-21.) Moreover, Adamski maintains that the Board has an affirmative obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to correct injustices in military records, and that it ignored that statutory obligation in the instant case.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 8-11.) Defendant also contends that the factual allegations in Adamski's amended complaint do not satisfy the elements of an ultra vires claim, and thus, that Adamski is not entitled to relief as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    at 13-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) For the reasons explained below, this Court concludes that the statute of limitations poses no bar to the Court's consideration of Adamski's ultra vires claim, but that the doctrine of prudential exhaustion-which requires a plaintiff to exhaust all available administrative remedies before bringing an action in federal court-might very well prevent the Court from entertaining the instant amended complaint.

Thus, when the allegations of the amended complaint are considered in the light most favorable to Adamski, the relevant agency action for claim accrual purposes took place in 2011, when the Board allegedly applied the one-year regulation to Adamski and returned his request for reconsideration without action.

First of all, Defendant is manifestly incorrect to insist that Adamski's efforts \"to focus attention on ... 2011\" were merely an \"attempt to obscure\" the fact that the relevant agency action for claim accrual purposes actually \"occurred in 1989[.]\" (Def.'s Br. at 8-9.) As explained above-and as was verified at this Court's hearing on the motion to dismiss-Adamski's complaint challenges the Board's allegedly unjustified refusal\n   <em>\n    in 2011\n   </em>\n   to process the request for reconsideration that Adamski had filed the previous year, and not the Board's initial decision in 1989 to let his record stand without amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the cases that Defendant's brief cites to support the proposition that requests for reconsideration do not extend the statute of limitations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 17 n.10) are inapposite because the claim at issue here relates to the independent legal error that the agency allegedly made in 2011, when it applied the intervening 2006 regulation to Adamski's request for reconsideration, and it is by no means an attempt to extend any claim that Adamski may have had with respect to the Board's 1989 denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant's fallback position-that \"what [the amended complaint is] actually doing is challenging the 2006 regulation itself\" and thus the six-year statutory deadline expired in 2012 (Mot. Hr'g Tr. at 11:20-21, 13:20-14:9)-is also unavailing, because even if Adamski was seeking to challenge the regulation itself, it is clear that the six-year statute of limitations would not bar such a challenge in the context of this lawsuit. Under the established case law of this Circuit, a statutory limitations period \"does not foreclose subsequent examination of a rule where properly brought before [a] court for review of further [agency] action\n   <em>\n    applying\n   </em>\n   it.\"\n   <em>\n    Functional Music, Inc. v.

Consequently, this Court finds that, regardless of whether Adamski \"could have sought immediate review\" of the 2006 regulation at the time it was promulgated, the six-year state of limitations would not prevent him from launching a substantive legal attack on the rule's validity, given the Board's application of the regulation to Adamski's reconsideration request in 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvin Lou Media, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542938,3667805\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/1/\">\n    571 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wind River Mining Corp. v.

The D.C.

In this Court's preliminary view, requiring Adamski to bring to the Board or the Secretary his argument that the ABCMR acted outside of its authority when it applied the 2006 regulation's one-year time limit to his 2010 reconsideration request seems likely to serve the underlying purposes of administrative exhaustion because, first, it would ensure that the agency has an opportunity to apply its own expertise regarding the application of that regulation in this context in order to correct (or confirm) its decision to apply the regulation to Adamski's situation, and second, the agency's consideration of the extent of its authority under the circumstances presented here would inform the parties and the Court, enhancing the record for purposes of judicial review. This Court is also not currently aware of any circumstances that would give rise to a conclusion that the delay resulting from imposing prudential exhaustion requirements here would lead to irreparable injury, nor does it appear that exhaustion would be a futile effort, in light of recent guidance that the Secretary of Defense has given military corrections boards regarding motions for reconsideration with respect to previously unrecognized claims of PTSD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, at present, this Court sees little risk, and potentially\n   substantial benefit, in requiring Adamski to exhaust all administrative remedies here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avocados Plus Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244968,5662267\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/1243/\">\n    370 F.3d at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that determining whether to require prudential exhaustion in a given case involves \" 'balanc[ing] the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum against the countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion' \" (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCarthy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p144\">\n    503 U.S. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p144\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Flight Attendants-CWA,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509704,3564872\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/155/\">\n    493 F.3d at 158-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies where plaintiff union could \"petition the agencies directly for the relief they seek in this lawsuit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendant has not raised the exhaustion issue with respect to Adamski's claim, and this Court is mindful of the fact that failure to exhaust administrative remedies functions as an affirmative defense and not a pleading requirement in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.
