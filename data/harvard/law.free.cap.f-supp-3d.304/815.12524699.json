Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This lawsuit arises from a dispute between two companies over work product created for a contract pitch. Plaintiff Goodbye Vanilla, LLC (Goodbye Vanilla) is a marketing consulting company with entertainment industry experience. Defendant Aimia Proprietary Loyalty U.S. Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Aimia) is a business that runs loyalty programs. After the relationship between Goodbye Vanilla and Aimia soured, Goodbye Vanilla initiated this lawsuit. Aimia now moves for summary judgment on all counts. (Dkt. 99.) For the reasons addressed below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Aimia's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Drew Pearson, the founder of Goodbye Vanilla, was professionally acquainted with Chris McLaren, an Aimia employee. On August 1, 2014, Aimia received a request for proposal from Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony) inviting Aimia to submit a pitch for a contract to create a computer-based loyalty program for the Wheel of Fortune television program. As a result of the professional acquaintance between McLaren and Pearson, Aimia invited Goodbye Vanilla to participate in the Wheel of Fortune pitch to Sony. The parties executed a written mutual nondisclosure agreement governing the use and exchange of confidential information, but the parties did not execute a written contract addressing the scope of work that each party would perform on the pitch to Sony\n   or on any ensuing project with Sony. Consequently, the parties dispute the precise nature and scope of Goodbye Vanilla's participation in the pitch process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla alleges that the parties agreed it would provide \"ongoing expertise and consulting services ... regarding television and entertainment marketing strategies, programs, and systems\" during both the pitch process and the duration of Aimia's relationship with Sony. Aimia argues that it invited Goodbye Vanilla to contribute \"TV industry-related advisory services\" for the Sony pitch. One specific service that the parties agree Goodbye Vanilla provided was research on how to use Nielsen Data Fusion, an analytical modeling tool that provides consumer and market data. Goodbye Vanilla also participated in Aimia's in-person pitch presentation to Sony in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 4, 2014, Aimia learned that it won the contract from Sony. Aimia and Sony did not execute a scope of work agreement at that time. At some point, Aimia became aware that Sony was not interested in contracting for the services attributed to Goodbye Vanilla, and Aimia instructed Goodbye Vanilla in March 2015 to put its Sony-related work on hold. The parties' relationship disintegrated. Goodbye Vanilla asserts that Aimia intentionally pushed Goodbye Vanilla out of the Sony project, contravening the parties' unwritten agreement. Aimia contends that Sony contracted for only a portion of Aimia's proposed services, and it was Sony's choice not to include Goodbye Vanilla's services in the contract between Sony and Aimia. Goodbye Vanilla subsequently commenced this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its complaint, Goodbye Vanilla asserted nine counts against Aimia, three of which it subsequently dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the remaining counts, Count III alleges misappropriation of trade secrets under the Minnesota Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 325C.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Count IV asserts a breach-of-contract claim alleging that Aimia violated the nondisclosure agreement. Counts V and VI, respectively, allege breach of a joint-venture agreement and breach of fiduciary duty arising from a joint-venture agreement. And Counts VII and VIII allege promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment. Aimia moves for summary judgment, and Goodbye Vanilla opposes the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Misappropriation of Trade Secrets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although Aimia maintains that it neither received Goodbye Vanilla's trade secrets nor misappropriated any confidential information, Goodbye Vanilla contends that whether the information it shared with Aimia includes trade secrets is a disputed question of fact.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 325C.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   MUTSA defines a trade secret as \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325C.01, subd. 5. To establish that information is a trade secret under MUTSA, a party must demonstrate that (1) the information is neither generally known nor readily ascertainable, (2) the information derives independent economic value from its secrecy, and (3) the plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    Gordon Emp't, Inc. v.

Minn. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla alleges that Aimia acquired trade secrets from Goodbye Vanilla that Aimia wrongfully disclosed and used for its benefit after \"cutting [Goodbye Vanilla] out of the Sony deal.\" Goodbye Vanilla argues that its \"proprietary information, industry expertise, and work product,\" including its experience with Nielsen Data Fusion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   are trade secrets. To support its claim that its research and expertise on Nielsen Data Fusion constitute trade secrets, Goodbye Vanilla relies on the deposition testimony of its CEO, Drew Pearson. Pearson testified that he worked with a consultant and others in the industry to research Nielsen Data Fusion, and he subsequently sent his research to Aimia. The record contains a one-page email that Pearson sent to Aimia employee Chris McLaren, which includes brief quotations about Nielsen Data Fusion and recommendations on how to use it. This one-page email is the only specific information Goodbye Vanilla identifies as a trade secret protected by MUTSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla fails to establish how this one-page email containing quotations and recommendations is a trade secret protected by MUTSA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Electro-Craft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677311\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/332/890/#p897\">\n    332 N.W.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The law of trade secrets will not protect talent or expertise, only secret information.\");\n   <em>\n    Jostens, Inc. v.

Minn. Dec. 23, 2013) (\"Defendants' use of readily ascertainable industry contacts does not suggest the misappropriation of a trade secret.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even assuming without deciding that Goodbye Vanilla's Nielsen Data Fusion information is a trade secret under MUTSA, Goodbye Vanilla identifies no fact in the record that supports its contention that Aimia misappropriated the information. Moreover, it is abundantly clear from Pearson's email that Goodbye Vanilla compiled the information for the specific purpose of sending it to Sony. And Goodbye Vanilla identifies nothing in the record that supports the claim that there is ongoing misuse or misappropriation of its alleged trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   No facts in the record demonstrate a genuine dispute about whether Aimia misappropriated any Goodbye Vanilla trade secret. Therefore, Aimia's motion for summary judgment is granted as to Count III, Goodbye Vanilla's misappropriation of trade secrets claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Violation of the Nondisclosure agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the nondisclosure agreement, which provides that it is governed by Minnesota law, is binding. Count IV of Goodbye Vanilla's complaint alleges that Aimia improperly used Goodbye Vanilla's proprietary information during Aimia's pitch to Sony and that Aimia continues to use and share that information, all in violation of the nondisclosure agreement. In support of summary judgment, Aimia argues that Goodbye Vanilla fails to identify any confidential information shared or used in violation of the nondisclosure agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Minnesota law distinguishes between a claim based on misappropriation of trade secrets and a claim based on breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Loftness Specialized Farm Equip., Inc. v. Twiestmeyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073068\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/845/#p850\">\n    742 F.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (8th Cir. 2014). The nondisclosure agreement's definition of confidential information determines what information can serve as the basis of a claim alleging a breach of the nondisclosure agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073068\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/845/#p850\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the nondisclosure agreement defines \"confidential information\" as either party's \"finances, research, development, business activities, products, services, or technical knowledge.\" Each party may use the other's confidential information \"only in connection with the business purpose,\" defined as the \"inten[t] to discuss the formation of a business relationship with each other, [formation of] such a business relationship, and [participation] in business activities during such business relationship.\" The nondisclosure agreement states that each party will protect the other's information \"in the same manner it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information,\" and \"will not disclose the Confidential Information except to its employees and agents who need to know the Confidential Information in order to achieve the Business Purpose.\" When the business purpose terminates,\n   each party must return or destroy the other party's confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla alleges that Aimia violated the nondisclosure agreement in three ways: by presenting Goodbye Vanilla's confidential information to Sony during the pitch process, by sharing Goodbye Vanilla's confidential information with Aimia employees who did not work on the Sony pitch, and by continuing to use Goodbye Vanilla's confidential information after the parties' relationship ended. But Goodbye Vanilla identifies no facts in the record that support these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla contends that Aimia disclosed confidential information to Sony during the pitch process by sending Sony a letter containing Goodbye Vanilla's Nielsen Data Fusion research. Pearson testified that he sent the research to McLaren, an Aimia employee, who \"pasted\" that research into a letter with Aimia's letterhead and sent the letter to Sony on November 17, 2014. Although the record does not contain the letter, the record includes the email that transmitted the research to McLaren. This email states that the recommendations are for Sony and directs McLaren to \"put [the research] in Aimia language.\" Even if the contents of the email meet the nondisclosure agreement's definition of confidential information, there is no fact in the record that supports the position that the disclosure of that information was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla next argues that Aimia improperly shared Goodbye Vanilla's confidential information with Aimia employees who were not working on the Sony pitch. Pearson testified that McLaren promised to send the pitch materials to an Aimia employee who was not assigned to the Sony pitch team, in contravention of the nondisclosure agreement's prohibition on internal disclosure of confidential information. But without more, Pearson's testimony does not create a genuine dispute as to whether the allegedly promised improper disclosure occurred. The record does not contain the email exchange, and Goodbye Vanilla produces no other fact that supports its allegation that Aimia improperly disclosed to its employees Goodbye Vanilla's confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla also contends that Aimia continues to use its confidential information despite the dissolution of the parties' relationship. The only basis for this allegation is Pearson's deposition testimony. But Pearson neither identifies the information he believes Aimia continues to use nor states for what purpose he believes Aimia uses the information. Goodbye Vanilla identifies no other evidence in support of this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In summary, Goodbye Vanilla has not identified any evidence to support its claim that Aimia improperly disclosed confidential information in violation of the parties' nondisclosure agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aimia's motion for summary judgment is granted as to Count IV, Goodbye Vanilla's breach-of-contract claim arising from the nondisclosure agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Joint-venture claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Goodbye Vanilla asserts two claims based on the existence of a joint-venture agreement: first, Goodbye Vanilla asserts\n   that the parties entered into a joint-venture agreement that Aimia breached in violation of Minnesota law, and second, Goodbye Vanilla asserts that Aimia's alleged breach of the joint-venture agreement also is a breach of Aimia's fiduciary duty to Goodbye Vanilla. Aimia argues that, because it never entered into a joint-venture agreement with Goodbye Vanilla, the claims must fail as a matter of law. Goodbye Vanilla counters that summary judgment must be denied because the existence of a joint venture must be determined by the finder of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Four elements establish the existence of a joint venture: \"(1) contribution by both parties; (2) joint proprietorship and control; (3) sharing of profits, but not necessarily losses ...; and (4) a contract, express or implied.\"\n   <em>\n    Westphal v.

Goodbye Vanilla relies on the deposition testimony of Annette Dimatos, a Sony executive, who testified that the Nielsen Data Fusion research was a key factor in awarding Aimia the contract. Goodbye Vanilla asserts that it was responsible for that content. Goodbye Vanilla also presents emails in which McLaren, an Aimia employee, recognized the value of Goodbye Vanilla's contribution to the pitch process. Given this evidence, whether Goodbye Vanilla provided a benefit to Aimia in the form of its knowledge and expertise is a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Aimia argues that even if Goodbye Vanilla's services helped Aimia secure the contract with Sony, entering into a contract with Sony was not a benefit because Sony did not actually purchase services from Aimia until months later. But the Sony contract is not the benefit on which Goodbye Vanilla bases its unjust-enrichment claim. The benefit is the services Goodbye Vanilla provided, which can have independent value. Thus, Aimia has not established the absence of a genuine dispute as to whether Goodbye Vanilla conferred a benefit and Aimia accepted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Both parties indicate that Aimia \"reimbursed\" Goodbye Vanilla for its expenses related to the pitch, but the record is unclear as to whether that payment fully compensated Goodbye Vanilla for its work.
