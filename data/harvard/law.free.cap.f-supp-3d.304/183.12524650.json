(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-55.) Williams's specific allegations pertain to a saga that involved a trip to New Orleans, a lost cell phone, and Verizon's subsequent investigation into William's asserted reasons for taking leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-23, 25-29, 31-41.) Williams claims that Verizon \"accused him[,]\" without evidence, \"of feigning his illness\" and \"l[ying] to [Verizon]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53), and later unlawfully terminated him \"for taking this leave, resulting in monetary loss including loss of employment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before this Court at present is Verizon's motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment.

(\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 28-1.) Among other things, Verizon argues that Williams's interference claim must fail because it is duplicative of his retaliation claim, and that Verizon granted Williams the requested FMLA leave, and thus did not interfere with Williams's exercise of his FMLA rights.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Williams filed the instant FMLA lawsuit against Verizon in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on April 13, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1-1, at 3.) Approximately one month later, on May 17, 2016,\n   Verizon removed Williams's action to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 5.) In the original two-count complaint, Williams alleged that Verizon interfered with his FMLA rights by denying his request for FMLA leave on March 7, 2014, and March 8, 2014, and further, that Verizon retaliated against him by accusing him of feigning his illness and subsequently terminating him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-46.) Verizon subsequently answered the complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the parties moved on to discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer, ECF No. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During discovery, Verizon moved for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and asked the Court to dismiss the case because Williams and his attorney had produced evidence that Verizon argued \"should have placed Plaintiff's counsel on notice that certain critical allegations in the [c]omplaint are false\" (Def.'s Mot. for Sanctions, ECF No. 14, at 1), and that his client's claims are not \"grounded in fact\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). As grounds for this motion, Verizon explained that the original complaint represented that Williams had decided to attend his aunt's funeral in New Orleans last-minute,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he had already called in sick, but that Williams produced debit card records showing that he had in fact purchased his ticket two days prior, on March 5, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Sanctions, ECF No. 15, at 3.) Verizon further contended that the original complaint's allegation that Verizon had denied Williams's FMLA leave was untrue, based on copies of FMLA paperwork that Williams had produced, which established that Verizon had in fact approved his FMLA requests for March 7 and 8, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court denied Verizon's motion for sanctions, insofar as Verizon sought dismissal of the complaint, and also declined to award attorney's fees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Order of Feb. 28, 2017). Thereafter, Williams amended his complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 46), and adjusted the interference claim to be based on the contention that \"Verizon [ ] terminated him ... for taking [FMLA] leave\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 11, 2017, Verizon filed a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment with respect to William's Amended Complaint. Because discovery has concluded, Verizon's motion is fairly presented as one for summary judgment, and this Court will treat it as such. In its motion, Verizon argues that Williams has failed to establish a valid FMLA interference claim because his interference claim is based on the same set of facts as his retaliation claim, and that, in any event, Williams has presented no evidence that Verizon interfered with the exercise of his FMLA rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 14-17.) Verizon further contends that Williams has failed to support his FMLA retaliation claim, because Williams has not shown the causation that a prima facie case for retaliation requires, and because Verizon has put forward a legitimate reason for terminating Williams-the fact that he lied during the investigation in violation of Verizon's Code of Conduct-which Williams has failed to rebut as pretextual. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his opposition to Verizon's motion for summary judgment, Williams appears to maintain that Verizon interfered with his exercise of rights under the FMLA, first, when his supervisors inquired into his leave, and then when they subsequently fired him, because an investigation alone \"make[s] it triply difficult for an employee to obtain FMLA[,]\" and Verizon further infringed on his FMLA rights when it made the decision to fire him. (Pl.'s Opp'n to Verizon's Mot. to Dismiss and/or Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 30, at 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.) Williams also contends that his firing was retaliatory, because Verizon never ascertained whether he was actually sick during his FMLA leave, and deviated from its \"usual progressive discipline policy\" in a way that suggests that the stated reason for firing Williams was not the actual reason he was fired.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The FMLA interference and FMLA retaliation claims that Williams has brought in this case are based on the same set of facts: that Verizon investigated him, and then terminated him, after he returned from taking FMLA leave. As an initial matter, there can be \"a good deal of overlap\" between retaliation claims and interference claims,\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052675,4355917\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/158/\">\n     778 F.3d at 161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , as explained fully below, and the fact that Williams's two claims arise out of the same facts does not preclude the Court's consideration of both legal theories. Even so, this Court finds that Williams has failed to point to anything with respect to either claim that would create more than a \"mere existence of a scintilla of evidence\" in support of Williams's claims.\n    <em>\n     Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , 477 U.S. at 252,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p252\">\n     106 S.Ct. 2505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is, the record evidence is not sufficient to support either Williams's contention that Verizon unlawfully restrained the rightful exercise of his FMLA rights, or his claim that Verizon illegitimately discriminated against him on the basis of his having taken FMLA leave when it fired him. Consequently, Verizon is entitled to summary judgment on both counts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Williams's Amended Interference Claim Need Not Be Dismissed As Duplicative\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    As its opening salvo, Verizon asserts that the Court need not reach Williams's interference claim as set forth in his Amended Complaint (Count I), because it is entirely duplicative of his retaliation claim (Count II). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 14-15.) Verizon argues that, because the FMLA provides \"two distinct claims\"-an interference claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), and a retaliation claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) -Williams cannot maintain\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    an interference claim\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    a\n    separate retaliation claim based on the same set of facts, which, here, involve approved FMLA leave followed by the termination of Williams's employment.

In light of this 'retaliatory interference' scenario, the same set of facts can actually form the basis for two different FMLA claims: that the employer unlawfully retaliated against the employee for taking leave in the past, and also that the employer's retaliatory act will substantially interfere with that employee's right to take leave in the future. In other words, it is plausible that the same retaliatory act can undergird two different legal theories under the FMLA, and thus, separate interference and retaliation claims that pertain to only one set of actions by the employer are not necessarily duplicative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Williams has been clear in his complaint and subsequent briefs that he wishes to bring claims for both interference and retaliation (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Am. Compl. (asserting two separate counts) ), and given the legal analysis set forth above, this Court sees no reason to dismiss his interference claim as necessarily duplicative of his retaliation claim on its face. Consequently, this Court will decline to follow Verizon's suggestion that Williams's \"interference claim should be dismissed with prejudice\" because his claim \"is one of retaliation only, not interference\" (Def.'s Mem. at 15), and will proceed to analyze both claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Williams's Interference Claim Fails Because There Is Insufficient Evidence That Verizon Discouraged The Exercise Of His Rights Under The FMLA\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Both parties agree that Verizon approved Williams's request to take FMLA\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    leave on March 7 and 8, 2014 (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23-24), and per Williams's amended complaint, Williams's interference claim is not based on Verizon's outright refusal of leave (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl. \u00b6 46). Instead, Williams's interference theory now rests on the fact that Verizon investigated his FMLA leave after his return to work, and subsequently fired him. Although Williams's legal assertions are less than clear, he appears to be making two related contentions: (1) that Verizon restrained the taking of FMLA leave by investigating the circumstances of his FMLA leave (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 14-15), and (2) that Verizon discouraged the taking of FMLA leave by terminating him on return from leave (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.220\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.220\">\n     at 15-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Williams is correct when he asserts that the fact of Verizon's approval of the FMLA leave, by itself, does not preclude a valid interference claim, if Verizon nevertheless acted in a manner that had a \"reasonable tendency[,]\"\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052675,4355917\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/158/\">\n     778 F.3d at 165\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , to thwart the taking of FMLA leave. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 11.) But, notably, Williams has not alleged, nor offered any evidence to support, that Verizon took any action with respect to Williams's\n    <em>\n     taking\n    </em>\n    leave. To the contrary, by all accounts, Williams appears to have taken the requested medical leave without hindrance, and the factual bases for Williams's interference claim-Verizon's investigation and its termination of him-occurred\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    he appears to have taken his leave successfully based on his pre-approved FMLA certification.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052675,4355917\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/158/\">\n     778 F.3d at 165\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (recognizing that interference claims are \"forward-looking[,]\" as distinguished from \"backward-looking\" retaliation claims). Nor is there any evidence that Verizon dragged its feet in acquiescing to the specific instances of his leave on March 7, 2014, and March 8, 2014 after the fact. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23-24.) Indeed, at the time that he called in sick and requested leave for March 8, 2014, Williams's certification for migraines had expired (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 19-20), but Verizon permitted Williams to obtain a FMLA certification from his physician for back pain some time later, and retroactively approved Williams's FMLA leave for March 8, 2014 based on that certification (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 23-24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The best that Williams can do to sustain his interference claim on the facts presented here is to maintain that what Verizon did after he returned from FMLA leave (i.e., investigate the circumstances of Williams's leave and ultimately terminate him) discouraged any potential\n    <em>\n     future\n    </em>\n    FMLA leave he may have wanted to take. But there is no support in the record for this theory of interference, either. As to the investigation, Williams appears to suggest that merely by asking questions about the circumstances of his FMLA leave, Verizon unlawfully discouraged the taking of any further leave, citing an Eleventh Circuit case where the employer was found to have interfered with an employee's FMLA leave by asking for additional documentation of her FMLA need. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 14-15 (citing\n    <em>\n     Diamond v. Hospice of Fla. Keys, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20Fed.%20Appx.%20586\">\n     677 Fed.Appx. 586\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 594 (11th Cir. 2017) ).) But in that case, the employer sought additional information as it decided whether or not to\n    <em>\n     approve\n    </em>\n    the employee's FMLA leave request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Diamond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20Fed.%20Appx.%20586\">\n     677 Fed.Appx. at 593-594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding that the employer's request for food receipts and other additional documentation in assessing the employee's \"need for leave\" was an impermissible attempt to \"mak[e] approval of her leave requests more difficult\"). Here, the evidence is clear that Verizon's investigation was not being conducted to construct additional hoops for Williams to traverse before his FMLA leave would be approved; instead, Verizon commenced investigating because of a reasonable suspicion that\n    Williams had been deceptive about his illness on the day he invoked the FMLA. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 49-52 (recounting the fact that Frames received a call from Williams's cell phone in Charlotte during Williams's FMLA leave, and Alexander directed Frames to conduct an investigation only after Frames notified him of that fact).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Verizon's legitimate attempt to look into how Williams had conducted himself during the FMLA medical leave that Verizon had authorized was entirely warranted based on the troubling facts that were brought to the company's attention, and nothing in the record indicates that the investigation had the tendency to thwart any valid request for medical leave by Williams in the future. Indeed, no employee who had a valid claim for medical leave and has used that leave appropriately would be bothered by the questions that Williams's supervisors asked. And to suggest otherwise, as Williams does here, is to accept the preposterous contention that employees can abuse the FMLA leave process with impunity, and that employers cannot do anything to audit or supervise the leave process, because to ask questions effectively makes it \"triply difficult\" for employees \"to obtain FMLA\" and to use it however they want, even inappropriately. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 18.)\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sharif v. United Airlines, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173891\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/199/#p206\">\n     841 F.3d 199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 206 (4th Cir. 2016) (upholding an employer's actions in terminating an employee suspected of lying about his FMLA leave, and remarking that \"[w]hile a company may not deny valid requests for leave ... it is equally important to prevent the FMLA from being abused\"). This Court concludes that Verizon's legitimate investigation of what appeared to be a dubious FMLA leave claim was not an act that interfered with an employee's right to bring valid FMLA requests in the future. At most, Verizon's investigation would have deterred\n    <em>\n     false\n    </em>\n    future FMLA claims, which does not constitute interference with the exercise of FMLA rights as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In regard to Williams's suggestion that Verizon's termination of his employment constituted unlawful interference, it is undisputed that it was only after the company's investigation and Williams's repeated misrepresentations during the investigatory interviews that Verizon fired him. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 53-71.) And in this Circuit, it is well established that \"[r]ights to FMLA leave-whether in the application phase, medical certification phase, or off-work phase-do not protect an employee's job against a legitimate, unrelated, reason for separation from employment.\"\n    <em>\n     Hopkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3549379\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/851/146/#p152\">\n     851 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    155 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hopkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20Fed.%20Appx.%201\">\n     529 Fed.Appx. at 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting an interference claim where there was a \"termination for a valid business reason\"). Here, it is undisputed that Williams's misrepresentations during the investigation violated Verizon's Code of Conduct (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 73-74), and such a violation is a legitimate business reason for Verizon's decision to fire Williams. Williams cannot shield himself from that outcome merely because the termination of his employment also prevented the hypothetical future exercise of his FMLA rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Undaunted, Williams maintains that Verizon investigated his use of FMLA leave, and then terminated him, without inquiring into whether he was\n    <em>\n     really\n    </em>\n    sick, and that, ultimately, Verizon penalized him \"because he was not in the District of Columbia\" and \"was not in bed for 24 hours\" during his leave. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 15.) This construction of the facts is belied by the facts in the instant record, which establish quite clearly that Williams lied about his whereabouts when he was questioned during the investigation, and that\n    his deceptiveness was one of the reasons for his termination. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Termination Letter at 1 (stating that Verizon determined that Williams misrepresented his health status, falsified records, and was not honest and forthcoming during the investigation);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 68 (demonstrating that Williams was not terminated until after Verizon had investigated the matter for more than two months, even though it was aware that Williams had traveled to New Orleans at the outset).) Williams's suggestion that Verizon had to verify Williams's malingering before it could fire him is also inconsistent with the law, which does not mandate that an employer amass \"medical documentary evidence\" that an employee is \"feigning his illness\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 53), prior to responding to suspected FMLA leave violations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sharif\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173891\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/199/#p206\">\n     841 F.3d at 206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding, in a case where plaintiff was investigated and discharged after the employer discovered that he was traveling during his FMLA leave, that the employer \"had no obligation to pursue additional investigation when it had more than ample reason to believe it had been lied to[,]\" as long as it had made a reasonably informed decision). Williams's similar suggestion that Verizon interfered with his exercise of FMLA rights by attaching additional restrictions to what constitutes valid FMLA leave, and firing him based on the failure to meet those made-up restrictions (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15 (\"Their insistence that he remain in D.C. and be in bed for 24 hours is made all the more bizarre, when not a single Verizon employee determined them to be qualifying conditions for FMLA leave.\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    (\"If he was sick, in bed, attending a funeral in Shanghai, and Verizon had notice of his leave, it is an FMLA qualifying incident.\") ), is likewise meritless. The record shows that Verizon's investigation was a reasonable attempt to determine what Williams actually did on the days he called in sick (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 56-59), in order to determine whether his request for leave was valid in light of the travel information Verizon received, and\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    an effort to impose new rules about what employees are permitted to do when they are truly sick, as Williams suggests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    For all his talk of actual illness, Williams has essentially ignored what is by far the most salient point as far as the interference claim is concerned: regardless of whether Williams actually had an FMLA-qualifying illness on March 7 and 8, 2014, Verizon was entitled to conduct an investigation based on its reasonable belief that he was not ill and was instead feigning illness and fraudulently claiming FMLA leave.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     George v.

Thus, to the extent that Williams asserts an interference claim with respect to his taking of FMLA leave and Verizon's ultimate termination of his employment, there is no evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Verizon took \"action with a reasonable tendency to 'interfere with, restrain, or deny' the 'exercise or attempt to exercise' an FMLA right\" when it investigated Williams, or when it terminated him after he came back from leave that it had approved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     Gordon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052675,4355917\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/158/\">\n     778 F.3d at 165\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

But Williams has failed to demonstrate any such inconsistency here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In this regard, Williams relies solely on two affidavits from two union stewards, Drucilla Jones and Derrick Griffin. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Aff. of Drucilla Jones (\"Jones Aff.\"), Ex. C to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 30-3; Aff. of Derrick Griffin (\"Griffin Aff.\"), Ex. D to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 30-4.) Both affidavits contain bald assertions about Verizon's so-called progressive discipline policy, past practices with respect to other employees involved in misconduct, and the alleged irregularity of Verizon's treatment of Williams. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Jones Aff. \u00b6 12 (\"Verizon had a practice of simply suspending employees for acts worse than that attributed to [ ] Williams.\"); Griffin Aff. \u00b6 18 (\"[Williams's] termination was a clear departure from Verizon's progressive discipline policy.\").) But neither provides the specificity required to give rise to an inference that the referenced facts and circumstances actually pertain to similarly situated employees who were treated more favorably by Verizon than Williams was treated in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As an initial matter, neither affidavit does more than merely assert that Verizon ordinarily employs a \"progressive discipline policy,\" pursuant to which it suspends derelict employees but does not fire them. (Jones Aff. \u00b6 8; Griffin Aff. \u00b6 8.) In fact, Jones's affidavit specifically recognizes that Verizon \"did not have a written policy for suspension[,]\" and no such policy or practice is contained in Verizon's collective bargaining agreement with the union. (Jones Aff. \u00b6 8;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Reply at 11 (maintaining that neither Verizon's Code of Conduct nor the collective bargaining agreement requires progressive discipline).) Griffin's affidavit purports to explain that his \"knowledge and familiarity\" with Verizon's progressive discipline policy comes from \"attend[ing] a three[-]day training\" on the grievance and termination process that the union conducts (Griffin Aff. \u00b6 8), but does not cite any source that shows that Verizon actually has such a policy, much less that it has taken the position that the company will not terminate employees who lie during an investigation of potential fraud pertaining to approved FMLA leave. In fact, Verizon's Code of Conduct appears to belie the claim that Verizon has a progressive discipline policy with respect to violations of the Code, because it specifically states that termination can result from violating company policy as set forth in the Code. (Verizon Code of Conduct at 8 (\"Failure to comply with any provision of this Code or company policy is a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action,\n    <em>\n     up to and including termination of employment\n    </em>\n    [.]\" (emphasis added) ).)\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Long\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265264\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/275/#p282\">\n     263 F.Supp.3d at 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting the argument that the employer's given reason her termination was pretextual based on its failure to follow an alleged \"progressive discipline policy\" where \"the record ma[de] it clear that [the employer] was not wedded to a strict\" policy and the staff handbook permitted termination without first employing other measures).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Nor do Jones's or Griffin's affidavits provide any competent comparator evidence to show that Williams was actually treated differently than anyone else.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Neuren v.

Jones's affidavit states generally that, \"[i]n my 35 years' experience as a union steward representing Verizon employees, I have full and\n    personal knowledge of employees who have been terminated under our grievance policy and Verizon has not terminated any employee for a lie or misrepresentation during a grievance or company hearing,\" and thus, \"Williams's \"termination was a deviation from [Verizon's] policy.\" (Jones Aff. \u00b6 7.)

Similarly, although Jones makes the blanket statement that Verizon employees are \"not terminated for ... falsifying FMLA leave\" (Jones Aff. \u00b6 9), she includes no facts regarding comparable employees who lied about their leave, making an assessment of their similarities or dissimilarities to Williams's case impossible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Holbrook v.

Cir. 2016) (\"Courts may grant summary judgment to a defendant where a plaintiff's evidence is vague or conclusory.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    It is also notable that Verizon has gone above and beyond to highlight the deficiency of Williams's showing, by providing evidence that specifically rebuts any claim that Williams faced inconsistent treatment in regard to his termination. Contrary to\n    Jones's and Griffin's vague perception that Verizon allows its employees to make fraudulent misrepresentations without being fired, it appears that Verizon\n    <em>\n     has\n    </em>\n    terminated employees who are also \"in the Potomac bargaining unit\" (to which Williams belongs) for \"providing false and misleading information during an investigation in violation of the Code of Conduct.\" (Def.'s Stmt. \u00b6 75;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Verizon Termination Letters, Ex. A-F to Decl. of Miriam T. Brooks, ECF No. 28-14, at 5-16.) And Williams's only objection to paragraph 75 of Verizon's statement of undisputed material facts is the contention that \"[h]is discipline was a deviation from their normal practice per the affidavit[s] of Drucilla Jones and Derrick Griffin[.]\" (Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 75.) As such, Williams merely maintains that the Jones and Griffin affidavits ought to be given more weight than the facts that are reflected in these company documents. However earnest, Williams's own assessment of the relevant strength of the parties' evidence is not important; what matters is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that Williams's termination was an anomaly because employees are\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    terminated for lying in an investigation as he did, and based on Verizon's exhibits and the paucity of information in Williams's affidavits, this Court concludes that it could not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Notably, even assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that Verizon departed from previous practice in regard to Williams's termination, that alone may still not be enough to show pretext.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson v. Lehman,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553010,3631354\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/918/\">\n     679 F.2d 918\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 922 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (noting, in the discrimination context, that even where an employer has failed to follow its own established regulations, that alone is merely probative, and may not be sufficient to establish a forbidden intent). Because Verizon's written policy explicitly states that termination may result for employees who violate its Code of Conduct (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Verizon Code of Conduct at 8), the mere fact that Verizon could have taken a different approach-i.e., suspended him instead of terminated him-would not be sufficient to show pretext, and this is especially so in the absence of robust comparator evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wilkerson v. Wackenhut Protective Servs., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185417\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/813/61/#p67\">\n     813 F.Supp.2d 61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 67 (D.D.C. 2011) (rejecting the idea that a plaintiff can \"establish pretext by contending that [the employer] could have, but did not, impose progressive discipline, especially when [the employer's] policy permitted swift and severe punishment for a single [violation]\" (internal citation omitted) );\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sharif\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173891\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/199/#p206\">\n     841 F.3d at 206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting the claim that the \"severity of the consequence [the employee] received is evidence of pretext\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The bottom line is this: when evaluating a retaliation claim at the summary judgment stage, the court must \"consider all the evidence, taken together,\" and assess whether it is sufficient to support a reasonable inference of retaliation.\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382721,5865433\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/670/\">\n     557 F.3d at 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, even for plaintiffs who create some genuine issue of material fact as to pretext, not every one \"will always be deemed to have presented enough evidence to survive summary judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n     156 F.3d 1284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc). So it is here. Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Williams,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tolan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002,12580258\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1861/\">\n     134 S.Ct. at 1866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \"the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision,\" and Williams has, at best, \"created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue[,]\"\n    <em>\n     Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p148\">\n     530 U.S. 133\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 148,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p148\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2097\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p148\">\n     147 L.Ed.2d 105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000). In other words, Williams has not provided evidence that would be\n    <em>\n     sufficient\n    </em>\n    for a reasonable jury to conclude that Verizon's stated reasons for firing him was\n    mere pretext; therefore, his retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269256\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/88/#p99\">\n     227 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    111 ;\n    <em>\n     Long\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265264\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/275/#p282\">\n     263 F.Supp.3d at 288\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    For the reasons explained above, this Court finds that Williams has not adduced sufficient evidence to support his claim that Verizon interfered with, or otherwise attempted to restrain, any exercise of his rights protected by the FMLA, and the Court also concludes that no reasonable jury could find based on the instant record evidence that Verizon terminated Williams with a retaliatory motive. Therefore, as set forth in the accompanying order, Verizon's motion for summary judgment will be\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    , and judgment will be entered in Defendant's favor on all claims.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
