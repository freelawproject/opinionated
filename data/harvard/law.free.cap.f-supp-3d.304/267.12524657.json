In anticipation of trial, which is scheduled for June, the Court ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing the legal question of what standard of proof governs this case-preponderance of the evidence or clear and convincing evidence. (ECF No. 99.) The Government argues that the standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence. Defendants Diane M. Garrity, Paul G. Garrity, Jr., and Paul M. Sterczala (collectively, \"Defendants\"), as fiduciaries of the Estate of Paul G. Garrity, Sr., argue that the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence. In addition, although not ordered by the Court to do so, the parties have also briefed the separate question of whether the Government must show that Mr. Garrity, Sr. intentionally violated a known legal duty to establish a \"willful\" violation of Section 5314 or whether the Government may satisfy its burden of proof by showing that Mr. Garrity, Sr. acted recklessly. Defendants urge the former standard, while the Government urges the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, I agree with the Government on both issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Government had assessed the penalty against Mr. Garrity, Sr. for his allegedly willful failure to timely report his financial interest in, and/or his authority over, a foreign bank account for the 2005 calendar year, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205314\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and its implementing regulations.

Rather, Defendants argue that the civil FBAR statute is analogous to the civil tax fraud statute, which requires proof by clear and convincing evidence.

The civil FBAR penalty does not implicate \"important individual interests or rights\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants argue that the clear and convincing evidence standard applies because the penalty for willful FBAR violations is \"far more draconian\" than the civil tax fraud penalty (ECF No. 106 at 3) and will involve proving allegations that could tarnish Mr. Garrity's reputation. (ECF No. 108 at 5.) Defendants thus suggest that the civil FBAR penalty implicates \"important individual interests or rights\" under\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 108 at 5.) But even allegations of fraud do not necessitate a higher standard of proof. In\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the applicable standard of proof for a fraudulent misrepresentation claim was preponderance of the evidence, reversing the Court of Appeals's ruling that the clear and convincing evidence standard applied to allegations of fraud.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/#p387\">\n    459 U.S. at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/#p387\">\n    103 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Grogan\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court rejected the notion that the presence of a statutory fraud claim necessarily warranted a higher standard of proof, even though the common law of many states did apply such a standard: \"Unlike a large number, and perhaps the majority, of the States, Congress has chosen the preponderance standard when it has created substantive causes of action for fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223600\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/279/#p288\">\n    498 U.S. at 288-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121506\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/111/654/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing numerous examples).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834042\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/908/1186/#p1201\">\n    908 F.Supp.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   in the civil tax-penalty arena).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, the Chief Counsel's statement that \"[c]ourts have traditionally applied the clear and convincing standard with respect to fraud cases in general\" (ECF No. 106-1 at 3) does not account for differences in how courts treat fraud under federal statutes and the common law, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Master-Halco, Inc. v.

Conn. 2010) (discussing differences between standards of proof for statutory fraud and common law fraud, and holding that clear and convincing evidence was the appropriate standard of proof for civil conspiracy to commit fraud and aiding and abetting fraud under state common law). The cases Defendants cite in support of a higher standard involved allegations of a patent's invalidity, which the Supreme Court has explicitly held must be established by clear and convincing evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the Connecticut common law standard for proving fraud-clear and convincing evidence-which a federal action for a civil FBAR penalty does not implicate.

We expect that a court will find the burden in civil FBAR cases to be that of providing \"clear and convincing evidence,\" rather than merely a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" The clear and convincing evidence standard is the same burden the Service must meet with respect to civil tax fraud cases where the Service also has to show the intent of the taxpayer at the time of the violation. Courts have traditionally applied the clear and convincing standard with respect to fraud cases in general, not just to tax fraud cases, because just as it is difficult to show intent, it is also difficult to show a lack of intent.
