KENNELLY, United States District Judge\n   IPOX Schuster LLC is a small financial services firm, founded by Dr. Josef Schuster, that produces \"indexes\" of companies with recent initial public offerings (IPOs). An IPO is what takes place when a company starts to sell stock to the public, and an index is a collection of stocks grouped together to measure the performance of a market. IPOX claims that the indexes it offers can serve as a \"pure proxy for economic growth and innovation\"-an appealing service for the investing industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Nikko Asset Management Co., a Japanese investment trust, wanted to issue a financial product composed of the stocks of American companies that experienced an IPO in the past five years-the \"Nikko Fund.\" Though they both aim to approximate the same market, there is a distinction between an index, a measurement of a market, and a fund, a product comprising the stocks of companies within that market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nikko contracted with Lazard Asset Management (LAM) and Lazard Japan Asset Management (LJAM), together \"Lazard,\" to identify the companies that should be included within the Nikko Fund. IPOX alleges that the defendants violated its rights in various ways during the development and marketing of the Nikko Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nikko and Lazard have moved for summary judgment on the thirteen counts in IPOX's complaint and on IPOX's request for punitive damages. IPOX has cross-moved for summary judgment on the defendants' affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nikko is a financial services corporation organized under the laws of Japan. Several years prior to this litigation, it operated the Nikko Growing Venture Fund, an investment trust that invested in Japanese companies with IPOs in the previous five years. In late 2013, the company wanted to create an analogous fund that would invest in American companies with recent IPOs. This fund, the subject of this litigation, is referred to as the Nikko Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To set up this fund, Nikko asked LJAM and LAM to select and trade the stocks in the Nikko Fund. Unlike some passively-managed funds, whose composition is determined by an index, the Nikko Fund is an actively managed fund whose composition is based upon the research and advice of investment advisors. In an agreement between Nikko and LAM establishing their relationship, they agreed that LJAM would provide services to LAM to help form the Nikko Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   LAM and LJAM both contend they were unfamiliar with IPOX before beginning work on the Nikko Fund. But by August 2014, prior to any direct contact with IPOX employees, LAM employees were acquainted with the IPOX indexes. LAM employees utilized information about the IPOX index to guide their own investment decisions. In one e-mail sent in early August, an analyst described how he compared the Nikko Fund model against the performance of the IPOX index. IPOX Ex. 101 at LAM00020446. Another e-mail expressed concern that the weighting of the Nikko Fund-the proportion of certain investments relative to others-disfavored large corporations as compared to the IPOX index. IPOX Ex. 69 at LAM00016478. The record does not identify\n   the source of the information used by the LAM employees. At the same time these e-mails were exchanged, Erik Miller, a LAM employee, e-mailed a question to Schuster about how he compiled the IPOX index. Schuster provided information to Miller that he later conceded was confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Michael Krenn, the LAM employee responsible for securing licenses for services like the IPOX index, e-mailed Schuster to request a license for the index. Lazard Ex. 96 at IPOX00000493. IPOX offered prospective customers the option of a data license, which authorizes the licensee to use the IPOX indexes internally, and a product license, which permits use of the IPOX indexes to create a new product. IPOX LR 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. IPOX charges data licensees a flat cost and product licensees a percentage of the value of IPOX-based products that they sell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cow.%209955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Schuster provided Krenn, and several other LJAM employees, a free trial: \"Happy to extend this for one month. Please note that a license is required, should you be interested in using the index etc. for a product.\" Lazard Ex. 97 at LAM00000416. Schuster also protected the confidentiality of his information by including, in some attachments, notices like \"Confidentiality Disclaimer applies.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Lazard Ex. 85 at IPOX00004904.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court issues this revised decision based on the parties' various motions to clarify or reconsider filed with respect to the decision originally issued on December 28, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    LJAM employees began to contact Schuster with specific questions about the inner workings of the IPOX index. Schuster provided detailed information on how the IPOX index was compiled.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Lazard Ex. 87 at IPOX00006888 (e-mail from Schuster describing \"the index construction process\"). At one point, Shintaro Kambara, an LJAM employee, mentioned in an e-mail that he had been involved in an IPO fund with Kosaka, who was already corresponding with Schuster. Lazard Ex. 142 at IPOX00006875. Kosaka, Kambara's manager, told Kambara not to mention the existence of the IPO fund. IPOX Ex. 130 at LAM00061607. Schuster e-mailed Kambara back to confirm that an IPO fund was being formed. In response, Kambara stated: \"Actually, we don't decide to launch a IPO fund now and we are conducting due diligence of relevant IPO Index.\" Lazard Ex. 89 at IPOX00001755. Schuster and Lazard employees continued to correspond.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    In mid-September 2014, representatives of Nikko, LJAM, and LAM traveled to New York City to present the Nikko Fund to SMBC Nikko, a major potential investor. At the presentation, the defendants shared a PowerPoint that touted the benefits of investing in the U.S. IPO market. The title slide included the name of each defendant. One slide stated \"The Post IPO Index (IPOX-100US) Tends to Perform Well in Almost Every Market Environment.\" IPOX Ex. 72 at LAM00153200 (PowerPoint). Other slides also referred to IPOX's strong performance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Separately, Nikko introduced marketing materials onto its website around October 1, 2014, the date of the launch of the Nikko Fund. The website was targeted solely to Japanese investors, was written in Japanese, and did not provide an option to purchase into the Nikko Fund from the site itself. On the website, the IPOX trademark was used in a chart comparing the strong performance of the IPOX index against three other indexes that did not measure the IPO market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    While using a search engine directed towards Japanese websites, Schuster learned of the materials on the Nikko website on October 16, 2014. By the end of October, Schuster, suspecting that Lazard was not merely conducting due diligence of the IPOX index, e-mailed Krenn to \"retract\" the \"data license proposal\" he extended to LAM in order to secure a license with Nikko directly, the \"funds sponsor.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Lazard Ex. 106 at IPOX00002949. In his response e-mail, Krenn implied he did not know which fund Schuster was talking about.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cow.%209955\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Schuster and Krenn never reached an agreement on a license.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    In August 2014, Schuster had separately begun negotiations with Nikko for a license after Ronald Cajetan, an IT professional employed by Nikko, requested a data license. Nikko Ex. N at IPOX00007060. Schuster sent Cajetan a proposal, to which Cajetan stated \"we are OK to move forward with the signing.\" But Cajetan responded to his own message to inform Schuster that the Nikko \"business side\" asked Cajetan not to sign the license. On October 16, 2014, after learning of Nikko's use of the IPOX mark on its Japanese website, Schuster e-mailed Cajetan and instructed him to direct Nikko's legal counsel to reach out to IPOX regarding the alleged infringement. Cajetan and Schuster began to negotiate an agreement again.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Schuster insisted that Nikko take a product license. Cajetan responded: \"After your product's license infringement by us, I know I should not ask you but would it be possible to ... revert back to [the data license] you first quoted for me.\" IPOX Ex. 91 at Nikko_0000058. Cajetan e-mailed Schuster a marked-up proposal, to which Schuster agreed. To ensure Schuster had adopted the marked-up proposal, Cajetan wanted to see the revised agreement before assenting to it. On October 28, Schuster responded: \"Let me know if you are OK with countersigning then I will mail the original documents to you.\" This document, which Schuster e-mailed to Cajetan on October 29, 2014, is the one IPOX alleges is the basis of an express contract between Nikko and IPOX. The \"business side\" of Nikko again intervened to instruct Cajetan to reject the agreement. Nikko also removed all reference to IPOX on its website by February 2015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Under the terms of the purported agreement formed at the end of October, IPOX was responsible for sending Nikko daily updates on the performance of the IPOX indexes. It began sending data updates in February upon advice of its counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The current version of IPOX's complaint in this lawsuit asserts fourteen claims against Nikko, LJAM, and LAM. IPOX alleges the defendants committed misappropriation under Illinois common law (Count 1) and the Illinois Trade Secrets Act (ITSA), 765 ILCS 1065/2 (Count 2), and infringed IPOX's trademark under Illinois common law and the Lanham Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Count 3). The Court previously dismissed the fourth count of IPOX's amended complaint. IPOX also alleges the defendants violated the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 815 ILCS 510/2 (Count 5), and the Illinois Trademark Registration Protections Act, 765 ILCS 1036/65(a) (Count 6). Against LJAM and LAM, IPOX alleges fraud (Count 7) and violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/2 (Count 8). IPOX also asserts against Nikko a claim for breach of express contract (Count 9) and a claim for breach of implied contract (Count 10). IPOX also alleges LAM breached an implied contract (Count 11), interfered in IPOX's contract with Nikko (Count 13), and interfered with a prospective business relationship (Count 14). IPOX also asserts an unjust enrichment claim against all defendants (Count 12).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Nikko and Lazard have both moved for summary judgment. Lazard also moved for summary judgment on IPOX's request for punitive damages on several counts. IPOX cross-moved for summary judgment on Nikko and Lazard's affirmative defenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    A party is entitled to summary judgment\n    if it can demonstrate that the non-movant has not presented enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find in its favor.

There is evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that LAM conferred both express and implied authority to LJAM. Specifically, there is evidence of express authority based upon the agreement between Nikko and LAM, which stated that LJAM was an affiliate of LAM that would \"provide services to [LAM] to intermediate for the conclusion of this agreement.\" Lazard Ex. A at LAM00000552. And there is evidence that LJAM derived implied authority from its course of conduct with LAM. Specifically, LAM described LJAM as its subsidiary. Mazzari Decl. \u00b6 1.

Schuster continued to pursue a product license after this exchange. To be clear, a reasonable jury could find in Lazard and Nikko's favor: the facts show that Schuster's efforts to protect the secrecy of the information were often less than painstaking. Erik Miller, a former employee of LAM, e-mailed Schuster with a question about the composition of the IPOX index, which Schuster answered without any effort to protect the confidentiality of that information. Lazard Ex. 84 at IPOX0003073 (e-mails between Miller and Schuster).

First, on the law: unlike other Illinois statutes that courts have found to be geographically limited, the ITSA may be\n    applied extraterritorially.

Nikko's argument also misstates the facts. The evidence indicates that Nikko used LJAM as a conduit to request and receive information from IPOX, which is based in Illinois. IPOX Ex. 210 at 54-55 (deposition of Shintaro Kambara, describing the information flow from IPOX to LJAM to Nikko); IPOX Ex 240 at 68-69 (same). In short, even if the ITSA cannot be applied to extraterritorial conduct, there is evidence supporting a contention that Nikko obtained a trade secret from an entity based in Illinois. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the defendants' motions for summary judgment on Count 2 as to non-public information, but grants the motion for any information that IPOX publicly distributed, as defined in Dkt. No. 138.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Lazard has also moved for summary judgment on IPOX's request for punitive damages for its ITSA claim. Lazard Mem. for Summ. J. at 40. Punitive damages under the ITSA are appropriate if the plaintiff may show \"willful and malicious\" misappropriation. 765 ILCS 1065/4(b). A plaintiff can satisfy this standard by showing \"intentional misappropriation\" or \"a misappropriation resulting from the conscious disregard of the rights of another.\"\n    <em>\n     Mangren Research &amp; Dev.

Nikko asked LJAM to obtain sensitive information from IPOX, which LJAM would then communicate back to Nikko, even while denying its employees were working on a fund. IPOX Ex. 210 at 54-55, 68-69 (Kambara deposition); Lazard Ex. 89 at IPOX00001755 (e-mail from Kambara to Schuster, stating \"we don't decide to launch a IPO fund now\"). Finally, LAM may be liable, as (1) LJAM acted as its agent in procuring this information and (2) Krenn misled Schuster by telling him that IPOX was not being used as a benchmark in the Nikko Fund, Lazard Ex. 135 at IPOX00001619, though it had been used as one as recently as August. IPOX Ex. 101 at LAM00020446 (LAM employees discuss using the IPOX-100 US as a benchmark for the Nikko Fund). Because a jury could reasonably find that each of the defendants intentionally misappropriated IPOX's trade secrets, which would entitle IPOX to punitive damages under the ITSA, the Court declines to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment on damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

IPOX alleges the defendants infringed its trademark on two occasions: first, when Nikko used the mark in advertising materials on its website and, second, when Nikko and Lazard used the mark in a sales presentation to a client in New York City. Because these allegations raise distinct legal issues on summary judgment, the Court considers them separately.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Nikko website\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    IPOX alleges that the defendants violated the Lanham Act by employing its mark on Nikko's website. Nikko's website featured the IPOX mark on some marketing materials, most notably, on a chart comparing the performance of the IPOX index with several other indexes. IPOX Ex. 34 at IPOX00000582 (image of the Nikko website). IPOX argues that LAM and LJAM are also liable for trademark infringement. To demonstrate trademark infringement, a plaintiff must show the defendant used the plaintiff's mark in a manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers.\n    <em>\n     Ty, Inc. v.

IPOX argues that LAM and LJAM were complicit in Nikko's decision to use the IPOX mark in its marketing materials. IPOX LR 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 81. Review of the exhibits to which IPOX directs the Court's attention shows e-mails among Lazard employees preparing materials describing how investments are screened, analyzed, and selected for inclusion in the Nikko Fund.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    IPOX Ex. 244 at LAM00024726. IPOX also alleges that Lazard provided the information that Nikko used to create the allegedly infringing chart, IPOX Ex. 52 at NIKKO_0010257, but not that LAM or LJAM asked or instructed Nikko to use IPOX's mark in their marketing efforts. Without more, IPOX has not offered any evidence upon which a reasonable jury to rely to make a finding that Lazard was responsible for or complicit in Nikko's alleged infringement. Lazard is entitled to summary judgment on trademark-based claims arising from Nikko's use of the mark on its website.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Turning to Nikko, the issue is whether the Lanham Act applies extraterritorially to the conduct of a Japanese company on a website that is targeted solely to a foreign market. As this Court explained in a prior opinion in this case, courts consider three factors to determine whether the Lanham Act has extraterritorial application: \"(1) whether the allegedly infringing party was a United States citizen; (2) whether the party's actions affected commerce in the United States; and (3) whether any foreign trademark law conflicted with American trademark law.\"\n    <em>\n     IPOX Schuster, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134850\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/790/#p802\">\n     191 F.Supp.3d at 805\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (collecting cases). Nikko is not a United States citizen, and there is no indication that there is a conflict between American and Japanese trademark law. Thus the Court focuses only on the second factor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Did Nikko's decision to employ the IPOX mark on its website affect commerce in the United States? IPOX argues it did. First, IPOX argues that Nikko also used the mark during a presentation in New York. IPOX Mem. for Summ. J. at 23. This is beside the point: the question is whether extraterritorial use of a trademark affected commerce in the United States, not whether there was also non-extraterritorial use. Next, IPOX claims the revenues of the Nikko Fund were re-invested in the United States, but it does not point the Court to a case in which this sort of attenuated relationship between an infringement\n    and U.S. commerce supported a copyright infringement claim. If commerce were defined so broadly as to include the proceeds of foreign activity that find their way back into the American economy, then there would be few instances in which the Lanham Act would not apply extraterritorially. Finally, IPOX argues that Nikko's display of its mark on the Internet was readily available to American consumers.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134850\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/790/#p802\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But the presence of an allegedly infringing mark on a foreign website on which American consumers are not shopping is insufficient to satisfy the second element.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Champion Lab., Inc. v.

Sales presentation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    IPOX alleges that Nikko and Lazard violated the Lanham Act by employing the IPOX mark during a sales presentation in New York City. Lazard hosted a meeting that Nikko and SMBC Nikko, a potential customer of the Nikko Fund, attended. It is not clear from the record whether an actual transaction occurred or if the meeting involved only marketing the Nikko Fund.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Just as Lazard argued it was uninvolved in the creation of Nikko's website, Nikko disputes that it was involved in the creation of the presentation or that SMBC Nikko was a potential customer.

IPOX Ex. 60 at LAM00017472-73. In an e-mail dated prior to the New York presentation, Kosaka described a meeting he held with Nikko in which he presented the Nikko Fund \"portfolio idea,\" discussed the use of the IPOX index as a benchmark measure, and learned Nikko wanted Lazard to present the materials to SMBC Nikko, their \"largest target customer.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938054\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/107/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In particular, in reference to testing the performance of the Nikko Fund against the IPOX index, Kosaka wrote \"Nikko prefers that they wait to see the result before taking to SMBC Nikko.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938054\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/107/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at LAM00017473. A reasonable jury could infer that Nikko is also responsible for the New York City presentation, which IPOX alleges infringed its rights under the Lanham Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    To prevail on a Lanham Act claim, IPOX must demonstrate that (1) the mark at issue is protectable and (2) there is a likelihood of confusion from the infringing use.\n    <em>\n     Ty, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164963\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/891/#p897\">\n     237 F.3d at 897\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . No one disputes that the IPOX mark is protectable. Thus the issue before the Court is whether IPOX has introduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the use of the IPOX mark in the New York presentation gave rise to a likelihood of confusion regarding the relationship between IPOX and the Nikko Fund.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164963\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/891/#p897\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    To evaluate this question, the Court considers: \"(1) the similarity of the marks in appearance and suggestion; (2) the similarity of the products; (3) the area and manner of concurrent use; (4) the degree of care likely to be used by consumers; (5) the strength of the plaintiff's mark; (6) whether any actual confusion exists; and (7) the defendant's intent to palm off its goods as those of the plaintiff[ ].\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164963\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/891/#p897\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The first factor favors IPOX. The original mark and the infringing use are identical, as the defendants used IPOX's mark in their presentation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The second factor, the similarity of the products, likewise favors IPOX. Though the specific products are distinct-IPOX-100 US is an index; the Nikko Fund is an investment product-they are closely related in that one measures the IPO market, while the other provides investors a way to invest in that market. Modern trademark law protects \"closely related products,\" such as beer and whiskey, linens and perfume, dog toys and dog shows, and liquor and restaurants.\n    <em>\n     Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20947\">\n     978 F.2d 947\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 958 (7th Cir. 1992).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The third factor (the manner of concurrent use of the marks) and the seventh factor (the defendant's intent to palm off its goods) involve the same facts. The defendants' central contention is that the use of the IPOX mark was comparative, not infringing. Nikko Mem. for Summ. J. at 9. As the Seventh Circuit has recognized, use of a rival's mark may promote competition within a market, as it aids consumers in comparing two or more goods.\n    <em>\n     August Storck K.G. v. Nabisco, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179409\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/616/#p618\">\n     59 F.3d 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 618 (7th Cir. 1995) (there is no infringement where the purpose of the use of a mark is not to blur the distinction between products, but to distinguish them). A reasonable jury could find this was not the aim here. The allegedly infringing chart compares the historical performance of the IPOX index against the S&amp;P 500, the Russell 2000, and the Nasdaq, none of which follows the IPO market. IPOX Ex. 72 at LAM00153199. The Nikko Fund, which had not yet been created and lacked historical performance information, was not on the chart. Thus the use of the IPOX mark in this chart can be easily distinguished from the use of the rival's mark in\n    <em>\n     August Storck\n    </em>\n    : whereas the defendant in\n    <em>\n     August Storck\n    </em>\n    sought to use the plaintiff's\n    mark to distinguish the goods, the present defendants sought to use IPOX's mark as a proxy for the performance of their own product.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The fourth factor, the degree of care likely to be used by customers, favors the defendants. The potential customers of the Nikko Fund-all of whom are sophisticated investors-were likely discriminating in their review of investment opportunities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Forum Corp. of N. Am. v.

Strick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824364\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/923/#p933\">\n     543 F.3d 923\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 933 (7th Cir. 2008). Nikko argues IPOX has not offered any evidence of its mark's strength. Nikko Reply Br. at 5. IPOX, however, contends that its mark is associated with over $3 billion in IPOX-linked products. Schuster Decl. \u00b6 4. Because it is unclear whether consumers associate these products with IPOX itself, the Court concludes the fifth factor is inconclusive. Finally, IPOX presents no evidence of actual confusion, the sixth factor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    When these factors are considered together, the scale does not tip so far in defendants' direction as to warrant summary judgment in their favor. A reasonable jury could find that the defendants' efforts to associate IPOX with the Nikko Fund produced a likelihood of confusion. The Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count 3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Lazard also moved for summary judgment on IPOX's request for treble damages for its Lanham Act claim. Lazard Mem. for Summ. J. at 25. What Lazard is challenging is not quite clear. The Lanham Act permits the court to assess damages\n    <em>\n     up to\n    </em>\n    three times actual damages,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), as well as treble damages for the use of a counterfeit mark (which is not at issue here).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1117(b). If IPOX successfully establishes liability under section 1117(a), there are three nonexclusive monetary remedies: \"(1) recovery of profits; (2) damages sustained by the plaintiff; and (3) costs of the action.\"\n    <em>\n     Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood\n    </em>\n    , 34 F.3d at 1347. Though Lazard contends that IPOX may not recover higher damages, because it has not offered evidence it sustained damages, IPOX has produced damage estimates from its expert. Duski Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. Damages, moreover, are not the only available remedy. The Court declines to grant summary judgment for Lazard on this point.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Count 5: Deceptive trade practices under the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    IPOX contends that the defendants violated the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act by using IPOX's mark in their business in a manner that caused a likelihood of confusion regarding the source of the goods or their affiliation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    815 ILCS 510/2. The Deceptive Trade Practices Act provides only for injunctive relief, 815 ILCS 510/3, and the party seeking relief must be able to identify future harm to be enjoined.\n    <em>\n     Camasta v.

IPOX essentially concedes this to be this case, as it argues that the future harm to be enjoined is the operation of the Nikko Fund itself. IPOX Mem. for Summ. J. at 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    IPOX has failed to provide evidence that would support a finding that the ongoing\n    operation of the Nikko Fund will cause the sort of harm that the Deceptive Trade Practices Act forbids. The Nikko Fund does not, through its operation, engender a likelihood of confusion regarding the source or affiliation of IPOX's mark. Any contention by IPOX that the defendants, while creating the Fund, violated the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, sets up a claim grounded in past conduct, which is insufficient.\n    <em>\n     Camasta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p740\">\n     761 F.3d at 740\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[P]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).

A reasonable jury could find that Lazard figured that disclosing that it was aiding Nikko in creating an IPO-based product, while denying the need for a product license, would have jeopardized its access to Schuster and the IPOX data.

A reasonable jury could infer that IPOX, whose sole business activity is licensing its indexes, would not have shared information with Lazard for free had Lazard honestly represented that it planned to use, and was using, IPOX's data and resources to develop a product without first securing a product license.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In its motion for summary judgment, Lazard argues that IPOX cannot demonstrate that it relied on any of its misrepresentations, as Schuster's behavior did not change before and after allegedly learning in an e-mail exchange that Lazard was engaged in building an IPO fund. Lazard Mem. for Summ. J. at 24. This misstates the record of the exchange. First, in an e-mail introduction, Kambara stated \"I am Shintaro Kambara ... I have been involved in IPO fund with Minoru Kosaka.\" Lazard Ex. 142 at IPOX00006875. In response, Schuster promptly asked Kambara to \"elaborate on the potential commercial arrangement between Lazard and IPOX Schuster in case a respective fund is launched[.]\" Lazard Ex. 89 at IPOX00001755.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Kosaka, who was Kambara's manager and was included on the e-mail disclosing the Nikko Fund, contacted Kambara directly and instructed him not to mention the Fund to Schuster, \"as we are still negotiating fees with this guy.\" IPOX Ex. 130 at LAM00061606. Kambara then followed up to tell Schuster that Lazard had not decided to launch an IPO fund at that point \"and we are conducting due diligence of relevant IPO Index.\" Lazard Ex. 89 at IPOX00001755. \"I believe we can offer you\n    a really good service to make it a very successful product,\" Schuster responded. Lazard Ex. 89 at IPOX00001754.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Contrary to Lazard's characterization-specifically, that Schuster learned defendants were creating an IPO fund but blithely continued sharing confidential information-a reasonable jury could find that Schuster immediately sought to put a product license in place upon learning that Lazard might be launching a fund. When Kambara falsely asserted that no such fund existed, Schuster stated that IPOX would be able to provide support for a product were it launched in the future. A jury reasonably could infer that Schuster relied on LJAM misrepresentations about the existence of a fund.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Finally, IPOX has provided evidence sufficient to support an award of damages.

IPOX, through the declaration of David Duski, has offered estimates of damages based upon theories of unjust enrichment, non-payment of royalties, and unpaid licensing fees. Duski Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. Lazard contends that IPOX cannot demonstrate damages, as IPOX stipulated that the company was not damaged as a whole by the defendants' conduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stip. and Agreed Order Re.

By stipulating that \"IPOX Schuster, LLC as a whole\" was not damaged, IPOX did not give up all of its potential damages, just those arising from damage to the company as a whole. But \"[c]ompensatory damages for fraud are intended to compensate for\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    injury which is the direct and natural consequence of [the plaintiff's] acting on the faith of defendant's representations.\"\n    <em>\n     Roboserve, Inc. v.

In other words, damages to the plaintiff entity itself are not the only damages available to IPOX.

This is unconvincing, as IPOX had already extended Lazard a data license under a \"free trial\" before the purported contract between IPOX and Nikko was ever formed. Moreover, the claimed contract does not provide for IPOX to deliver these data reports to Lazard. Nikko Ex.

IPOX did not perform under the purported contract for months after its creation. Rather, the relationship between Nikko and IPOX was marked by a lengthy and never-consummated negotiation over whether to form a contract, not by performance under a contract. Once IPOX began to \"perform,\" Nikko asked it to stop. Nikko Ex. C at 415-16. No reasonable jury could infer from Nikko and IPOX's conduct that the parties had reached an implied-in-fact contract.

Nikko contends IPOX cannot show that Nikko had sufficient contacts in Illinois in the absence of the contract-related claims. Nikko Mem. for Summ. J. at 20. Nikko previously moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. In denying that motion, the Court reviewed Nikko's contacts with Illinois that permitted exercise of jurisdiction over the company:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    Nikko corresponded with IPOX repeatedly, both before and after IPOX sent a cease-and-desist letter in October 2014. IPOX alleges that Nikko then reached into Illinois by infringing IPOX's trademark rights and attempting to capitalize on IPOX's reputation and goodwill with knowledge that IPOX had built its reputation and would be injured in Illinois.

To prevail on a breach of an implied-in-fact contract, a plaintiff must establish, through evidence of the parties' conduct, all of the elements of a traditional contract, including offer, acceptance, and consideration.\n    <em>\n     Marcatante\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834091\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/433/#p440\">\n     657 F.3d at 440\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    IPOX argues that a contract should be implied from its course of conduct with LAM, but it does not describe very well the nature of the contract it contends was formed. IPOX argues that its contract with LAM was formed after Krenn contacted Schuster to establish access to IPOX data on Bloomberg. IPOX Mem. for Summ. J. at 37-38; Lazard Ex. 97 at LAM00000415-16.

When did Lazard manifest its assent to a contract? What is the price term upon which the parties agreed? What consideration did IPOX receive (or even seek) for this access to its data?

With regard to Count 3, the Court holds that both defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim to the extent it involves marketing activities that occurred in Japan regarding Nikko's website, but not otherwise.
