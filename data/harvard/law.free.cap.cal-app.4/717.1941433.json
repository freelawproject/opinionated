That.the court has no jurisdiction of the offense charged therein; 2. That it does not substantially conform to the requirements of sections 951 and 952 of the Penal Code; 3. That the facts stated do not constitute a public offense.\u201d The demurrer was overruled. Appellant was tried by a jury and convicted and was sentenced by the court to pay a fine of one hundred dollars. The appeal is from the judgment and an order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The charging part of the information is as follows: \u201cThe Palermo Land and Water Company, being at all times herein mentioned a corporation, duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, for the purpose of selling, distributing and renting water, and having water to sell, rent and distribute, did, on or about the first day of July, 1905, at Butte County, State of California, and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>filing of this information, wrongfully, unlawfully, willfully and maliciously refuse and fail to sell and deliver six inches of water to said William Hilemon for irrigating his orchard, after being tendered seventy-five cents payment in advance for one day\u2019s supply thereof, the said corporation having then and there water to sell, contrary to and in violation of the provisions of Ordinance No. 211, passed by the Board of Supervisors of Butte County, State of California, February 27, 1905, the orchard of the said William Hilemon being then and there within the limits of the unincorporated town of Oroville, in Butte County, State of California, and not within the limits of any incorporated town, city or village, contrary to the form, force and effect,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">Ordinance 211, upon which the prosecution was based, among other things provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201cSection 1. The rate or compensation to be collected by any person, company or corporation in the County of Butte for the use of water supplied to any unincorporated city or town, or the inhabitants thereof, is hereby fixed and established as follows: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201c29. For water used for irrigation or mining ditches, for irrigation of vineyards, orchards and similar uses, the rate shall not exceed 10 cents per inch, miner\u2019s measure, for day of twenty-four hours. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cSection 3. Any person, company or corporation having water to sell, who shall refuse to deliver water to any person tendering payment therefor, in advance, for one day\u2019s supply, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine <em>not exceeding $200.00, or by imprisonment in the County Jail not exceeding 100 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Among the grounds of demurrer, as already observed, is one involving the determination of the question of the jurisdiction of the superior court to try the offense charged against the appellant. The claim is made that it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the justice court to try offenses wherein the punishment \u201cdoes not exceed a fine of five hundred dollars or imprisonment not exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d In the present instance the maximum punishment provided by the ordinance is a \u201cfine of $200 and imprisonment for one hundred days in the county jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>To the consideration of this vital question of jurisdiction our attention will be directed. In the discussion it will be assumed that the ordinance in question is sufficiently pleaded, so that the court could take judicial notice of its terms. The jurisdiction of the superior court is conferred directly by the constitution of the state; that of the justice court arises from the act of the legislature. Section 5, article VI, of the constitution provides: \u201cThe Superior Court shall have original jurisdiction . . . <em>in all criminal cases </em>amounting to felony and cases of misdemeanor <em>not otherwise provided for.\u201d </em>The authority delegated to the legislature in respect to the jurisdiction of the justice court is found in section 11 of said article 6. The provision is: \u201cThe legislature shall determine the number of justices of the peace to be elected in townships, incorporated cities and towns, or cities and counties, and shall fix by law the powers, duties and responsibilities of justices of the peace; provided, such powers shall not in any case trench upon the jurisdiction of the several courts of record,\u201d etc. In consonance with this grant of power the legislature has clothed the justice court with jurisdiction over certain misdemeanors. The test and measure of its said jurisdiction are presented in section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, as follows: \u201cThe justices\u2019 courts shall have jurisdiction of the following public offenses committed within the respective counties in which such courts are established: . . . 3. Breaches of the peace, riots, routs, affrays, committing a willful injury to property, <em>and all misdemeanors </em>punishable by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d Therefore, it would seem that the misdemeanor of which appellant has been convicted is \u201cotherwise provided for,\u201d and not cognizable within the scope of the original jurisdiction of the superior court. The subject has received elaborate treatment from the supreme court on different occasions. If authority be needed to determine what seems so clear from the said provisions of the constitution and Code of Civil Procedure, reference may be made to the following cases: <em>Ex parte Wallingford, </em>60 Cal. 103; <em>Gafford </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>60 Cal. 149; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>78 Cal. 556, [21 Pac. 307, 541]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Joselyn, </em>80 Cal. 544, [22 Pac. 217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>82 Cal. 182, [22 Pac. 1120]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamberg, </em>84 Cal. 468, [24 Pac. 298]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tom Nop, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>124 Cal. 150, [56 Pac. 786]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haagen, </em>139 Cal. 115, [72 Pac. 836].</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\">The case at bar, however, is sought to be distinguished from the others on the ground that appellant is a corporation. In this behalf it is argued that the supreme court had jurisdiction to try defendant by virtue of the provisions of chapter IX, title X, part II, of the Penal Code, entitled, \u201cProceedings Against Corporations.\u201d In the first place, independent of said chapter, it is clear that as far as jurisdiction of the offense is concerned, it can make no difference whether the accused be a corporation or an individual. Section 7 of the Penal Code provides that the word \u201cperson\u201d includes a corporation as well as a natural person, and it would be judicial legislation to hold that \u201call misdemeanors\u201d mean \u201call misdemeanors committed by a natural person.\u201d There is no reasonable foundation in the nature of things or such intrinsic difference between corporations and natural persons, of which I am aware, that requires the application of a measure of jurisdiction over an offense committed by a corporation different from that to be invoked where an individual is charged with the same or similar crime. The general rule, in criminal cases, where corporations are amenable to the criminal law, when limited to the officers through whom the corporation performs its corporate acts, is the same as in civil cases. \u201cPrivate corporations in respect to their liability for the acts of their agents or servants stand before the law on the same footing as individuals.\u201d (10 Cyc. 1204, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Nor do the provisions of the Penal Code, sections 1390 to 1397, inclusive, cited by respondent, affect the question at issue. That chapter simply provides a mode of procedure against corporations charged with crime. It is well settled that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the offense is not determined by the form of procedure by which it is prosecuted, but by the nature of the offense itself.\u201d <em>(Ex parte Wallingford, </em>60 Cal. 103.) Even if it be conceded that the form of procedure provided is applicable only to cases tried in the superior court and that it seems to contemplate that all criminal charges against corporations shall be submitted to such tribunal, it still remains true that the test of jurisdiction afforded by the statute indubitably sustains appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In conclusion, it may be suggested that the procedure provided by section 1391 et seq. of the Penal Code may be made available to the justice court in the prosecution of corporations, although it must be remembered that the \u201cmeans by which the defendant has been brought within the jurisdiction of the court does not affect its right to try him.\u201d <em>(Ex parte Ah Men, </em>77 Cal. 198, [11 Am. St. Rep. 263, 19 Pac. 380]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>78 Cal. 345, [20 Pac. 731]; <em>Mahon </em>v. <em>Justice, </em>127 U. S. 708, [8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204].) If this procedure be not apt and adequate, then resort must be had to the sections of the code in reference to the trials of persons, and also to section 187, Cole of Civil Procedure, which provides that \u201cin the exercise of its jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by this code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">The judgment and order denying the motion for a new trial are reversed and the court below is directed to dismiss the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Hart, J., and Chipman, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on March 28, 1907, and the following opinion was then rendered thereon:</p>\n<author id=\"b754-6\">THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AtS\">The application that the above-entitled cause be heard and determined by this court, after decision in the district court of appeal for the third appellate district, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In denying the application, it is proper to state that section 1427 of the Penal Code, as amended in 1905 (Stats. 1905, p. 706), apparently furnishes a rule of procedure in the case of a corporation charged with a misdemeanor triable in a justice\u2019s court or police court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
