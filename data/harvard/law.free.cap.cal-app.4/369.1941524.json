But assuming that this is the case, the right of the plaintiffs to sue them in any county could exist only in a ease where they were the only defendants (Code Civ. Proe., sec. 395), and here it appears that there are two other defendants, Neumann and Oliver, both of whom are residents of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We may disregard, also, as a point that need not be decided, the claim of the appellants that under the provisions of article XII, section 16, of the constitution, these corporations have a right to a trial of the case in the city and county of San Francisco; and, on the other hand, the fictitious defendants named in the complaint may be disregarded as not being parties to the action, or, at least, as not being necessary or proper parties, or interested in the action. Of the remaining defendants, Oliver does not join in the <em>motion; </em>but it appears that he, as well as Neumann, the moving defendant, is a resident of the city and county of San Francisco. The case, therefore, comes directly within the decision in <em>Wood, Curtis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Herman Min. Co., </em>139 Cal. 713, [73 Pac. 588], where it is held that where all the defendants in an action are nonresidents of the county in which the action is brought, any of the defendants residing in another county are entitled to a change of the place of trial, notwithstanding the opposition of the other defendants; and upon the authority of this decision, the order appealed from must be reversed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
