In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>San Francisco &amp; H. B. R. R. Co., </em>41 Cal. 17, it is said: \u201cThe exercise of the mere discretion of the court ought to tend in a reasonable degree, at least, to bring about a judgment on the very merits of the case; and when the circumstances are such as to lead the court to hesitate upon the motion to open the default, it is better, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a general rule, that the doubt should be resolved in favor- of the application.\u201d (See, also, <em>Nicholl </em>v. <em>Weldon, </em>130 Cal. 666, [63 Pac. 63]; <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Black, </em>134 Cal. 125, [66 Pac. 197] ; <em>Wolf &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Pacific Ry., </em>89 Cal. 332, [26 Pac. 825] ; <em>Melde </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>129 Cal. 308, [61 Pac. 932] ; <em>Pelegrinelli </em>v. <em>McCloud River Lumber Co., </em>1 Cal. App. 593, [82 Pac. 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The record in the case at bar shows that after the filing of plaintiff\u2019s original complaint a demurrer thereto was filed, but before action thereon an amended demurrer was filed. This demurrer was sustained December 12, 1902, with leave to plaintiff to amend her complaint in ten days. Notice of the order sustaining the demurrer, with leave to amend the complaint, was served on the attorneys for plaintiff December 16, 1902. The affidavit of Robert W. Campbell, one of the attorneys for plaintiff, shows he is one of the firm of Campbell, Metson &amp; Campbell, the attorneys of record for plaintiff. That on the fifth day of December it was reported to him by one of the clerks of said firm that upon the calling of the demurrer for argument in the court in which the action was pending an amended demurrer was filed, argued and submitted upon briefs, five and five, plaintiff to submit first brief. Plaintiff thereafter, on December 10, 1902, served and filed her brief. On December 13th affiant noticed in the \u201cDaily Recorder,\u201d the official organ of the court, under the heading of \u201cYesterday\u2019s Proceedings, Department One of said Superior Court, Seawell, J.,\u201d the following: \u201c82661. Barling v. Weeks. Administrator etc., Dem. to complaint sustained, ten days to amend.\u201d That there was also in said \u201cRecorder\u201d of said date under the title of \u201cYesterday\u2019s Proceedings, Dept. 2, Murasky, J.,\u201d the following entry: \u201c21, Barling v. Weeks Adm. etc., Amd. dem. to compl. ordered off calendar.\u201d \u201cThat affiant, observing the above-mentioned entries in said \u2018Recorder\u2019 of said 13th day of December, 1902, and noticing the conflicting terms thereof, believed that an error had been committed. That thereafter, on the 15th day of December, 1902, affiant\u2019s belief was confirmed by the receipt of defendant\u2019s brief in support of demurrer, which was served on said firm on said 15th day of December. That thereafter, and on the 16th day of December, the said firm of Campbell, Metson &amp; Campbell received a copy of the notice of sustaining of the demurrer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>with ten days to amend, said notice specifying that said demurrer had been by the above-entitled court, Department No. 2 thereof, sustained. That affiant, believing that said notice was an error, and that it had been based upon what affiant believed to be an erroneous and incorrect entry in the \u2018Recorder\u2019 of said 13th day of December, caused inquiry and investigation to be made at the office of the County Clerk of the City and County of San Francisco, and on the 18th day of December requested Thomas A. Keogh, one of the clerks in the employ of said firm of Campbell, Metson &amp; Campbell, to make such inquiry and investigation. That said Thomas A. Keogh reported back to affiant that he had investigated the records in said cause, and made in the record book in the office of said firm the following entry: \u2018Barling v. Weeks, Demurrer sustained Dept. 2, December 17, 10 days to amend. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Affiant further stated that he believed the report of Keogh, and that it confirmed his former belief as to the error in the entry in said \u201cRecorder\u201d of December 13th, and he believed that the notice of the sustaining of the demurrer had been erroneously given. That he was also influenced in this belief by the additional fact that the amended demurrer had been submitted on December 5th upon briefs, whereas the entry in the \u201cRecorder\u201d with respect to the sustaining of the said demurrer, and also the notice received by affiant\u2019s firm, referred to the demurrer of defendant, and not to the amended demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The affidavit was accompanied by the usual affidavit of merit made by plaintiff, and by a verified amended complaint offered for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">From the foregoing facts we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in finding that the default was entered through the excusable mistake of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">It is further urged that the default should not have been opened, nor leave granted to file the amended complaint, because the same was not in furtherance of justice. The original complaint set forth an action to recover money paid by plaintiff as surety upon a note, although she did not appear to be such surety on the face of the note. The original complaint does not allege an assignment, indorsement or transfer of the note to plaintiff, but she sought to recover upon an implied assumpsit arising from the fact that as surety she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>had paid the note. A copy of the note is attached to the complaint, and it appears to be stamped \u201cPaid.\u201d A demurrer that the action was barred by section 339, subdivision 1, Code of Civil Procedure, was sustained, with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In the amended complaint it is alleged that the note was transferred and assigned to plaintiff, and she seeks to recover as the owner of the note. Upon this theory of her case the action is not barred by the above section, and it is not contended that the amended complaint does not state a cause of action. It is, however, insisted that the amended complaint is inconsistent with the facts set forth in the original, and therefore must be false and sham, and an order allowing the same to be filed would therefore not be in furtherance of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Upon this point much stress is laid upon the fact that the copy of the note set forth in the original complaint does not appear to be indorsed to plaintiff, but bears the stamp \u201cPaid\u201d upon its face. This may all be true, and yet the note may have been transferred and assigned to plaintiff. It may have been transferred and assigned by a separate instrument, and the fact that the note is stamped \u201cPaid\u201d is not conclusive on this point. The amended complaint is duly verified, and the motion was accompanied by an affidavit of merit, in which plaintiff stated that she had fully and fairly stated all the facts of the case to her counsel, and after such statement she was advised by them and believes that she has a good, true, legal and meritorious cause of action against defendant on its merits. We see no reason to hold that the trial court abused its discretion in opening the default or in allowing the amended complaint to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Cooper, J., and Harrison, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
