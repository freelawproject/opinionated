Accordingly, we vacate Defendant-Appellant Ernie Isomura\u2019s (Defendant) sentence of ten years of imprisonment and remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Following an accident in which Defendant\u2019s car struck and killed three tourist bicyclists on Molokai, Defendant was convicted by a jury of three counts of Negligent Homicide in the Third Degree, HRS \u00a7 707-704 (Supp. 1991), a misdemeanor; one count of Failure to Stop, HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) (1985), a felony; and one count of Storage of Opened Container Containing Intoxicating Liquor, HRS \u00a7 291-3.3 (Supp. 1991), a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The trial judge thereafter sentenced Defendant to a jail term of one year each for the three Negligent Homicide counts, and an indeterminate term of ten years of imprisonment for the Failure to Stop offense, all sentences to be served concurrently. The judge also imposed a $500 fine for the Storage of Opened Container Containing Intoxicating Liquor, count and permanently revoked Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Defendant filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court improperly applied HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) in sentencing him to a ten-year prison term for the Failure to Stop count. Defendant argues that the trial court should instead have sentenced him to a five-year term of imprisonment pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-610(2) (Supp. 1991) and 706-660 (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">When Defendant was indicted for the Failure to Stop offense onMay21,1990, HRS \u00a7 291 C-12(b) (1985)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided for penalties of a fine of \u201cnot more than $1,000 or imprison [ment of] not more than ten years, or both.\u201d However, HRS \u00a7 706-610(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Supp. 1991), part of the Hawai\u2018i Penal Code (Code), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">(2) A felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felony, except if another provision of law specifically defines a felony to be of a specified class as defined by this Code, such felony shall be treated for the purpose of sentence as provided by this chapter for that class of felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The maximum prison term for a class B felony is ten years and for a class C felony, five years. HRS \u00a7 706-660 (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Defendant essentially argues that: (1) an HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) Failure to Stop offense is clearly a felony as defined in HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u00a7 701-107(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> since a person convicted thereof may be sentenced, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b), to a prison term in excess of one year; (2) HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b), which defines the Failure to Stop offense as a felony, clearly is a statute outside the Code; (3) HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) does not fall within the HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) exception because it does not specifically define the Failure to Stop offense as a class A or class B felony; and (4) therefore, the Failure to Stop offense must be sentenced as a class C felony. For the reasons discussed below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">HRS \u00a7 291C-12 was enacted in 1971, Act 150, \u00a7 1, 1971 Haw. Sess. Laws 323, 327, 347, took effect on January 1, 1972, and was not amended substantively until 1992, when subsection (b) was amended to classify the Failure to Stop offense as a class B felony. <em>See </em>Act 243, \u00a7 4, 1992 Haw. Sess. Laws 642. HRS \u00a7 291C-12 was thus already on the books when the Hawai\u2018i Penal Code was adopted by the Legislature in 1972, to take effect on January 1, 1973. Act 9, 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In enacting the Code, the Legislature indicated that its purpose was to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">effect the first complete reorganization of the criminal law of the State of Hawai* i by a redefinition of criminal offenses, elimination of inconsistencies, modernization of language, logical rearrangement of the criminal provisions, and amendment of the substantive criminal laws. The [Code], originally drafted by the Committee on Penal Law Revision of the Judicial Council of Hawai\u2018i and a derivative of the Model Penal Code as recommended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the American Law Institute, is designed to update the criminal law and to ease the growing public feeling of dissatisfaction with a body of criminal law that is still largely uncodified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">House Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1 on H.B. No. 20, 1972 House Journal 1036, Senate Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1 on H.B. No. 20, 1972 Senate Journal 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The Legislature recognized, however, that even with the adoption of the Code, there would continue to be crimes defined by statutes outside the Code. The Legislature thus provided in HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of. law, a felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYLo\">The Commentary to HRS \u00a7 706-610, which, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-105 may be used as an aid in understanding the provisions of the Code, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Subsection (2) reduces to a class C felony, those felonies defined by a statute not within this Code. This reflects the \u201cjudgment that the [Penal] Code should deal at least with any area of criminality involving crimes so serious that classification as a [class A or class B] felony for sentence purposes is justified.\u201d [Quoting from the Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at 10-11 (1954)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Since HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) was derived from section 6.01(2) of the Model Penal Code, the following commentary on the section by the American Law Institute is also instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">Felonies Outside the Penal Code. Section 6.01(2) asserts that a felony defined in any statute not contained in the penal code shall be classified as a third degree felony \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d Two judgments underlie this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The first is that some control over the proliferation of statutory penalties in crimes created in other titles of the codified laws is clearly necessary in order to rectify and prevent recurrence of the chaotic condition that prevailed at the time the Model Code was drafted. The second is that any offense that deserves classification above the lowest category of felony should be processed through those committees of the legislature that have control of the penal law. Unless both principles are preserved, the integrity of the grading structure achieved by counterpart provisions to Section 6.01(1) is likely to be undermined, either by continuing expansion of the grading categories or by the introduction of inconsistencies in the relative gravity of offenses. Any offense that is serious enough to be classified in any but the lowest class of felony, in other words, should be subjected to rigorous examination by those charged with responsibility for the penal code in order to assure consistency with the principles underlying that code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Model Penal Code and Commentaries (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1962), Commentary at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The foregoing evinces a clear legislative intent that upon the adoption of the Code, offenses committed in violation of statutes outside the Code were to be punished as class C felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">HRS \u00a7 291C-12 predated and is outside the Code and continued substantively intact, after the Code\u2019s adoption until June 17, 1992. The Failure to Stop offense prohibited by HRS \u00a7 291C-12;is clearly a felony in view of its penalties and is not specifically classified as a class A or class B felony. Therefore, any violations of HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) that occurred prior to June 17, 1992 were clearly intended by the Legislature to be sentenced as class C felonies pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-610(2), which upon the Code\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>adoption, superseded the conflicting sentencing provision in HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The State maintains, however, that the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>68 Haw. 622, 725 P.2d 799 (1986), requires us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>Spencer, </em>the defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm in violation of HRS \u00a7 134-7(b). Because HRS \u00a7 134-7(f) provided that a felon who violated HRS \u00a7 134-7(b) was guilty of a class B felony, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a ten-year prison term. At that time, HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) provided that a felony defined by a statute outside the Code constituted a class C felony for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the defendant argued that the trial court should have imposed a five-year prison term for a class C felony. The supreme court, however, affirmed the trial court\u2019s sentence, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">Generally, where a specific and general statute overlap in their application, effect will be given to both if possible, since repeal by implication is disfavored. However, where there is a \u201cplainly irreconcilable\u201d conflict between a specific statute and a general statute governing the same subject matter the specific statute shall be favored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">68 Haw. at 624, 725 P.2d at 800 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\"><em>Spencer, </em>however, is clearly distinguishable from the instant situation. First of all, HRS \u00a7 134-7(f), which the <em>Spencer </em>court construed, specifically defined the firearms offense as a class B felony, thus placing it squarely in conflict with HRS \u00a7 706-610(2)\u2019s mandate that statutes outside the Code be sentenced as class C felonies. When Defendant committed the Failure to Stop offense in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>instant case, however, HRS \u00a7 291 C-12(b) did not specifically classify the offense as either a class A or class B felony, but instead vested considerable discretion in the trial court to sentence a defendant to prison for a term \u201cnot more than ten years.\u201d Moreover, unlike HRS \u00a7 291 C-12, which predated the Code, HRS \u00a7 134-7(f) was not enacted until 1981, after the effective date of the Code, <em>see </em>Act 239, \u00a7 5, 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws 462, 466, and thus, its conflict with HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) could be resolved in favor of the later legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Subsequent to the adoption of the Code, the Hawai\u2018i Legislature has indicated a willingness to retreat somewhat from the mandate of HRS \u00a7 706-610(2). In 1986, for example, the legislature amended HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">(2) [Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a] A felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felonvU. except if another provision of law specifically defines a felony to be of a specified class as defined bv this Code, such felony shall be treated for the purpose of sentence as provided bv this chapter for that class of felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Act 314, \u00a7 19, 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws 593, 603 (bracketed language deleted; new language underscored).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The reason for the amendment to HRS \u00a7 706-610 is explained in various legislative committee reports as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Senate Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 51-86, 1986 Senate Journal 747, 749; House Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 51-86, 1986 House Journal 937, 938; Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 820-86, 1986 Senate Journal 1168, 1170 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Under section 706-610, any felony defined outside of the penal code is designated as a class C felony. </em>The section has been amended to allow provisions enacted subsequent to 1973 to specifically designate crimes as class A or B felonies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The Legislature thus clearly recognized that felonies not contained in the Hawai\u2018i Penal Code were to be sentenced as class C felonies, and took steps to allow such felonies to be classified instead as class A or class B felonies for sentencing purposes. Indeed, just this year, the legislature amended HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) to make violations of HRS \u00a7 291 C-12(a) a class B felony. Act 243, 1992 Haw. Sess. Laws 642, 643. Therefore, beginning June 17, 1992,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the effective date of the amendment, persons convicted of the Failing to Stop offense are treated, for sentencing purposes, as class B offenders, and not class C offenders under HRS \u00a7 706-610(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that a violation of the pre-June 17, 1992 version of HRS \u00a7 291C-12 must be sentenced as a class C offense under HRS \u00a7 706-610(2). To ignore the mandate of HRS \u00a7 706-610(2), as the State urges us to do, would effectively nullify its provisions and render it meaningless. Such a construction would be inconsistent not only with the legislature\u2019s intent but also with the general rule that a statute should be interpreted to give it effect and to avoid a construction that would render it a vain legislative effort or a nullity. <em>Levy v. Kimball, </em>51 Haw. 540, 545, 465 P.2d 580, 583 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Accordingly, we vacate that part of the Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence, dated September 23,1991, whereby the Second Circuit Court sentenced Defendant to ten years of imprisonment for his conviction of Failure to Stop, a violation of HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00a7 291C \u2014 12(a) (Count 4), and remand this case for resentencing as a class C felony.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARY\"><em>Timothy E.

I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Commencing June 17, 1992, HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) expressly categorizes the felony proscribed by HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) as a class B felony. Prior thereto, and on May 21, 1990 when Defendant violated HRS \u00a7 291C-12(a) (1985), HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) did not express any alphabetical label for the crime. However, it expressly provided for \u201cimprison[ment of] not more than ten years[.]\u201d Since the maximum prison term for a class B felony is ten years whereas for a class C felony it is five years, HRS \u00a7 706-660 (Supp. 1991), the penalty expressly authorized by HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) was a class B penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Did HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b), prior to its amendment on June 17, 1991, specifically define HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b)\u2019s felony to be of a specified class as defined by HRS \u00a7 706-660? The majority\u2019s answer is no, because HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) did not then, as it does now, expressly state the alphabetical label \u201cB.\u201d My answer is yes because, when HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) specifically permitted imprisonment of not more than ten years, it thereby specifically defined the felony to be a class B felony. HRS \u00a7 706-610(2)\u2019s exception when the \u201cprovision of law specifically defines a felony to be of a specified class as defined by this Code\u201d unambiguously means more than \u201cspecifically states the alphabetical class\u201d or \u201cspecifically classifies as a class A or class B felony.\u201d There is no meaningful difference between a provision that the felony is a class B felony and a provision that the maximum prison term for the felony is ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In my view, the majority\u2019s decision invalidating HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b)\u2019s authorization of \u201cimprison[ment of] not more than ten years\u201d is, to quote the majority opinion, \u201cinconsistent not only with the legislature\u2019s intent but also with the general rule that a statute should be interpreted to give it effect and to avoid a construction that would render it a vain legislative effort or a nullity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Additionally, I disagree that <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>68 Haw. 622, 725 P.2d 799 (1986), is \u201cclearly distinguishable.\u201d When <em>Spencer </em>was decided and prior to January 1, 1987, HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) (1985) provided in its entirety as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felony.\u201d In other words, when <em>Spencer </em>was decided, HRS \u00a7 706-610(2) did not permit any exception. Despite such legislative mandate, the supreme court applied the rule that \u201cwhere there is a \u2018plainly irreconcilable\u2019 conflict between a specific statute and a general statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific statute will be favored,\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>68 Haw. at 624, 725 P.2d at 800 (citation omitted), and enforced HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) (1985) rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>than HRS \u00a7 706-610(2). The supreme court did not discuss the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 706-610(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">As an inferior court, if there is a \u201cplainly irreconcilable\u201d conflict between HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b) and HRS \u00a7 706-610(2), we are obligated to follow the rule in <em>Spencer </em>and favor HRS \u00a7 291C-12(b). <em>See Robinson v.
