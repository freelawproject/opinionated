Garcia (Defendant) appeals his conviction of Abuse of a Family or Household Member, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence at trial to conclude that he resided in the same dwelling unit as the complainant, a material element of the offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Defendant lived with his wife, brother, father, sister, and nephew in a three-bedroom house in Nanakuli. Connected to this \u201cmain house\u201d was a one-bedroom extension, where Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>son and daughter-in-law (Daughter-in-law) lived with their two children. Defendant was not on speaking terms with his son; therefore, while the two living quarters were connected, Defendant rarely set foot into his son\u2019s part of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On July 10,1991, during an argument involving various family members, Defendant stormed into his son\u2019s part of the house and hit Daughter-in-law, giving her a black eye. Daughter-in-law promptly called the police, who arrested Defendant and charged him with Abuse of a Family or Household Member, a violation of Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 709-906 (1985 and Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Following a jury-waived trial, the trial court convicted Defendant and sentenced him to serve two days in jail, attend domestic violence counseling, and remain in counseling until clinically discharged. Defendant\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">HRS \u00a7 709-906 (1985), which sets forth the offense of Abuse of Family and Household Members, provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family or household member, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cfamily or household member\u201d means spouses or former spouses, parents, children, and persons jointly residing or formerly residing in the same dwelling unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">At trial, it was undisputed that Defendant physically abused Daughter-in-law. The sole issue before the trial court was whether Defendant and Daughter-in-law resided in the same dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">It is Defendant\u2019s position on appeal that the trial court erroneously concluded that he and Daughter-in-law were \u201cresiding in the same dwelling unit.\u201d Defendant argues that he and Daughter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in-law lived in separate living quarters, with separate entrances accessed by separate keys. He further maintains that a curtain divided the two living quarters and there was minimal contact between the families living on either side of the curtain. Defendant thus urges us to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The term \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d for purposes of applying HRS \u00a7 709-906, is not defined. However, HRS \u00a7 1-14 (1985) requires that in the construction of statutes, \u201c[t]he words of a law are generally to be understood in their most known and usual signification, without attending so much to the literal and strictly grammatical construction of the words as to their general or popular us\u00e9 or meaning.\u201d As the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court explained in <em>In re Taxes of Johnson, </em>44 Haw. 519, 356 P.2d 1028 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">One of the primary rules in the construction of a statute is that the words used therein should be taken in their ordinary and popular signification, unless there is something in the statute requiring a different interpretation. This is really nothing more than a rule of common sense, for it must be supposed that the legislature, in enacting a statute, intended that the words used therein should be understood in the sense in which they are ordinarily and popularly understood by the people, for whose guidance and government the law was enacted, unless there is something in the statute showing that the words in question were used in some other sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">44 Haw. at 530, 356 P.2d at 1034 (quoting from <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment, </em>230 S.C. 440, 96 S.E.2d 456, 462 (1957) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The word \u201cdwelling\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 436 (2d Coll. ed. 1984). as \u201ca place to live in; residence; house; abode.\u201d The word \u201cunit\u201d has numerous definitions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>same dictionary. However, the only definition that has any significance when used in relation to the word \u201cdwelling\u201d is the following: \u201ca single residence, as an apartment, that is part of a complex [a rental <em>unit\\.\u201d Id. </em>at 1552. The term \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d as used in the context of HRS \u00a7 709-906, would thus be ordinarily and popularly understood by the general public to mean a single residence, house, abode, or place in which members of a family or household live together.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Factors which are relevant in determining whether members of a family or household are \u201cresiding in the same dwelling unit\u201d include: the layout of the dwelling unit; how different residents enter the dwelling unit or different parts thereof; who pays for the mortgage, rent, utilities, or other expenses of the dwelling unit; what common areas of the dwelling unit are shared; what the mailing addresses of the different occupants of the dwelling unit are; and whether there are separate phone numbers for different residents of the dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We therefore review the trial evidence in the. instant case ire light of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The testimony at trial revealed that the residence in question was owned by Defendant\u2019s sister, Jessie, and was originally a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>three-bedroom, single-house dwelling. However, an extension to the house was subsequently constructed, consisting of a bedroom, parlor, and bathroom. Daughter-in-law, her husband (Defendant\u2019s son), and their two children lived in the extension. Defendant, his brother, his father, his wife, Keno, his sister, Jessie, and Jessie\u2019s son lived in the main part of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The occupants of both parts of the house shared the same address and used the same mailbox. One water main, one electrical box, one water heater, and one phone number served both parts of the house. While Defendant paid the water and phone bills, Jessie paid for all of the other utilities. There is absolutely no evidence that Daughter-in-law or her husband paid any rent for use of the extension or that they contributed in any way to the expenses of maintaining the main part of the house or the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">There was evidence that a curtain served as a divider between Jessie\u2019s bedroom, which was in the main part of the house, and the parlor, which was in the extension. However, the curtain was always left wide open and Daughter-in-law and her children went over to the main part of the house \u201call the time.\u201d Transcript at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Although there was evidence that the extension and the main part of the house had separate entrances which could be accessed by separate keys, it is not clear that these keys opened different locks. When the trial court asked Daughter-in-law whether she and Defendant shared \u201cseparate or common entrance^],\u201d she responded: \u201cI can go into the other side and I can go out through my side.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The testimony at trial also revealed that the occupants of both parts of the house shared the same kitchen, the same food, and the same meals, although Daughter-in-law and her husband did not \u201csit down like a family to eat\u201d with Defendant and his wife. They ate \u201cwhenever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Officer Park, the investigating police officer, described the house as being a \u201csingle family dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. He also stated that during his investigation, Jessie, the owner of the house, told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>him that \u201cthey all live together in one house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. He further testified that he did not see any separate accommodations during his investigation and didn\u2019t recall seeing a curtain separating the two parts of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">On appeal of a conviction, \u201cthe test to ascertain the legal sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Tripp, </em>71 Haw. 479, 483, 795 P.2d 280, 283 (1990). \u201cEven if it could be said that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence tending to support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial court\u2019s determination will be upheld.\u201d <em>State v. Halmos, </em>70 Haw. 14, 16, 755 P.2d 1226, 1227 (1988). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201ccredible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a [person] of reasonable caution to reach a conclusion.\u201d <em>State v. Lima, </em>64 Haw. 470, 475, 643 P.2d 536, 539 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Measured against the foregoing standard, there is clearly substantial evidence to sustain Defendant\u2019s conviction and support the trial court\u2019s finding that Defendant was \u201cresiding in the same dwelling unit\u201d as Daughter-in-law. The occupants of both parts of the house were members of an extended family who lived together as a common household. The fact that Defendant and Daughter-in-law\u2019s husband did not get along and avoided each other did not create a boundary sufficient to divide the house into two distinct dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">To uphold Defendant\u2019s distinction and overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling would be clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies which the legislature sought to achieve when it expanded the protections of HRS \u00a7 709-906 to include family and household members residing in the same dwelling unit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">Your [Conference] Committee is concerned with effectively addressing and combatting family violence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The ramifications of family violence spread far beyond the confines of the family. Children who are the victims of or are witnesses to, violence learn to view it as accepted and normal behavior. They may perpetuate the violence as adults.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AuTB\"><em>Patsy M. Kim, </em>Deputy Public Defender, on the briefs for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AzY\"><em>Alexa D. M. Fujise, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Ian E. Cate, </em>Law Clerk, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">Presented with this problem, your Committee, upon further consideration, amended the bill to bro\u00e1den its applicability to family and household members. \u201cFamily and household members\u201d is defined in the bill as \u201cspouses, former spouses, parents, children, and persons jointly or formerly residing in the same dwelling unit.\u201d Your Committee believes that extending the protection of this criminal statute to family and household members will assist in mitigating family violence and its effect on the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Sen.

No. 15, in 1985 House Journal at 887-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the Judgment and Sentence of die Family Court of the First Circuit, filed on November 7, 1991.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> We note that the legislature has defined \u201cdwelling\u201d or \u201cdwelling unit\u201d for purposes of interpreting other statutes. For example, HRS \u00a7 708-800 (Supp. 1991) defines \u201cdwelling,\u201d in the context of chapter 708 of the Penal Code relating to offenses against property, as \u201ca building which is used or usually used by a person for lodging.\u201d Also, HRS \u00a7 521-8 (1985), which Defendant suggests is ahelpful \u201clegislative pronouncement as to the intended breadth of the term,\u201d defines \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d for purposes of construing the Residential Landlord Tenant Code, as \u201ca structure, or part of a structure, which is used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by one person or by two or more persons maintaining a common household, to the exclusion of all others.\u201d While neither ofthese definitions apply to Penal Code violations under HRS chapter 709, they are consistent with the ordinary and popular meaning of the term.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
