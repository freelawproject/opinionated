More specifically, Alvin appeals the April 17,1991 order denying his November 27, 1990 motion to suppress evidence. The question is whether the circuit court was right or wrong when it decided that the actions of the police, when they saw and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>took possession of the loaded semi-automatic handgun (Handgun I) from the car Alvin had been driving, did not constitute an illegal search and seizure. Our answer is that it was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In No. 15605, Defendant Glenn Jordan Sequin, Jr. (Glenn) appeals the circuit court\u2019s August 28, 1991 judgment convicting him of Count 2, Carrying Firearm on Person Without License, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 134 \u2014 9, - 17 (Supp. 1991). More specifically, Glenn appeals the April 17,1991 order denying his November 15, 1990 motion to suppress evidence of the loaded semi-automatic handgun (Handgun H) that Glenn tossed away after he was arrested and partially searched. The question is whether the circuit court was right or wrong when it decided that the police had probable cause to arrest Glenn for possession of Handgun I. Our answer is that it was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Since Alvin\u2019s appeal in No. 15620 and Glenn\u2019s appeal in No. 15605 arise from the same case and trial in the circuit court, both appeals were consolidated for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The circuit court\u2019s April 17, 1991 findings of fact have not been challenged. They state in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">1. On or about August 1, 1990 at approximately 12:45 a.m. Officer Zarriello of the Honolulu Police Department spotted the car of [Alvin] and [Glenn] (hereinafter Defendants), pass in front of his location at a speed which exceeded the posted speed limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">2. Thereafter, Officer Zarriello activated both his blue flashing lights and his headlights and proceeded after the Defendants\u2019 car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">3. The car however, did not stop and the Officer continued to chase the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">4. While chasing the car, the Officer noticed both the tax and safety emblems were expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>5. The Officer checked with dispatch and confirmed that the emblems were expired and also that the last registered owner was a Derrick Dyer of a Pearl City address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">6. At some point during the chase the [right front] passenger stuck his hand out of the window and appeared to gesture to the Officer [to follow].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">7. Officer Zarriello continued to follow the car and activated his siren in an attempt to stop the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">8. At Holt and Makau Streets, Officer Zarriello observed the car run through the posted stop sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">9. At about that time the Officer activated his siren and left it on in a further attempt to get the car to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">10. The car finally stopped after pulling into a driveway at 84-049 Lawai\u2019a Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">11. After the car stopped, the driver, [Alvin] and the two passengers one of who[m] was [Glenn] voluntarily and quickly exited the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">12. Based upon what the Officer had observed up until that point and suspecting the car may have been stolen, he ordered the three to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">15. [Alvin\u2019s] only explanation of his conduct was that he did not want to stop; he was running out of gas and wanted to get to his uncle\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">16. The Officer subsequently arrested [Alvin] for the various traffic and vehicle documentation offenses/ violations as the lat[t]er could not provide the Officer with any of the documentation he requested to wit; a valid Hawai\u2018i driver\u2019s license, no-fault documents and/ or current registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-15\">17. Officer Zarriello\u2019s suspicions were now heightened as a result of [Alvin\u2019s] explanation for his refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>stop, his inability to produce documentation as to the ownership of the car and the fact that he too had no identification. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">18. The Officer proceeded to the passenger side of the car, and with the aid of his flashlight looked through the opened window and saw what he believed to be the butt end of a handgun [Handgun I] sticking out from under the driver\u2019 [sic] seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">19. The Officer then proceeded around to the driver\u2019s side of the car and confirmed that what he saw was indeed the butt end of a semi-automatic handgun [Handgun I] and retrieved the same from the unlocked car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">20. . . . [A]ll three occupants of the car were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">21. While performing a limited post arrest pat down of [Glenn] for weapons or instrumentalities of escape the lat[t]er protested of pain from an alleged dislocated left shoulder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">22. As a result, the Officer limited his search in an attempt not to cause any undue pain or discomfort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">23. Officer Zarriello next began to pat down the passenger and while doing so he saw [Glenn] toss a small black object away from where he was seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">24. Officer Zarriello searched for and found the object he saw [Glenn] toss away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">25. The object turned out to be a loaded semiautomatic handgun [Handgun II].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">26. [Glenn] was then arrested for being in possession of a loaded firearm and as an incident thereto admitted to having found the firearm and intended first to show it to his uncle as opposed to immediately turning the same over to the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The findings do not mention the following relevant facts in the record on appeal: The car was a two-door Chevy Nova (Nova); Officer Zarriello knew Charles Stevens; Charles Stevens was the driver \u2019 s uncle and the passenger in the right front seat; Glenn was a passenger in the right rear seat; Alvin stated that the Nova was Alvin\u2019s car; when the three exited the car, they closed its doors; and Handgun I was loaded with a chambered round and a magazine containing thirteen rounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">APPEAL NO. 15620</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Alvin appeals his conviction on Count 3, Place to Keep Firearm Loaded With Ammunition, HRS \u00a7 134-6(c) (Supp. 1991). That subsection makes it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">unlawful for any person on any public highway to carry on the person, or to have in the person\u2019s possession, or to carry in a vehicle any firearm loaded with ammunition; provided that the provision of this paragraph shall not apply to any person who has in the person\u2019s possession or carries a pistol or revolver and ammunition therefor in accordance with a license issued as provided in section 134-9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Alvin contends that the police conducted an unlawful search and seizure when the police officer, with the aid of a flashlight, looked through the open car window, observed Handgun I, and seized it from the unlocked car. We disagree. There was no search because Handgun I was in open view, and the seizure of Handgun I was lawful because exigent circumstances authorized the seizure. <em>State v. Kapoi, </em>64 Haw. 130, 140-42, 637 P.2d 1105, 1113-14 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">APPEAL NO. 15605</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The investigative stop/temporary detention of Glenn after he exited the car has not been challenged. Although Glenn was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>arrested and charged in Count 1 for his connection with Handgun I, he was convicted only on Count 2 for his connection with Handgun II.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Glenn contends that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him for Handgun I, the unlawful arrest led to the unlawful search of his person, his abandonment of Handgun II was a reasonable response to the unlawful arrest and search, and th\u00e9 evidence of Handgun II was the fruit of a poisonous tree which must be suppressed upon proper request. <em>State v. Pau\u2018u, </em>72 Haw. 505, 824 P.2d 833 (1992); <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>758 S.W.2d 255 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">HRS \u00a7 803-5 (1985) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">By police officer without warrant, (a) A police officer or other officer of justice, may, without warrant, arrest and detain for examination any person when the officer has probable cause to believe that such person has committed any offense, whether in the officer\u2019s presence or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">(b) For purposes of this section, a police officer has probable cause to make an arrest when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge and of which the officer has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that a crime has been or is being committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">In other words, \u201c[pjrobable cause exists when the facts and circumstances known to the officer, or of which [the officer] had reasonably trustworthy information, would warrant [an officer] of reasonable caution to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. 333, 335, 568 P.2d 1207, 1209-10 (1977) (citations omitted). Thus, the applicable standard is not the more probable than not standard and a <em>prima facie </em>case is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Moreover, a person can violate HRS \u00a7 134-6(c) either as a principal or as an accomplice. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 702-221 and-222 (1985) provide in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u00a7702-221 Liability for conduct of another. (1) A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">(2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">(c) He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u00a7 702-222 Liability for conduct of another; complicity. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">(1) With the intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">(b) Aids or agrees or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">The dispositive question is whether, in light of the facts known to the police at the time of the arrest, the police reasonably believed that the passenger seated in the right rear seat violated HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 6(c) either as a principal or accomplice. Our answer is yes. The combination of the following facts was significant: the time of night; the Nova\u2019s speeding; the Nova\u2019s expired tax and safety emblems; the time and distance it took for the Nova to stop in response to the activation of the blue lights of the officer\u2019s car and the subsequent activation of its siren; the stopping of the Nova in the driveway of a residence; the voluntary immediate and quick exit from the Nova by all three adults in it; the driver\u2019s explanation of why he did not stop the Nova immediately when signaled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>officer; the name given by the driver of the Nova was not the name of its registered owner; the driver\u2019s inability to produce personal identification, driver\u2019s license, insurance card, and vehicle registration; the driver\u2019s statement that the Nova was his; the officer\u2019s open-view discovery of Handgun I partially under the driver\u2019s seat of the Nova; and the officer\u2019s observation that the car had only two doors, thus requiring a rear seat passenger to enter the car through a front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">As previously noted, HRS \u00a7 134~6(c) makes it unlawful for any person on any public highway (1) to carry on the person, (2) to have in the person\u2019s possession, or (3) to carry in a vehicle any firearm loaded with ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Under the facts of this case, prohibition 1 is not relevant. Prohibition 2 is relevant. The question is whether Handgun I was in Glenn\u2019s actual or constructive possession. Prohibition 3 may be relevant because of Glenn\u2019s connection with Alvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In New York, there is a statutory permissive presumption that weapons and other specified items present in a vehicle are in the possession of all persons occupying such vehicle at the time such items are found. <em>See </em>N.Y. Controlled Substances and Offenses Law \u00a7 220.25 (McKinney 1992); N.Y. Firearms and Other Dangerous Weapons Law \u00a7 265.15 (McKinney 1992). This presumption is federally constitutional. <em>Ulster County Ct. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d <em>111 </em>(1979). Hawaii, however, does not have a similar statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1163 (6th ed. 1990) defines possession in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">The law, in general, recognizes two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession. A person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing, at a given time, is then in actual possession of it. A person who, although not .in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Thus, in <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>State, </em>350 So. 2d 753 (Ala. Crim. App. 1977), the court concluded that an unloaded .32 caliber pistol found hidden under the center arm rest of the front seat of a 1973 Oldsmobile provided the police with probable cause to arrest the passenger who was sitting in the right front seat for the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. The court concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the passenger had constructive possession of the pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Likewise, in <em>People v. Thompson, </em>215 Ill. App. 3d 514, 575 N.E.2d 256 (1991), the court concluded that a loaded .38-caliber automatic handgun found under the front passenger seat of a car provided the police with probable cause to arrest both persons seated on the rear passenger seat for the crime of the unlawful use of a weapon. The police had probable cause to arrest both notwithstanding the fact that one said that the gun was his. The crucial fact was the weapon\u2019s \u201cproximity to the accused as to lie within easy reach so that the weapon is readily available for use[.]\u201d 215 Ill. App. 3d at 519, 575 N.E.2d at 259 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The facts in Glenn\u2019s case, combined with Hawaii\u2019s statutory definition of probable cause, provide a firmer basis for affirmance in Glenn\u2019s case than existed in <em>Braxton </em>and <em>Thompson. </em>We conclude that, in view of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Handgun I, the police reasonably believed that Glenn had violated HRS \u00a7 134-6(c) as a principal and/or accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Accordingly, in No. 15620 we affirm the August 28, 1991 judgment convicting Defendant Alvin Mark Sequin of Counts 3, 4,6, 7, 8, 9, and 11; and in No. 15605 we affirm the August 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>1991 judgment convicting Defendant Glenn Jordan Sequin, Jr., of Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">Appeal No. 15605</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-G\"><em>Jonathan J.

However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s disposition of the appeal of Glenn Jordan Sequin (Glenn). In my view, the circumstances known to the arresting officer were not sufficient to support a reasonable belief that Glenn was either in constructive possession of the handgun in this case or was an accomplice in Alvin\u2019s possession. With all due regard for the plethora of guns in our community and the multitude of gun-related crimes being committed, it is nevertheless my view that the law requires that probable cause be grounded on more than the evidence produced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The question is whether it was reasonable for the arresting officer to infer from the fact that he found a gun under Alvin\u2019s seat that Glenn knew the gun was there and therefore was either in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>constructive possession of the gun or an accomplice in Alvin\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In the absence of direct evidence that a passenger in a car where the police found a gun knew that the gun was there, other-courts have used the passenger\u2019s close proximity to the gun to show constructive possession. <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>State, </em>350 So. 2d 753 (Ala. Cr. App. 1977), and <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>215 Ill. App. 3d 514, 575 N.E.2d 256 (1991), cited by the majority, illustrate the rationale of those courts. In <em>Braxton, </em>the gun was located under an armrest situated on the front seat between the driver and the passenger. The Alabama court held there was probable cause to believe that the passenger had constructive possession of the gun. In <em>Thompson, </em>the gun was found under the front passenger seat. There was contradictory evidence as to where on the rear seat the appellant in that case was seated; the appellant maintained that he was seated on the passenger\u2019s side of the rear seat. The Illinois court held that regardless of the location of the appellant in the rear seat, the fact that the gun was in such \u201cproximity to the accused as to lie within easy reach so that the weapon is readily available for use\u201d was sufficient to establish probable cause for appellant\u2019s arrest. As I will discuss later, <em>Braxton </em>is a clearer case than <em>Thompson. </em>Nevertheless, <em>Braxton </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. Neither case supports the inference of knowledge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">I am not convinced that proximity gives such ready access from which one may infer constructive possession in all cases. For example, anyone who has attempted to retrieve something from under the front seat of a car while seated in the back seat can attest to the fact that, unless the object is located under the rear of the front seat, the object is not within easy reach and, therefore, is not readily available for use. For that same passenger to retrieve that same object from under the forward portion of the front seat is even more difficult, even in a small car like a Ford Pinto. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>smaller car, with its tighter quarters, might even make the attempt more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">I am, of course, aware that we are dealing here only with the question of probable cause. It would for that reason be easy to say that even though the evidence in this case might not be sufficient to convict Glenn of possession of the handgun in question, there was enough to support a reasonable belief that Glenn was in constructive possession of the handgun and, therefore, his arrest was legal. However, I would require more than was shown in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We must bear in mind that probable cause is more than a phrase developed to support an arrest; it is an important curb on excessive police intrusion into a person\u2019s liberty. Without more evidence than was produced in this case, the police are at liberty to arrest with impunity all passengers in a car where a gun was found, regardless of the circumstances of their presence or their actual knowledge of the gun\u2019s presence. In my view, that affords the police too much latitude and improperly places the burden on every such person to prove his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Although the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Brighter, </em>61 Haw. 99, 595 P.2d 1072 (1979), deals with the presence of narcotics in a car and the inference as to possession that may be drawn therefrom, I believe that the decision in that case is illustrative of the kind of evidence that should be required in the case at hand and other cases like it. In <em>Brighter, </em>the defendant was charged with the possession of marijuana found in a shopping bag on the back seat of the car that defendant was driving, after he had been stopped for a traffic violation. At trial, the defendant denied any knowledge of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The prosecution in <em>Brighter </em>relied on Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7712 \u2014 1251(1) (1976) to prove possession. The statute provided (and still provides) that, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, the presence of a dangerous, detrimental, or harmful drug in a motor vehicle is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of knowing posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>sion of such drug by everyone occupying the vehicle when the drug was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In <em>Brighter, </em>however, the supreme court limited the broad reach of the statute. The court stated that the statute created a permissive inference of possession which may only be authorized in accordance with due process \u201cif there is a natural and rational evidentiary relation between the facts proven and the ultimate fact which the statute authorizes to be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>61 Haw. at 103, 595 P.2d at 1075. The supreme court held that the statutory inference could only be applied when the quantity of drugs found in the car was sufficiently large as to constitute dealership quantity. The rationale of <em>Brighter </em>is that the occupants of a car can be presumed to be in possession of drugs found in a vehicle when the quantity of the drugs makes it extremely unlikely that the occupants were unaware of its presence. <em>Id. </em>61 Haw. at 108, 595 P.2d at 1078. The rationale of the court in <em>Brighter </em>is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In my view, due process requires that there be something in the circumstances under which a handgun is found in a car by a police officer which forms a natural and rational relation to a belief that all the passengers in the car were in possession of the handgun because it is extremely unlikely that they, or at least the person charged with constructive possession, did not know the gun was there. Thus, if the evidence in this case showed that the gun was a large one or could easily be seen from Glenn\u2019s vantage point in the car, or that the gun was situated so that it in fact was within Glenn\u2019s easy reach, I would readily agree that one could reasonably infer that Glenn was not likely to be unaware of it, and, therefore, he was in constructive possession of the gun. However, there is no such evidence in this case. We simply do not know where under the front seat the gun was located. I deem it significant that from his vantage point the officer saw only the butt end of the handgun. He had to go to the driver\u2019s side to confirm that it was a handgun. I find it difficult to make the necessary rational connection between those facts and the fact of Glenn\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Braxton </em>is an example of the application of the principle I would apply from <em>Brighter. </em>However, <em>Braxton </em>is distinguishable from this case, because the location of the gun under the armrest between the driver and the passenger rationally leads to the inference that it was likely that the passenger knew the gun was there. The evidence in <em>Thompson </em>is similar to the evidence in this case and, in my view, does not support the inference of constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The inference that Glenn was Alvin\u2019s accomplice in the possession of the gun is equally as tenuous as the inference of knowledge discussed above. There is simply no natural or rational connection between the facts proven and the fact sought to be proved, <em>i.e., </em>that Glenn was Alvin\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">I would hold that Glenn was illegally arrested and the evidence of the gun that he threw away should have been suppressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
