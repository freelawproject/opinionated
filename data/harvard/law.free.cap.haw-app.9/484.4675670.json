We hold that it was not and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Danielson\u2019s petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">On August 25, 1991, Danielson was arrested for DUI. He refused to submit to a breath or blood test after being informed of the sanctions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Pursuant to Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 286-258 (Supp. 1992), Danielson\u2019s driver\u2019s license was administratively revoked for a period of one year from September 25,1991 to September 25, 1992. Danielson timely requested an administrative hearing. At a hearing held on October 11,1991, the hearing officer affirmed the license revocation. The hearing officer\u2019s written decision (Hearing Decision) was mailed to Danielson on October 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On November 15, 1991, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 286-260(a) (Supp. 1992), Danielson filed a petition for judicial review in the District Court of the First Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On December 3, 1991, the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>filed its \u201cOrder Dismissing Appeal.\u201d The order stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Because [Danielson] failed to file his Petition within thirty days of the mailing of the hearing decision, the court does not have jurisdiction to review the administrative decision, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Pursuant to his <em>ex parte </em>motion to extend time, Danielson obtained an order from the district court extending the time to file a notice of appeal. Danielson filed his notice of appeal within the extended period of time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">HRS \u00a7 286-260(a) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">(a) If the director sustains the administrative revocation after administrative hearing, the arrestee may file a petition for judicial review <em>within thirty days after the administrative hearing decision is mailed. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Here, the Hearing Decision was mailed to Danielson on October 15,1991. Danielson filed his petition for judicial review on November 15,1991. The filing occurred thirty-one days after the Hearing Decision was mailed. Consequently, Danielson\u2019s petition was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">However, Danielson states that District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 72(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cmimics the thirty-day filing requirement\u201d of HRS \u00a7 286-260(a). Danielson calls our attention to DCRCP Rule 6(e) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">(e) Additional Time After Service by Mail. Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice of paper is served upon him by mail, two days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Danielson then asserts that, since the Hearing Decision was served on him by mail, he had thirty-two days to file his petition for judicial review. Therefore, he urges us that his petition was timely filed on the thirty-first day. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The HawaiM Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[w]here the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous that a specific time provision must be met, it is mandatory and not merely directory.\u201d <em>State v. Himuro, </em>70 Haw. 103, 105, 761 P.2d 1148, 1149 (1988). The court also stated that \u201c[i]n determining whether a statute is mandatoiy or directory, the intent of the legislature must.be ascertained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>HRS \u00a7 286-260(a) plainly and unambiguously provides for the filing of a petition for judicial review \u201cwithin thirty days after the administrative hearing decision is mailed.\u201d Recently, in <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Tanaka, 9 </em>Haw. App. 396, 843 P.2d 145 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>74 Haw. 651, 845 P.2d 1193 (1993), we had occasion to ascertain the legislative intent of the Administrative Revocation of Driver\u2019s License Law, Part XIV of HRS Chapter 286 (Supp. 1992). We found that the legislature desired that the driver\u2019s license revocation process be \u201cexpeditious,\u201d that the law be administered \u201cproperly and quickly,\u201d and that \u201cany lengthy delays in the hearing process\u201d is not to be tolerated. <em>Id. </em>at 404-05, 843 P.2d at 149. We deduce therefrom that the legislature likewise desired that any judicial review of the administrative license revocation be expeditious and without delay. We conclude that the time restraint of HRS \u00a7 286-260(a) is legislatively intended to be mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We do not believe that DCRCP Rule 6(e) is applicable to enlarge the thirty-day filing requirement under HRS \u00a7 286-260(a) for two reasons. First, the legislative intent that a judicial review of the administrative license revocation decision be expeditious and without delay militates against time enlargement. Second, the legislature did not intend that the time period be computed in accordance with DCRCP Rule 6. This is evident from Part XIV\u2019s inclusion of HRS \u00a7 286-266 (Supp. 1992)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> regarding computation of time, which is covered in DCRCP Rule 6(a), and Part XIV\u2019s non-inclusion of the contents of DCRCP Rule 6(e) in Part XTV.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that Danielson\u2019s petition for judicial review, filed on the thirty-first day after the mailing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Hearing Decision, was untimely. Therefore, lacking jurisdiction, the district court properly dismissed Danielson\u2019s petition for judicial review. <em>See Romans v. Director of Revenue, </em>783 S.W.2d 894 (Mo. 1990) (trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a petition for review not filed within thirty days of the notice of administrative revocation of driver\u2019s license for refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine blood alcohol content).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoKc\"><em>Richard Crisman Lindstrom </em>and <em>Lloyd A.
