The notice of entry of this order was filed with the Third Circuit Court on July 30, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Salazar filed an appeal from the order on August 16, 1990. However, Budget\u2019s counsel convinced Salazar\u2019s attorney that the notice of appeal was premature because there were other parties and claims remaining. Consequently, Salazar\u2019s attorney withdrew the notice of appeal on August 23,1990. The case then sat for over a year until Salazar, on November 1,1991, filed a \u201cMotion to Stay C\u00e1se and for Entry of Final Judgment as to Plaintiff Budget Rent-A-Car and Defendant Aaron Salazar.\u201d The motion was never heard, however, because the parties executed a \u201cStipulation to Stay Case and for Entry of Final Judgment; Order,\u201d which was approved and entered by the Third Circuit Court on December 30, 1991. This stipulation and order provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">That the parties stipulate and agree that final judgment be entered against Defendant/Third-Party AARON SALAZAR, and in favor of Plaintiff BUDGET RENT-A-CAR SYSTEMS, INC., pursuant to the Order granting Plaintiff BUDGET RENT-A-CAR SYSTEMS, INC.[\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment filed herein on July 23, 1990, and that the case be dismissed as between the parties hereto. The parties further stipulate that the Defendant/ Third-Party Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Stay Case And For Entry of Final Judgment as-To Plaintiff Budget Rent-A-Car and Defendant Aaron Salazar shall be withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A7r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>James Ireijo </em>on the briefs for defendant-appellant/third-party plaintiff-appellant Aaron Salazar.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A0m-\"><em>Craig K.

Furthermore, the filing of a tardy notice of appeal \u201cis a jurisdictional defect which can neither be waived by the parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d <em>Naki </em>v. <em>Hawai'ian Elec. Co., </em>50 Haw. 85-86, 431 P.2d 943-44 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The car accident occurred on May 11,1988. On that date, Defendant Aaron Salazar (Salazar), a passenger in a car owned by Budget and driven by his girlfriend, Main, got into an argument with Main and grabbed the steering wheel, causing her to lose control of the car, run off the road, and seriously injure him. Budget had rented the car to Donna Pua (Pua), Main\u2019s sister, and by the terms of the rental agreement, only Pua, Adan Rodrigues, and certain individuals specifically described in the agreement were authorized to drive the car. It is undisputed that at the time of the accident, Main had not gotten permission from either Pua or Budget to drive the car, and did not qualify as an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d under the terms of the rental agreement. Because Budget\u2019s rental agreement with Pua clearly stated that it had no liability for any injury or damages caused by an unauthorized driver of its rental cars, Budget filed the instant action, seeking a declaratory judgment ruling that it had no duty to indemnify or defend Main. Salazar argued before the trial court, however, that the general scheme of Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault law should supersede a contractual provision which precludes coverage to \u201can unauthorized driver when an innocent third-party is seriously injured and seeks damages against such an unauthorized driver.\u201d In the alternative, Salazar asked that such a contractual provision be declared invalid as against public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
