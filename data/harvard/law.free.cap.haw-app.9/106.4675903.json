(HIC), a Hawai\u2018i corporation, andH. E. \u201cBud\u201d Shasteen (Shasteen), HIC\u2019s president and owner, appeal the circuit court\u2019s December 14,1990judgment as to Defendants H. E. \u201cBud\u201d Shasteen and Hawaiian Improvement Corp. (December 14, 1990 Judgment). Shasteen and HIC contend that the evidence does not support the conclusion in the December 14, 1990 Judgment that they violated Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 480-2 (Supp. 1990) four times. We conclude that the evidence supports the conclusion in the December 14, 1990 Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Plaintiff State of Hawai\u2018i Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) cross-appeals, contending that the circuit court erred (1) in levying civil penalties against Shasteen and HIC \u201cjointly\u201d instead of \u201cindividually\u201d and (2) in failing to conclude that Shasteen and HIC violated HRS \u00a7 480-2 thirty-four or more additional times and to impose civil fines on Shasteen and HIC for these additional violations. We agree with contention (1) and disagree with contention (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">HRS \u00a7 480-2 prohibits \u201c[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce[.]\u201d On March 14, 1988, OCP filed a complaint against HIC and Shasteen. The complaint alleged that:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">1. On October 6, 1986, Shasteen and HIC published the following advertisement in the Honolulu Advertiser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>PUBLIC WARNING: BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU &amp; CONSUMER PROTECTION ADVISE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Get Bids before you buy anything; Especially Siding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">I can save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Salesmen make big commissions, you deal directly with me \u2014 the president &amp; owner \u2014 no salesman involved. Guaranteed superior siding from the oldest contractor in Hawai\u2018i and <em>lowest prices.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">You won\u2019t know unless you have other prices. Please get other bids, <em>then </em>call me. I\u2019ll guarantee the lowest price or I\u2019ll pay $200.00 towards the purchase of siding from any other contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">H.E. \u201cBud\u201d SHASTEEN (SIGNED) \u201cVINYL IS FINAL\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">PRESIDENT HAWAI'IAN IMPROVEMENT CORP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">GENERAL CONTRACTOR\u2019S LIC.

Essentially the same advertisement was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on June 26, 1987; and</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">3. On March 2 and 4, 1988, Shasteen and HIC broadcast a television commercial, the audio portion of which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">Announcer: Public Warning. Better Business Bureau and Consumer Protection advise get bids before buying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">Shasteen: Would you throw a thousand dollars away? Two thousand? Many will do this when buying siding. Get bids then call me. My guarantee, the lowest price when siding your house or I\u2019ll pay $200 toward the purchase of siding from any other contractor. I\u2019ll save you money. Guaranteed. Also free dinner at Shasteen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>restaurant. Call Bud Shasteen Vinyl is Final at 537-2886.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The complaint prayed for an injunction and a $10,000 civil f\u00edne against each defendant for each violation of HRS \u00a7 480-2. During the trial, and without objection, OCP introduced evidence of thirty-four or more other publication violations in addition to the four alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">On September 4, 1990, immediately after closing arguments, the circuit court commented on the evidence of the other thirty-four or more advertisements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">THE COURT: The Court has mentioned the fact and questioned [OCP] as to whether or not there are forty-three different offenses alleged in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">I told you it was your case, do what you want. No real motion was made. So the Court is only going to consider four violations that occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The circuit court orally ruled in favor of OCP, granted an injunction, and imposed civil fines of $500 for the October 6, 1986 advertisement and $2,000 for the June 26, 1987 and the March 2 and 4, 1988 advertisements because they occurred after OCP\u2019s November 17, 1986 cease and desist letter. The total fine was $6,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">On September 21, 1990, the circuit court orally denied OCP\u2019s September 17, 1990 post-oral decision motion to amend its pleadings to conform to the evidence by adding and seeking civil penalties for thirty-four additional advertisements. On November 19, 1990, the circuit court entered its Order Denying Plaintiff State of Hawaii\u2019s Motion to Amend Pleadings to Conform to Evidence at Trial and to Reconsider Oral Findings and Conclusions Filed September 17, 1990 (November 19, 1990 Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">The circuit court entered its Findings of Fact (FOF) and Conclusions of Law (COL) on October 31, 1990. COL Nos. 3 and 5 state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>3. The Court on two separate occasions prior to rendering its oral judgment called [OCP\u2019s] attention to the fact that its pleading was less than the evidence presented and [OCP] neglected to amend its pleading despite the admonition of the Court and only after the rendition of the oral judgment did it move to amend its pleading to conform to the evidence therefore [OCP] is estopped from amending its pleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">5. Shasteen and HIC were each engaged in unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of Secs. 480-2 and 481-3(a) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The circuit court\u2019s December 14, 1990 Judgment concluded that Shasteen and HIC \u201care jointly and severally liable to [OCP] for civil penalties pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 480-3.1 in the amount of $6,500.00\u201d and permanently enjoined Shasteen and HIC from publishing advertisements that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">a. Cause the likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding that a governmental agency or organization has issued a public warning, when none was issued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">b. Cause the likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding that a government agency or organization has endorsed or sponsored [Shasteen and HIC], when none had;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">c. Cause the likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding that a governmental agency or organization was affiliated, connected or associated with [Shasteen and HIC], when that was not true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">d. Falsely represent that a governmental agency or organization is the source of or has sponsored [Shasteen\u2019s and HIC\u2019s] advertisement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">e. Represent [Shasteen and HIC] as the \u201coldest contractor,\u201d when [Shasteen and HIC] are not the \u201coldest contractor,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>f. Make any false or misleading representations of fact regarding any industry, group or company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In their appeal, Shasteen and HIC challenge twenty-four of the circuit court\u2019s thirty-four FOF and seven of the court\u2019s nine COL and essentially contend that their advertisements did not violate HRS \u00a7 480-2 (Supp. 1990) and \u00a7 481A-3(a) (1985). Upon a review of the record, we conclude that the challenged FOF are not clearly erroneous and that the FOF validate the challenged COL. Therefore, we conclude that Shasteen\u2019s and HIC\u2019s appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">In its cross-appeal, OCP contends that the other thirty-four or more publication violations were tried with the implied consent of the parties and, therefore, the circuit court violated Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 15(b) when it entered its November 19, 1990 Order. In OCP\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">[t]he lower court should have determined whether there had been an express or implied consent to try the issues which had not been raised in the pleadings. The relevant evidence had been received by the court without objection and the court was required to find consent. Once consent was found, the court was required to make findings on the additional violations. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">The question is whether the issue of Shasteen\u2019s and HIC\u2019s liability to be civilly fined for each of the thirty-four or more additional violations was tried with the implied consent of the parties. The answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Hamm v. Merrick, </em>61 Haw. 470, 605 P.2d 499 (1980), is authority for the general rule that consent to litigate issues not raised by the pleadings will be implied from the failure to object to the introduction of evidence relevant to the unpleaded issues. In this case, however, OCP\u2019s introduction of the evidence of the thirty-four or more additional violations was insufficient to prove OCP\u2019s implied consent to litigate the issue of Shasteen\u2019s and HIC\u2019s liability for civil fines for those additional violations. OCP has not disagreed with or challenged the circuit court\u2019s statement that it expressly \u201cquestioned [OCP] as to whether or not there are forty-three different offenses alleged in the complaint\u201d and OCP did not respond. Under those circumstances, it cannot be implied that OCP\u2019s answer was yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">OCP also contends that the circuit court violated HRS \u00a7 480-3.1 (Supp. 1990) when it ordered Shasteen and HIC to bear joint and several liability for one civil fine, rather than ordering Shasteen and HIC to each bear separate liability for separate civil fines. We agree with OCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">HRS \u00a7 480-3.1 (Supp. 1990) states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">Civil Penalty. Any person, firm, company, association, or corporation violating any of the provisions of section 480-2 shall be fined a sum of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 for each violation!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The question is, when a court determines that a person, while acting on behalf of a corporation owned and operated by that person, violated HRS \u00a7 480-2 each time that person caused the publication of the corporation\u2019s newspaper and television advertisements, does HRS \u00a7 480-3.1 allow the circuit court the discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>impose for each violation one fine jointly and severally payable by the person and the person\u2019s corporation? Our answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>J.B. Williams Co., </em>498 F.2d 414 (2d Cir. 1974), the Parkson Advertising Agency was wholly owned by the stockholders of the J. B. Williams Company and ninety-five percent of Parkson\u2019s business came from Williams. The court decided that 15 United States Code \u00a7 45(1), which requires any \u201cperson, partnership, or corporation\u201d violating it to be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $ 10,000 for each violation,\u201d authorized only a single penalty for entities under a single control and that, in this context, Williams and Parkson should be regarded as one legal entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In <em>State ex rel. Corbin v. United Energy Corp. of America, </em>151 Ariz. 45, 725 P.2d 752 (Ariz. App. 1986), a jury assessed identical penalties of $55,000 for eleven violations ($5,000 per violation) against (a) a corporation, (b) a man who was the corporation\u2019s part owner, president, and treasurer, and (c) the man\u2019s father, who was the corporation\u2019s general manager. The applicable statute allowed \u201cany person\u201d violating it to be assessed a civil penalty of \u201cnot more than five thousand dollars per violation.\u201d The court factually distinguished <em>Williams </em>and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We also factually distinguish <em>Williams. </em>We are not dealing with a corporate parent and its corporate subsidiary. We are dealing with a man who acted for and through his corporation. In our view, HRS \u00a7 480-3.1 clearly and unambiguously required the court to civilly fine the man a minimum of $500 for each violation by the man and to civilly fine the corporation a minimum of $500 for each violation by the corporation. The facts that the man acted for the corporation and that the corporation was wholly owned, controlled, and operated by the man did not alter the facts that (1) the man and the corporation had distinct and separate legal identities and (2) the activities of each violated the prohibitions of the applicable statute. The man had his reasons for acting for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>through his corporation. The legislature had its reasons for imposing a mandatory civil f\u00edne on both the man and the corporation for and through which the man acted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALk\"><em>William H. Brady </em>and <em>Rory Soares Toomey </em>(Law Office of William H. Brady), on the briefs, for defendants-appellants, cross-appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9v\"><em>Lorrin A. Kau, </em>Office of Consumer Protection, on the briefs, for plaintiff-appellee, cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Nothing in the applicable statute, however, requires the circuit court to impose the same amount of civil fine on the man and his corporation. As noted above, the statutory civil fine for each violation is a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Accordingly, we vacate the second to the last paragraph of the December 14,1990 Judgment which imposes the $6,500 civil fine \u201cjointly and severally\u201d payable by defendants H. E. \u201cBud\u201d Shasteen and Hawaiian Improvement Corp., and we remand for reconsideration in the light of this opinion only the issue of the civil fines to be imposed against each defendant. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
