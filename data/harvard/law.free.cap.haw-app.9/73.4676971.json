The Officer also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Q And at the police academy, Officer, is there any type of instruction that you receive in recognizing a City and County of Honolulu or State of Hawai* i sign?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">A Yes, sir. It\u2019s posted and there\u2019s a label on the back of the sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">Q In this particular instance, did you check to see if there was a label on that sign?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">A No, sir. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve checked it before, but not that night cause it\u2019s the same sign that was there, same sign, same post.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Q And that label was on that sign when you last checked it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">Q Okay, Officer, based upon your training and experience was, are you able to say whether or not that was an official City and County of Honolulu or State of Hawai\u2018i speed sign?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Defendant\u2019s objection to the last answer was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">The trial court then took judicial notice of the schedules of speed limits (Schedules) on county highways on file with the clerk of the district court and found the official speed limit on Kapahulu Avenue was 25 mph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the State had not proven that the speed limit had been established in one of the two ways required by HRS \u00a7 291C-102.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion was denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Defendant rested and renewed his motion, this time arguing that HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c) (1985), which the court had relied on to find that the speed limit sign testified to by the Officer was placed under lawful authority, unlawfully shifted the burden of proof to him. Defendant\u2019s second motion was also denied, and the court adjudged him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The questions on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">(1) whether the oral charge against Defendant was legally sufficient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">(2) whether the State proved (a) that the speed limit had been established by ordinance; (b) that the speed limit sign was an official traffic control device; and (c) that the speed limit sign had been erected under lawful authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We will discuss those questions <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Defendant was charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">MR. HOKE: Okay. Mr. Vallejo, on or about April 19,1990, in the District of Honolulu, City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai\u2018i, you did drive a motor vehicle at a speed greater than the maximum speed limit by driving at 49 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone, in violation of Section 291C-102(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes which pertains to a county road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Defendant asserts that the charge was legally deficient because it did not specifically charge him with violating either a county ordinance or a state statute. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Defendant did not object to the charge below. Consequently, it will be liberally construed in favor of validity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983). If the charge reasonably includes the necessary elements of the offense charged, and the defendant is neither surprised nor prejudiced by the claimed omission, the charge will be upheld. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Here, Defendant was clearly charged with violating HRS \u00a7 291C-102(a) and was informed that the charge \u201cpertain[ed] to a county road.\u201d Thus, he was effectively put on notice that he had allegedly exceeded a speed limit established by a county ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Moreover, the record indicates Defendant was not misled or prejudiced by the charge. The record shows that when the court indicated it was taking judicial notice of the Schedules, Defendant produced his own set of Schedules in an effort to convince the court that Kapahulu Avenue was not listed on the Schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the State\u2019s burden of proof is confusing. However, we construe his argument to be that the State failed to prove (A) the ordinance establishing the speed limit; (B) that the speed limit sign was official; and (C) that the sign had been erected under lawful authority. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Speed limits for Honolulu, county roads are established by Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) 1978 Chapter 15 (1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ed.), the Traffic Code. The Traffic Code establishes a myriad of regulations, including speed limits, governing traffic on county roads. Speed limits are established by ROH \u00a7 15-7.2. The names of the individual streets covered by the speed limits in ROH \u00a7 15-7.2 are listed in Schedules IV through X, XXXHI, and XXXVH, attached to and incorporated in the Traffic Code. Rule 202(b), Hawai\u2018i Rules of Evidence (HRE) (1985), requires the courts to take judicial notice of all duly enacted ordinances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the court took judicial notice of the Schedules filed with the clerk, it took judicial notice of ROH \u00a7 15-7.2. Consequently, the ordinance was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The pertinent provision of ROH \u00a7 15-7.2 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Sec. 15-7.2. Speed Limit Zones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">(2) Twenty-five miles per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(a) Any street or highway within the City and County of Honolulu where speed limit has not been otherwise established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">(c) On those streets or portions thereof described in Schedule V attached hereto and made a part hereof; subject, however, to the limitations and extensions set forth therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">We have examined the Schedules and confirm Defendant\u2019s assertion that Kapahulu Avenue is not listed under Schedule V, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>which designates streets where the speed limit is 25 mph. Moreover, we do not find Kapahulu Avenue listed in any other schedule. Consequently, in accordance with ROH \u00a7 15-7.2(2)(a), the trial court properly found that the speed limit on Kapahulu Avenue is 25 mph.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Defendant argues that the court erred in permitting the Officer to testify that the speed limit sign was an official sign. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Officer testified that in his training program he was taught that official traffic control signs are \u201cposted\u201d and bear a label on the back. He had previously checked the sign, which was posted on Kapahulu Avenue opposite Herbert Street, and noted that it bore such a label. The receipt of the Officer\u2019s opinion was within the discretion of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sartain, 62 </em>Haw. 650, 618 P.2d 1144 (1980). The trial court here noted that the Officer was trained to observe and recognize official signs. The Officer\u2019s training and observations were sufficient, in our view, to allow him to state his opinion that the sign was official. Rule 701, HRE (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Officer\u2019s testimony did not \u201ccreate\u201d the sign as Defendant argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that, even if the sign was official, the presumption of HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c) cannot be used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>establish that the sign was placed under lawful authority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The pertinent provisions of HRS \u00a7 291C-31 (1985) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Obedience to and required traffic-control devices, (a) The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official traffic-control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with law, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">(c) Whenever official traffic-control devices are placed in position approximately conforming to law, such devices shall be presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful authority, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Defendant contends that the presumption is mandatory and unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof to him, thus relieving the State of the burden of proving an element of the offense charged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">A presumption is a deduction or an inference that may be drawn by the trier of fact from certain facts found or established during the course of a trial. <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyva, </em>38 N.Y.2d 160, 168-69 n.3, 379 N.Y.S.2d 30, 37 n.3, 341 N.E.2d 546, 551 n.3 (1975) (citing <em>Tot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U.S. 463, 63 S. Ct. 1241, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>87 L. Ed. 1519 (1943)). A statutory presumption that shifts the burden to an accused to disprove any element of the offense charged is invalid. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>57 Haw. 526, 560 P.2d 110 (1977); <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>7 Haw. App. 532, 782 P.2d 891 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The judgment of the legislature in establishing a presumption is to be given great weight by the courts, \u201cprovided it is based on common experience or reliable empirical data[.]\u201d <em>Leyva, </em>38 N.Y.2d at 166, 379 N.Y.S.2d at 35, 341 N.E.2d at 549-50; see <em>also State v. Brighter, </em>61 Haw. 99, 595 P.2d 1072 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In <em>State v. Williams, </em>415 N.W.2d 351 (Minn. App. 1987), the court considered language nearly identical to HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c) and held that proof of the underlying facts was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the presumed fact. <em>Cf. People v. Northrup, </em>142 Misc. 2d 973, 539 N.Y.S.2d 246 (N.Y. Just. Ct. 1988). Consequently, the defendant was required to produce proof, if he could, to rebut the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brighter, supra, </em>our supreme court reviewed the guidelines established by the United States Supreme Court for determining the constitutionality of the relationship between the proven fact and the inferred fact in the presumption. The <em>Brighter </em>court noted that in <em>Tot v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 463, 63 S. Ct. 1241, 87 L. Ed. 1519 (1943), \u201cthe Supreme Court declared that a \u2018rational connection\u2019 must exist between the fact proven and the fact inferred in order to satisfy the requirements of due process,\u201d and in <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S. Ct. 1532, 23 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1969), the Supreme Court held that a statutory inference cannot be sustained on constitutional grounds \u201c \u2018unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brighter, </em>61 Haw. at 104, 595 P.2d at 1076 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In our case, the legislature has required every motor vehicle driver to \u201cobey the instructions of any official traffic-control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>device... placed in accordance with law[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 291C-31(a). The presumption of HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c) reflects the legislature\u2019s intent that the prosecution should not be required \u201cto go through the hoops\u201d and prove not only that the traffic control device in question is official and properly placed but that it has been placed by lawful authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c)\u2019spresumption is the legislature\u2019s recognition of the common experience that, where an official traffic control device is in a legally proper place on the highway, it was placed there by some properly authorized agent of the government. Therefore, the legislative intent expressed in the statute is that, if the State has proved the official nature of the traffic control device and its position approximately conforming to law, it has established <em>prima facie </em>that the device was placed under authority of law. The State need not produce evidence of the authority but may rely on the presumption. In our view, HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c)\u2019s presumption meets both the <em>Tot </em>test and the <em>Leary </em>test. The statute does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof, since the State is still required to convince the trier of fact that the presumption flows from the proven facts. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 105 S. Ct. 1965, 85 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Finally, contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, we do not deem HRS \u00a7 291C-31(c)\u2019s presumption to be mandatory. Although the word shall is normally accorded a mandatory meaning when used in a statute, it may be given a directory meaning when it comports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>with the legislature\u2019s intention. <em>State </em>v. Himuro, 70 Haw. 103, 761 P.2d 1148 (1988). As we have indicated above, the legislature\u2019s intent in \u00a7 291C-31(c) was merely to ease the formality of proving the official nature of the traffic device. We find nothing in the statute to indicate that the legislature intended the presumption to be mandatory.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Asf\"><em>Mariano V. Hernando </em>(Traffic Clinic Hawai\u2018i, of counsel) on the briefs for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3X\"><em>Alexa D. M. Fujise, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, City and County of Honolulu, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The Officer\u2019s testimony was sufficient to allow the trial court to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the sign was placed under lawful authority. Consequently, contrary to his argument, the presumption was not unconstitutionally applied to Defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\"> Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291C-102(a) (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">Noncompliance with speed limit prohibited, (a) No person shall drive a vehicle at a speed greater than a maximum speed limit and no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed less than a minimum speed limit established by county ordinance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-12\"> We take judicial notice that Kapahulu Avenue is a county highway.
