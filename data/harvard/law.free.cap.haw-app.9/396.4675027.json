Aspinwall (Aspinwall) appeals the district court\u2019s December 12, 1991 Decision and Order Affirming Administrative Revocation and its December 12, 1991 Judgment on Appeal which affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s September 25, 1991 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On August 15,1991, Aspinwall was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI). The arresting officer issued to Aspinwall a Notice of License Revocation which was endorsed to provide a 30-day temporary driving permit expiring September 14,1991. Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 286-255 (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As required by HRS 286-258 (Supp. 1991), the Administrative Driver\u2019s License Revocation Office (ADLRO) reviewed the issuance of the Notice of License Revocation within eight days of its issuance. On August 22,1991, the ADLRO issued a Notice of Administrative Review Decision, revoking Aspinwall\u2019s driver\u2019s license from September 15, 1991 to December 15, 1991, and informing Aspinwall that she had five days from the date of the mailing of the decision to request an administrative hearing to review the decision. HRS \u00a7 286-258(f). On August 27, 1991, Aspinwall requested an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The ADLRO mailed to Aspinwall a letter dated September 6, 1991, which stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">Your hearing has been set for September 9, 1991. However, it has been Administratively Continued until September 12, 1991 at 9:00 a.m. at the Administrative Driver\u2019s License Revocation Office at 2875 S. King Street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Hearings were held on Thursday, September 12, 1991, and Friday, September 20, 1991. On September 12, 1991 Aspinwall moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that the review hearing was not commenced within twenty-five days of the issuance of the August 15, 1991 Notice of License Revocation as required by HRS \u00a7 286-259 (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">On September 25,1991, the hearing officer entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and as well as a Notice of Administrative Hearing Decision revoking Aspinwall\u2019s driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>license from September 15,1991 through December 15,1991 and denying Aspinwall\u2019s request for a conditional driving permit because she did not provide a sworn statement from her employer. The revocation caused Aspinwall to be subject to the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, HRS \u00a7 287-20 (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On October 17,1991, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Aspinwall filed a Petition for Judicial Review and Statement of the Case. HRS \u00a7 286-260. The specific ground upon which Aspinwall\u2019s petition sought reversal of the administrative revocation was that \u201c[the Administrative Director] erred in failing to hold Petitioner\u2019s administrative hearing within twenty-five (25) days of her arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">On December 12,1991, the district court issued its (1) Decision and Order Affirming Administrative Revocation and (2) Judgment on Appeal. The district court concluded that Aspinwall\u2019s August 27, 1991 request for an administrative hearing and the September 12, 1991 hearing were both timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Aspinwall timely appealed the district court\u2019s December 12, 1991 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">RELEVANT STATUTES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u00a7286-259 Administrative hearing, (a) If the director administratively revokes the arrestee\u2019s license after administrative review, the arrestee may request an administrative hearing to review the decision within five days of the date the administrative review decision is mailed. The hearing shall be scheduled to commence no later than twenty-five days from the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued. The director may continue the hearing only as provided in subsection (j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">(j) For good cause shown, the director may grant a continuance either of the commencement of the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>or of a hearing that has already commenced. If a continuance is granted at the request of the director, the director shall extend the validity of the temporary permit for a period not to exceed the period of the continuance. If a continuance is granted at the request of the arrestee, the director shall not extend the validity of the temporary permit. For purposes of this section a continuance means a delay in the commencement of the hearing or an interruption of a hearing that has commenced other than for recesses during the day or at the end of the day or week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u00a7286-260 Judicial review; procedure, (a) If the director sustains the administrative revocation after administrative hearing, the arrestee may file a petition for judicial review within thirty days after the administrative hearing decision is mailed. ... The filing of the petition shall not operate as a stay of the administrative revocation nor shall the court stay the administrative revocation pending the outcome of the judicial review. ... The petition shall state with specificity the grounds upon which the petitioner seeks reversal of the administrative revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(b) The court shall schedule the judicial review as quickly as practicable, and the review shall be on the record of the administrative hearing without taking of additional testimony or evidence. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(c) The sole issues before the court shall be whether the director exceeded constitutional or statutory authority, erroneously interpreted the law, acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, committed an abuse of discretion, or made a determination that was unsupported by the evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u00a7286-266 Computation of time. The time in which any act provided in this part is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a Sunday or holiday, and then it is also excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Aspinwall notes that HRS \u00a7 286-259(a) mandates that a review hearing \u201cshall be scheduled to commence no later than twenty-five days from\u201d August 15,1991. The 25th day was Monday, September 9, 1991, but the review hearing commenced on Thursday, September 12,1991. Consequently, Aspinwall asserts that the proceedings should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The respondent Administrative Director of the Courts (Director) responds that HRS \u00a7 286-259(a) requires that the hearing \u201cshall be scheduled to commence no later than twenty-five days from the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued,\u201d and HRS \u00a7 286-259(j) authorizes the Director to grant \u201ca continuance ... of the commencement of the hearing[.]\u201d Here, Director scheduled the hearing to commence on September 9, 1991, and continued it to September 12, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Aspinwall counters that the ADLRO\u2019s September 6, 1991 scheduling of the hearing for September 9,1991 was really a sham. We disagree. Nothing in the statute prohibits the use of one notice to schedule the commencement of the hearing and to continue the scheduled commencement of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Aspinwall also counters that HRS \u00a7 286-259(j) authorizes Director to grant a continuance \u201cat the request of the director\u201d or \u201cat the request of the arrestee\u201d but that, in either case, the request can be granted only \u201c[f]or good cause shown[.]\u201d Aspinwall contends that nowhere in the record is good cause shown for the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Director agrees that the record contains no evidence of \u201cgood cause\u201d warranting a continuance of the hearing from the twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fifth day to the twenty-eighth day. He also agrees that Aspinwall\u2019s temporary permit was not extended for the three-day extension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Aspinwall contends that the continuance was invalid because no good cause was shown, that absent a valid continuance HRS \u00a7 286-259 required the administrative hearing to commence within twenty-five days from the date the notice of administrative revocation was issued, and that Director violated this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Director agrees that HRS \u00a7 286-259 requires the hearing to \u201cbe scheduled to commence no later than\u201d the twenty-fifth day but contends that he satisfied that requirement. Director agrees that he violated the \u201c[f]or good cause shown\u201d requirement when he requested and granted the continuance but contends that the violation is not a ground for invalidating the hearing officer\u2019s September 25, 1991 decision revoking Aspinwall\u2019s driver\u2019s license because the statute does not impose any number-of-days limit on continuances. Under the Director\u2019s interpretation, the number-of-days within which the commencement of the hearing must be scheduled is mandatory, but the number-of-days within which the hearing must actually commence is discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In our view, the Director misinterprets HRS \u00a7 286-259. Subsection (a) speaks in terms of the \u201cscheduled\u201d date for the commencement of the hearing because subsection (j) authorizes continuances. However, the continuance authorized by subsection (j) is \u201cof the commencement of the hearing[.]\u201d This means that, if the scheduled commencement of the hearing is not validly continued, the actual commencement must occur on or before the twenty-fifth day.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">HRS \u00a7 286 \u2014 259(j) authorizes the scheduled commencement to be continued \u201c[f]or good cause shown[.]\u201d This means that, absent \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d the continuance is invalid. Otherwise, the \u201c[f]or good cause shown\u201d requirement would be meaningless. That requirement expressly mandates the Director to show good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>cause on the record so that, upon judicial review under HRS \u00a7 286-260, the court can decide whether the \u201ccause shown\u201d is \u201cgood,\u201d thereby determining HRS 286-260(c)\u2019s question whether \u201cthe director exceeded... statutory authority\u201d when he continued the scheduled hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Consequently, we are presented with a situation where the hearing was timely scheduled, invalidly continued by Director upon Director\u2019s request, and, therefore, untimely held. Aspinwall contends that this violation of HRS \u00a7 286-259 requires reversal of the administrative revocation of her driver\u2019s license. The question is whether HRS \u00a7 286-259\u2019s time requirement is mandatory or. directory. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Himuro, </em>70 Haw. 103, 761 P.2d 1148 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The purposes of Act 188, 1990, as amended by Act 1, 1991 Special Session, which first enacted Hawaii\u2019s Administrative Revocation of Driver\u2019s License law, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 286-251 through 286-266, were succinctly stated by Senator Lehua Fernandes Sailing, the Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, when, on the 60th day of the 1990 Regular Session, she spoke in favor of S.B. 1148, C.D.1, in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">[T]he bill before us accomplishes three major objectives of the Senate. No. 1, it provides an administrative review and hearing to be completed within 30 days so that the process is expeditious. This 30-day limit is followed in most states. No. 2, it requires that a person may have a temporary permit until a hearing has determined his guilt or innocence. If the state requires more time and asks for a continuance, the temporary permit will also continue. We believe that this will be the exception and most cases will be decided within the 30 days. And No. 3, should the state lose on the merits of the case, it will be prevented from bringing the driver to criminal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">In closing, let me at least mention one concern that I have about the bill which allows the state to have a continuance if they are not able to go forward with their case in 30 days. The Senate\u2019s position was to complete the hearing process in 30 days so that the revocation process was \u201cexpeditious.\u201d The law enforcement community wanted to be able to have the continuance to make certain that they could adequately prosecute anyone. And to balance this, we have allowed for the temporary permit to run until the hearing is finally held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">What concerns me is that the continuance will be used to let cases drag on. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">Mr. President, once this bill is law nothing would fuel the emotional outrage of this community more than the failure to administer this law properly and quickly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">As I said before, the use of a continuance beyond 30 days is the unique exception, and let the law enforcement community know that we will be watching this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">We have provided in this bill an appropriation for a study that will monitor various aspects of the administration of this law, including the use of the continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">And this study is our way of signaling our prosecutors that we will not tolerate any lengthy delays in the hearing process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">1990 Senate Journal, at 681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The express desire for the \u201cprocess [to be] expeditious[,]\u201d not to allow the continuance to be used \u201cto let cases drag on[,]\u201d \u201cto administer this law properly and quickly[,]\u201d to cause \u201cthe use of a continuance beyond 30 days [to be] the unique exception[,]\u201d and \u201cnot [to] tolerate any lengthy delays in the hearing process\u201d causes us to conclude that HRS \u00a7 286-259\u2019s time requirement is intended to be mandatory.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Richard Crisman Linstrom </em>and <em>Lloyd A. Poelman </em>for petitioner-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Afs\"><em>Edwin L. Baker, </em>Deputy Attorney General, for respondentappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, we must decide the consequences of Director\u2019s violation of the mandatory time requirements of HRS \u00a7 286-259. The applicable rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">[I]f the provision is mandatory, the failure to follow it will render the proceeding to which it relates illegal and void. If the provision is directory, however, the observance of the provision will not be necessary to the validity of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\"><em>Jack Endo Elec., Inc </em>v. <em>Lear Siegler, Inc., </em>59 Haw. 612, 616, 585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In light of the above, we conclude that Director\u2019s violation of the mandatory time requirements of HRS \u00a7 286-259 voids the administrative revocation of driver\u2019s license proceeding against Aspinwall.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Accordingly, we reverse (1) the hearing officer\u2019s September 25,1991 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision; and (2) the district court\u2019s (a) December 12,1991 Decision and Order Affirming Administrative Revocation, and (b) December 12,1991 Judgment on Appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
