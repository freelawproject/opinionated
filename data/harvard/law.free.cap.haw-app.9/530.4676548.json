Carver, Jr., and Leroy L. Carver, III, were consolidated for decision by order of this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment in Appeal No. 15659 (No. 15659) and dismiss Appeal No. 15729 (No. 15729).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>On February 17, 1987, Plaintiff-Appellee Maher A. A. Azer (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Courthouse for (1) unpaid lease rents, \u201capplicable state taxes and other additional charges and expenses,\u201d on space leased by Courthouse from Plaintiff in a building (the Building) owned by Plaintiff on Kapiolani Boulevard; and (2) unpaid assessments for the use of additional parking spaces in the Building\u2019s parking facility. On March 30, 1987, Courthouse answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">On May 27,1987, Courthouse filed a First Amended Counterclaim (Counterclaim) alleging, in Counts V, VI, and VII, that it had suffered damages on account of Plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain and repair the Building\u2019s parking facility. In particular, paragraph 28 (Paragraph 28) of the Counterclaim, alleged that because of Plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain and repair the Building\u2019s parking facility, Courthouse lost old and new customers and suffered a loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>income in the amount of $4,000 per day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Counterclaim prayed for damages for Plaintiffs breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On November 21,1988, Plaintiff moved to join the Carvers as defendants claiming the Carvers were personally liable because (1) after Courthouse was dissolved on November 15, 1985, for failure to file an annual corporate exhibit, the Carvers, as officers, directors, and stockholders of Courthouse, continued to operate Courthouse\u2019s business; and (2) the Carvers had personally guaranteed Courthouse\u2019s performance of the lease terms. Joinder was granted on March 21, 1989, and trial was set for the week of July 31, 1989.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In the course of preparing for trial, Plaintiff undertook several steps to discover from Courthouse what evidence Courthouse had to support the damages alleged in Paragraph 28. The following discovery steps are pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">(1) October 8, 1987: Plaintiffs First Request for Answers to Interrogatories (First Interrogatory Request).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Interrogatories 10 through 14 (Interrogatories 10-14) requested information relating to the Counterclaim, including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the customers that Courthouse allegedly lost, the dates on which such customers were lost, the facts concerning each loss, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>amount of lost income attributed to each such customer, and the facts supporting the allegation of a daily loss of $4,000 income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">(2) February 3,1989: Plaintiff\u2019s Third Request for Production of Documents (Third Document Request).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP56\">Plaintiff sought documents related to Courthouse\u2019s income and expenses, cash receipts and disbursements, profits and losses, and assets and liabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">(3) June 9, 1989: Plaintiffs Motion to Compel Answers to the First Interrogatory Request and/or for Preclusion of Evidence (Motion to Preclude).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">Plaintiff sought to compel answers to Interrogatories 10-14 or to preclude Courthouse from producing evidence at trial regarding the Counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">(4) June 22, 1989: Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel the production of the documents sought in the Third Document Request (Motion to Compel).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">On June 23, 1989, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental affidavit in support of the Motion to Preclude in which he outlined the history of Courthouse\u2019s alleged discovery abuses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a memorandum filed on June 22, 1989, opposing the Motion to Preclude, Courthouse promised to submit supplemental responses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>to Interrogatories 10-14 by June 30, 1989, the discovery cut-off date. On that date, Defendants produced four \u201cbankers boxes\u201d filled with documents in response to the first and third requests for documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The Motion to Preclude and the Motion to Compel were considered by the court without a hearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and on July 10, 1989, the motions judge issued a Minute Order (Minute Order) which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">1. Defendants have failed to answer interrogatories 10-14 dealing with para. 28 in their 1st Am Counterclaim. Since die Defendants promised responses by 6/30/89, the Court will disallow any evidence by Defendants to support para. 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>2. Defendants ordered per Plaintiffs\u2019 3rd Production Request to produce the records therein within 20 days from the date of this minute order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">3. Reasonable expenses to Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On July 18, 1989, Defendants filed a Motion for Reconsideration (First Motion for Reconsideration) of the Minute Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On August 11, 1989, the motions judge entered a formal order (Preclusion Order) granting the Motion to Preclude and the Motion to Compel and denying the First Motion for Reconsideration. The Preclusion Order read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">4. Defendants shall be and are hereby precluded from presenting any evidence at trial in support of the allegations of Counts V, VI, and VII of the Counterclaim as amended, that as a result of Plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain and/or repair the premises, parking deck and/or common areas,... \u201cDefendant/Counterclaimanthas been damaged in that it has lost both new and old customers in an amount to be proven at trial, but which exceeds $4,000 per day,\u201d as alleged in paragraph 28 of the Amended Counterclaim, or in any way relating to the alleged loss of contract sales described in the Report of Expert Testimony of Teresa McAllister, C.P.A., and Jim Bock, C.P.A., filed herein on July 19, 1989.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">After a bench trial that lasted from August 7 to 16, 1989, and in which no evidence was allowed by the court with respect to the allegations in Paragraph 28, the trial court entered findings of fact (FOF) and conclusions of law (COL). In FOF No. 12, the trial court found that, pursuant to the Preclusion Order, Courthouse was prevented from-introducing <em>prima facie </em>evidence in support of the Counterclaim. Judgment was entered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>December 22,1989, in favor of Plaintiff against Courthouse only,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Counterclaim was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">This is Defendants\u2019 fourth attempt to appeal from the judgment, and was lodged after an August 1, 1991 motion by the Carvers to dismiss the complaint as to them or in the alternative for summary judgment was denied in an order entered by the lower court on October 7,1991.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the same order, the court entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Rule 54(b) certification, which had also been requested by Defendants. This is No. 15659.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">No. 15659</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Defendants assert that (1) the motions judge erred in issuing the Preclusion Order; (2) the trial judge erred in dismissing the Counterclaim; and (3) the motions judge erred in denying Defendants\u2019 July 23, 1990 motion for reconsideration (Second Motion for Reconsideration) of the Preclusion Order. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The dispositive issue is whether the motions judge abused his discretion when he issued the Preclusion Order. A thorough review of the record indicates he did. It follows that the ensuing dismissal of the Counterclaim was error and the motions judge abused his discretion in denying Defendants\u2019 Second Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">A trial court\u2019s imposition of a discovery abuse sanction is reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>Kukui Nuts of Hawai\u2018i, Inc. v. R. Baird &amp; Co., </em>Inc., 6 Haw. App. 431, 726 P.2d 268 (1986) (hereinafter <em>Kukui I). A </em>trial court abuses its discretion whenever it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party. <em>SGM Partners </em>v. <em>The Profit Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 86, 793 P.2d 1189, <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>71 Haw. 506, 795 P.2d 853 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Moreover, dismissal of a pending action by the trial court with prejudice is not favored, <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>6 Haw. App. 614, 736 P.2d 63 (1987), and a full trial on the merits is favored, <em>GLA, Inc. v. Spengler, </em>1 Haw. App. 647, 623 P.2d 1283 (1981). An appellate court will uphold a dismissal with prejudice only where the record clearly shows delay or contumacious conduct and where lesser sanctions would not serve the best interest of justice. <em>Richardson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Defendants argue that the Preclusion Order is contrary to the principles established by this court in W. <em>H. Shipman, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 354, 802 P.2d 1203 (1990). However, <em>Shipman </em>is distinguishable on its facts and, therefore, is inapplicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The essence of Plaintiffs argument is that the Preclusion Order was properly entered in accordance with the provisions of Rule 37, Hawai\u2018i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1980). Our close examination of the record indicates that the Preclusion Order was not authorized by Rule 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Rule 37, HRCP, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Rule 37. FAILURE TO MAKE DISCOVERY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">SANCTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">(a) Motion for Order Compelling Discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>(2) <em>Motion. </em>If... a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33, . . . the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">(3) <em>Evasive or Incomplete Answer. For purposes of this subdivision </em>an evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">(b) Failure to Comply With Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">(2) <em>Sanctions by Court in Which Action is Pending. </em>If a party .. <em>.fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, </em>... the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">(B) <em>An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in evidenced]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require <em>the party failing to obey the order </em>or the attorney advising him or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">(d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection. If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party <em>fails </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>... (2) <em>to serve answers or objections to interrogatories </em>submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, ... the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising him or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has applied for a protective order as provided by Rule 26(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Generally, Rule 37(b) sanctions are only warranted where a court order for discovery has been violated. However, sanctions are allowed under Rule 37(d) \u201cagainst a party for a <em>complete </em>failure to respond to ... interrogatories[.]\u201d 8 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2282, at 757 (1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANHD\">[I]f any single interrogatory is not answered, or in lieu of an answer an objection is not made, there is an infraction of the rule and sanctions may be imposed under Rule 37(d) without first ordering the party to answer. If an answer is filed to a particular interrogatory, on the other hand, but the party serving it deems it to be \u201cincomplete,\u201d he must move to compel a satisfactory answer and may not move for the imposition of sanctions. Clearly evasive or incomplete answers justify an order under Rule 37(a). Further, once an order is made requiring answers, evasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>or incomplete answers may be treated as a failure to comply, and sanctions imposed under Rule 37(b) without the necessity of making a second order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">4A J. Moore and J. Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (Moore\u2019s) \u00b6 37.02[5], at 37-44-45 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">Rule 37(d) makes it explicit that a party properly served has an absolute duty to respond, that is, to . . . serve answers or objections to interrogatories served upon him, ... and that the court in which the action is pending may enforce this duty by imposing sanctions for its violation. Rule 37(d) deals, then, with failure to make the initial response required by the Rules, while subdivisions (a) and (b) provide a method of resolving differences between the parties and enforcing the court\u2019s determinations. Thus, there must be an order under subdivision (a) before sanctions are imposed under (b), while under (d) the party aggrieved moves directly for the imposition of sanctions____In short, if the party from whom discovery is sought complies with the rule in question by making the initial response, he has a right to refuse discovery until compelled by court order, subject to the expenses of determining the justification of his refusal; but if he does not comply with the rule, he is subject to the sanctions set forth in Rule 37(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Moore\u2019S \u00b6 37.05, at 37-120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Our review of the Preclusion Order was hampered by the fact that the motions judge did not make FOF and COL.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, in the Minute Order the motions judge did note that Defendants failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>to answer Interrogatories 10 through 14. A close review of the record indicates the \u201cfinding\u201d was erroneous. Appellants did in fact answer the questions within the meaning of Rule 37(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In its response to Interrogatories 10-14 filed on February 17, 1988, Courthouse generally objected to Interrogatories No. 10,11, and 13 on the grounds that the information was protected from discovery by the counsel work product privilege, and that the interrogatories were burdensome and oppressive, vague, and compound. Courthouse also indicated that its own discovery was continuing and that it would supply further answers upon completion of discovery. In response to Interrogatory No. 12, Courthouse did supply the name of one customer it allegedly lost on account of the parking difficulties and indicated generally the evidence it intended to rely on to support its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Interrogatory No. 14 and Courthouse\u2019s answer read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Interrogatory No. 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">With respect to the allegation contained in paragraph 28 of Defendant\u2019s First Amended Counterclaim that Defendant\u2019s damages exceed $4,000 per day, please state each and every fact, contention, document and other source upon which Defendant relies to support its claim that damages exceed $4,000 per day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">Response to Interrogatory No. 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">Objection, the question seeks to invade defendant and counterclaimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s work product privilege in that it calls for an analysis of written data, and in so far as the question invades that privilege, defendant and cross-complainant objects. Without waiving said objections, defendant and crosscomplainant answers as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">Parking complaint sheets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Drops in gross monthly income subsequent to the 1984 start of parking problems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">Accounting records showing income trends before, during and after the repair of the parking area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">Discovery is continuing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Thus, Courthouse did respond to Interrogatories 10-14, and the Preclusion Order was not authorized under Rule 37(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Plaintiffs argument that Defendants\u2019 responses were \u201cevasive, misleading or false\u201d and may be treated as \u201ca failure to answer\u201d in accordance with Rule 37(a)(3), thus justifying Rule 37(d) sanctions, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Evasive or incomplete answers to interrogatories are treated under Rule 37(a)(3) as failures to answer only with respect to Rule 37(a). Moore\u2019S \u00b6 37.01 [8], at 37-22. Thus, Defendants\u2019answers might have been used by Plaintiff to support a motion to compel in accordance with Rule 37(a)(2). However, the evasive or incomplete answers could not be used to support sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d). <em>See </em>Moore\u2019s \u00b6 37.02[5], at 37-44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Citing <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>3 Haw. App. 15, 639 P.2d 1121 (1982), Plaintiff also claims that the Preclusion Order was authorized under Rule 37(d) because Defendants failed to observe their agreement to supplement their responses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">First, <em>Doe </em>is factually distinguishable. In <em>Doe, </em>the petitioner failed to meet its agreement to provide the respondent with copies of certain letters. However, the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the petitioner to introduce the letters at trial was based not only on the petitioner\u2019s breach of the agreement but also on the fact that the petitioner had refused the respondent\u2019s request to examine the letters immediately prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">Second, Defendants did not completely fail to honor their agreement to supplement their answers. Defendants (1) answered each interrogatory, (2) promised to supplement their responses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and (3) did supplement their responses, albeit tardily and, perhaps, incompletely.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Plaintiffs further contention that the Preclusion Order was appropriate under Rule 37 for Defendants\u2019 violation of their agreement to supplement their answers in accordance with Rule 26(e) is without merit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, Rule 37 is not the source of the court\u2019s authority to impose sanctions for a party\u2019s Rule 26(e) violation. 8 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Civil \u00a7 2050, at 325 (1970). Second, as we have noted, Defendants did not fail to meet their agreement. Finally, Rule 26(e) requires a party to supplement responses only in certain circumstances, none of which are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Plaintiff also argues that the Preclusion Order was based on the lower court\u2019s February 23, 1989 order (February 23 Order) to Defendants to produce documents they had withheld from discovery under Plaintiffs first request for production of documents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiff claims that the Motion to Compel put the February 23 Order before the court and the Minute Order referred to it. The record does not support the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">First, the Motion to Compel does not allege that Defendants had violated any prior court order. Second, the Preclusion Order does not state that it was based on Defendants\u2019 failure to comply with any prior order. The Minute Order, on which the Preclusion Order was based, referred to Plaintiffs third request for production of documents, for which the record shows there was no prior order. Neither the Minute Order nor the Preclusion Order referred to the February 23 Order. Therefore, it does not appear that the February 23 Order was a basis for the Preclusion Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Plaintiff also argues that through the parties\u2019 memoranda and affidavits filed with respect to the First Motion for Reconsideration, the court was fully informed of all of Defendants\u2019 alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>discovery abuses before it formally entered the Preclusion Order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Those \u201cfactual\u201d accounts according to Plaintiff provide further justification for the Preclusion Order and \u201cmandates affirmance of the judgment below.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Motion to Preclude was based on Defendants\u2019 failure to answer interrogatories. Although the record indicates that the court did consider the Motion to Compel at the same time that it considered the Motion to Preclude, and both motions were granted in the Minute Order<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> there is nothing in the Minute Order to indicate that the sanction relating to Counts V, VI, and VII was based on anything other than the allegations of the Motion to Preclude. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Moreover, it does not appear that the Preclusion Order was anything more than a formalization of the determinations expressed in the Minute Order, which obviously was not based on the representations that followed upon the filing of the motion for reconsideration. Since the motions judge did not state any reasons for the Preclusion Order that were not mentioned in the Minute Order, we assume that the motions judge did not intend to go beyond the considerations that went into the Minute Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Finally, we note, as Plaintiff implicitly argues, that in addition to its authority under Rule 37, HRCP, the court may sanction parties for abusive litigation practices in a proceeding before it in accordance with Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes \u00a7 603-21.9(1) and (6) (1985), and its inherent powers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Kukui Nuts of Hawai'i, Inc. v. R. Baird &amp; Co., Inc., </em>7 Haw. App. 598, 789 P.2d 501 (1990) <em>(Kukui Nuts II). </em>In <em>Kukui </em>I, we held that the power of the court under either authority \u201cmust be exercised with restraint and discretion\u201d and the exercise is subject to review for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>6 Haw. App. at 436-37, 726 P.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In the absence, in this case, of a full hearing to establish the factual bases for the Preclusion Order, we are not convinced that the record so clearly shows (1) delay or contumacious conduct and (2) lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice so as to justify denying Defendants the opportunity to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Counterclaim. Consequently, we cannot uphold the Preclusion Order as a proper exercise of judicial discretion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeD\"><em>William C. McCorriston, William Meheula, Mark J.

Carver, III, will be collectively referred to as the Carvers, and the Defendants-Appellants will be collectively referred to as Defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> The pertinent notice of appeal in Appeal No. 15659 (No. 15659) was filed on October 10, 1991. On October 25, 1991, the lower court entered a judgment (Costs Judgment) in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amounts of $178,919.86 and $10,713.00, respectively, on account of a counterclaim that is the subject of No. 15659. Defendants appealed the Costs Judgment on November 12, 1991. This is Appeal No. 15729 (No. 15729).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On January 13, 1992, Courthouse filed in the supreme court a \u201cMotion for Summary Reversal\u201d in No. 15729, and asserted that when the Costs Judgment was entered the notice of appeal had already been filed in No. 15659 and the circuit court had no jurisdiction to enter the judgment. At the same time, however, Courthouse argued that the appellate courts had jurisdiction to enter the summary reversal on the grounds that (1) the Rule 54(b) certification in No. 15659, made the Costs Judgment an appealable judgment, and (2) the Costs Judgment was separately appealable as a collateral order. The motion was denied without explanation, and No. 15729 was thereafter briefed and assigned to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The general rule is that where a point was adjudicated on a motion to dismiss an appeal and the motion was denied, the same issue will not be considered by the appellate court again when raised in the briefs. <em>Schepp </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>770 P.2d 34 (Okla. 1989); <em>Condas </em>v. <em>Sugarhouse Mercantile Co., </em>14 Utah 2d 74, 377 P.2d 498 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">We construe the denial as nothing more than the supreme court\u2019s refusal to grant Courthouse\u2019s specific request for an unusual remedy not provided for by the rules and in support of which Courthouse cited no precedent. We do not deem the denial of the motion for summary reversal as an adjudication of the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>either the lower court to enter the Costs Judgment or this court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine No. 15729. This is particularly so in light of the fact that the order denying the motion for summary reversal was entered without affording Azer an opportunity to respond. Consequently, we are not foreclosed from determining the question of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">An appellate court is required in every case brought before it to determine if it has jurisdiction to decide the appeal, <em>State </em>v. Kam, 69 Haw. 483, 748 P.2d 372 (1988), and if a jurisdictional defect appears in the record, the appellate court must, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismiss the appeal. <em>Familian Northwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Pacific Boiler &amp; Piping, Ltd., </em>68 Haw. 368, 714 P.2d 936 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">When the notice of appeal was filed in No. 15659 on October 7,1991, the lower court lost jurisdiction to render the Costs Judgment. <em>SGM Partners v. The Profit Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 86, 793 P.2d 1189, <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, 71 </em>Haw. 506, 795 P.2d 853 (1990). Consequently, we hold, <em>sua sponte, </em>that, since the lower court did not have jurisdiction to enter the Costs Judgment, this court is without jurisdiction to consider the appeal from that order. <em>Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawai\u2018i, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 9 </em>Haw. App. 298, 837 P.2d 311 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> For a discussion of the parking problems experienced by tenants of the Building, <em>see SGM Partners, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b556-12\"> On November 18, 1988, Maher and Milagros Azer filed an action on the same lease involved in this case in the District Court of the First Circuit against the Carvers for summary possession, unpaid lease rents, and other claims. The case was transferred to the First Circuit Court and designated Civ. No. 89-0058-01 when the defendants demanded a jury trial. On May 5, 1989, the circuit court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to consolidate Civ. No. 89-0058-01 with this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\"> The affidavit pointed out that in addition to the Motion to Preclude and the Motion to Compel, Plaintiff was forced to take the following actions to compel Courthouse\u2019s compliance with discovery requests:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">(1) November 3, 1988: Motion to compel the production of documents sought in Plaintiff\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents. The motion was granted on February 23,1989;</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>(2) February 17,1989: Motion to compel answers in response to Plaintiff\u2019s Second Request for Answers to Interrogatories. The motion was granted on April 10, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The affidavit further recounted that in response to Plaintiff\u2019s Third Request for Production of Documents filed on February 3, 1989, Courthouse produced only its general excise tax returns. Additionally, the affidavit stated that in a June 21,1989 deposition of Edie Hood (Hood), who was Courthouse\u2019s office manager/ bookkeeper, Hood testified that she prepared monthly income and expense reports and other financial records and periodically sent copies of those records to Leroy Carver, III. Hood further testified that Defendants\u2019 representative and their attorney placed copies of those and other financial records in storage in Honolulu and that after Courthouse closed its business, she sent copies of all financial and other relevant records to Leroy Carver, III, in California. When Hood was asked for the address of the storage facility where the records were located, she was instructed by Defendants\u2019 counsel not to answer under a claim of confidentiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> On May 11,1983, the then civil administrative judge of the first circuit court entered an order which provided that thereafter certain enumerated motions would be accorded \u201coral hearings.\u201d All other motions would be decided on the basis of memoranda and affidavits without oral hearings. Discovery motions are not among those specifically enumerated in the order. Thus, discovery motions are decided without oral hearings in the first circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\"> In Conclusion of Law \u201cQ,\u201d the trial court held it had no jurisdiction over the Carvers, who are not Hawai\u2019i residents and were not served. Therefore, no judgment was entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The judgment awarded Plaintiff \u201cthe unpaid principal sum of $ 10,135.64[,]\u201d together with prejudgment interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> Defendants\u2019 first appeal was lodged on October 25,1989, after the findings of fact and conclusions of law were entered. This appeal was dismissed as not being from a final judgment. The second appeal was from the December 22,1989 judgment against Courthouse only. However, the supreme court dismissed that appeal on grounds that although the Carvers had not been personally served, they had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by filing an affidavit in the case. Therefore, there was no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The judgment against Courthouse was paid, and on July 23,1990, the Carvers filed a motion for summary judgment in their favor on the ground that the satisfaction of the judgment relieved them of any further liability either as guarantors, alter egos, or trustees in the dissolution of Courthouse. In the alternative, the motion sought Rule 54(b), Hawai\u2019i Rules of Civil Procedure certification. In an order filed on November 5,1990, the court denied, <em>inter alia, </em>the Carvers\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Also on July 23,1990, Defendants filed another motion for reconsideration of the Preclusion Order (Second Motion for Reconsideration), which was denied on November 14,1990. In the Second Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants made the same argument they make on appeal, to wit, the Preclusion Order is contrary to the principles set forth in W. <em>H. Shipman, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., </em>8 Haw. App. 354, 802 P.2d 1203 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Defendants filed a third notice of appeal on December 3,1990. This appeal was also dismissed on the ground that the November 5, 1990 order denying the Carvers\u2019 motion for summary judgment was not a final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> <em>See </em>note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b561-11\"> In the notice of appeal, Defendants indicated that they were appealing from an August 11,1991 order denying their motion to dismiss the complaint as to the Carvers. However, there is no mention of the order in the opening brief\u2019s sections on points or questions on appeal. Additionally, the opening brief makes no argument on the issue. Consequently, Defendants are deemed to have waived the issue. <em>State v. McCully, </em>64 Haw. 407, 642 P.2d 933, <em>cert. </em>denied, 459 U.S. 830, 103 S. Ct. 68, 74 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1982); Rule 28(b)(4), Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b562-12\"> In <em>Shipman, supra, </em>the lower court, after finding that the defendant had violated the discovery rules of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure, entered an order specifically precluding the defendant from \u201c\u2019asserting, or offering any evidence of, any matters\u2019 covered by the [interrogatories served by the plaintiff] in defense of any of Shipman\u2019s claims.\u201d 8 Haw. App. at 361, 802 P.2d at 1207. In this case, as discussed in the opinion, although Defendants\u2019 conduct was not in keeping with a party\u2019s duty to give complete discovery of all relevant information in his possession. Defendants did not actually violate the discovery rules. <em>See Wakabayashi </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>66 Haw. 265, 660 P.2d 1309 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b565-13\"> We also question whether, when the trial court proposes to impose a discovery sanction of such severe consequences as the sanction imposed here, the issue should be resolved without a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\"> On July 5,1989, five days after the discovery cut-off date, Defendants filed an affidavit opposing the Motion to Preclude in which they provided supplemental answers to the First Interrogatory Request. The supplemental answers referred Plaintiff to financial information contained in the four \u201cbankers boxes\u201d full of documents furnished to Plaintiff on June 30,1989. The affidavit also gave Defendants\u2019 reasons for not having provided the information earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The affidavit stated that after Courthouse ceased doing business, (1) its financial records were placed in storage in over 40 bankers boxes; (2) six file folders of business records were forwarded to the Carvers on the mainland, which were immediately sent to Carvers\u2019 counsel to sort out privileged information; (3) Carvers\u2019 counsel refrained from sending these documents to counsel, since they were incomplete, and from supplementing the answers to interrogatories until a complete set could be obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> Rule 26(e), Hawai\u2018i Rules of Civil Procedure (1990) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">Supplementation of Responses. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (A) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which he is expected to testify, and the substance of his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if he obtains information upon the basis of which (A) he knows that the response was incorrect when made, or (B) he knows that the response though correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>when made is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">(3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\"> The record shows that after Plaintiffs first request for production of documents was served, discovery was held in abeyance pending settlement negotiations. After settlement negotiations failed, Plaintiff filed the first motion to compel production of the documents, which resulted in the February 23,1989 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> The parties filed lengthy memoranda and affidavits of counsel in support of and opposing the First Motion for Reconsideration. The memoranda and affidavits contained lengthy accounts of the actions of both parties during the discovery stage of the proceedings. In his memorandum, Plaintiff asserted that Courthouse\u2019s response to the February 23, 1989 order was evasive and incomplete, because although Courthouse produced various letters and memoranda,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\"><em>none of the 4 boxes of financial records upon which Defendants now rely to support their damage claims were produced at that time. </em>THE COURTHOUSE was apparently relying upon the cryptic response, \u201cDefendant will supply further documents which are applicable to this request upon completion of discovery,\u201d to justify withholding documents which were in its possession and in the possession of third parties over whom THE COURTHOUSE had direct control, even though the Order of February 23, 1989, required production <em>forthwith.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">(Emphasis in original.) The Preclusion Order may arguably have been partly based on Courthouse\u2019s actions. The court could have reasoned that the incomplete production constituted a failure to comply with a discovery order within the meaning of Rule 37(b). However, we are not convinced that the motions judge in fact took Plaintiff\u2019s argument into account or that Courthouse\u2019s actions constituted a \u201cfailure to comply\u201d within the meaning of the rule, since Courthouse did provide some of the documents, promised further production, and then, prior to the entry of the Preclusion Order, produced more documents in response to the Third Document Request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\"> In the Preclusion Order, the court also denied the First Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7 603-21.9(1) and (6) (1985) reads as follows: Powers.
