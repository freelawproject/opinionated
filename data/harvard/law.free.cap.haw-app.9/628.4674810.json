The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>concedes that the trial court erred in denying Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on Count II of the indictment, Possession, Use or Threat to Use a Deadly Weapon in the Commission of a Crime. HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 51(b) (Supp. 1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse Defendant\u2019s conviction on Count II and, after a review of the record, vacate the convictions on Counts I and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred in:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">(1) granting immunity to Defendant\u2019s alleged victims from any prosecution for perjury that might arise from their testimony in this case; and</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">(2) instructing the jury on the elements of the offense of robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">THE IMMUNITY GRANT</p>\n<p id=\"AxF8\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">On March 19,1991, the police arrived at the home of Defendant\u2019s parents, Lester (Lester) and Martha (Martha) Radcliffe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>investigate a report of \u201can argument involving a knife[,]\u201d and found Lester with a blackened left eye and a slight cut over his right eye. The police obtained separate signed statements from both Lester and Martha, indicating unequivocally that at one point in the day Defendant had punched Lester. Additionally, in her statement, Martha stated that later, while Defendant was holding a paring knife to Lester\u2019s throat and demanding money from him, Martha gave Defendant $80, \u201cin hopes that he would leave Lester and [Martha] alone.\u201d Defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Six days later, at Defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing on these charges, Lester testified that what had occurred was a \u201clittle ruckus[,] . . . little bit of a disagreement and a struggle.\u201d Lester testified that he had grabbed Defendant by the forearm to prevent Defendant from leaving the house and driving Lester\u2019s automobile because Defendant was intoxicated; in attempting to free himself from Lester\u2019s grasp, Defendant swung at and hit Lester in the face, causing a black eye and an abrasion. Lester did not recall telling the police that Defendant had held a knife at Lester\u2019s throat and did not recall signing any statement. Lester also testified that Defendant was merely waving the knife around and had not held it at Lester\u2019s throat. Martha did not testify at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On February 24,1992, Lester and Martha moved to quash the subpoenas served on them requiring them to testify at trial. In an affidavit attached to the motion their counsel indicated that, if they were called to testify, both Lester and Martha would disclaim their statements to the police and testify that no criminal offenses occurred in their home on the day in question. Additionally, if Lester and Martha were called to testify they intended to invoke their constitutional privilege against incriminating themselves in the offense of rendering a false report of a crime to the police. HRS \u00a7 710-1015 (1985). The court orally denied the motion at a hearing that day and directed Lester and Martha to return the next day for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>On February 25, 1992, the State filed two identical applications under HRS \u00a7 621 C-4 (1985)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for (1) a grant to Lester and Martha of transactional immunity from prosecution for any act, transaction, matter or thing concerning which each of them would testify relating to the March 19, 1991 incident, and (2) an order directing Lester and Martha to testify regarding the incident. After a hearing on the motion that day, the court issued identical orders to Lester and Martha directing them to testify about the incident and ordering that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">shall not be prosecuted, nor punished, in any future criminal action or proceeding for, or on account of any act, transaction, matter or thing concerning that which [Lester and Martha] provide[] testimony with regards to an incident.. . except that [Lester and Martha] may be prosecuted for obstructing justice or for any other criminal offense stemming from... failure to comply with this order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">At that same hearing, the court and the parties agreed that the immunity grant would apply to the possible false reporting charge. However, Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s attorney questioned whether Lester could be prosecuted for a variance between his preliminary hearing testimony and his trial testimony. At that point the deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>prosecuting attorney stated that \u201cthe State intends to afford immunity for perjury as well.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">During Martha\u2019s trial testimony, she denied that Defendant had punched Lester or that Defendant had held a knife to Lester\u2019s throat and demanded money. She also disavowed making such statements to the police and denied reading the statement before signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Additionally, the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Q. [By the prosecutor] You\u2019re testifying today under a grant of immunity. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">Q. So whatever you say in court today, whether it be the truth or whether it be a lie, there\u2019s no legal consequence for you. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">A. I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">Q. I mean, if you lie in court today, you can\u2019t be charged with perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">A. I\u2019ve been told to tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Q. If you lie in court today, you can\u2019t be charged with perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">A. Can I speak with my attorney, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">THE COURT: Mr. Thompson [Martha\u2019s counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">(Witness conferring with counsel.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-17\">A. I\u2019ve been told that if I lied today, I could be charged with perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-18\">THE COURT: Counsel, approach the bench, please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">In the ensuing bench conference, the court and counsel clarified that the prosecutor\u2019s statement during the hearing on the application, that \u201cthe State intends to afford immunity from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>perjury as well[,]\u201d included any possible charge of perjury from Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s trial testimony. Martha\u2019s counsel conferred with her again, after which the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">Q. [By the prosecutor] Isn\u2019t it true, Mrs. Radcliffe, that you could lie on the stand today and you face no legal consequences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">A. I have been advised that lam \u2014 I cannot be charged with perjury at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The next day, Defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s actions in granting absolute immunity, including immunity from perjury for Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s trial testimony, was prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant\u2019s position was that the State had granted Lester and Martha immunity for the purpose of impeaching them. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Lester\u2019s testimony was similar to his preliminary hearing testimony, <em>i.e., </em>the injuries he received were inadvertently caused by Defendant; Defendant only waved a knife at him; and although he signed the statement the police prepared, he disagreed with its contents, felt \u201ccoerced and intimidated\u201d by the police presence, and only signed it after one of the police officers guaranteed that the statement could be withdrawn at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">During Lester\u2019s re-direct examination by the prosecutor, the following question and answer were stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">Q. You could be testifying today and you can lie on the stand and there\u2019s absolutely no legal consequences to you; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">A. That\u2019s what I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">The next day, Defendant again moved for a mistrial. This time, defense counsel argued that the court hadno statutory authority to grant immunity against prosecution for perjury and that the immunity nullified the witnesses\u2019 oath. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s statements were introduced in evidence during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>b.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Citing <em>Butler </em>v. <em>State, 55 </em>Md. App. 409, 462 A.2d 1230 (1983), Defendant first argues that immunity from prosecution can only be granted by statute, that the prosecutor lacks \u201ccommon law\u201d power to grant immunity, and that the legislature did not intend for HRS \u00a7 621C-4 to grant immunity from prosecution for perjury prior to the time the testimony is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>Butler, </em>the Maryland court said, \u201c\u2018[t]here is no inherent, common law power in the State\u2019s Attorney or in the Grand Jury or in the judge or in anyone else to confer immunity from prosecution. Immunity is exclusively a creation of statute and can only exist when a statute has brought it into being.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 462 A.2d at 1234 (quoting <em>Bowie </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Md. App. 567, 575, 287 A.2d 782, 787 (1972)). That is the universal rule. <em>Butler; Higdon v. State, </em>367 So. 2d 991 (Ala. Cr. App. 1979). However, Defendant\u2019s reliance on the general rule is misplaced. The quotation from <em>Butler </em>only applies to one facet of the issue before us \u2014 as in <em>Butler </em>\u2014 immunity from prosecution based on incriminating statements or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In <em>Butler, </em>Maryland police officers investigating a robbery, having first obtained the approval of the Maryland prosecutor\u2019s office, promised the defendant that if he gave them a truthful account of all he knew about the crime, they would not charge him with the offense. However, he was in fact charged. In appealing his conviction the defendant argued that his motion to dismiss, which was based on the police officers\u2019 promise, should have been granted. Although holding that the prosecutor could not grant immunity to a defendant for the offense that was being investigated by the police, the <em>Butler </em>court noted that the prosecutor had general authority to enter into plea bargains, or other types of bargains with people being investigated for criminal activity. The Maryland court remanded the case, instructing the lower court to make factual findings regarding the nature of the offer made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>police and the means of enforcing any agreement between the defendant and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Butler </em>is important for its discussion of the nature of immunity and the difference between that legal mechanism and the prosecutorial function relating to plea bargains and other decisions not to prosecute a criminal offender.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">We should meticulously keep separate and apart the subjects of (1) the conferral of immunity, (2) a plea bargain, and (3) some other bargain involving something other than a plea to a criminal charge. The sources of authority are different. The social purposes are different. The legal incidents are different. The procedural rules are different. Other than the very general notion of some <em>\u201cquid pro quo,\u201d </em>the three phenomena are distinct. We only do the law a disservice when we heedlessly blur those distinctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 418, 462 A.2d at 1234.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">The very notion of immunity has no existence outside the context of the constitutional privilege against compelled testimonial self-incrimination. It is the \u201cflip-side\u201d of the privilege. \u201cImmunity displaces the [privilege].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 421, 462 A.2d at 1236 (quoting <em>Ullman v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 439, 76 S. Ct. 497, 507, 100 L. Ed. 511, 525 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">To support its pronouncement that immunity is granted only by statute, the Maryland court quoted Chief Justice Cardozo who stated for the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Doyle v. Hofstader, </em>257 N.Y. 244, 255, 177 N.E. 489, 495 (1931):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">The conclusion, we think, is inescapable that the power to suspend the criminal law by the tender of immunity is not an implied or inherent incident of a power to investigate. It may be necessary for fruitful results in a particular instance, but it is not so generally indispensable as to attach itself automatically to the mere power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>inquire. Whether the good to be attained by procuring the testimony of criminals is greater or less than the evil to be wrought by exempting them forever from prosecution for their crimes is a question of high policy as to which the law-making department of the government is entitled to be heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In contrast to a prosecutor\u2019s promise not to prosecute, which has certain attributes of transactional immunity and is not binding on other prosecuting offices in the state or on a successor prosecutor, formal immunity is frequently forced upon a witness against the witness\u2019s will and binds all other prosecutors in the same state. Additionally, a grant of immunity confers, under the due process clause, \u201cuse and derivative use\u201d immunity against all other states and the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Butler, </em>55 Md. App. at 422, 462 A.2d at 1236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In our case, it does not appear that the court in fact granted immunity from prosecution for perjury. When the prosecutor advised the court that the State intended the order to include immunity from perjuiy, the court neither approved nor disapproved the \u201cgrant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Regardless, we agree with Defendant that the statute does not grant such authority to the courts. The statute clearly contemplates that the witness will testify truthfully. If the legislature had intended to include immunity from prosecution for perjurious testimony in the grant authorized by HRS \u00a7 621C-4, it would not have provided that the witness \u201cmay be prosecuted for perjury, [or] for giving a false statement[.]\u201d Moreover, the legislative history of HRS Chapter 621C indicates that it was enacted \u201cto protect a witness by granting him both transactional and use immunity except in a prosecution for an offense arising out of a failure to comply with the direction to testify or produce evidence, or for perjury committed while testifying under the grant of immunity.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 483, in 1971 House Journal, at 898. A grant of immunity from perjury prosecution for untruthful testimony is totally destructive of the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The court\u2019s lack of authority does not, however, resolve the issue of whether the prosecutor had the power to forego any perjury prosecution in this case, for it is equally as obvious that such was her intent. Accordingly, the next question is whether the prosecutor was authorized to render Lester and Martha prospective \u201cimmunity\u201d from prosecution for their anticipated false testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfKJ\">Through his influence over the charging process and his ability to secure an indictment or information, the prosecutor is able to determine when the criminal process will be initiated. His authority to decline to prosecute any given case and his powers to grant immunity and to negotiate pleas allow him to decide when the process shall terminate. The conventional view is that the prosecutor has broad, almost complete discretion in the exercise of these powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\"><em>A Symposium: Prosecutorial Discretion, </em>13 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 379, 379 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>[The prosecutor] not only has complete discretion as to whether to charge, he also has complete discretion as to when charges will be filed, what charges will be filed, how many charges will be filed, and under what statutes the charges will be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">S. Cox, <em>Prosecutorial Discretion: An Overview, </em>13 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 383, 418 (1976) (hereinafter Cox).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">A proper exercise of [prosecutorial discretion] expedites the speedy and efficient administration of criminal justice by eliminating cases in which there is little likelihood of conviction in early stages of prosecution. It also enables the prosecutor to eliminate or defer a criminal prosecution as part of a tactical move.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Note, <em>Prosecutor\u2019s Discretion, </em>103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1057, 1057 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Our supreme court has recognized that the prosecuting attorney has broad discretion to dispose of criminal charges by agreement, <em>State v. Fox, </em>70 Haw. 46, 760 P.2d 670 (1988); <em>State v. Yoon, </em>66 Haw. 342, 662 P.2d 1112 (1983), and to charge a defendant under one statute or another. <em>State v. Rabago, </em>67 Haw. 332, 686 P.2d 824 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Some authors believe that limits should be imposed on the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of discretion, either internally, through administrative rules or guidelines, or externally. Cox, at 392-93. The American Bar Association (ABA) has developed the following guidelines for the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of a discretion not to bring charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">The prosecutor is not obliged to present all charges which the evidence might support. The prosecutor may in some circumstances and for good cause consistent with the public interest decline to prosecute, notwithstanding that evidence exists which would support a conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Illustrative of the factors which the prosecutor may properly consider in exercising his discretion are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">(i) the prosecutor\u2019s reasonable doubt that the accused is in fact guilty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">(ii) the extent of the harm caused by the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">(iii) the disproportion of the authorized punishment in relation to the particular offense or the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">(iv) possible improper motives of a complainant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">(v) prolonged non-enforcement of a statute, with community acquiescence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">(vi) reluctance of the victim to testify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">(vii) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or conviction of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">(viii) availability and likelihood of prosecution by another jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-14\"><em>ABA Standards Relating To The Prosecution Function and the Defense Function \u00a7 </em>3.9(b) (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">However, the great majority of the courts that have considered challenges to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion have declined to interfere, holding generally that the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of authority is free from judicial review under the doctrine of the separation of powers or because of the absence of an adequate record for review and the complex nature of the prosecutor\u2019s decision. Cox, at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">On the other hand, there is an emerging minority rule regarding judicial review of the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to prosecute, generally based on the theory that courts and prosecutors share overlapping responsibilities which allow the court to act when the prosecutor\u2019s behavior has been irresponsible or unacceptable. <em>Id. </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">One court has said: \u201cOf course, prosecutors have broad discretion to press or drop charges-. But there are limits.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>394 F.2d 966, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1968). In <em>Dixon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the court upheld the lower court\u2019s dismissal of a prosecution for a traffic offense that was brought in retaliation for the defendant\u2019s filing, contrary to an agreement with government attorneys, a misconduct charge against the arresting police officers. The court refused to be the enforcer of such an \u201codious\u201d agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>320 F. Supp. 527 (D.D.C. 1970), the court enjoined the United States Attorney from issuing summonses directing defense witnesses to appear at the attorney\u2019s office for interviews. The court held that the summonses, which were misleadingly similar to court issued subpoenas, were \u201coffensive documentfs]\u201d and \u201cusurpation of judicial power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We conclude (i) the prosecutor\u2019s decision declining to prosecute Lester and Martha for perjury before they had even testified was unacceptable behavior and an abuse of discretion, and (ii) the questions posed to Lester and Martha quoted above were improper and highly prejudicial to Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Clearly, the prosecutor\u2019s reason for foregoing prosecution of Lester and Martha for perjury on account of their trial testimony was a tactical decision. If Lester and Martha thought they would be prosecuted for perjury for their trial testimony, they would not have testified at all. Under those circumstances, the prosecutor would not have been able to get their prior inconsistent statements before the jury, since the prosecutor would be unable to lay the foundation that their prior statements conflicted with their trial testimony. Rule 802.1(1), Hawai\u2018i Rules of Evidence (HRE), HRS Chapter 626 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">As stated, HRS Chapter 621C contemplates that the immunized witness will testify truthfully. Nevertheless, the statute does not command that such witnesses be prosecuted for perjury for not so testifying. Had the legislature intended to mandate prosecution, it would have used language other than the word \u201cmay.\u201d Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>quently, the decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is left to the prosecutor\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Thus, the prosecutor clearly had authority under the common law to refrain from prosecuting Lester and Martha for their allegedly false testimony after they had testified. However, the prosecutor\u2019s actions invited them to testify falsely and advised them that they could do so with impunity. The prosecutor created the opportunity for Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s wilful false oath to tell the truth. The prosecutor\u2019s actions did not serve the end of justice and did not encourage Lester and Martha to testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">d.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">We turn now to the question whether the prosecutor\u2019s questions to Lester and Martha about the grant of immunity from prosecution for perjury amounted to misconduct that deprived Defendant of a fair trial. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>71 Haw. 466, 796 P.2d 80 (1990). We think they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Without asking the controversial questions, the prosecutor could have impeached Lester and Martha and could have introduced their statements into evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 607, HRE. The prosecutor could then have argued to the jury that Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s statements to the police contained the true description of Defendant\u2019s criminal acts. The prosecutor could have argued that the jury should not believe Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s trial testimony for the obvious reason that they had changed their minds when confronted with the possibility that Defendant, their son, could go to prison. The jury would have had the witnesses\u2019 conflicting statements to compare with other evidence and determine for themselves which statements to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The questions and answers announced to the jury that Lester and Martha had come to the trial with no intention of telling the truth; that they even lied when they took the oath as witnesses. Having asked the questions at issue and obtained the answers, the prosecutor laid the foundation to argue that Lester and Martha had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>lied in court not only because of their parental love for Defendant, but also because they had been granted \u201cimmunity\u201d from prosecution if they did lie; immunity which the prosecutor had accorded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In our view, the prosecutor\u2019s actions unfairly deprived Defendant of any opportunity to argue meaningfully for the credibility of Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s trial testimony and against the credibility of their prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cThe duty of the prosecution is to seek justice, to exercise the highest good faith in the interest of the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair advantage over the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\"><em>State v. Quelnan, </em>70 Haw. 194, 198, 767 P.2d 243, 246 (1989) (quoting <em>State v. Miller, </em>67 Haw. 121, 122, 680 P.2d 251, 253 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">THE INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the law relating to Count I, Robbery in the First Degree. HRS \u00a7 708 \u2014 840(1)(b)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The essence of Count I was that while Defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument, <em>i.e., </em>the knife, he threatened the imminent use of force against Lester with the intent of obtaining money. The court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[a] knife is a dangerous instrument,\u201d and that \u201c[a] threat of imminent use of force is made when a defendant creates circumstances which cause another person present to believe that he may be subject to bodily injury.\u201d Defendant did not object to those instructions; however, he now argues that the instructions were plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">Rule 30(e), Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (1977) (HRPP), provides that the trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>assigned as error on appeal unless the party alleging the error objected to the instruction before the jury retired. However, the alleged error may be considered by the appellate court where it is plain error or a defect affecting substantial rights. Rule 52(b), HRPP. Plain error is error that is obvious or otherwise seriously affects \u2018\u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Fox, </em>70 Haw. at 56, 760 P.2d at 676 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S. Ct. 391, 392, 80 L. Ed. 555, 557 (1936)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Defendant had the substantial right in this case to have the jury correctly instructed in order to insure that the jury was properly guided in its consideration of the issues presented to it. <em>State v. Feliciano, </em>62 Haw. 637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980). In our view, the instructions complained of constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">HRS \u00a7 708-840(2) (Supp. 1992) defines a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d as \u201cany firearm,... or other weapon, device, instrument, material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or threatened to be used is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d By that definition, a knife is not a dangerous instrument unless the manner in which it is used or threatened to be used renders it capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. When the court told the jury that a knife is a dangerous instrument, it misstated the law and took the question of the knife\u2019s use from the jury. <em>State v. Napeahi, </em>57 Haw. 365, 556 P.2d 569 (1976). This was especially prejudicial to Defendant in view of Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s trial testimony that Defendant was merely waving the knife around and not holding it against Lester\u2019s throat as they had indicated in their statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The State\u2019s argument that the divergence from the statute in this case was not error because, unlike the <em>Napeahi </em>court, the court here did not instruct the jury that a knife is a dangerous instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>as a matter of law, </em>is not persuasive. Here, the jury was instructed on the elements of the offense and was told that the State had to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. One of those elements was that Defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument. The clear effect of the offending instruction was to tell the jury that the State had already proved that element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AE-\"><em>Brook Hart </em>(Hart &amp; Wolff, of counsel) on the briefs for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1O\"><em>Doraine F. Meyer, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, City and County of Honolulu, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The instruction defining the imminent use of force requires us to construe HRS \u00a7 708-840. In doing so, it is our duty to determine the legislature\u2019s intent primarily from the language of the statute. <em>State v. Briones, </em>71 Haw. 86, 784 P.2d 860 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Robbery is an aggravated form of theft. <em>See </em>Commentary on HRS \u00a7\u00a7 708-840 and -841 (1985). The legislature has treated it more seriously than ordinary theft because of the risk of bodily harm to the victim. <em>Id. </em>Since the statute states that robbery involves the threat of \u201cimminent use of force\u201d against someone who is \u201cpresent,\u201d it necessarily follows that the legislature intended the threat to be of imminent bodily harm. An instruction, such as the one here, that allows the jury to erroneously conclude that the threat may be of future bodily injury incorrectly states the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction on Count II, vacate' the judgment of conviction on Counts I and III, and remand those latter counts for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\"> Count III originally charged Defendant with assault in the second degree. However, on March 3,1992, the court granted Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on Count III on the ground that the injury suffered by the one injured victim was not a serious bodily injury and submitted Count III to the jury as a reduced charge of assault in the third degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-12\"> The answering brief concedes that (1) the State failed to prove that the paring knife allegedly used by Defendant was a \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapon\u201d within the meaning of Hawai\u2019i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 708-840(2) (Supp. 1992); and (2) the court failed to properly instruct the jury on the legal definition of a deadly or dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\"> Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in (1) overruling Defendant\u2019s objection when the prosecutor asked Defendant on cross-examination if he had \u201cbeen driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d on the day of the incident: and (2) admitting into evidence the written statements given to the police by the alleged victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">First, our review of the record indicates that, even if the court erred in overruling the objection, the error was harmless, since the record contains a plethora of testimony, including Defendant\u2019s, that he had been drinking the whole day of the event, was intoxicated, and had driven an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-17\">Second, the fact, as discussed in the opinion, that the victims recanted their statements affects the weight of the statements, not their admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> HRS \u00a7 621 C-4 (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">Transactional immunity. If a person is ordered to testify or produce a record, document, or other object under this chapter and the order specifies that the person is granted transactional immunity pursuant to this section, such person shall not be prosecuted or punished in any criminal action or proceeding for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the person is so ordered to testify or produce a record, document, or other object, except that the person may be prosecuted for perjury, for giving a false statement, or for an offense involving a failure to comply with the order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-20\"> On March 3,1992, the prosecutor indicated that the immunity covered both Lester\u2019s and Martha\u2019s testimony as to all the counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> For a discussion of the characteristics of use and derivative use immunity and transactional immunity, <em>see State </em>v. <em>Miyasaki, 62 </em>Haw. 269, 614 P.2d 915 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\"> The transcript of the pre-trial conference where the immunity application and grant were discussed indicates that the original intent of the court was that the order would only grant transactional immunity. During that conference, the prosecutor stated that \u201cthe State intends to afford immunity for perjury as well.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statement can only be viewed as stating her intent not to prosecute for peijury. It cannot be considered as a construction of the order, since such construction was a matter for the court. <em>Cain </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>59 Haw. 32, 575 P.2d 468 (1978). The court\u2019s statements during the conference clearly show that it did not consider the order as granting immunity from perjury. We do not know why the court did not say so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
