A subordinate question is whether such defendants were entitled to an allowance of costs. We conclude that such defendants were not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees, but were entitled to an allowance of costs in the discretion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">On April 16,1990, plaintiff David J. Schubert (Schubert) filed a verified complaint for summary possession and damages. Schubert alleged that (1) on December 1, 1987, he, as landlord, and defendants Tevita Finau Saluni and Lupe Manupuna Saluni (collectively, the Salunis), as tenants, executed a rental agreement (Rental Agreement), covering certain residential premises at Waipahu, 0\u2018ahu (the Premises); (2) tenancy under the Rental Agreement terminated on February 1,1990; and (3) despite notices to vacate, the Salunis have not vacated the Premises. Schubert sought possession of the Premises and a money judgment for accrued rent and interest, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">On May 8, 1990, the Salunis filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the district court lacked subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>matter jurisdiction. A memorandum of law and an affidavit attached to the motion alleged that (1) on May 27,1988, Schubert, as optionor, and the Salunis, as optionees, entered into a \u201cLease and Option to Purchase\u201d agreement which superseded the Rental Agreement; (2) on October 20, 1989, the Salunis exercised the option to purchase the Premises; and (3) Schubert is in breach of the option agreement. Defendant relied on HRS \u00a7 604-5(d) (1985) which provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall not have cognizance of... actions in which the title to real estate comes in question[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfH\">On May 25,1990, at the close of a hearing, the district court orally granted the Salunis\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Thereafter, on July 2, 1990, the Salunis filed a \u201cMotion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs.\u201d At a hearing on July 20, 1990, the district court orally denied the motion. On August 1, 1990, the court filed its \u201cOrder re Defendants\u2019 Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4MB\">On August 2, 1991, the court entered its \u201cOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss,\u201d and the Salunis appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We start with the precept that a court may not award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cabsent statute, agreement, stipulation, or precedent authorizing the allowance thereof.\u201d <em>Smothers </em>v. <em>Renander, </em>2 Haw. App. 400, 404, 633 P.2d 556, 560 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Paragraph G.3. of the Rental Agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY1\">If we [landlord] employ an attorney or someone else to collect unpaid rents, you [tenant] must pay: (a) reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of not more than 25% of the unpaid rent; (b) the reasonable costs to collect; plus (c) court costs and interest that we may be entitled to. If you do not obey other terms of this Agreement, we may also employ an attorney to enforce them, and you must also pay for: (1) reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees; plus (2) any court costs and interest on funds owed that we may be entitled to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Record at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">HRS \u00a7 607-17 (1985) provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Attorney\u2019s fees when provided for in promissory notes, etc. Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, where an action is instituted in the district or circuit court on a promissory note or other contract in writing which provides for an attorney\u2019s fee the following rates shall prevail and shall be awarded to the successful party, whether plaintiff or defendant^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Relying on HRS \u00a7 607-17, the Salunis assert that they were the \u201csuccessful parties\u201d in the case and are entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">In construing HRS \u00a7 607-17, our supreme court stated that \u201cwhere a party prevails on the disputed main issue, even though not to the extent of his original contention, he will be deemed to be the successful party for the purpose of taxing costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Food Pantry, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc., </em>58 Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879 (1978) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Here, the disputed main issue was whether Schubert was entitled to possession of the premises and damages because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Salunis\u2019 breach of the Rental Agreement. The district court, however, did not resolve this issue because, based on the Salunis\u2019 motion to dismiss, it was without jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case. Accordingly, there was no successful party on the disputed main issue raised by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The Salunis therefore were not the \u201csuccessful parties\u201d and not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under HRS \u00a7 607-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Nonetheless, the Salunis contend that they were the \u201csuccessful parties\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-17 because the court granted their motion to dismiss Schubert\u2019s case. Since in <em>Food Pantry </em>there was a trial and a decision on the merits of the case, this contention raises an issue of whether there may be a \u201csuccessful party\u201d when the court terminated a case without reaching the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The statute itself does not define the term \u201csuccessful party\u201d \u2014 whether it encompasses only a party that is victorious on the merits of the case or a party that prevails in the case. Thus, HRS \u00a7 607-17 is ambiguous, and \u201cwe may look to the policies behind the enactment of the statutory provisions to ascertain legislative intent.\u201d <em>Zator </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>69 Haw. 594, 597, 752 P.2d 1073, 1075 (1988) (citation omitted). In gleaning legislative intent, we will heed the statutory mandate that \u201c[l]aws <em>in pari materia, </em>or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other.\u201d HRS \u00a7 1-16 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">HRS \u00a7 607-17 is <em>in pari materia </em>with HRS \u00a7 607-14 (1985), which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">Attorneys\u2019 fees in actions in the nature of assumpsit. In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of assumpsit there shall be taxed as attorneys\u2019 fees, in addition to the attorneys\u2019 fees otherwise taxable by law, to be paid by the losing party[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>... The fees provided for by this section shall not be taxed in any action where the plaintiff obtains a judgment which includes attorneys\u2019 fees upon a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness, when the promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness contains a provision for the recovery of costs of collection or attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Although HRS \u00a7 607-17 refers to \u201csuccessful party\u201d and HRS \u00a7 607-14 refers to \u201closing party,\u201d the terms \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201closing\u201d are antonyms, and both sections deal with the same subject matter \u2014 attorneys\u2019 fees. In 1959, when the term \u201csuccessful party\u201d was inserted in HRS \u00a7 607-17, the Senate Judiciary Committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Your Committee believes that it is unfair on a suit on an instrument which provides for any attorney\u2019s fee, to permit the plaintiff to recover such fees from the defendant if plaintiff is successful while permitting the defendant to recover only the modest attorney\u2019s commissions if the defendant obtains judgment in his favor. It is frequently more expensive for a defendant to defend an action successfully than for the plaintiff to prosecute his action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Your Committee has therefor [sic] also amended the bill to permit either successful party to recover attorney\u2019s fees as provided by the instrument, subject to the limitations as set forth in the Bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 623, in 1959 Senate Journal at 837. The \u201cmodest attorney\u2019s commissions\u201d referred to in the committee report is the \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees\u201d taxable to the losing party under HRS \u00a7 607-14. Thus, we must construe the provisions in HRS \u00a7 607-17 with reference to those in HRS \u00a7 607-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Regarding HRS \u00a7 607-14, the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court held that \u201cunder construction given to this statute for some forty years, defendant may tax as fees <em>only in case of a judgment upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>the merits.\u201d Yoshida v. Nobrega, Adm\u2019r, </em>39 Haw. 254 (1952) (emphasis added). In <em>Yoshida, </em>in an assumpsit action, the circuit court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. However, the defendant was not entitled to tax attorney\u2019s fee against the plaintiff as the \u201closing party\u201d because the judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor was not on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We conclude that the legislature\u2019s intent, when it amended HRS \u00a7 607-17 in 1959, was to award attorney\u2019s fees thereunder consistent with such award pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-14. In other words, since a \u201closing party\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-14 was the party who lost on the \u201cmerits,\u201d a \u201csuccessful party\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-17 would be the party who won on the \u201cmerits\u201d of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Here, the Salunis did not win on the merits of the case. Consequently, they were not the \u201csuccessful parties\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-17, and were properly denied an award of attorney\u2019s fees thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">It is unclear from the record on what basis the district court denied the Salunis an allowance of costs. The fact that the Salunis were not \u201csuccessful parties\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-17 did not automatically preclude them from an allowance of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Generally, in a civil case in a district court, allowance or taxation of costs is governed by HRS \u00a7 607-9 (Supp. 1992) and District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 54(d). HRS \u00a7 607-9 specifies what types of actual disbursements may be allowed in taxation of costs. DCRCP Rule 54(d) provides in part that \u201ccosts shall be allowed as of course to the <em>prevailing party </em>unless the court otherwise directs[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The DCRCP do not define the term \u201cprevailing party.\u201d The interpretation of the counterpart Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), however, is \u201chighly persuasive ... in the construction of our Rules[.]\u201d <em>Ellis v. Crockett, </em>51 Haw. 45, 61, 451 P.2d 814, 824 (1969) (citation omitted). For purposes of FRCP Rule 54(d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u201c[u]sually the litigant in whose favor judgment is rendered is the prevailing party____Thus, a dismissal of the action, whether on the merits or not, generally means that defendant is the prevailing party.\u201d 10 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d \u00a7 2667, at 178-80 (1983) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Accordingly, the Salunis, who succeeded in having the case dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, were the prevailing parties below. Under DCRCP Rule 54(d), the Salunis were entitled to an allowance of costs as of course unless the district court in its discretion directed otherwise. Here, the record fails to disclose why the court denied the Salunis an allowance of costs, other than the fact that they were not \u201csuccessful parties\u201d under HRS \u00a7 607-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Pursuant to Hawai\u2018i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schubert contends that the Salunis\u2019 appeal is frivolous and seeks an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">A frivolous appeal is one \u201cmanifestly and palpably without merit so as to indicate bad faith on appellant\u2019s part.\u201d <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co. </em>v. <em>The Makahuena Corp., </em>66 Haw. 663, 672 n.5, 675 P.2d 760, 767 n.5 (1984). Inasmuch as the district court\u2019s August 1, 1990 order is being vacated in part, we determine that the Salunis\u2019 appeal is not manifestly and palpably without merit and therefore not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Accordingly, we affirm that part of the district court\u2019s August 1, 1990 \u201cOrder re Defendants\u2019 Motion for Attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Fees\u201d denying an award of attorney\u2019s fees and vacate the part thereof denying an allowance of costs. Upon remand, \u201c[i]n determining whether and what costs should be taxed, the [district] court may consider the equities of the situation.\u201d HRS \u00a7 607-9 (Supp. 1992).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Akd\"><em>Roger C. Lerud </em>on the briefs for defendants-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ASi\"><em>Leland B. T. Look </em>on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\"> The record discloses that on June 29, 1990, the Salunis filed a complaint against Schubert and others in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in Civil No. 90-2011-06, alleging breach of the \u201cLease and Option to Purchase\u201d agreement, dated May 27,1988, and seeking a constructive trust on the Premises and general and punitive damages. Schubert counterclaimed, seeking an adjudication of the rights and duties of the parties under both the Rental Agreement and Lease and Option to Purchase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> This is the second appeal in the case. On August 10,1990, the Salunis filed their initial notice of appeal. This court; however, dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Schubert </em>v. <em>Saluni, </em>memo. op. (No. 14747, July 10, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-13\"> Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">If a Hawaii appellate court shall determine that an appeal decided by it was frivolous, it may award damages including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the appellee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
