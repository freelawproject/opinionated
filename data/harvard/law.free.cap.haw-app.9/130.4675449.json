We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the DUI conviction and remand the case with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal for Defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">On June 17, 1990, Defendant was arrested for DUI. At the police station, Defendant consented to a breath test. The breath test administered on the Intoxilyzer indicated a blood alcohol concentration of 0.12 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">At trial, Honolulu Police Department (HPD) criminalist Gilbert Chang (Chang), a certified intoxilyzer operator-supervisor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>testified that (1) certified operator-supervisors periodically test or calibrate the HPD\u2019s intoxilyzers for accuracy; (2) the testing is done with two simulator solutions or reference samples of different alcohol concentration as required by \u201cTitle 11,\u201d which is the State Department of Health\u2019s Rules for the Testing of Blood, Breath and Other Bodily Substances for Alcohol Concentration (Rules); (3) testing by a beam attenuator<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is also conducted; (4) after completion of the testing, the operator-supervisor enters into the record book or log book, which is kept at Chang\u2019s desk and is under Chang\u2019s control, the date and results of the testing for accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The court admitted into evidence, over Defendant\u2019s objection, a copy of a page of the record book (Log) that Chang brought into court. The Log showed that on May 31, 1990, and June 28, 1990, the Intoxilyzer had been tested for accuracy by a beam attenuator and two simulator solutions of 0.05 percent and 0.30 percent alcohol concentration, respectively. Based on the initials \u201cJW\u201d on the Log, Chang testified that John Wadahara (Wadahara) had tested the Intoxilyzer for accuracy on those dates. Chang stated that the Log indicated that the Intoxilyzer was operating accurately on May 31 and June 28, 1990. Wadahara did not testify in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The court admitted the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence over Defendant\u2019s objection. The court found Defendant guilty of DUI, commenting \u201chad there been no [breath] test in this case, I would have been inclined to find [Defendant] not guilty.\u201d October 1, 1990 Transcript at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Section 11-111-2.1(j)(2) of the Rules requires testing for accuracy of all breath testing instruments \u201cnot less frequently than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>every thirty days[.]\u201d Section 11-111\u20142.1(k) of the Rules provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">(k) The recommended calibration testing method shall use a minimum of two reference samples of known alcohol concentration at a known temperature within the range of one hundredths to thirty hundredths per cent weight per volume or higher known alcohol concentrations that are recommended by the breath testing instrument\u2019s manufacturer. The results of the analysis shall agree with the reference sample value within the limits of plus or minus one hundredths per cent weight per volume jar such limits set by the director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>6 Haw. App. 554, 559, 732 P.2d 253, 257 (1987), we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">[I]n meeting the foundational prerequisites for the admission of the Intoxilyzer test result there must be a showing of strict compliance with those provisions of the Rules which have a direct bearing on the validity and accuracy of the test result. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Section 11-111-2.1(k) \u201chas a direct bearing on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer test result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamasaki, </em>7 Haw.App. 542, 544, 783 P.2d 1235, 1238 (1989). Thus, a showing of strict compliance with that section is a foundational prerequisite in order to admit a breath test result into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Defendant contends that the foundational prerequisite was not met because (1) the Log itself and Chang\u2019s testimony regarding Wadahara\u2019s testing of the Intoxilyzer constituted hearsay and were improperly admitted into evidence and (2) the admission of such evidence violated Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation. We disagree. Defendant further contends that the record lacks evidence of \u201cknown temperature\u201d of the two reference samples of known alcohol concentration, as required by section 11-111-2.1(k). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"ApO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The information on the Log was clearly hearsay. However, the court admitted it under the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule set forth in Hawai\u2018i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(8)(B) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel,... unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">HRE Rule 803 exceptions to the hearsay rule \u201cdo not depend upon the present status or whereabouts of the declarant.\u201d Rule 803 Commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The Log falls within the HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) exception. It constitutes a record or report of a public agency, the HPD. It includes matters observed and reported by a HPD operator-supervisor who tested the Intoxilyzer for accuracy as required by provisions of the Rules. The only issue is whether the Log is excludable from the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule as \u201cmatters observed by ... law enforcement personnel\u201d in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Federal Rules of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) 803(8)(B) is identical to HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B). In construing the exclusion provision of Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(B), the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit took a very restrictive view, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">in criminal cases reports of public agencies setting forth matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel and reports of public agencies setting forth factual findings resulting from investigations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>made pursuant to authority granted by law cannot satisfy the standards of any hearsay exceptions if those reports are sought to be introduced against the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45, 84 (2d Cir. 1977). The <em>Oates </em>restrictive view has been criticized. <em>See 4 </em>J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 803(8)[04] (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe exclusionary provisions of Rule 803(8)(B) were intended to apply to observations made by law enforcement officials at the scene of a crime or the apprehension of the accused and not \u2018records of routine, nonadversarial matters\u2019 made in a nonadversarial setting.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilmer, </em>799 F.2d 495, 500-01 (9th Cir. 1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. 1004, 107 S. Ct. 1626, 95 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1987) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orozco, </em>590 F.2d 789, 793 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 920, 99 S. Ct. 2845, 61 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1979)). <em>Wilmer </em>held that, in a DUI case, the calibration report of a breathalyzer maintenance operator is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(B). <em>See United States v. DeWater, </em>846 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1988) (in a DUI case, the intoxilyzer test results were admissible under the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We opt to follow the rationale in the <em>Orozco, Wilmer, </em>and <em>DeWater </em>cases. Clearly, Wadahara\u2019s report in the Log of his testing of the Intoxilyzer for accuracy on the specified dates constituted a record of routine, nonadversarial matters made in a nonadversarial setting. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>66 Or. App. 703, 707, 675 P.2d 510, 512 (1984) (certificates of breathalyzer inspections relate to \u201cthe routine function of testing breathalyzer equipment to insure that it gives accurate readings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Moreover, based on the record, we conclude that neither the sources of information nor other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness of the information reported in the Log. As indicated above, the testing or calibration of the Intoxilyzer by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Wadahara was routine and nonadversarial. Wadahara had no personal stake in the outcome of individual cases. His duty was to test the Intoxilyzer for accuracy and report the results in the Log. <em>See DeWater, </em>846 F.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As the custodian of the Log and a certified intoxilyzer operator-supervisor, Chang explained what appeared on the Log and what the written items meant. Such testimony did not constitute hearsay. Based on the Log and other exhibits in evidence, Chang gave his opinion testimony regarding the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer. Such opinion testimony was allowable under HRE Rule 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Log into evidence and denying Defendant\u2019s objections to Chang\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), the Supreme Court indicated that the Confrontation Clause restricts the range of admissible hearsay by requiring the prosecution to either produce, or show the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement is sought to be used against the defendant or demonstrate the trustworthiness of the hearsay sought to be admitted. Relying on <em>Roberts, </em>Defendant asserts that the district court\u2019s admission of the Log violated his rights of confrontation guaranteed by the United States and Hawai\u2018i Constitutions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>In a very recent case, the Supreme Court reiterated its statement in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S. Ct. 1121, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1986), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\"><em>Roberts </em>stands for the proposition that unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the Confrontation Clause inquiry only when the challenged out-of-court statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>White v. </em>Illinois, _ U.S. _, _, 112 S. Ct. 736, 741, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 858 (1992). The Supreme Court stressed that it \u201crefused to extend the unavailability requirement established in <em>Roberts </em>to all out-of-court statements.\u201d _ U.S. at _, 112 S. Ct. at 741-42, 116 L. Ed. 2d at 858. Furthermore, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cwhere proffered hearsay has sufficient guarantees of reliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.\u201d _ U.S. at 112 S. Ct. at 743, 116 L. Ed. 2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule is firmly rooted in our jurisprudence. HRE Rule 803 Commentary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">Traditional common law doctrine has consistently recognized the admissibility of public records under a hearsay exception, predicated on the same general indicia of reliability and trustworthiness as for business records[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-14\"><em>See DeWater, </em>846 F.2d at 530 (the exception is \u201cfirmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence\u201d that an independent inquiry into the reliability of the records and reports is unnecessary); <em>State v. Conway, </em>70 Or. App. 721, 723, 690 P.2d 1128, 1129 (1984) (the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>records exception to the hearsay rule has a firm basis in common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We therefore conclude that there has been no violation of Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In <em>Hamasaki, </em>we held that there must be a showing of strict compliance with the provisions of section 11-111-2.1(k) of the Rules in laying a foundation for the admission of an intoxilyzer test result into evidence. Defendant argues that the State failed to show the \u201cknown temperature\u201d of the simulator solutions used to test the Intoxilyzer on May 31 and June 28, 1990. Defendant therefore asserts that the district court erred in admitting the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The Log established that on the two dates in question Wadahara tested the Intoxilyzer for accuracy with simulator solutions of 0.05 percent and 0.30 percent alcohol concentration and the Intoxilyzer registered results within 0.01 percent as required by section 11-111-2.1(k). However, the Log did not indicate the temperature of the simulator solutions. Chang admitted that he had no personal knowledge of Wadahara\u2019s testing of the Intoxilyzer on the dates in question other than what was shown on the Log.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The State argues, however, that section 11-111-2.1(k) merely refers to \u201cconcentration at a known temperature\u201d and the temperature of the simulator solutions Wadahara used \u201csurely was \u2018known.\u2019 \u201d The State further argues that section 11-111-6(a)(2) of the Rules requires only the name of the calibration operator, \u201c[reference control lot number and results,\u201d and dates of the calibration to be included in the record book, not the \u201cknown temperature\u201d of the reference sample or simulator solution. These arguments are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Section 11-111-2.1(k) refers to \u201cknown temperature... recommended by the breath testing instrument\u2019s manufacturer.\u201d In other words, a section 11-111-2.1(k) testing must be done with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>a simulator solution of a certain temperature recommended by the intoxilyzer\u2019s manufacturer. Also, the fact that section 11\u2014111\u20146(a)(2) does not include the \u201cknown temperature\u201d of the simulator solution to be included in the record book does not abrogate any of the requirements in section 11-111-2.1(k). Section 11-111\u20146(a)(2) merely specifies the minimum information to be included in the record book. Nothing precludes the insertion of the \u201cknown temperature\u201d of the simulator solutions or reference samples by the operator-supervisor conducting the testing in the record book.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We conclude that the foundation laid for the admission of the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence was insufficient. Therefore, the court abused its discretion in admitting the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The district court\u2019s admission of the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence compels a vacation of the DUI conviction. The question is whether we should remand the case for retrial or with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal for Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bannister, </em>60 Haw. 658, 660, 594 P.2d 133, 134 (1979), a case involving a first degree theft conviction in a jury-waived trial, the supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">Where a judgment is reversed for insufficiency of the evidence, as opposed to reversal for trial error, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prevents a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In <em>Bannister, </em>the supreme court concluded that the store manager\u2019s inadmissible hearsay evidence was the sole evidence with respect to a necessary element of the charged offense. The court deemed that its reversal of the conviction was for insufficiency of the evidence rather than for trial error. Consequently, it remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the case with instructions to the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Arakaki, </em>7 Haw. App. 48, 744 P.2d 783 (1987), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>by <em>State v. Dow, </em>72 Haw. 56, 61, 806 P.2d 402, 405 (1991), the prosecution conceded on appeal that because of insufficient foundation the intoxilyzer test result had been improperly admitted into evidence. Relying on <em>Bannister, </em>the defendant argued that a retrial would subject him to double jeopardy. We distinguished <em>Bannister </em>by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">The hearsay evidence in <em>Bannister </em>was held to be inadmissible under well-settled principles of evidence law. [Citation omitted.] Neither of the DUI cases which required strict compliance with Chapter 111 of Title 11 of the Hawai\u2018i Administrative Rules with reference to the testing of the accuracy of the intoxilyzer, <em>State v. Rolison, 6 </em>Haw. App. [569], 733 P.2d 326 (1987); <em>State v. Souza, </em>6 Haw. App. [554], 732 P.2d 253 (1987), had been decided at the time of the trial of this case. Thus, unlike the disputed evidence in <em>Bannister, </em>the evidence at issue in this case was admitted, but not contrary to well-settled principles of evidence law. We therefore apply the rule that \u201cevidentiary points that involve matters of first impression\u201d in this state constitute \u201ctrial error and not any insufficiency of the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Van Isler, </em>283 S.E.2d 836, 838 (W. Va. 1981). <em>See also People </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>31 Cal. 3d 18, 723 P.2d 1354, 181 Cal. Rptr. 243 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\"><em>Arakaki, </em>7 Haw. App. at 58, 744 P.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Our rationale in <em>Arakaki </em>is not applicable in the case at bar. Here, the case was tried in October 1990, well after we decided <em>Hamasaki </em>on December 1, 1989. <em>Hamasaki </em>clearly indicated that a strict compliance with section 11-111-2.1(k) of the Rules required a showing at trial that <em>\u201cthe two reference samples </em>used for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>calibration testing of the Intoxilyzer <em>be at a known </em>temperature.\u201d 7 Haw. App. at 545, 783 P.2d at 1238 (emphasis in original). Thus, the evidentiary matter at issue in this case was not an evidentiary point of first impression.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_L\"><em>Winston D.M. Ling, </em>Deputy Public Defender, on the brief for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ar8\"><em>Patricia A. Loo, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Accordingly, our reversal of the DUI conviction based on the improperly admitted Intoxilyzer test result is for insufficiency of the evidence, not for trial error. Therefore, the State may not retry the DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We conclude that the district court (1) did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Log and Chang\u2019s testimony into evidence and (2) did not violate Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation by its evidentiary rulings. The court, however, abused its discretion in admitting the Intoxilyzer test result into evidence because the foundation laid for its admission was insufficient. The resulting reversal is for insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the DUI conviction and remand the case with instructions for an entry of judgment of acquittal for Defendant. However, we affirm the driving on the left side of the roadway judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291-4(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Driving under influence of intoxicating liquor, (a) A person commits the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">(1) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">(2) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle with 0.10 per cent or more, by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\"> Defendant Moonga Ofa (Defendant) also appealed his conviction of driving on the left side of the roadway in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-46(a) (1985).
