This opinion decides both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Pursuant to a lease that commenced on January 1, 1957, an arbitration panel on April 26, 1991 decided the amount of the lease rent payable for the ten-year period beginning January 1, 1987. Upon the application of the lessor, Applicant Excelsior Lodge Number One, Independent Order of Odd Fellows (Lessor-Excelsior), a Hawaii eleemosynary corporation, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>confirmed the arbitration panel\u2019s award. In Nos. 15435 and 15658 the lessee, Respondent Eyecor, Ltd. (Lessee-Eyecor), a Hawai\u2018i corporation, appeals the circuit court\u2019s June 10,1991 Order Granting Applicant\u2019s Motion for Confirmation of Arbitration Award Filed on April 26, 1991 (June 10, 1991 Order Confirming Arbitration Award). In No. 15658, Lessee-Eyecor and the sublessee, Respondent Atkinson Towers, Inc. (Sublessee-Atkinson), a cooperative housing corporation as defined in Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 519-3 (1985 and Supp. 1991), appeal the circuit court\u2019s October 1, 1991 order denying Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s May 6, 1991 motion for reconsideration of the circuit court\u2019s April 24, 1991 order deciding that HRS \u00a7 519-3 did not impose a ceiling on the amount of the lease rent legally due from Lessee-Eyecor to Lessor-Excelsior.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We dismiss No. 15435 for lack of appellate jurisdiction. In No. 15658, we vacate the June 10,1991 Order Confirming Arbitration Award and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Lessor-Excelsior owns the land at 419A Atkinson Drive, Honolulu, subject to a March 30, 1957 lease (Lease) to LesseeEyecor\u2019s predecessor in interest and a sublease to SublesseeAtkinson\u2019s predecessor in interest. The term of the Lease is sixty years commencing January 1, 3957. The Lease fixed the rent for the first twenty years through December 31, 1976. The rent for each ten-year period thereafter is by agreement. If the parties are unable to agree, each shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">choose an appraiser and these two shall choose a third appraiser. All such appraisers shall be recognized and qualified appraisers____The appraisers shall deduct from the value found by them the total amount of buildings erected by the Lessees and also any improvement assessments or charges which shall have been levied against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>demised premises and paid by the Lessees or for which the Lessees are required to reimburse the Lessor under the terms of this lease. The value found by a majority of the appraisers, less said deductions, shall be deemed the \u201cappraised value\u201d for the purposes of their determining the rental [under the lease].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Lease also states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">5. That the Lessees will not, without the consent in writing of the Lessor, assign or mortgage this lease or sublet the whole or any part of said premises; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Lessor will not unreasonably withhold such consent, and will not require the payment of any moneys as consideration for the giving of such consent; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Lessees may, without such consent, (a) sublet or rent rooms or apartments in the operation of an apartment house business on the premises; (b) assign this lease by way of mortgage to a recognized lending institution for the purpose of financing the cost of erecting buildings on the premises herein demised or any additions or improvements to such buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">On October 10,1958 Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s predecessor in interest subleased (Sublease) 419A Atkinson Drive to Atkinson Building, Inc. Lessor-Excelsior consented in writing to the Sublease. On October 10,1960 Atkinson Building, Inc., assigned its sublessee\u2019s interest in the Sublease to Sublessee-Atkinson. Lessor-Excelsior consented in writing to the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The Sublease expires one day prior to the expiration of the Lease. After December 31,1976 the Sublease rent is the same as the Lease rent. The Sublease provides \u201cthat the Sublessor hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>constitutes and appoints the Sublessee its agent for the purposes of negotiating the rental to be paid during each ten-year period following December 31, 1976 with said Lessor[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">HRS \u00a7 519-3, which became effective on June 12, 1982, states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">(a) All leases, including subleases executed by a cooperative housing corporation as lessee, and all leases, including subleases acquired by a cooperative housing corporation by assignment, whether executed prior to or after June 12, 1982, which directly or by incorporation provide for reopening of the contract for renegotiation of lease rent terms, shall provide or be construed in conformity with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">(2) Upon renegotiation, the lease rent payable by a cooperative housing corporation as lessee, sublessee, or assignee shall not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the \u201cowner\u2019s basis\u201d by the original percentage rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">(d) For purposes of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">(1) \u201cCooperative housing corporation\u201d means a corporation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">(A) Having one and only one class of stock outstanding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">(B) Each of the stockholders of which is entitled solely by reason of the shareholder\u2019s ownership of stock in the corporation, to occupy for dwelling purposes the dwelling unit in a building, owned or leased by the corporation, and situated on land leased by the corporation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">(C) No stockholder of which is entitled (either conditionally or unconditionally) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>receive any distribution not out of earnings and profits of the corporation except in a complete or partial liquidation of the corporation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABqN\">(D) Eighty per cent or more of the gross income for the taxable year in which the taxes and interest described in 26 U.S.C. section 216(a) are paid or incurred is derived from tenant stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">(4) \u201cOwner\u2019s basis\u201d means the value of the lessor\u2019s leased fee interest in the property that would apply if such interest were normally traded on an open market.

The order, which was prepared by Lessor-Excelsior\u2019s attorney, did not state that HRS \u00a7 519-3 was inapplicable. It stated that Lessee-Eyecor and SublesseeAtkinson were \u201ccompelled to participate in the arbitration/appraisal process to determine lease rent for the ten year period commencing January 1,1987, and as required under the recorded Indenture of Lease[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>April 12, 1990 The two arbitrators appointed the third.</p>\n<p id=\"APx\">April 4, 1991 Lessee-Eyecor moved in circuit court for a ruling that HRS \u00a7 519-3 precluded the Lease rent from exceeding \u201cthe amount derived by multiplying the \u2018Owner\u2019s basis\u2019 by the original percentage rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqPW\">April 10, 1991 The arbitrators conducted their site inspection and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"ALh\">April 24,1991 Consistent with its April 17, 1991 oral ruling, the circuit court entered an order \u201cby way of clarification and for the limited purposes of the arbitration between [Lessor-Excelsior] and [Sublessee]-Eyecor, that [HRS] \u00a7 519-3 is not applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">April 26, 1991 The arbitrators awarded an annual rent of $169,200.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh7\">April 26, 1991 Lessor-Excelsior moved for confirmation of the April 26, 1991 arbitration award plus ten percent interest as authorized by HRS \u00a7 478-2(1).</p>\n<p id=\"AKr\">May 6, 1991 Lessee-Eyecor filed a Hawai\u2018i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59 motion for reconsideration of the circuit court\u2019s April 24, 1991 order. The certificate of service states that the motion was hand delivered to Lessor-Excelsior on May 6, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Mq\">May 6, 1991 Lessee-Eyecor filed a notice of appeal of the circuit court\u2019s orders of April 3,1990 and April 24, 1991. This is appeal No. 15322.</p>\n<p id=\"Aay\">June 10, 1991 The circuit court entered its June 10,1991 Order Confirming Arbitration Award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>which confirmed the April 26,1991 arbitration award and awarded interest at ten percent on the unpaid amounts from January 1, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad0s\">June 24, 1991 Lessee-Eyecor filed a notice of appeal of the circuit court\u2019s June 10, 1991 order. This is appeal No. 15435. '</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">July 23, 1991 The Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court dismissed No. 15322 for lack of appellate jurisdiction implicitly because (1) it was not a timely appeal of the April 3, 1990 order and (2) Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s May 6, 1991 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration remained undecided.</p>\n<p id=\"A9g\">October 1, 1991 The circuit court entered an order denying Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s May 6, 1991 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">October 15, 1991 Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson filed a notice of appeal of the circuit court\u2019s orders dated April 3, 1990, April 24, 1991, June 10, 1991, and October 1, 1991. This is appeal No. 15658.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">The first issue is appellate jurisdiction. The question is whether Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s May 6,1991 motion for reconsideration was served later than required by HRCP Rule 59(e). Although Lessee-Eyecor\u2019s certificate of service stated that its May 6, 1991 motion for reconsideration was timely served on May 6, 1991, Lessor-Excelsior filed papers in opposition to the motion contending that it was untimely served on May 7,1991. The circuit court did not decide this dispute of fact and Lessor-Excelsior did not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the circuit court or on appeal challenge the circuit court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">If the motion for reconsideration was served on May 6,1991, we have jurisdiction over No. 15658. If it was served on May 7, 1991, we do not have jurisdiction over No. 15658 but we have jurisdiction over No. 15435. Based on the record before us, we conclude that we have jurisdiction, over No. 15658.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Lessor-Excelsior contends that (1) the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 1990 order decided that HRS \u00a7 519-3 was inapplicable and (2) we do not have appellate jurisdiction over the April 3, 1990 order because Lessee-Eyecor failed to appeal it within thirty days of its entry. Based on our conclusion that the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 1990 order did not decide that HRS \u00a7 519-3 was inapplicable, we disagree with Lessor-Excelsior\u2019s contention (1). The circuit court\u2019s April 24,1991 order may have been consistent with a prior oral decision of the circuit court, but, in the absence of any prior circuit court order entered (written and filed) on the subject, it did not \u201cclarify\u201d a prior \u201corder\u201d of the circuit court. Our disagreement with (1) moots (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The circuit court\u2019s April 3, 1990 order prohibited LesseeEyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson from appointing Medusky as an arbitrator. Lessor-Excelsior contends that Lessee-Eyecor had only thirty days from April 3,1990 in which to appeal the April 3, 1990 order and, because it did not do so, we do not have appellate jurisdiction over the April 3,1990 order. Based on HRS \u00a7 658-15 (1985), we conclude that the April 3,1990 order was not a final and appealable order. HRS \u00a7 658-15 states, \u201cUnless the agreement for award provides that no appeal may be taken an appeal may be taken from an order vacating an award, or from a judgment entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>upon an award, as from an order or judgment in an action, otherwise no appeal may be had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson contend that the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 1990 order erroneously barred them from appointing Medusky as an arbitrator and, therefore, that the arbitration panel was improperly constituted and without any power to arbitrate the dispute in this case. We do not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The record shows that after the circuit court entered its order barring Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson from appointing Medusky as an arbitrator, Lessor-Excelsior appointed an arbitrator, Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson appointed an arbitrator other than Medusky, the two arbitrators appointed the third arbitrator, and this arbitration panel issued the April 26, 1991 award. Based on these facts and the record, we conclude that (1) there is no evidence that Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson suffered any prejudice from the order barring them from appointing Medusky; and (2) Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson waived their right to challenge the April 3,1990 order barring them from appointing Medusky as an arbitrator. If Lessee-Eyecor and Sublessee-Atkinson wanted to retain the right to challenge the April 3, 1990 order barring them from appointing Medusky as an arbitrator, they had to refrain from appointing a replacement and leave Lessor-Excelsior with no alternative but to ask the circuit court to name a replacement pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Lessor-Excelsior argues that the only way Lessee-Eyecor could have challenged the June 10,1991 Order Confirming Arbitration Award was by filing an HRS \u00a7 658-9 motion to vacate the award and/or an HRS \u00a7 658-10 motion to modify or correct the award and serving them as required by HRS \u00a7 658-11 within ten days after the June 10,1991 Order Confirming Arbitration Award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>was served. We disagree. A party who disagrees with an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrators have exceeded their powers has two opportunities to challenge it. First, the party may file an HRS \u00a7 658-9 application to vacate the award and serve it as required by HRS \u00a7 658-11. Second, the party may wait until the other party applies pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-8 to confirm the award and then challenge the confirmation motion pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-9. <em>Gozum </em>v. <em>American Int'l Adjustment Co., </em>72 Haw. 41, 45-46, 805 P.2d 445, 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Relying on <em>Westin Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Inv., Inc., </em>72 Haw. 178, 811 P.2d 467, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>72 Haw. 617, 841 P.2d 1074 (1991), and <em>Mars Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., </em>51 Haw. 332, 460 P.2d 317 (1969), Lessor-Excelsior contends that the question of the applicability of HRS \u00a7 519-3 was submitted to the arbitration panel and that we are powerless to review the panel\u2019s decision in that respect. We disagree that the question of the applicability of HRS \u00a7 519-3 was submitted to the arbitration panel. Before the arbitration panel made its award, the circuit court ruled that HRS \u00a7 519-3 was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Moreover, if HRS \u00a7 519-3 is applicable and the award of the arbitration panel violates it, then the award of the arbitration panel is subject to a timely challenge under HRS \u00a7 658-9(4) on the ground that it exceeded its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">According to the Sublease, (1) Sublessee-Atkinson is LesseeEyecor\u2019s agent for negotiating the Lease rent payable to LesseeEyecor to Lessor-Excelsior and (2) the amount of the Sublease rent legally due from Sublessee-Atkinson to Lessee-Eyecor after December 31, 1976 is the same as the amount of the Lease rent legally due from Lessee-Eyecor to Lessor-Excelsior plus the general excise taxes legally due from Lessee-Eyecor to the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Hawai\u2018i assessed on the Sublease rent. HRS \u00a7 519-3 imposes a ceiling on the amount of the Sublease rent legally due from Sublessee-Atkinson to Lessee-Eyecor. The question is whether HRS \u00a7 519-3 imposes an identical ceiling on the amount of the Lease rent legally due from Lessee-Eyecor to Lessor-Excelsior. If it does not, Lessee-Eyecor may be legally obligated to pay Lessor-Excelsior more Lease rent than the Sublease rent it is legally entitled to collect from Sublessee-Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In our view, HRS \u00a7 519-3 is not ambiguous. Ambiguous or not, however, the result is the same. HRS \u00a7 519-3 covers \u201c[a]ll leases, including subleases\u201d where a cooperative housing corporation is the lessee or sublessee of the land and its stockholders occupy for dwelling purposes the building(s) on the land. It imposes a ceiling on the amount of the rent legally due all along the entire strata or chain from the sublessee cooperative housing corporation to the lessor. It imposes a ceiling on the amount of the sublease rent legally due from the sublessee-cooperative housing corporation to the lessee-sublessor and it imposes the same ceiling on the lease rent legally due from the lessee-sublessor to the lessor. Therefore, we conclude that HRS \u00a7 519-3 imposes the same ceiling on the amount of the Lease rent legally due from LesseeEyecor to Lessor-Excelsior as it imposes on the amount of the Sublease rent legally due from Sublessee-Atkinson to LesseeEyecor.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Upon remand, proof that the arbitrators\u2019 April 26,1991 award exceeded the Lease rent ceiling imposed by HRS \u00a7 519-3 will entitle Lessee-Eyecor to an order vacating the April 26, 1991 award under HRS \u00a7 658-9(4) because the arbitrators exceeded their powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Lessor-Excelsior contends .that this appeal is frivolous. We disagree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>G. Stephen Elisha, Philip L. Lahne, Richard S.
