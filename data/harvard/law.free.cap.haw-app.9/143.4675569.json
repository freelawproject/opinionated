Puna Geothermal Venture, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Haw. App. 203, 797 P.2d 69 (1990) <em>(Pele I), </em>Plaintiffs-Appellants Pele Defense Fund, a Hawai\u2018i non-profit corporation, Aurora Martinovich, Robert Petricci, Steven Philips, Susan Philips, Gregory Pommerenk, and Deborah Pommerenk (collectively Plaintiffs) filed this action below <em>(Pele II) </em>seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. On November 5,1990, the circuit court, in separate orders, denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and granted Defendant-Appellee Puna Geothermal Venture\u2019s (Defendant) motion to dismiss with prejudice. Plaintiffs appeal only the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Pele II </em>stems, as did <em>Pele </em>I, from the Hawaii County Planning Commission\u2019s (Commission) award to Defendant of Geothermal Resource Permit No. 2 (GRP-2) and centers on condition 51 of GRP-2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleges that (1) condition 51 can never be complied with and, consequently, GRP-2 is null and void (claim 1); (2) condition 51 was not complied with and, therefore, any construction activity under GRP-2 would be illegal (claim 2); and (3) Defendant\u2019s construction work would create excessive noise, and since Defendant had not obtained a permit for excessive noise as required by Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 342F (Supp. 1991), the construction work would be illegal (claim 3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tiffs asked the lower court (1) to declare (a) that condition 51 had not been and could not be satisfied, and (b) that Defendant\u2019s construction activity would create excessive noise, and (2) to enjoin any further activity under GRP-2 until all of condition 51 \u2019s terms had been met and Defendant had obtained a permit regulating excessive noise from the Health Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed under Rule 12(b)(6), Hawai\u2018i Rules of Civil Procedure (1980), and was accompanied by a number of documents. Since the documents were not excluded by the court, our review is governed by the principles regarding summary judgment. <em>Rosa v. CWJ Contractors, Ltd., 4 </em>Haw. App. 210, 664 P.2d 745 (1983). We are obliged to determine from the record whether there is no genuine issue of material fact and Defendant was entitled to judgment on all claims as a matter of law. <em>See Kukui Nuts of Hawai'i, Inc. v. R. Baird &amp; Co., </em>7 Haw. App. 598, 789 P.2d 501 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The answering brief accuses Plaintiffs of enmeshing Defendant and GRP-2 in \u201c... protracted and repetitious litigation,\u201d causing Defendant \u201cto incur substantial expense and delay resulting from two extended public hearings, a lengthy mediation process, a protracted appeal aggravated by dilatory briefing and repetitious motions[.]\u201d The record certainly portrays a long-standing dispute between the residents of Puna and the proponents of geothermal development.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We take judicial notice of the dispute and the further fact that geothermal development is viewed by proponents throughout the State as essential to providing for the State\u2019s energy needs. The importance of the issue demands that our citizenry, the government agencies concerned, and the courts ensure that all the necessary prerequisites to geothermal development as established by the pertinent statutes be conscientiously observed. This action must be viewed in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"AHN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Defendant argues that claims 1 and 2 are barred by res judicata and that claim 3 is barred by collateral estoppel. Plaintiffs argue that their claims are not barred by res judicata. We agree with Defendant regarding claims 1 and 3. With respect to claim 2, we hold it is not barred by res judicata. We will discuss claims 1 and 3, first, followed by claim 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Claim 1</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Claim 1 is the same as that presented in <em>Pele I </em>that condition 51 could never be satisfied. As an attack on the validity of GRP-2, claim 1 is res judicata. <em>Hall </em>v. State, 7 Haw. App. 274, 756 P.2d 1048, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 803, 109 S. Ct. 33, 102 L. Ed. 2d 13 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Claim 3</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The record in <em>Pele I </em>indicates that the potential for noise generated by Defendant played a large role in the controversy over the issuance of GRP-2. The issue of whether Defendant was required to obtain a permit for excessive noise from the State Department of Health could have been raised in <em>Pele I. </em>Consequently, the issue is res judicata.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Claim 2</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Condition 51 requires (1) the State and Defendant to initially \u201ccontribute\u201d funds to \u201c[the Geothermal Asset Fund (GAF)] or other appropriate existing fund\u201d to be used for \u201cgeothermal impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>mitigation efforts\u201d within the Puna district,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) the County of Hawai\u2018i (County) to promulgate, with the participation of Puna residents, rules and regulations for the administration of GAF. Plaintiffs contend that those requirements must be met before building and construction permits may be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The testimony below shows that Defendant had obtained permits for some of its building and construction activities on its geothermal drilling site and was carrying on such activities at the time of the hearing below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The testimony also shows that no rules or regulations regarding the administration of GAF have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Plaintiffs assert that the State\u2019s contribution to GAF is subject to reimbursement and does not meet condition 5 l\u2019s terms. For that reason, and because the rules and regulations have not been promulgated, Plaintiffs argue that condition 51 has not been satisfied, and any building and construction permits were illegally issued.</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">Claim 2 is different from the claim in <em>Pele </em>I, and was presaged by our statement there that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Whether or not condition 5 l\u2019s terms have been complied with becomes pertinent when Respondent applies for its first building or construction permit. Presumably, it will not be able to obtain any permit unless condition 51 has been met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\"><em>Pele </em>I, 8 Haw. App. at 209, 797 P.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Indeed, claim 2 could not have been raised until the State made its contribution to GAF and Defendant applied for and obtained building and construction permits. Those events did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>take place until after the November 2, 1989 appeal in <em>Pele I. </em>The record indicates that the legislature did not authorize the State\u2019s contribution to GAF until the 1990 legislative session, Act 299, \u00a7 5(30), 1990 Haw. Sess. Laws 672, 710,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the contribution was not deposited until some time after January 30, 1990. We do not know when Defendant applied for and obtained its building and construction permits. However, it does not appear that the permits were applied for before <em>Pele I. </em>Thus, claim 2 is not barred by res judicata. We now consider whether the circuit court correctly dismissed claim 2 on summary judgment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Examination of the record indicates there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the alleged noncompliance with condition 51. A November 28, 1989 letter from the State Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) to the Hawai\u2018i County Planning Director (Director) indicates that the State expected its contribution to be reimbursed. Minutes of a Commission meeting, that apparently took place on December 19, 1989, indicate that die Commission\u2019s position was that if reimbursement was expected, condition 51 \u201ccannot be fulfilled.\u201d A January 2, 1990 letter from the Director to DLNR states that the Commission did not consider that \u201ca payback mechanism\u201d was included in condition 51. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>January 30, 1990 letter from DLNR indicates that the State expects to \u201ceventually be reimbursed[.]\u201d The Director testified at the hearing in this case that the State\u2019s contribution had been received and condition 51 had been met. He also testified that when the State\u2019s contribution was made, the State said nothing about reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The record does not indicate whether DLNR, when it finally made its contribution, had abandoned its expectation of reimbursement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither does the record indicate whether the Commission is still of the opinion that a reimbursable contribution does not comply with condition 51. Those questions are material to the legal issue of whether condition 51 has been satisfied. The Director\u2019s determination that condition 51 had been met is not binding on the court. <em>Sohns </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>11 Wis. 2d 449, 105 N.W.2d 818 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Additionally, it is not clear from the language of condition 51 whether or not the Commission intended that the rules, regulations, and procedures required therein had to be promulgated before any construction permits could be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Finally, the argument made by Defendant that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims cannot defeat Defendant\u2019s rights under GRP-2 because of the statement in condition 51 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">[t]he rights granted to the permittee shall not be conditioned upon any contribution or further participation by the State in the fund nor with respect to the creation, management, and operation of the fund other than set forth above[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">also requires a determination of fact as to what the Commission intended by that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"AnP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are not entitled to judicial relief on this record, because they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The doctrine of exhaustion of remedies in the field of administrative law holds that where a remedy is available from an administrative agency, that remedy must be exhausted before the courts will act to afford relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cJudicial review of agency action will not be available unless the party affected has taken advantage of all the corrective procedures provided for in the administrative process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\"><em>Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>69 Haw. 81, 93, 734 P.2d 161, 169 (1987) (quoting B. Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 8.30, at 502 (2d ed. 1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Where, however, no administrative procedures are provided for an aggrieved party to seek a remedy, the aggrieved party may apply directly to the court for relief. <em>Northern Boiler Co. v. David, </em>105 N.E.2d 451 (Ohio App. 1951). The statute, ordinance or regulation under which the agency exercises its power must establish \u201cclearly defined machinery for the submission, evaluation and resolution of complaints by aggrieved parties.\u201d <em>Rosenfield v. Malcolm, </em>65 Cal. 2d 559, 566, 55 Cal. Rptr. 505, 509, 421 P.2d 697, 701 (1967). Where the administrative machinery is not provided, the power of the court is not ousted by a claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Matson Terminals </em>v. <em>California Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>24 Cal. 2d 695, 151 P.2d 202 (1944). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Examination of the record in this case indicates that no administrative recourse was afforded to Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">First, as we have noted above, claim 2 is not a challenge to the validity of GRP-2 and does not seek to strike down condition 51. Rather, claim 2 merely questions whether condition 51\u2019s terms have been met and challenges the building and construction permits issued to Defendant. Consequently, the appeal provisions of HRS \u00a7 205-5.1(g) (Supp. 1991), which are applicable to an appeal from an agency action following a public hearing or hearings on a geothermal permit application, do not afford Plaintiffs an avenue of relief for claim 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Second, Defendant\u2019s reliance on Rule 12-10 (Rule 12-10) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure (1988),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in support of its argument is misplaced. Under Rule 12-10 Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>are not provided either with a means of bringing to the Director a complaint of noncompliance with a condition of a geothermal permit or a route of appeal from the Director\u2019s decision on such a complaint to the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Finally, the record contains nothing to indicate that \u00a7 5-6.3 of the Hawai\u2018i County Charter (1980), which provides that the County Board of Appeals \u201cshall hear and determine all appeals from the actions of the [Director] and [Commission^,]\u201d affords Plaintiffs a remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The record shows that there are genuine issues of material fact relating to claim 2; therefore, summary judgment was improvidently granted on that claim. Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal of claim 2 and remand for further proceedings. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Anthony L. Ranken </em>on the briefs for plaintiffs-appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIh\"><em>Gerald A. Sumida, Margery S. Bronster, Paul H. Achitoff, </em>and <em>Gilbert S.

However, the record indicates that GRP-1 is the number of the permit application. The permit number is Geothermal Resource Permit No. 2 (GRP-2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> The complete text of condition 51 is set forth in <em>Pele Defense Fund </em>v. <em>Puna Geothermal Venture, </em>8 Haw. App. 203, 206-08, 797 P.2d 69, 71-72 (1990). In summary, condition 51 requires the State and Defendant to contribute monies to a Geothermal Asset Fund to be used for \u201cgeothermal impact mitigation efforts\u201d and requires Hawai'i County to promulgate rules and regulations for administration of the fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\"> We do not decide the challenge raised by Defendant to Plaintiffs\u2019 standing to bring an action under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 342F (Supp. 1991). Neither do we decide the question whether, in spite of the noise level guidelines and the noise monitoring and control requirements imposed in GRP-2, the provisions of HRS Chapter 342F are applicable in accordance with HRS \u00a7 205-5.1(c) (Supp. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> Condition 51 also requires Defendant to make eight additional annual contributions to Geothermal Asset Fund.
