Marshall (Marshall) from a summary judgment entered in favor of Defendants-Appellees University of Hawai\u2018i (UH), Paul Kopecky (Kopecky), Edward J. Kormondy (Kormondy), and Charles M. Fullerton (Fullerton).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispositive question is whether Marshall should have been accorded time for discovery prior to any ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss or for summary judgment (Motion). We answer yes as to a part of Count I and as to Counts III, IV and V, and vacate the judgment as to those counts; however, we answer no and affirm the judgment as to Counts II, VI, and VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">On October 28,1988, Marshall, then an assistant professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at the UH Hilo campus (UH Hilo), filed an application for tenure and promotion (tenure application). At that time, Kormondy was Chancellor, Kopecky was Dean of Student Services, and Fullerton was Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at UH Hilo. Marshall\u2019s tenure application was in accordance with a memorandum from Fullerton to the faculty establishing deadlines for processing tenure applications. According to Fullerton\u2019s memorandum, the deadline for an application to be routed through the tenure review process to Kormondy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>March 10,1989. The terms of Marshall\u2019s employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement entitled \u201c1987-89 Agreement Between the University of Hawai\u2018i Professional Assembly and the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai\u2018i\u201d (Agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On March 1, 1989, Kopecky, in accordance with his duties under the UH Hilo \u201cPolicy Statement on Sexual Harassment\u201d (Policy)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> promulgated by the Chancellor of UH Hilo,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interviewed a female UH Hilo student who complained of sexual harassment by Marshall in October 1984. Kopecky determined that \u201cgood cause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>existed to investigate the complaint. Kormondy also interviewed the student and agreed with Kopecky\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Kopecky initiated an informal investigation and interviewed Marshall on March 30, 1989. Marshall admitted engaging in romantic activity with the student in her home, but denied that his actions were unwanted or unwelcome. Kopecky told Marshall that he was investigating two complaints against Marshall. Marshall requested the names of the complainants and copies of their written statements. Kopecky would not reveal the names and told Marshall there were no written complaints because the investigations were still in the informal stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Kopecky was not able to resolve the complaints because of the conflicting accounts and because he did not have access to any medical or police records. However, after his meeting with Marshall, he felt there was factual support for the first student\u2019s complaint and recommended a formal investigation. On the basis of advice from the State Attorney General, Kopecky recommended to Kormondy that a private investigator be engaged to conduct a formal investigation and a committee be appointed to review the results of the investigation. Upon Kormondy\u2019s instruction, Fullerton retained an investigator and organized a committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On May 12, 1989, Fullerton provided Marshall with a statement of the complaint, but not a statement from the complainant. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the same day, Kormondy informed Marshall by letter that if the \u201cformal\u201d hearing was not completed by May 24, 1989, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>date on which promotion and tenure recommendations were required to be transmitted to the UH Board of Regents (Board), Marshall\u2019s probationary period would be extended for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On May 22, 1989, Marshall filed a grievance in accordance with the Agreement alleging that Kormondy did not properly evaluate Marshall\u2019s tenure application and that the extension of his probationary status \u201cwas taken as a form of discipline without just cause. I have been discriminated against based on my race.\u201d In the grievance document, Marshall demanded that his tenure application be forwarded to the Board for action without any comment from Kormondy that might prejudice approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On August 16, 1989, the hearing committee reported to Fullerton that it could not reach a conclusion on the complaint against Marshall and recommended that the matter be closed. On August 23, 1989, Fullerton advised Kormondy of the report and his concurrence with the committee\u2019s recommendation. Fullerton also recommended that Marshall\u2019s tenure application be reactivated and Marshall be recommended for tenure retroactive to July 1, 1989. Fullerton\u2019s recommendation was followed, and the Board approved tenure for Marshall effective July 1, 1989. On December 5, 1989, after Marshall was informed of the Board\u2019s actions, his grievance was withdrawn. However, the UH Hilo personnel office did not receive notice of the Board\u2019s action on the change in Marshall\u2019s rank and salary until Marshall complained, on January 19, 1990, that the paperwork had not been forwarded to that office. Additionally, the approval of Marshall\u2019s tenure and promotion was not publicized, contrary to UH Hilo policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Marshall filed the complaint below on April 17, 1990. Kopecky, Kormondy and Fullerton are named as defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The thrust of the complaint\u2019s seven counts is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">Count I: against UH for violating the Agreement and the Policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Count II: against UH for emotional distress caused by UH\u2019s willful, wanton and reckless breach of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Count HI: against Defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress on Marshall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">Count IV: against Defendants for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">Count V: against Defendants for invasion of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">Count VI: against Kopecky, Kormondy, and Fullerton for interference with prospective contractual relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-14\">Count VII: against Kopecky, Kormondy, and Fullerton in their individual/personal capacities, under 42 USC \u00a7 1983, for violating Marshall\u2019s civil rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZx\">On May 30,1989, Defendants filed their Motion. The Motion was heard on June 25, 1990, and summary judgment in favor of Defendants on all counts was entered on July 24, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-18\">Marshall argues that, since he was not accorded adequate time to conduct discovery, the lower court erred in granting summary judgment. Defendants counter by pointing out that Marshall did not file an affidavit showing the need for discovery as required by Rule 56(f), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Marshall\u2019s non-compliance with Rule 56(f), HRCP, is not fatal to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>In <em>Crutchfield </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>2 Haw. App. 250, 630 P.2d 124 (1981), this court stated that Rule 56(f), HRCP, should be liberally construed and reversed an award of summary judgment on the basis that the non-moving party had not had adequate opportunity to conduct discovery. In <em>Crutchfield, </em>the non-movant\u2019s memorandum opposing the motion for summary judgment, filed just three days before the hearing, informed the presiding judge of the lack of adequate time for discovery. We stated that even though the rule had not been followed, the issue of lack of adequate time for discovery had been seasonably raised. We suggested to the trial court that it fix a reasonable time frame for conducting discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In this case, the last service of the complaint and summons was effected on UH on April 24,1990. The Motion was filed on May 30, 1990, a mere 36 days after the last service and 43 days after the complaint was filed. In his June 22,1990 memorandum opposing the Motion and at the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiff informed the lower court that he needed discovery on several key issues. Defendants argued that Plaintiff had three weeks between May 30,1990, and the June 25,1990 hearing in which to conduct discovery, and that he had not complied with Rule 56(f), HRCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">For the reasons outlined below, we hold that Marshall should have been given time to conduct discovery on a part of Count I and on Counts IE, IV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">In Counts I and H, which are against UH alone, Marshall seeks consequential damages resulting from UH\u2019s alleged breach of the Policy and the Agreement (Count I), and damages for emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>distress allegedly caused by UH\u2019s willful, wanton, and reckless breach of the Agreement (Count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">UH argues that under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 661-3 (1985)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the lower court had no jurisdiction to entertain Counts I and II. We disagree. The plain language of the statute merely precludes an action against the state where the plaintiff already has an action pending against any person who at the time the claim allegedly arose acted or professed to act, directly or indirectly, under the state\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute does not operate to prevent a joinder of the state and any such person as defendants in one suit, as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">UH argues that Marshall\u2019s action on the Agreement in Counts I and II is barred on the ground that he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We agree. <em>See Winslow v. State, 2 </em>Haw. App. 50, 625 P.2d 1046 (1981). <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, whether the principle of exhaustion applies to the Policy depends on the intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>parties to the Agreement regarding the legal nature and effect of the Policy. We turn now to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Both parties maintain that the Policy is not a part of the Agreement. However, Marshall argues that the Policy is a contract under case law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Article III. A. 1. of the Agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> UH argues that the Policy is not a contract in \u201clanguage, form or content,\u201d and that it cannot be converted into one by Article III. A. 1. UH contends Article IB. A. 1. merely ensures the retention of certain rights and benefits but does not establish that the Policy is to be construed as a contract. In our view, the legal nature and effect of the Policy is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>question of fact, since it depends on the intent of the parties to the Agreement. <em>See Bishop Trust Co. v. Central Union Church, </em>3 Haw. App. 624, 656 P.2d 1353 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It appears from a fair reading of Article DI. A. 1. that the parties to the Agreement intended that any rights and benefits relating to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment accorded to the faculty in the policies adopted by the Board have a degree of permanency during the term of the Agreement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the policies may be changed during the term of the Agreement, the rights or benefits bestowed by them on the faculty members are \u201cfrozen,\u201d as it were, as of the execution of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The record shows the Policy was adopted in accordance with the directive of UH Executive Policy E1.203 to implement the Board\u2019s policy banning sexual harassment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Policy, with its procedure for handling complaints, is the essential instrument for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>furtherance of the Board\u2019s policy on the UH Hilo campus.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Without such an instrumentality, the Board\u2019s policy is little more than a noble statement of purpose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">However, the Agreement leaves open how the faculty members may ensure that their rights under such Board policies in fact are maintained during the term of the Agreement or, if those rights are violated, what steps the faculty may take to enforce them. Those questions can only be resolved by determining the intent of the parties to the Agreement. Did they intend to ensure the maintenance of those rights through the Agreement, in which case the grievance procedure would apply, or did they intend that any such policy would have a life of its own, as it were, for enforcement purposes? If they intended the latter, what remedies did they intend would be available to the faculty for an alleged breach of such a policy? Those are clearly genuine issues of fact that are material to Marshall\u2019s action on the Policy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>We reject UH\u2019s argument that the Policy did not \u201cpertain to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d The clear import of the Policy is that every employee is prohibited from engaging in sexual harassment. We take judicial notice of the fact that issues relating to sexual harassment and UH policy on that topic have been the subject of long and heated debate among the UH administration, faculty, and students, and even in the community in general. We do not believe it can be denied that a policy prohibiting sexual harassment such as we have here establishes conditions of employment for a UH faculty member.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Neither can it be denied that the expectation of all concerned is that its procedural components will be applied equally and fairly to all who may be charged with sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Marshall is entitled to discovery to determine the intent of the parties to the Agreement and the method of enforcing the rights protected by Article HI. A. 1. Consequently, summary judgment was improvidently granted to UH on Marshall\u2019s claim for alleged breach of the Policy in Count I. However, summary judgment in favor of UH on Marshall\u2019s claims in Counts I and II for alleged breach of the Agreement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In Count HI, Marshall alleged that Defendants negligently inflicted emotional distress on him through the investigation and through the delay in reviewing his tenure application. Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>argue that under HRS \u00a7 386-5 (1985)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s remedy is limited exclusively to a workers\u2019 compensation award. We agree with Defendants as to UH only.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court has consistently rejected challenges to the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. HRS \u00a7 386-5. <em>See Estate of Coates v. Pacific Eng\u2019g, </em>71 Haw. 358, 791 P.2d 1257 (1990) (citing <em>Kamali v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., </em>54 Haw. 153, 504 P.2d 861 (1972)); <em>Hanagami </em>v. <em>China Airlines, Ltd., </em>67 Haw. 357, 688 P.2d 1139 (1984); <em>Costa Minors v. Flintkote Co., </em>42 Haw. 518 (1958). Thus, if Marshall has a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against UH, his employer, he is restricted to asserting it as a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The individual defendants, however, are in a different situation. Under HRS \u00a7 386-8 (1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">[w]hen a work injury for which compensation is payable under this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in some person <em>other than the employer or another employee of the employer acting in the course of his employment </em>a legal liability to pay damages on account thereof, the injured employee or his dependents (hereinafter referred to collectively as the employee) may claim compensation under this chapter and recover damages from such third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Another employee of the same employer shall not be relieved of his liability as a third party, if the personal injury is <em>caused by his willful and wanton misconduct.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anf\">(Emphasis added.) The statute clearly allows an employee to sue a fellow employee for damages resulting from an injury caused by the fellow employee\u2019s willful and wanton misconduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Hirasa v. Burtner, </em>68 Haw. 22, 702 P.2d 772 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In Count HI, Marshall alleges that the individual defendants had acted within the scope of their employment. Without more, the allegation fails to state a cause of action. HRS \u00a7 386-5. However, in his affidavit opposing the Motion, Marshall alleges that the \u201cinvestigation was maliciously conjured up to frustrate and defeat my tenure application.\u201d The averment of malice went beyond the allegation of the complaint. Nevertheless, that does not require the affidavit\u2019s rejection. Marshall should be allowed to amend his pleading to allege a proper cause of action for willful and wanton misconduct rather than have summary judgment entered against him. 10A C. Wright, A. Miller and M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2738 (1983). Such a procedure would comport with the purpose of modem day pleadings and the policy of liberality toward their amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under the issue raised by Marshall\u2019s affidavit, the doctrine of qualified immunity does not assist the individual defendants. Qualified immunity provides, as its name implies, only limited immunity to a public official for his tortious acts. <em>Towse v. State, </em>64 Haw. 624, 647 P.2d 696 (1982). If in exercising his or her official authority the public official was motivated by malice, and not by an otherwise proper purpose, the cloak of immunity is lost, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the official must defend the suit the same as any other defendant. <em>See Towse, supra. </em>The existence of malice is generally for the jury, <em>id.; Runnels </em>v. <em>Okamoto, </em>56 Haw. 1, 525 P.2d 1125 (1974), and summary judgment is only proper on the issue when it has been removed from the case by uncontroverted affidavits or depositions. <em>Towse; Runnels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The record shows that the investigation of the alleged sexual harassment complaint did not follow the procedure prescribed by the Policy. The complaint concerned an event occurring more than six months earlier, yet no finding was made that there was good cause for the delay in making the complaint. Also, there is no showing that anyone asked the complainant to make a written statement. Even the timing of the complaint could cause a reasonable person to question whether any of the individual defendants might have encouraged or instigated it. Marshall was entitled to discovery to determine the reason for the departure from the Policy and whether the departure was maliciously motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Marshall\u2019s affidavit, coupled with the individual defendants\u2019 departure from the Policy\u2019s procedures, is sufficient, in spite of the averments in the individual defendants\u2019 affidavits that they were motivated by a proper purpose, to raise a genuine issue of fact, and he should be allowed to amend Count HI and to conduct discovery as to the individual defendants\u2019 motives for their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Count IV is a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Marshall alleged that Defendants acted intentionally and unreasonably in conducting the investigation and delaying his tenure application, and that their actions were likely to result in illness. We reach the same result on this count as we did on Count HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">First, although no Hawai\u2019i appellate courts have passed on the issue, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress can be maintained only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>under HRS Chapter 386. <em>See Courtney </em>v. <em>Canyon Television &amp; Appliance Rental, Inc., </em>899 F.2d 845 (9th Cir. 1990). We now adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding. Thus, Marshall\u2019s claim against UH in Count IV is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Second, the discussion of the issues of the individual defendants\u2019 motivation and qualified immunity applies to the allegations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Third, we perceive a discrete genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the acts of the individual defendants were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: \u201c(1) that the act allegedly causing harm was intentional; (2) that the act was unreasonable; and (3) that the actor should have recognized that the act was likely to result in illness.\u201d <em>Wong v. Panis, </em>7 Haw. App. 414, 421, <em>112 </em>P.2d 695, 696-97 (1989). The question of reasonableness is for the court in the first instance; however, if reasonable persons could differ on the question, it should be left to the jury. <em>Id. </em>The question of whether a defendant should have recognized that his act was likely to cause illness is a jury question. <em>Chedester </em>v. <em>Stecker, </em>64 Haw. 464, 643 P.2d 532 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The individual defendants argue that they had the duty under the Policy to conduct the investigation and the authority under the Agreement to delay the tenure review until the investigation was completed; consequently their actions were not without just cause. However, since the Policy was not strictly followed, and the investigation was begun when Marshall\u2019s tenure review period was nearly over, reasonable persons could differ over the question of whether the individual defendants\u2019 actions were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">In Count V, Marshall alleges that Defendants invaded his privacy by making unauthorized disclosure of information regarding the investigation and the delay of his tenure application.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Defendants argue that summary judgment was properly granted, since the individual defendants averred in their affidavits that they did not disclose confidential information to others, and Marshall\u2019s responsive affidavit contained only hearsay and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Marshall argues that summary judgment was improper, because he had not had time for discoveiy. We agree with Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In Count VI, Marshall alleges that the individual defendants intentionally interfered with his contractual relations with UH under the Agreement, causing him injury. In our view, Marshall has not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">If Marshall\u2019s tenure application had been processed in strict accordance with the Agreement, the July 1, 1989 date was the earliest date on which he could have been awarded tenure. When he was awarded tenure, it was made retroactive to that date. Thus even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the delay in the award of Marshall\u2019s tenure was a breach of the Agreement, he eventually got everything to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Count VII is a complaint for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of Marshall\u2019s civil rights. Marshall alleges that the individual defendants, acting in their individual capacities and under color of law, violated his substantive and procedural rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Marshall\u2019s claim is utterly without merit, and summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">The first inquiry in a claim under \u00a7 1983 \u201cis whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right \u2018secured by the Constitution and laws\u2019 of the United States.\u201d <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 284, 100 S. Ct. 553, 558, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481, 488, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>U.S. 920, 100 S. Ct. 1285, 63 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1980). It is well settled that \u201ca probationary university employee has no \u2018property\u2019 interest in obtaining tenure.\u201d <em>Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d 870, 875 (1st Cir. 1981) (citations omitted). Since Marshall had no property interest in obtaining tenure, he has not been deprived of a cognizable fourteenth amendment right in this case, since the award was merely delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Marshall also claims that the investigation and the alleged disclosures of confidential information damaged his reputation and \u201cstigmatized\u201d him. Again, Marshall has no claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. In <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>425 U.S. 985, 96 S. Ct. 2194, 48 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1976), the Supreme Court held that reputation alone, apart from some tangible interest such as employment, does not implicate any \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest sufficient to invoke the protection of the due process clause. <em>See id. </em>at 701-02, 96 S. Ct. at 1165-66, 47 L. Ed. 2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><em>Paul </em>also bars any claim Marshall may be deemed to have asserted in Count VII for any violation of his substantive due process right to privacy resulting from the alleged unauthorized release of confidential information, since his claim does not fit within any of the primary rights recognized by the Supreme Court as being protected under the Federal Constitution. <em>See id. </em>at 712-14, 96 S. Ct. at 1166, 47 L. Ed. 2d at 420-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">1.

Any student who considers herself or himself a victim of sexual harassment should contact the Dean of Student Services. No complaint will be heard unless received by the EEO/ AA Coordinator or by the Dean of Student Services within six (6) calendar months after the date on which the sexual harassment is alleged to have occurred, unless good cause for a later filing is demonstrated. The Coordinator or the Dean will request a written report from the complainant setting forth the allegations of sexual harassment. The Coordinator or the Dean, after consultation with the complainant, will investigate the matter, maintaining confidentiality to the extent possible. An effort will be made to settle the allegations informally with the people involved within a period of thirty (30) calendar days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">If a satisfactory resolution to the complaint cannot be reached through the above procedure, the EEO/AA Coordinator or the Dean will make available to the Chancellor or the appropriate Dean, Provost, or Director the information that has been compiled. If sufficient cause exists to warrant disciplinary action against an employee, the administrator is empowered to invoke the disciplinary article of the individual\u2019s unit contract within a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the time the administrator has been notified by the EEO/AA Coordinator or by the Dean of Student Services.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\"> We do not know from the record whether the Policy was promulgated by Kormondy or a predecessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"> Fullerton\u2019s statement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">A complaint of sexual harassment has been made by a student against you.
