Shiroma (Shiroma) was charged with (1) Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-716(1)(d); (2) Sexual Assault in the Third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Degree, HRS \u00a7 707-732(1)(e); and (3) Kidnapping, HRS \u00a7 707-720(1 )(d). All three charges allegedly involved the same female victim (the Woman). The jury found Shiroma guilty of the lesser-included offenses of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree, HRS \u00a7 707-717 (1985), and Unlawful Imprisonment in the Second Degree, HRS \u00a7 707-722 (1985), but not guilty of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. Shiroma appeals the December 12, 1991 judgment entered in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The circuit court unlawfully used a twenty-two person \u201cstruck jury\u201d method to impanel the jury. <em>See State v. Echineque, </em>73 Haw. 100, 828 P.2d 276 (1992). If Shiroma had objected to this method of jury selection, we would be compelled to reverse. Since Shiroma did not object, the question is whether the use of the \u201cstruck jury\u201d method to select the jury was plain error. HRS \u00a7 641-16 (1985); Hawai\u2018i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(D). An error is plain error if it \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings[,]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>70 Haw. 46, 56, 760 P.2d 670, 676 (1988) <em>(quoting United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S. Ct. 391, 392, 80 L. Ed. 555 (1936)), or affected the substantial rights of the appellant. HRS \u00a7 641-16 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In the absence of HRS \u00a7 641-16\u2019s mandate, the \u201cstruck jury\u201d method would be a reasonable method to select the jury. Shiroma participated in the selection of the jury and did not object to any of the 12 jurors who heard the evidence and rendered the verdict. The jury that rendered the verdict was fair and impartial. The fact that the jury was not selected as required by HRS \u00a7 635-26(a) did not negatively and seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of Shiroma\u2019s jury trial. Neither did it affect Shiroma\u2019s substantial rights. Therefore, the trial judge\u2019s error in the process used to select the jury was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"ATl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Shiroma contends that the trial court allowed the State, over his objection, to violate Hawai\u2018i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 404(b). That rule states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible where such evidence is probative of any other fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court has explained the trial court\u2019s duty under HRE 404(b) in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">Yet even when the evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts tends to establish a fact of consequence to the determination of the case, the trial court is still obliged to exclude the evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Haw. R. Evid. 404(b) Commentary (quoting the House Judiciary Committee Report accompanying the Federal Rules of Evidence).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">As we observed, when evidence of other crimes, wrongs, and acts is offered by the prosecution, the problem for the trial court is one \u201cof classifying and then balancing^ if necessary].\u201d E. W. Cleary, [McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 190(3d ed. 1984)]. If its purpose is only \u201cto show some propensity to commit the crime at trial, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>is no room for ad hoc balancing. The evidence is then unequivocally inadmissible[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>If it is probative of any other fact of consequence in the determination of the case, the court must then consider whether the prejudicial impact of the evidence would be substantially greater than its probative worth. And,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">[i]n deciding whether the danger of unfair prejudice and the like substantially outweighs the incremental probative value, a variety of matters must be considered, including the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the interval of time that has elapsed between the crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree to which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\"><em>State v. </em>Castro, 69 Haw. 633, 643-44, 756 P.2d 1033, 1041 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">In Shiroma\u2019s case, the Woman and Shiroma had dated for several weeks and had been sexually intimate. The Woman lived in an apartment in a secured building. Shiroma needed the Woman\u2019s assistance to enter the building and the apartment. The alleged crimes occurred after the Woman told Shiroma over the phone that she was terminating their relationship. Approximately three hours after that phone conversation, Shiroma went to the Woman\u2019s apartment. The alleged crimes occurred during that phone conversation and/or in the Woman\u2019s apartment. No persons other than Shiroma and the Woman witnessed the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Shiroma denied committing the alleged crimes. He testified that the Woman was lying. He argued and sought to prove that her reason for terminating their relationship and her motive for falsely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>accusing him of committing crimes against her was that she was extremely angry with him for dating another female while he was dating her and for falsely denying his non-exclusivity when she queried him about it. He testified that he was merely the apologetic defender and she was the outraged, hysterical aggressor.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQrT\"><em>Clayton C. Ikei </em>on the brief for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ATJ\"><em>James H. S. Choi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Shiroma\u2019s defense compelled the State to introduce additional evidence of the Woman\u2019s credibility to explain her actions and reactions to Shiroma\u2019s words and actions before, during, and after his alleged crimes against her. Therefore, the State introduced evidence that the Woman\u2019s reason for terminating her relationship with Shiroma was not jealousy, but fear, based on her knowledge that Shiroma was connected to the business of drug dealing and collecting monies due for drug deals, and associated with physically big men involved in that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The trial judge implicitly decided that the State\u2019s need to prove the Woman\u2019s knowledge of Shiroma\u2019s connection to the business of drug dealing and collecting monies due for drug deals, and of his association with physically big men involved in that business, was not substantially outweighed by its possible prejudicial impact. To the extent that the trial judge\u2019s implicit decision is a finding of fact, it is not clearly erroneous. To the extent that it is an exercise of discretion, it is not an abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s December 12,1991 judgment convicting defendant Brian S. Shiroma of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree and Unlawful Imprisonment in the Second Degree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
