We affirm the convictions. Regarding the No No-Fault Insurance conviction, however, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">At trial, the State\u2019s evidence established the following facts. Just before midnight on July 20, 1990, police officer Edmund Barroga (Officer Barroga) of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) was driving westbound on the H-l Freeway near the Houghtailing overpass. He observed a Honda station wagon driven by Defendant traveling approximately one car length ahead of his vehicle in the fast lane. He noticed the station wagon \u201cstraddling the left yellow line closest to the medial barrier.\u201d The station wagon then \u201cswerve[d] to the right several times riding over the chatter bumps on the right side of that lane.\u201d As his vehicle got closer to the station wagon he noticed \u201can expired registration sticker, also an expired safety check on the bumper of the [station wagon].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Officer Barroga pulled over the station wagon at the Ahua off-ramp. He approached the station wagon and asked Defendant for his driver\u2019s license and no-fault insurance card. The officer observed that Defendant\u2019s eyes were red, glassy, and bloodshot and noted a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Defendant\u2019s breath. Defendant stated that \u201chis driver\u2019s license was suspended and he had no no-fault insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Officer Barroga then asked Defendant to step out of the station wagon to take a field sobriety test, to which Defendant consented. As Defendant got out of his car, he appeared \u201cnervous and shaken.\u201d Defendant said that he was taking antibiotics, but was not under a doctor\u2019s care. Defendant did not complain of any physical condition that might affect his performance of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The officer had Defendant perform the field sobriety test, consisting of three separate tests, namely: (1) \u201cheel-to-toe\u201d test; (2) \u201cleg raised\u201d test; and (3) \u201carch back\u201d test. Before Defendant performed each of the three tests, Officer Barroga demonstrated and explained each test, and Defendant appeared to understand the instructions. In Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion, Defendant failed to pass each of the three tests. Therefore, the officer arrested Defendant for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">After the State completed its case-in-chief, Defendant chose not to put on any evidence. The court found Defendant guilty of DUI, No No-Fault Insurance, and No Safety Check.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regarding the No No-Fault Insurance offense, the court sentenced Defendant as a two-time offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Officer Barroga testified that he had Defendant perform the \u201cheel-to-toe,\u201d \u201cleg raised,\u201d and \u201carch back\u201d tests. He opined that Defendant failed (1) the \u201cheel-to-toe\u201d test because Defendant \u201cdid not touch heel to toe all nine [steps]\u201d and \u201cappeared unsteady when he did [the test;]\u201d (2) the \u201cleg raised\u201d test because Defendant \u201cdropped his left leg and touched the ground twice to regain his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>balance[;]\u201d and (3) the \u201carch back\u201d test because Defendant \u201cbobbed back and forth ... [and] his eyelids also fluttered [when the eyes should have been closed].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant objected to the opinion testimony on the ground of \u201cno proper foundation having been laid.\u201d Defendant argued the necessity of a foundation regarding \u201chow [Officer Barroga] derives these opinions, what [they are] based on, what training and experience he\u2019s had.\u201d Th\u00e9 court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Hawai\u2018i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 701 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">Opinion testimony by lay witnesses. If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The commentary to HRE Rule 701 states that Rule 701 \u201cretains the common-law requirement that lay opinion be based upon firsthand knowledge[.]\u201d Thus, for an opinion testimony to be admissible under HRE Rule 701, \u201cthe witness must have personal knowledge of matter that forms the basis of testimony of opinion; the testimony must be based rationally upon the perception of the witness; and of course, the opinion must be helpful to the jury (the principal test).\u201d 1 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence (hereafter McCormick) \u00a7 11, at 45-46 (4th ed. 1992) (footnotes omitted). The \u201crational\u201d test means whether the opinion \u201cis one which a normal person would form on the basis of the observed facts.\u201d 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence (hereafter Weinstein\u2019s Evidence) \u00b6 701[02], at 701-18 (1992) (footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>omitted). Also, \u201cwhere relevancy requires, a foundation must be laid as to the witness\u2019 personal knowledge of facts to which the observed facts are being compared.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McCormick \u00a7 11 at n.22. Finally, \u201cRule 701 is a rule of discretion.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 701 [02] at 701-31. We apply the foregoing principles in analyzing Defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u201c[A] lay witness may express an opinion regarding another person\u2019s sobriety, provided the witness has had an opportunity to observe the other person.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>451 N.W.2d 154, 155 (Iowa 1990). However, the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">\u201c[F]ield sobriety tests are designed and administered to avoid the shortcomings of casual observation. 1 Am. J. Crim. L. 96 (1967).\u201d <em>State v. Arsenault, </em>115 N.H. 109, 111, 336 A.2d 244, 246 (1975). \u201cThey are premised upon the relationship between intoxication and the externally manifested loss of coordination it causes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 336 A.2d at 247. They essentially require a suspected driver to go through prescribed routines so his physical characteristics may be observed by the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\"><em>State v. Wyatt, </em>67 Haw. 293, 302, 687 P.2d 544, 551 (1984). In Hawai'i, it is common knowledge that, where a police officer reasonably believes that a motorist is DUI, the officer will order him out of the car and administer field sobriety tests to the motorist with his consent. Police departments conduct training sessions for police officers relating to the administering of field sobriety tests and print and issue to officers field sobriety tests work sheets containing instructions to be given to motorists undergoing these tests. In re Doe, 9 Haw. App. 406, 408-09, 844 P.2d 679, 681 (1992). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>fact, the record of this case suggests the use by Officer Barroga of a \u201c424 form\u201d containing instructions regarding the field sobriety tests prescribed by the HPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The State argues that Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony that \u201cDefendant failed the field sobriety test was rationally based upon his perception of the Defendant on the night of his arrest[,] . .. [and] the testimony was helpful to understanding Officer Barroga\u2019s conclusions regarding Defendant\u2019s physical condition.\u201d The State therefore concludes that Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony met the requirements of HRE Rule 701 and was properly admitted into evidence. We do not believe that the opinion testimony met the rationality test.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Here, Officer Barroga did not merely testify that based on his perception of Defendant\u2019s lack of coordination he was of the opinion that Defendant was intoxicated. Rather, the officer\u2019s opinion testimony was that Defendant failed to pass the \u201cheel-to-toe,\u201d \u201cleg raised,\u201d and \u201carch back\u201d tests that Defendant had undertaken to perform. A normal person may not necessarily form such an opinion if he or she had not been taught to grade the performance of the three field sobriety tests. In other words, this was a situation where foundational evidence as to Officer Barroga\u2019s knowledge of HPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures was necessary. The record discloses no foundational evidence in this regard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>evidence. However, the admission of Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony did not prejudice Defendant and was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In this case, the court, not a jury, was the trier of fact. The record clearly discloses that the court did not consider or rely upon Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">I\u2019m not really, frankly, looking at the officer\u2019s specific evaluation. I\u2019m evaluating the picture that I get of what the defendant did that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">[Defendant\u2019s] balance was extremely poor from what I can see here. He had balance and coordination problems on every one of the tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Consequently, although Officer Barroga\u2019s opinion testimony was improperly admitted into evidence, it was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">In resolving Defendant\u2019s second contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish Defendant\u2019s guilt of DUI beyond a reasonable doubt, we apply the following standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">In a bench trial, a lower court\u2019s determination will be affirmed if \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Hopkins, </em>60 Haw. 540, 542, 592 P.2d 810, 811 (1979) (citations omitted); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sujohn, </em>5 Haw. App. 459, 461, 697 P.2d 1143, 1145 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-14\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Halmos, </em>70 Haw. 14, 16, 755 P.2d 1226, 1227 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">A review of the record discloses the following evidence testified to by Officer Barroga: (1) Defendant\u2019s station wagon was weaving within the fast lane; (2) Defendant\u2019s eyes were \u201cred glassy bloodshot\u201d and his breath had a strong odor of alcohol; and (3) while performing the field sobriety tests, Defendant lost his balance and had coordination problems. HPD police matron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Sylvia Dawson testified that, at the police station on the night in question, \u201c[Defendant] had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath, very red, watery eyes, and he did speak with a thick-tongued slurred speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Defendant was guilty of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">At the time of sentencing, the State submitted to the district court, over Defendant\u2019s objection, a certified traffic abstract showing that a person with the same name as Defendant had a prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction. Based on the abstract, the court sentenced Defendant as a two-time offender regarding the No No-Fault Insurance conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Defendant contends that the State\u2019s proof of the prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction was unsatisfactory because (1) the State was required to submit a \u201ccertified copy of the judgment,\u201d rather than a certified copy of a traffic abstract; (2) the State failed to show that at the time of Defendant\u2019s prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction, Defendant was represented by counsel or had knowingly and intelligently waived such representation; and (3) the State failed to show that Defendant was the Michael Nishi who was previously convicted of No No-Fault Insurance as shown on the traffic abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoglund, </em>71 Haw. 147, 785 P.2d 1311 (1990), the defendant raised the issue of the adequacy of a certified copy of a traffic abstract to prove his prior DUI conviction. However, the supreme court refused to consider this issue because it had been raised for the first time on appeal, and the trial court did not consider and rule on this issue. Thus, this issue is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Referring to <em>State v. Afong, </em>61 Haw. 281, 602 P.2d 927 (1979), which involved enhanced sentencing for burglary in the first degree, a felony, Defendant asserts that, to prove a prior conviction, the State must submit a certified copy of the judgment and testimony from a probation officer or other credible source identifying the defendant. Defendant argues that submission of a certified copy of his traffic abstract was insufficient. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The supreme court has not laid down any rule that a prior conviction may be proved only by a certified copy of a judgment. Rather, the Hawaii Penal Code provides that a \u201cprior conviction may be proved by <em>any evidence, </em>including fingerprint records made in connection with arrest, conviction, or imprisonment, that <em>reasonably satisfies the court </em>that the defendant was convicted.\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-666 (1985) (emphases added). The supreme court has stated that \u201cthe fact of [the defendant\u2019s] prior conviction must be established by <em>satisfactory evidence[.]\u201d State v. Freitas, </em>61 Haw. 262, 277, 602 P.2d 914, 925 (1979). The question we must answer is whether a certified copy of a person\u2019s traffic abstract is satisfactory evidence to establish his prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In resolving the question, we consider the following factors. First, a judgment of conviction in a circuit court is different from a judgment of conviction in a district court. While a circuit court judgment generally is a one-page document, a district court judgment consists of the clerk\u2019s notation on the court\u2019s daily calendar containing numerous cases. <em>See </em>Hawai\u2018i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 32(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Second, Hawaii\u2019s statute authorizes the use of traffic abstracts. The Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, HRS Chapter 287, requires the traffic violations bureau of a district court to furnish upon request a person\u2019s certified abstract \u201crelating to all alleged moving violations, as well as any convictions resulting therefrom, arising from the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d HRS \u00a7 287-3 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Third, we take judicial notice of the fact that a person\u2019s certified traffic abstract issued by the traffic violations bureau of the District Court of the First Circuit includes not only the person\u2019s name, but also the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license number, which is identical to the person\u2019s social security number, and the person\u2019s date of birth. We deem that such information contained in the abstract is adequate to connect a defendant with a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Based on the foregoing factors, we conclude that a certified copy of a person\u2019s traffic abstract is satisfactory evidence to establish his prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Citing <em>State v. </em>Vares, 71 Haw. 617, 801 P.2d 555 (1990), Defendant argues that the State failed to show that at the time of his prior conviction, he was represented by counsel or knowingly and intelligently waived representation. Defendant misreads <em>Vares.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In <em>Vares, </em>the court imposed on the defendant, as a third-time DUI offender, a fine, revocation of his driver\u2019s license for three years, and a jail term of 180 days, of which all but 15 days were suspended subject to certain conditions. On appeal, the supreme court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">An uncounseled conviction cannot be used collaterally to support an enhanced sentence <em>where such enhanced sentence includes a term of imprisonment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-11\"><em>Vares, </em>71 Haw. at 621, 801 P.2d at 557 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In making that holding, the supreme court distinguished its prior holding in <em>Hoglund, supra, </em>that an uncounseled prior conviction may support an enhanced sentence where imprisonment is not imposed. <em>Hoglund, </em>71 Haw. at 152, 785 P.2d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Here, the district court did not impose any term of imprisonment for the No No-Fault Insurance conviction. Thus, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>was not required to show that Defendant was counseled at the time of his prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Finally, Defendant asserts that the State failed to submit any evidence to show that Defendant was the same Michael Nishi who had been convicted of a No No-Fault Insurance offense as shown on the certified copy of a traffic abstract submitted to the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cUnless conceded by the defendant, the [S]tate is required to show, by evidence satisfactory to the court, ... the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction[.]\u201d <em>Afong, </em>61 Haw. at 282-83, 602 P.2d at 929. Thus, the State must satisfactorily identify the defendant being sentenced to be the same person who was previously convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Although we have stated above that a certified copy of a traffic abstract is satisfactory evidence to establish a prior No No-Fault Insurance conviction, the record discloses no evidence to tie Defendant with the Michael Nishi of the traffic abstract. The State presented no evidence of Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license number or social security number or birth date that could be compared with information appearing on the traffic abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that (A) the district court\u2019s admission of the police officer\u2019s opinion testimony regarding the results of the field sobriety test was harmless error; (B) there was substantial evidence to support Defendant\u2019s guilt for DUI; and (C) there was insufficent proof of Defendant\u2019s prior conviction to support the enhanced sentence for the No No-Fault Insurance offense.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Patsy M.
