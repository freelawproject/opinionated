Topliss, dba Pacific Land Company (Petitioner), filed a petition (Permit Petition) with Appellee Planning Commission of the County of Hawai'i (Commission) for a Special Management Area (SMA) permit (SMAP) pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 205A (1985 and Supp. 1991), to develop two multi-story office buildings on his property (property) in Kailua-Kona.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The property lies on the northern comer of the intersection of Kuakini Highway and Seaview Circle. Kuakini Highway has an 80-foot right-of-way with a 24-foot pavement, while Seaview Circle has a 60-foot right-of-way with a 20-foot pavement. The Permit Petition acknowledges that the property \u201clies on a vital intersection and is adjacent to a high-traffic highway.\u201d The Permit Petition also describes the intersection as \u201ca high-traffic intersection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The property consists of two adjacent lots within the 143-lot Kona Sea View Lots Subdivision, most of which are in single family residential use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, some of the lots at the intersection and along Kuakini Highway are either vacant or in multi-family use. The two lots making up the property will be consolidated to effect the development. The State Land Use District classification for the property is Urban, and the County of Hawaii\u2019s General Plan Land Use Pattern Allocation Guide designates the property as Medium Density Urban. The commercial zoning classification for the property allows the proposed use.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Besides the property, six lots zoned for commercial and four zoned for residential use remain undeveloped within the subdivision. An 18-story residential condominium building occupies the adjoining lot to the north of the property. A 7-Eleven store, restaurant, and offices are situated across Kuakini Highway from the property. Four vacant lots across Sea View Circle to the south of the property are zoned for commercial use. The Commission granted two SMAPs each in 1980 and 1990 in the vicinity of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The property has an area of approximately one-half acre and is nearly 400 feet above sea level and about 3600 feet from the shoreline. The property is rather severely sloped away from Kuakini Highway with a grade of approximately 20%. The differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ence in elevation between the property\u2019s mauka and makai boundaries is approximately 40 feet. The roof line of the proposed building abutting Kuakini Highway would extend approximately six feet above the elevation of the property\u2019s boundary. Between the property and the coastline lies most of the Kona Sea View Lots Subdivision, a \u201cnon-transgressable thicket,\u201d hotels and apartments along Alii Drive, and Alii Drive itself, which is the paved county roadway closest to and paralleling the coastline. Two circuitous vehicular routes measuring 2.7 miles in the southerly direction and 1.5 miles in the northerly direction are the only accesses to the coastline.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The property came within the purview of the CZMA in 1980 when the Commission designated all of the area makai of Kuakini Highway from Kailua southward to Keauhou as an SMA. At that time, the Commission cited \u201canticipated development pressures\u201d in the area, the steep topography, soil composition, the Hawai\u2018i County General Plan designation of \u201cthe entire Kuakini right of way ... as an important scenic resource,\u201d and the need to \u201cbetter coordinate the overall development of the area\u201d as the grounds for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The Commission denied the Permit Petition and Petitioner appealed to the third circuit court. By stipulation of the parties, the matter was remanded to the Commission for the entry of findings of fact (FOF) and conclusions of law (COL). Meanwhile, on September 4, 1990, Petitioner filed a petition with the Commission to amend the boundaries (Boundary Petition) of the SMA to exclude his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The Boundary Petition was heard by the Commission on January 31, 1991. At the same hearing, the Commission denied Petitioner\u2019s request to reconsider the denial of the Permit Petition. On February 21, 1991, the Commission entered separate FOF, COL, and Orders denying both Petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Petitioner appealed both orders to the third circuit court and on September 5,1991, that court entered an order affirming the Commission. The matter is here on Petitioner\u2019s appeal from the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Our review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is governed by the standards set forth in HRS \u00a7 91 \u2014 14(g) (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Williams v. Hawai'i Hous. Auth., </em>5 Haw. App. 325, 690 P.2d 285 (1984), <em>cert denied </em>67 Haw. 686, 744 P.2d 782 (1984). Under HRS 91-14(g), an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact are reviewable for clear error, while its conclusions of law are freely reviewable. <em>Medeiros v. Hawai'i County Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Haw. App. 183, 797 P.2d 59(1990). An administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside on appeal unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record or the appellate court, upon a thorough examination of the record, is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, 4 </em>Haw. App. 26, 659 P.2d 77 (1983). As a general rule, an administrative agency\u2019s decision within its sphere of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>expertise is given a presumption of validity, <em>Aio </em>v. <em>Hamada, </em>66 Haw. 401, 664 P.2d 727 (1983), and one who seeks to overturn the agency\u2019s decision bears the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences. <em>In re Hawai'i Elec. Light Co., </em>60 Haw. 625, 594 P.2d 612 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Although Petitioner does not challenge the validity of the CZMA, the thrust of his attack is that when the Commission denied his Petitions it violated the CZMA\u2019s clear objectives and purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree with respect to the Boundary Petition, but agree with respect to the Permit Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The dispositive question is construction of the CZMA. Our duty in construing statutes is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention and to implement that intention to the fullest degree. <em>State v. Briones, </em>71 Haw. 86, 784 P.2d 860 (1989). Petitioner argues that the CZMA is simply a zoning statute which must, as a general rule, be strictly construed against further derogation of common-law property rights. The rule cited by Petitioner is inapplicable here, however, since the language of the CZMA is clear and unambiguous and the legislature\u2019s intent is beyond peradventure. <em>See Maui County </em>v. <em>Puamana Management Corp., </em>2 Haw. App. 352, 631 P.2d 1215 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The CZMA is \u201ca comprehensive State regulatory scheme to protect the environment and resources of our shoreline areas.\u201d <em>Mahuiki v. Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>65 Haw. 506, 517, 654 P.2d 874, 881 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">The CZMA imposes special controls on the development of real property along the shoreline areas in order \u201cto preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>resources of the coastal zone of Hawai'i.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Sandy Beach Defense Fund </em>v. <em>City Council, </em>70 Haw. 361, 365, 773 P.2d 250, 254 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">When it enacted the CZMA, the Hawai* i legislature specifically found that \u201cspecial controls on developments within an area along the shoreline are necessary to avoid permanent losses of valuable resources and the foreclosure of management options, and to ensure that adequate access, by dedication or other means, to public owned or used beaches, recreation areas, and natural reserves is provided.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-21 (1985). The legislature therefore declared it to be \u201cthe state policy to preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of Hawai'i.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to carry out the CZMA\u2019s policies and objectives, the legislature authorized the counties to establish SMAs. HRS \u00a7 205A-23 (1985). Development within an SMA is controlled by a permit system administered by the counties pursuant to HRS \u00a7 205A-28 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">THE BOUNDARY PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"AcQ\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Petitioner argues that the Commission exceeded its lawful authority when it established Kuakini Highway as the mauka boundary of the SMA. He contends that the CZMA authorizes the Commission to include within the SMA lands that have a \u201cdirect and significant impact\u201d on the coastal waters protected by the CZMA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts that in this case the property has \u201cno potential for direct or substantial impact upon either the coastal water or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>coastal resources to be protected\u201d and should not be included within the SMA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Among the CZMA\u2019s stated objectives and policies are the protection, preservation, restoration and improvement of the \u201cquality of coastal scenic and open space resources[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-2(b)(3) and (c)(3)(C) (1985), and the \u201cdesigning and locating\u201d of new \u201cdevelopments to minimize the alteration of... existing public views to and along the shoreline[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-2(c)(3)(B) (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In order to protect and preserve the coastal zone\u2019s scenic and open space resources, the CZMA requires the Commission to \u201cminimize, where reasonable... [a]ny development which would substantially interfere with or detract from the line of sight toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the sea from the state highway nearest the coast[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-26(3)(D) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The intent of the CZMA is clearly to authorize inclusion in the SMA of lands that have a significant impact on the scenic resources in the area and whose development would alter the public views to and along the shoreline. Protection of the coastal areas and waters from adverse environmental or ecological impact is only one of the CZMA\u2019s objectives. Another clear objective is protection against interference with or alteration of coastal scenic resources. Where a property or development has the potential for such interference, then it may be included within an SMA even though it is not in close proximity to the coastline.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments that (1) the Commission\u2019s \u201crapid growth\u201d finding<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d because the area surrounding the property \u201chad already become substantially developed as early as 1977[,]\u201d and (2) the property \u201cis one of the very last parcels in the neighborhood which is yet to be developed!,] \u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">First, the finding is merely a reiteration of the original finding made in 1980 when the SMA boundary was established at Kuakini Highway. There is nothing in the record to support Petitioner\u2019s argument that the area was already substantially developed at the time the finding was made. Moreover, whether the growth in the area was rapid or slow is really of no import. The aim of the CZMA is to control growth of whatever rapidity. <em>See Sandy Beach Defense Fund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Second, the fact that the property is among the last to be developed in the neighborhood does not vitiate the finding. The objective of controlling growth relates to the entire SMA not just the neighborhood in which the property is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Since control of growth in the SMA is an objective of the CZMA, <em>id., </em>it cannot be said, as Petitioner argues, that control of rapid growth is the Commission\u2019s attempt to use general planning and zoning objectives to justify imposition of the special controls of the CZMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Petitioner acknowledges that the CZMA expresses the legislature\u2019s concern for \u201cviews along the shoreline.\u201d However, he contends that the \u201cscenic viewplanes\u201d cited by the Commission in FOF No. 63 is purely a creation of the Commission and is not among the \u201cstate interests\u201d advanced by the CZMA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, the continued inclusion of the property in the SMA unconstitutionally deprived him of his property. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">First, Petitioner misstates the language of the CZMA. HRS \u00a7 205A-2(c)(3)(B) clearly establishes the protection of views <em>to and along </em>the shoreline as among the legislature\u2019s policies regarding scenic and open space resources.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Second, as stated above, HRS \u00a7 205A-26(3)(D) requires the Commission to minimize a development\u2019s interference with the line of sight from Kuakini Highway toward the sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In our view, the term scenic viewplanes employed in FOF No. 63 relating to the Boundary Petition is merely a paraphrase of the statutory terms \u201cviews to and along the shoreline\u201d or \u201cline of sight toward the sea,\u201d and clearly comports with the intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Petitioner also argues that since the shoreline itself, as defined in the CZMA,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> cannot be seen from the property, the continued inclusion of the property in the SMA goes beyond the legislature\u2019s authorization to protect \u201cviews to and along the shoreline\u201d and \u201cshoreline open space and scenic resources.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">HRS \u00a7 205A-26(3)(D) clearly mandates the Commission to protect and preserve more than just the view of the shoreline. As noted above, the statute, by its very language, is intended to protect the view toward the sea even though the \u201cshoreline\u201d cannot be seen either because of intervening development or natural growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Petitioner also contends that even if \u201cprotecting panoramic coastal views\u201d is within the legislative mandate, it is not a reasonable basis for imposing SMA regulations, since Hawaii County may impose height and setback limitations under its zoning powers. However, the fact that the County can impose the same restrictions through the exercise of one power does not make the proper exercise of another specifically authorized power unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Petitioner asserts that since there is no significant view of either the ocean or the shoreline from the portion of Kuakini Highway that abuts the property, the inclusion of the property in the SMA did not advance the State\u2019s interest in preserving the viewplane from the highway. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Admittedly, Petitioner\u2019s evidence indicates that the view from the portion of Kuakini Highway abutting the property is limited. However, that does not affect the Commission\u2019s finding as to the significance of the total viewplane from the highway. If, in fact, Petitioner\u2019s development would not have a significant, adverse impact on the total viewplane, the Commission could consider that as favoring the development or could impose conditions on the development to minimize the impact. However, that would not necessarily support removal of the property from the SMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Petitioner argues that \u201c[t]he original enactment of Hawaii\u2019s CZMA in 1975 ... defined the SMA to exclude \u2018portions of [lands in] which there are numerous residental commercial or other structures of a substantial nature in existence as of the effective date of [CZMA],\u201d\u2019 and there is no indication that that exclusion should not be continued. The argument misstates the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The original enactment excluded from SMAs only such built up areas that may be located on lands \u201cwhich abut any <em>inland </em>waterway or body of water wholly or partially improved with walls[.]\u201d Act 176, 1975 Haw. Sess. Laws \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). That is not the situation here and there is nothing to indicate the legislature intended to continue that exclusion or to expand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">THE PERMIT PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In denying the Permit Petition, the Commission made the following FOF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">62. Rule 9-10(H)(5) says that one factor which should be considered in constituting a \u201csignificant adverse effect\u201d is when the proposed use, activity or operation \u201cinvolves substantial secondary impacts . . . such as effect on public facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">69. Based upon the evidence adduced, including that submitted with the Petition, the testimony of the public and the Petitioner, and the information contained in the [Planning] Department\u2019s Background Report, the Commission concluded that the Petitioner\u2019s proposed development would have cumulative and significant adverse effects and impact on the public roadway facilities and system in the area of said development, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">(A) Increased traffic congestion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">(B) Decreased pedestrian safety, especially with a school bus stop in the vicinity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">(C) Potential increase in vehicular accidents at the intersection of Kuakini Highway and Sea View Circle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">(Footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Petitioner challenges the quoted FOF as not being based on substantial evidence. We disagree. The record contains substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tial evidence showing that the development will impact on the roads in the vicinity of the Kuakini Highway-Sea View Circle intersection. Nevertheless, after a thorough review of the record, we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 205A-26(2) (1985), development cannot be approved within an SMA unless findings are made that the development (A) will not have any substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect except, however, where the substantial adverse effect is practicably minimized and \u201cclearly outweighed by public health, safety, or compelling public interests\u201d; (B) is consistent with the objectives, policies, and SMA guidelines of the CZMA; and (C) is consistent with the county general plan and zoning. In our view, where a proposed development meets those statutory requisites, the Commission\u2019s denial of \u00e1n SMAP would be in excess of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The purpose of the CZMA is to control development within an SMA through the device of the SMAP, not to totally prevent or prohibit such activity. It follows that, where an administrative record indicates that a proposed development within an SMA would not contravene the statute\u2019s policies, objectives, and purposes, the Commission would exceed its authority by denying an SMAP that may have been requested for that project. The question, here, is whether the Commission\u2019s findings satisfied its duty and authority under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Here, the Commission in other FOF found that the development would have no significant impact on archaeological or historical sites, \u201cfloral\u201d and \u201cfaunal\u201d resources of the coastal area, or on the coastal waters.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission made no finding regarding any impact on the viewplanes and open space.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The only reason given by the Commission for denying the permit, as noted in FOF 62 and 69, is that the development would have cumulative and significant adverse effects on the roadway system at the intersection in question. However, at oral argument in this court, the Commission\u2019s counsel conceded that the traffic generated by the development in this case would have very little, if any, impact on the coastal zone\u2019s environment or ecology.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, absent a finding that the impact on the public facilities would result in a substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, or render the development inconsistent with the objectives, policies, and guidelines of the CZMA, the Commission\u2019s finding that the development would have significant adverse effects and impact on the existing highway system in the area of the development does not provide a sufficient basis for denying the Permit Petition. In other words, if traffic from a development within an SMA is not shown to have a substantial adverse effect on the coastal environment, such impact as the traffic may otherwise have on the existing roadway system in the area of the development cannot be the basis for denying an SMAP application.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Additionally, even if the development in this case is shown to have a substantial adverse effect in accordance with the statute, the Commission was required under HRS 205A-26(2)(A) to determine whether that effect could be practicably minimized and, when minimized, whether the effect is clearly outweighed by public health, safety, or compelling public interests. <em>See Mahuiki, </em>65 Haw. at 516-17 n.10, 654 P.2d at 881 n.10. That was not done in this case. Here, Petitioner represented to the Commission that he would be willing to design the development so as to minimize the traffic impact as much as possible. It does not appear from the record that the Commission considered Petitioner\u2019s offer as we think it was required to do under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On remand, the Commission should reconsider the Permit Petition and determine whether the traffic generated by the development will or will not have a substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect on the coastal zone. If the Commission finds that the traffic <em>will not </em>have such a substantial adverse effect, then the Commission should approve the Permit Petition without conditions relating to the traffic.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Larry Thomas </em>Topliss, Petitioner-Appellant, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AtO\"><em>Michael J. Matsukawa, </em>Corporation Counsel <em>(Anson K. Lee, </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, and <em>Patricia K. O\u2019Toole, </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, with him on the brief), County of Hawai\u2018i, for the Planning Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">If the Commission finds that the traffic <em>will </em>have such a substantial effect, but that the effect can be practicably minimized and, as minimized, the effect is clearly outweighed by public health, safety, or compelling public interests, the Commission should approve the Permit Petition. In order to achieve the minimization, the Commission may impose reasonable conditions on the development. If, of course, the development cannot be made to conform to HRS \u00a7 205A-26(2)(A), then the Commission should deny the Permit Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">This opinion is not meant to prevent the Commission from imposing other reasonable conditions affecting matters within the purview of the CZMA, such as the viewplanes to the ocean, where such may be deemed necessary to comply with the intent of the CZMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s denial of the Boundary Petition.

According to Rule 9\u201411.C.1., the Commission may not approve a proposed development within the SMA unless it first finds that the proposal will not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>\u201csignificant </em>adverse environmental or ecological effectf.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) The CZMA, as indicated above, requires a finding of substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect. The question is whether the language of the Rule renders it in conflict with HRS \u00a7 205A-26(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Administrative rules may not enlarge, alter, or restrict the provisions of the statute being administered. <em>Jacober </em>v. <em>Sunn, </em>6 Haw.

The courts\u2019 duty is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the administrative agency, and the courts will not adopt an interpretation of the agency\u2019s rules that will lead to an absurd result. <em>Mahiai </em>v. <em>Suwa, </em>69 Haw. 349, 742 P.2d 359 (1987).
