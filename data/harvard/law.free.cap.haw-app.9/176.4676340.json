Paul (Leslie) appeals the family court\u2019s (a) August 7, 1991 order granting Plaintiff Don Paul\u2019s (Don) July 24, 1991 motion to strike Leslie\u2019s June 17, 1991 motion to set; and (b) September 18, 1991 order denying Leslie\u2019s August 27, 1991 motion for reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">In FC-D No. 90-2080, which was initiated by Don, Leslie was served by publication that did not attempt to satisfy the in rem jurisdiction requirements outlined in <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, 1 </em>Haw. App. 102, 747 P.2d 1281 (1987). The family court, on March 4, 1991, entered a Decree Granting Absolute Divorce (Divorce Decree) which stated in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">(2) All other matters including but not limited to alimony, division of real property, division of the household goods, furnishings and effects of the parties, division of automobiles, division of personal property, division of insurance policies, ownership of credit cards, division of joint accounts, division and responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>joint debts, and the division of the retirement/pension pay and/or benefits of the parties are all hereby reserved for further order by a court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u2666 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We agree with the family court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the Divorce Decree did not decide the issues listed in paragraph (2) because the family court did not have jurisdiction to decide those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Notwithstanding the fact that FC-D No. 90-2080 had progressed to the point where the time for taking an appeal had passed and, according to Hawai\u2018i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 87(a), Don\u2019s attorney was no longer Don\u2019s attorney of record, Leslie, on June 17, 1991, filed in FC-D No. 90-2080 a motion to set the property division and distribution issues for a hearing and served it by mail on Don\u2019s attorney. Leslie\u2019s motion to set, which included her position statement and financials, was heard on July 2, 1991. At that hearing both attorneys were present, but Don was not present. On July 3, 1991, pursuant to the stipulation of the two attorneys, an expedited trial was set for August 2, 1991 at 8:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">On July 24, 1991 Don\u2019s attorney filed Don\u2019s Motion to Strike Motion to Set, or in the Alternative to Continue Trial. On August 7, 1991 the family court entered an order granting Don\u2019s motion to strike Leslie\u2019s motion to set. The family court concluded that the proper way for Leslie to litigate the property division and distribution issues was by an order to show cause served on Don and not by a motion to set served on the attorney who previously represented Don in FC-D No. 90-2080.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Divorce cases involve a maximum of four discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage;- (2) child custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and (4) division and distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>property and debts. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>7 Haw. App. 111, 748 P.2d 801 (1987). When the family court entered the Divorce Decree, it did not have personal jurisdiction over Leslie or in rem jurisdiction over any of the property and debts of the parties located in Hawai\u2018i. Therefore, it had jurisdiction over only part (1). <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 580-56 (1985)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> specifies what happens to property division and distribution issues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>remain undecided after the entry of a decree of divorce. <em>Boulton v. Boulton, </em>69 Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338 (1986). However, we conclude that HRS \u00a7 580-56 does not apply where the family court did not have jurisdiction to finally adjudicate part (4). Otherwise, a family court that did not have jurisdiction to finally divide and distribute the property and debts of the parties would, in fact and law, divide and distribute them. Therefore, HRS \u00a7 580-56 does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">There are various possibilities with respect to the family court\u2019s entry of a decree of divorce finally deciding part (1):</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">(A) The family court had jurisdiction over part (1) but not part (4). It finally decided part (1) and ignored part (4) and/or left part (4) to be decided by a court with jurisdiction to do so. HRS \u00a7 580-56 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">(B)The family court had jurisdiction over part (1) but not part (4). It finally decided part (1) and part (4) or finally decided part (1) and purported to reserve jurisdiction to decide part (4). HRS \u00a7 580-56 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">(C) The family court had jurisdiction over part (1) but not part (4). It finally decided part (1). It subsequently acquired jurisdiction over part (4). HRS \u00a7 580-56(d)\u2019s \u201cone year\u201d began to run when the family court acquired jurisdiction over part (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(D)The family court had jurisdiction over part (1) and part (4). It finally decided part (1) and ignored part (4). HRS \u00a7 580-56(a) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">(E) The family court had jurisdiction over part (1) and part (4). It finally decided part (1) and reserved jurisdiction to decide part (4). HRS \u00a7 580-56(d)\u2019s \u201cone year\u201d began to run when the family court finally decided part (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">This case presents situation (A). The family court recognized that it did not have jurisdiction to decide part (4) and expressly left part (4) to be decided by a court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">After the family court that has jurisdiction over only part (1) of a divorce case enters the divorce decree and the time for appeal has expired, how does either party bring part (4) to the family court for adjudication? HFCR Rule 3 requires a party to do so by filing an \u201cinitial pleading\u201d with the court. Nothing in the HFCR requires or prohibits that initial pleading from being designated a \u201cMotion to Set\u201d or from being filed under the same FC-D number as was used in the case involving only part (1). Therefore, we conclude that Leslie\u2019s June 17, 1991 Motion to Set satisfied HFCR Rule 3\u2019s \u201cinitial pleading\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In the absence of a relevant statute, the service requirement is governed by the HFCR. <em>See In re Vockrodt, </em>50 Haw. 201, 436 P.2d 752 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">There is a relevant difference between HFCR Rule 4(d)(1) and Hawai\u2018i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 4(d)(1). HRCP Rule 4(d)(1) allows personal service upon an individual to be accomplished in the following ways: (A) by delivering a copy to the individual personally; or (B) if the individual cannot be found, by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein; or (C) by delivering a copy to an agent authorized (1) by appointment or (2) by law to receive service. In contrast, HFCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Rule 4(d)(1) allows personal service to be made only by delivering a copy to the individual personally. Therefore, the family court does not acquire personal jurisdiction over Don until Don is personally served with process pursuant to HFCR Rule 4. In the family court, Leslie contended that (1) the July 3, 1991 stipulation of Don\u2019s attorney setting the matter for trial and (2) the July 24, 1991 motion to strike filed by Don\u2019s attorney each satisfied the personal service of process requirement. We conclude that neither satisfied the personal service of process requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">A party may waive the service of process. 62B Am. Jur. 2d <em>Process </em>\u00a7 111 (1990). Thus, a valid appearance and waiver of service signed by the party is a valid substitute for personal service upon the signing party. In this case, however, there is no evidence that Don waived the service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Don\u2019s attorney entered into a stipulation to set the matter for a hearing and he filed a motion to strike the motion to set or to postpone the hearing to which he had previously stipulated. Under the HRCP, these acts by Don\u2019s attorney may or may not have satisfied the HRCP\u2019s personal service of process requirement because \u201c[i]n the absence of a controlling statute, an attorney may not, without express authority, accept or waive service of original process by which jurisdiction of the court over the person of the client is first established.\u201d 7 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Attorneys at Law </em>\u00a7 146 (1980) (citations omitted). In this case, there is no controlling statute and no evidence that Don\u2019s attorney had express authority to accept or waive service of original process on Don. More importantly, the HRCP does not apply in this case. The HFCR applies and it does not authorize service of an \u201cinitial pleading\u201d on Don\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the family court\u2019s (a) August 7, 1991 order that granted Plaintiff.Don Paul\u2019s July 24, 1991 motion to strike Defendant Leslie Maty Paul\u2019s motion to set, and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>September 18, 1991 order that denied Defendant Leslie Mary Paul\u2019s August 27, 1991 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0z\"><em>Ronald P.
