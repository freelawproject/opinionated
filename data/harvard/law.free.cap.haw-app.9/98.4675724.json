(Defendant) from his bench trial conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291-4(a)(1)(1985), the dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">On December 24, 1989, at 2240 hours, Defendant was stopped by a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer at an HPD sobriety roadblock (sobriety roadblock) on North King Street fronting Wallace Rider Farrington High School. The sobriety roadblock was part of HPD\u2019s drunk driving prevention program and was established under an HPD regulation entitled Administrative Notice No. 86-10 (Notice 86-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Defendant argues that Notice 86-10 was not promulgated in accordance with HRS Chapter 91, as required by HRS \u00a7 286-162.5 (1985), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">Authorization to establish intoxication control roadblock programs. The police departments of the respective counties are authorized to establish and implement intoxication control roadblock programs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>accordance with the minimum standards and guidelines provided in section 286-162.6. The chief of police in any county establishing an intoxication control roadblock program pursuant to this section shall specify the procedures to be followed in carrying out the program in rules adopted under chapter 91; provided that the procedures shall be in conformity with and not more intrusive than the standards and guidelines described in section 286-162.6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The State argues that Notice 86-10 was an internal HPD regulation within the definition of HRS \u00a7 91-1(4) and, therefore, exempt from Chapter 91 \u2019s promulgation provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the State. <em>Doe v. Chang, </em>58 Haw. 94, 564 P.2d 1271 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The same issue was raised in <em>Commonwealth v. Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 483 N.E.2d 1102 (1985). There, the court held that the \u201cguidelines\u201d did not constitute a regulation requiring promulgation according to Massachusetts law. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">The guidelines are directed solely toward troopers, and instruct them as to the manner in which they fulfill their duties. Thus, they do concern the internal management of this agency. ... [The guidelines] limn important procedural and safety considerations. The guidelines reflect an attempt to ensure that the State Police execute roadblocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>in compliance with the principles articulated in <em>Commonwealth v. McGeoghegan, supra. </em>They do not purport directly to regulate public conduct. The guidelines are simply an accurate reflection of the rights of the public as set forth in <em>McGeoghegan. </em>We conclude that the guidelines are not regulations as defined in G.L. c. 30A, \u00a7 K5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 483 N.E.2d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Similarly, although HPD sobriety roadblocks unquestionably impinge on a driver\u2019s freedom of movement, Notice 86-10\u2019s procedures are aimed at prescribing and controlling the police officer\u2019s activities in order to minimize the intrusion on the driver\u2019s rights. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 521 N.E.2d 987 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Defendant next argues that the sobriety roadblock at which he was stopped was not established according to Notice 86-10 and, therefore, he was subject to an unconstitutional seizure. Consequently, he asserts, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress all the evidence obtained as a result of the stop. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Because Defendant was seized without a warrant, the State has the burden of proving that the seizure was reasonable. <em>Shields, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">To carry its burden of proving that the roadblock seizure was reasonable the Commonwealth must show, at least, that the roadblock was conducted in accordance with the guidelines established in <em>Trumble, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 449 N.E.2d 349 (1983). <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>398 Mass. 98, 101, 495 N.E.2d 276 (1986). Adherence to these guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>lines, the content of which need not be recited here, assures that a roadblock seizure is the result of a \u201cplan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.\u201d <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51, 99 S. Ct. 2637, 2640, 61 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1979). Conducting roadblocks in accordance with such neutral criteria minimizes the risk \u201cthat the individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy [will be] \u2018subject to the discretion of the official in the field. \u2019 \u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 655, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 1397, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979), quoting <em>Camara, supra </em>387 U.S. at 532, 87 S. Ct. at 1732. Adherence to the guidelines\u2019 requirements also assures that the surprise, fear, and inconvenience to \u2014 and therefore the intrusion on \u2014 the motoring public is minimized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 521 N.E.2d at 989-90. Our review of the record in the instant case convinces us that the State failed to carry its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">HRS \u00a7 286-162.5 requires that sobriety roadblock procedures comply with the minimum standards established in HRS \u00a7 286-162.6 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notice 86-10 generally conforms to the minimum standards. Notice 86-10 also contains other procedures which, in our view, are designed to make sobriety roadblocks less intrusive than HRS \u00a7 286-162.6\u2019s minimum stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>dards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear from the statute that the legislature intended that, once the procedures were established by the various police departments, they would be scrupulously followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In order to validate the change in location of the sobriety roadblock in this case, the State had to prove that HPD Sergeant William Donnelly\u2019s (Sgt. Donnelly) decision was in accordance with Notice 86-10 and not an exercise of his discretion to set up a road<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>block in a more manageable location. <em>See Shields. </em>The State failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">A memorandum in evidence from Sgt. Donnelly, the officer in charge of the sobriety roadblock, to his superior officers indicated that the sobriety roadblock for December 24-25, 1989, was to be situated at Palama and Halona Streets (Palama-Halona) between 2100 and 2330 hours. However, the State\u2019s offer of proof was that Sgt. Donnelly changed the location from Palama-Halona to North King Street, approximately a mile away, because of traffic congestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The State failed to prove that Sgt. Donnelly had such authority under Notice 86-10. Paragraph H.C. of Notice 86-10 provides that the \u201cGeneral Site\u201d for a sobriety roadblock will be selected by divisional-level commanders. On the other hand, the \u201cSpecific Location\u201d for the sobriety roadblock is selected by the \u201csupervisor responsible for the maintenance of the roadblock[.J\u201d Notice 86-10, Paragraph H.D. Unfortunately, Notice 86-10 does not define either \u201cgeneral site\u201d or \u201cspecific location.\u201d Neither does it provide guidelines for changing either of them once established. Such changes cannot be left to the discretion of the officers in the field. <em>Shields, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The State also argues that Sgt. Donnelly had such authority under HRS \u00a7 286-162.6(a)(3)(E). We disagree. The authority to terminate a sobriety roadblock on account of traffic congestion does not constitute authority under the statute to establish another sobriety roadblock in another location. In fact, that is the precise kind of discretion the guidelines and procedures were designed to prevent. <em>Shields, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Defendant\u2019s seizure was illegal. <em>See Shields. </em>Consequently, all the evidence that flowed therefrom should have been suppressed. Absent that evidence, the State will be unable to proceed with further prosecution. Consequently, Defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Walter K. Horie </em>and <em>Anthony H.

Subparagraph (a)(2) of the statute requires that roadblocks be maintained at a specific location for a maximum period of three hours. However, subparagraph II.I. of Notice 86-10 allows a roadblock period to be extended on account of \u201cdisruptions, severe weather or other unforeseen factors[.]\u201d An extension, even for the extraordinary circumstances described, does not appear to be in harmony with the clear wording of HRS \u00a7 286-162.6. However, the departure from the statute does not, in our view, invalidate Notice 86-10 or any of its other provisions. The departure does not affect the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
