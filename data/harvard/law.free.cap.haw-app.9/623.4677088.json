We vacate the March 6,1992 order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">John and Jane were married on November 23, 1990. Four months later, on March 26, 1991, Jane gave birth to Daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In a related Texas case, Jane submitted her August 16, 1991 affidavit in which she stated in relevant part as follows: \u201cI specifically deny that [John Doe] is the biological father of [Daughter]. The true biological father of [Daughter] is [Richard Zoe], to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In a related Hawai! family court case, Jane filed a complaint for divorce on August 22, 1991. In his answer, John denied his paternity of Daughter. On September 17, 1991, the family court ordered John to pay child support of $200 per month. On March 6, 1992, John filed a motion for an order requiring DNA testing of John, Jane, and Daughter. Three days later, a guardian ad item (GAL) was appointed to protect Daughter\u2019s interests. In his March 19,1992 memorandum in opposition to John\u2019s March 6, 1992 motion, the GAL opposed the motion \u201con the ground that such tests is [sic] not in [Daughter\u2019s] best interest because [John] is requesting the DNA tests solely to disestablish paternity.\u201d On March 30, 1992, the family court denied John\u2019s March 6, 1992 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The instant paternity case commenced when John filed a petition on January 14,1992 seeking the family court\u2019s decree that he is not Daughter\u2019s father. On March 6,1992, the family court entered an order <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing John\u2019s petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The transcript of the January 29, 1992 family court hearing states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">THE COURT: ... But my problem is this, [John] has filed a petition to disestablish paternity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">. THE COURT: ... The petition has to be a petition to establish. He can\u2019t file under Uniform Parent \u2014 the purpose of the Uniform Parentage Act is not to take away fathers from kids, but to give them parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">* <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The transcript of the March 6,1992 family court hearing states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">THE COURT: ... [M]y interpretation of the statute is I don\u2019t think the court has jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">This looks like a disestablishment of paternity action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s why I have problems with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">THE COURT: ... [According to the statute I don\u2019t think I have any jurisdiction at this point in time \u2014 or authority I should say basically \u2014 to \u2014 entertain this petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">So, the Court sua sponte then will dismiss this petition according to [Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 584-6(a)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 584-4(a)(1) (1985) states in relevant part that \u201c[a] man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if: (1) He and the child\u2019s natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is bom during the marriage[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhT\">HRS \u00a7 584-6(a) (Supp. 1992), which is part of Hawaii\u2019s Uniform Parentage Act, states in relevant part as follows: \u201c[A] presumed father as defined in section 584 \u2014 4, . . . may bring an action for the purpose of declaring the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship[.]\u201d In other words, HRS \u00a7 584-6(a) clearly and unambiguously permits John, the presumed father, to bring a paternity action for the purpose of declaring the nonexistence of a father and child relationship between John and Daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">We are \u201cbound by the plain,.clear, and unambiguous language of the statute unless the literal construction would produce an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>absurd and unjust result, and would be clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute.\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>63 Haw. 55, 59, 621 P.2d 346, 348-49 (1980) (citations omitted). We conclude that a literal construction of HRS \u00a7 584-6(a) does not produce an absurd and unjust result and is not clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">From its inception in 1975, HRS \u00a7 584-6(a) permitted certain specified persons to bring an action for the purpose of declaring the \u201cnonexistence\u201d of the father and child relationship. The language expressly allowing a presumed father to bring such an action was added to HRS \u00a7 584-6(a) by Act 224, \u00a7 1, 1991 Haw. Sess. Laws 518, effective June 6, 1991. Thus, the family court was wrong in stating that \u201cthe purpose of the Uniform Parentage Act is not to take away fathers from kids, but to give them parents.\u201d For the same reason, cases such as <em>Matter of Marriage of Ross, </em>245 Kan. 591, 783 P.2d 331 (1989), and <em>McDaniels v. Carlson, </em>108 Wash. 2d 299, 738 P.2d 254 (1987), which were cited by the GAL in his memorandum, have no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">It could be argued that the family court\u2019s ruling was right because Richard Zoe (Richard) was an indispensable party and he was not a party in the case. We conclude that Richard was not an indispensable party. HRS \u00a7 584 \u2014 9(a) (Supp. 1992) states in relevant part that \u201ceach man alleged to be the natural father, shall be made [a party], or, if not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, shall be given notice of the action in a manner prescribed by the court and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d According to the record, Richard was not physically present in Hawai\u2018i and was not subject to the jurisdiction of the family court. So long as that continues to be a fact, Richard need not be made a party, but he shall be given notice. On remand, he must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Jane admits John\u2019s statutory right to seek a judicial determination of his non-paternity. She expresses the view that \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>presumptively legitimate child of questionable parentage should know the truth of her parentage \u2014 both, if there is a difference, her natural and her legal parentage.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkU\"><em>David C. Farmer </em>and <em>Jerilynn Ono Hall </em>(Case &amp; Lynch of counsel) on the briefs for petitioner-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AFD\"><em>Ian A. Macdonald </em>on the brief for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">However, Jane contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">[t]he trial court correctly, in the interest of judicial economy, dismissed the paternity case. There is no logic in allowing two parallel, tandem cases to proceed which both involve the same parties, many of the same facts and many of the same issues. The issue of paternity should be decided in the divorce case (the FC-D case) pursuant to HRS \u00a7 571 \u2014 47[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">We disagree. It would be unfair to John and of no benefit to the judicial system to cause the resolution of his paternity issue to await a resolution of Jane\u2019s property and debt distribution issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Accordingly, we vacate the family court\u2019s March 6, 1992 order that <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed without prejudice John Doe\u2019s January 14,1992 petition seeking a determination that he is not the natural father of Jane Roe\u2019s daughter bom on March 26,1991. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
