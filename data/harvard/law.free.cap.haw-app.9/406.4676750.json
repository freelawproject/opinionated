We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In the early morning hours of July 20,1991, Doe was arrested and thereafter charged with (1) DUI; (2) driving through a red light in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-32(a)(3A) (1985); and (3) driving with an expired safety sticker in violation of HRS \u00a7 286-25 (1985). Doe filed a motion to suppress \u201cany and all evidence relating to the field sobriety tests and evidence derived as a result thereof[.]\u201d Record at 15. On January 8,1992, the family court held an evidentiary hearing on Doe\u2019s motion. The testimony of HCPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Officer Martin Ellazar (Officer Ellazar) established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">At about 12:15 a.m. on July 20, 1991, Officer Ellazar observed Doe drive his vehicle through the intersection of Route 19 and Pukihae Street in South Hilo against a red traffic light. Officer Ellazar activated his blue light and stopped Doe. As Officer Ellazar approached Doe\u2019s vehicle from the rear, Doe got out of his vehicle to meet the officer. Officer Ellazar observed that the safety sticker on Doe\u2019s vehicle had expired and advised Doe of this violation. As Doe stood a foot away from him, Officer Ellazar detected \u201ca very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath.\u201d Trial Transcript at 9. The officer then advised Doe that he would administer field sobriety tests on Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Prior to administering the field sobriety tests, Officer Ellazar asked Doe if he had any physical impairments. Upon receiving a negative reply, Officer Ellazar proceeded to administer to Doe five different field sobriety tests: (1) Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test; (2) Walk-and-Tum test; (3) One-Leg Stand test; (4) Finger-to-Nose test; and (5) Modified Rhomberg test (with heels together and hands down at his side, subject closes his eyes, tilts his head back, and counts backward). Officer Ellazar testified that Doe failed all five tests, so he arrested Doe for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Officer Ellazar also testified that he had been a police officer since 1985, he had a minimum of eight hours of classroom training and another eight hours of classroom training later relating to administering field sobriety tests. HCPD personnel conducted these training sessions. Officer Ellazar has administered field sobriety tests since becoming a police officer in 1985. He stated that field sobriety tests are routinely administered to a driver suspected of DUI, unless the driver is physically unable or refuses to undergo such tests. The HCPD has printed \u201cStandardized Field Sobriety Tests Work Sheet\u201d forms used by its police officers. State\u2019s Exhibit 1. These forms contain instructions to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to the driver being administered the tests and spaces to score the results for each of the five field sobriety tests. According to Officer Ellazar, based on his knowledge, \u201cthere were no administrative rules or regulations governing the administration of the field sobriety tests.\u201d Record at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At the close of the hearing, the family court denied Doe\u2019s motion to suppress. Thereafter, the jury-waived trial of the case commenced. The parties stipulated that the testimony and other evidence in the suppression hearing be made a part of the trial on the merits. The parties further stipulated that (1) after Doe\u2019s arrest, he was transported to the police station where he consented to take a breath test; and (2) the intoxilyzer breath test administered to Doe at 1:45 a.m. indicated a blood alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent. The family court adjudged that Doe was a law violator with respect to DUI,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> driving through a red light, and driving with an expired safety sticker.</p>\n<p id=\"Agh\">After the denial of his motion for reconsideration, Doe timely appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">A state agency \u201cmust conform to the requirements of HAPA when acting in ... a rule making capacity (quasi-legislative)[.]\u201d <em>Town v. Land Use Comm\u2019n, </em>55 Haw. 538, 545, 524 P.2d 84, 89 (1974); <em>see also Sharma v. State, </em>66 Haw. 632, 637, 673 P.2d 1030, 1033 (1983), <em>cert denied, </em>469 U.S. 836, 105 S. Ct. 131, 83 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1984). HAPA defines \u201cagency\u201d and \u201crule\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">(1) \u201cAgency\u201d means each state or county board, commission, department, or officer authorized by law to make rules or to adjudicate contested cases, except those in the legislative or judicial branches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">(4) \u201cRule\u201d means each agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency. The term does not include regulations concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights of-er-preeedures available to the public, nor does the term include declaratory rulings issued pursuant to section 91-8, nor intra-agency memoranda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">HRS \u00a7 91-1 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Doe argues that (1) HCPD is an \u201cagency\u201d as defined in HAPA; (2) HCPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures are \u201crules\u201d pursuant to HAPA; (3) because HCPD failed to conform to HAPA\u2019s rule-making requirements in adopting the field sobriety testing procedures, the procedures are invalid and unenforceable; (4) consequently, the family court should have suppressed the field sobriety test results which led to Doe\u2019s arrest for DUI; (5) without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the field sobriety test results, there was insufficient evidence that Doe was guilty of DUI beyond a reasonable doubt; and (6) therefore the family court\u2019s adjudication that Doe was a law violator for DUI must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The HCPD is a county department authorized by law to make rules. Charter of the County of Hawai\u2018i sec. 7-2.3 (1980) (the police commission is authorized to adopt rules). We therefore agree that the HCPD is an \u201cagency\u201d required to conform to HAPA\u2019s rule-making requirements. However, we do not agree that the HCPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures constitute \u201crules\u201d subject to HAPA\u2019s rule-making requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">HAPA itself excludes \u201cregulations concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights of or procedures available to the public\u201d from its rule-making restraints. <em>See Holdman v. Olim, 59 </em>Haw. 346, 355, 581 P.2d 1164, 1170 (1978) (a directive controlling the dress of visitors to the Oahu State Prison). We conclude that the HCPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures fall within such exclusion and are not subject to HAPA\u2019s rule-making requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In <em>Doe v. Chang, </em>58 Haw. 94, 564 P.2d 1272 (1977), three welfare recipient plaintiffs sought injunctive relief from investigations and prosecutions of welfare fraud on the ground that the State welfare fraud procedures were invalid because the manual of instructions concerning welfare fraud investigations was not adopted in accordance with HAPA\u2019s rule-making requirements. The Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court disagreed with the plaintiffs, holding that the manual of instructions in question constituted \u201cinternal regulation contemplated by HRS \u00a7 91-1(4).\u201d 58 Haw. at 96, 564 P.2d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In <em>State v. Fedak, 9 </em>Haw. App. 98, 825 P.2d 1068 (1992), the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s (HPD) regulation that established the department\u2019s drunk driving prevention program, which included the authorization of sobriety roadblocks, was at issue. A DUI defendant, who had been stopped at a sobriety roadblock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>challenged the HPD regulation in question on the ground that it had not been promulgated in accordance with HAPA. This court held that the HPD regulation was an internal regulation within the definition of HRS \u00a7 91-1(4), stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">[Although HPD sobriety roadblocks unquestionably impinge on a driver\u2019s freedom of movement, [the HPD regulation\u2019s] procedures are aimed at prescribing and controlling the police officer\u2019s activities in order to minimize the intrusion on the driver\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">9 Haw. App. at 101, 825 P.2d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The record in this case discloses that, like in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Chang, supra, </em>the field sobriety testing procedures established by the HCPD were instructional in nature directed only to HCPD police officers. The procedures instructed the officers how to administer field sobriety tests to drivers reasonably believed to have been DUI, after they were properly stopped and ordered out of their cars.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also, although field sobriety tests intrude on drivers\u2019 rights as do sobriety roadblocks, HCPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures are aimed at assuring the proper and correct methods of administering the tests to drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Consequently, those testing procedures concern only the \u201cinternal management\u201d of the HCPD and do not affect \u201cprivate rights of or procedures available to the public\u201d within the meaning of HAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Accordingly, we hold that the HCPD\u2019s field sobriety testing procedures are not \u201crules\u201d subject to the rule-making requirements of HAPA. Therefore, the family court did not err in denying Doe\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Theodore Y.H.
