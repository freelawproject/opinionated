J.</author>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">On April 15, 1985, Son was born to Mother and Father. Although Mother and Father were not married, they and Son lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>together. On July 23, 1986, Mother and the State of Hawai\u2018i Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH) commenced this case by filing a paternity petition against Father. Mother and Father ceased living together in April, May, or June of 1989. In June 1989, Mother and Son moved in with Mother\u2019s father (Maternal Grandfather), whose birth date is January 5, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In June 1989, Father married a woman (Stepmother) and became the stepfather of a fourteen-year-old daughter (Stepdaughter) and a twelv\u00e9-year-old son (Stepson). Stepdaughter lived with her grandmother. Stepson lived with Stepmother and Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On June 23,1989, Father acknowledged his paternity of Son. On September 22,1989, the family court entered a judgment confirming Father\u2019s paternity of Son, awarding Mother legal and physical custody of Son pending a social study, requiring Father to pay child support of $ 120 per month commencing August 10,1989 and $220 per month commencing August 10, 1990 and awarding Father specific reasonable visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On January 11, 1990, the family court entered a Stipulation and Order Granting Child Custody (January 11, 1990 Stipulated Custody Order) which awarded joint legal custody of Son to Father and Maternal Grandfather and sole physical custody of Son to Maternal Grandfather, subject to Father\u2019s rights of reasonable visitation as specified in the September 22, 1989 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On February 20,1990, the family court approved and ordered a stipulation which retroactively reserved Father\u2019s child support payments effective September 10, 1989. On February 21, 1990, the family court approved and ordered a stipulation interpleading Maternal Grandfather in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">On May 7, 1990, Father filed a motion seeking the sole legal and physical custody of Son, subject to Maternal Grandfather\u2019s rights of reasonable visitation. On July 13,1990, Maternal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Grandfather filed a motion seeking the sole legal and physical custody of Son, subject to Father\u2019s rights of reasonable visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The family court\u2019s August 1,1990 social study recommended the award of the legal and physical custody of Son to Maternal Grandfather subject to Father\u2019s rights of reasonable visitation as specified therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">After a September 17,1990 hearing, the family court entered a November 2, 1990 Order Granting Child Custody awarding the sole legal and physical custody of Son to Maternal Grandfather subject to Father\u2019s specified rights of reasonable visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On February 13,1991, the family court entered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The family court found, in essence, that (1) Son has been in the sole physical custody of Maternal Grandfather since June 1989; (2) Maternal Grandfather has provided Son with a stable and wholesome environment in which Son has thrived; (3) it would not be in Son\u2019s best interests to disrupt Maternal Grandfather\u2019s sole physical custody of Son; and (4) Maternal Grandfather can provide \u201cbetter continuity of good care\u201d for Son than Father. The family court expressly did not enter a finding as to whether or not Father was a fit and proper person or had a stable and wholesome home.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The findings of fact challenged by Father in this appeal are not clearly erroneous. The dispositive issue is the question of law whether the family court was permitted to change Maternal Grandfather\u2019s legal custody of Son from joint to sole, to continue Maternal Grandfather\u2019s sole physical custody of Son, and to deny Father\u2019s petition for the award to him of the sole legal and physical custody of Son without entering a finding that Father is not a fit and proper person or does not have a stable and wholesome home. Our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">In <em>In re Jane Doe, 1 </em>Haw. App. 547, 784 P.2d 873 (1989), we quoted the relevant subsections of Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 571-46 (1985) and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>[u]nder HRS \u00a7 571-46, the determining factor with respect to child custody is the best interest of the child. <em>Fujikane </em>v. <em>Fujikane, </em>61 Haw. 352, 604 P.2d 43 (1979). On the subject of best interests, HRS \u00a7 571-46(1) accords priority to the child\u2019s parents. HRS Chapter 587 accords priority to the child\u2019s family as defined in HRS \u00a7 587-2, <em>supra. </em>There are no other statutory priorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">7 Haw. App. at 556, 784 P.2d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Applying the foregoing priorities in a subsequent case, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">in a contest between the mother and the paternal grandmother for a child\u2019s custody, the mother must prevail absent a valid finding that she is not a fit and proper person or has a home that is not stable and wholesome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\"><em>In re John Doe, </em>7 Haw. App. 575, 581, 786 P.2d 519, 523 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The above rule, which is based on HRS \u00a7 571-46(1) (1985), applies in the absence of a valid court order awarding the custody of the child to a person other than the father and/or the mother. When there is a valid court order awarding the custody of the child to a person other than the child\u2019s father and/or mother, HRS \u00a7 571-46(6) (Supp. 1990) applies. It provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cAny custody award shall be subject to modification or change whenever the best interests of the child require or justify the modification or change[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Consequently, Father\u2019s right to custody priority in the absence of a valid finding that he is not a fit and proper person or has a home that is not stable and wholesome was extinguished by the January 11, 1990 Stipulated Custody Order awarding joint legal custody of Son to Father and Maternal Grandfather and sole physical custody to Maternal Grandfather. Thereafter, the sole consideration was the best interests of Son.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Philip D.
