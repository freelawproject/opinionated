Gartrell contends that the district court reversibly erred when it granted the State\u2019s pretrial Motion to Amend Charge. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On September 3, 1990, the automobile Gartrell was driving struck a telephone pole. He was cited for violating HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14 (1985). These statutory provisions specify a driver\u2019s duty to give information and render aid when involved in \u201can accident resulting only in damage to... property which is... attended by any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">On December 19, 1990, Gartrell filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint in which he correctly pointed out that HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14 did not apply to his accident. On January 23, 1991, the State responded with a Motion to Amend Charge to allege a violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-15. That statutory section specifies a driver\u2019s duty when involved in \u201can accident with any... property which is unattended resulting in any damage to the other... property[.]\u201d A first time violator of HRS \u00a7 291C-13 may be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than ten days, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291C-13 and -161(c) (1985). A first time violator of HRS \u00a7 291C-15 may be fined not more than $100, HRS \u00a7 291C-161(b)(1985). On March 11, 1991, Gartrell filed a memorandum in opposition to the State\u2019s motion contending that Hawai\u2018i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(f) did not authorize the State\u2019s motion. After the State\u2019s motion was heard and granted, Gartrell was tried, found guilty of violating HRS \u00a7 291C-15, and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">In this appeal, Gartrell contends that HRPP Rule 7(f) did not permit the district court to allow the State to amend the charge. HRPP Rule 7(f) states as follows: \u201cThe court may permit a charge other than an indictment to be amended at any time before verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Gartrell does not contend that the amendment of the charge prejudiced his substantial rights. Upon a review of the record, we conclude that there is no evidence that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The issue is whether the offense of violating the duties imposed by HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14 with respect to collisions with attended property is a \u201cdifferent offense\u201d than the offense of violating the duties imposed by HRS \u00a7 291C-15 with respect to collisions with unattended property. The answer to that question is dictated by the answer to the question whether the offense of violating HRS \u00a7 291C-15 is an included offense of an offense of violating HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14. <em>State </em>v. Woicek, 63 Haw. 548, 632 P.2d 654 (1981). We conclude that an offense under HRS \u00a7 291C-15 is an included offense of, and not a \u201cdifferent offense\u201d than, an offense under HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">HRS \u00a7 701-109(4)(a) (1985) provides that an offense is included in the charged offense when \u201c[i]t is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">To prove an offense under HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14, the State must prove that (1) Gartrell was driving a vehicle which struck property; (2) the property was attended by a person; and (3) Gartrell (a) failed to immediately stop at the scene of the accident or (b) failed to render reasonable assistance to any person injured in the accident or (c) failed to give the person attending the property and any police officer at the scene certain information required by the statute or, in their absence, failed to give the information to the nearest police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">To prove an offense under HRS \u00a7 291C-15, the State must prove item (1) but not (2). With respect to item (3), the State must prove item 3(a) or (d) that Gartrell failed to locate the owner of the property and give the information to him or (e) failed to attach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>securely in a conspicuous place a written notice giving the information or (f) failed to notify the nearest police officer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AsT\"><em>Jack F. Schweigert </em>(Schweigert &amp; Hossellman, of counsel), on the briefs, for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AEM\"><em>Alexa D. M. Fujise, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We conclude that an HRS \u00a7 291C-15 offense requires proof of less than all the facts required to prove an HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and -14 offense; that an HRS \u00a7 291C-15 offense is an included offense of, and not a \u201cdifferent offense\u201d from, an HRS \u00a7 291C-13 and-14 offense; and, therefore, that HRPP Rule 7(f) permitted the district court to amend the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s June 24, 1991 judgment adjudicating Gartrell guilty of violating HRS \u00a7 291C-15.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
