Kealoha, Jr. (Kealoha) appeals the district court\u2019s April 24, 1991 judgment finding him guilty of the unauthorized overnight parking of his pickup truck at the Molokai airport on April 22, 1990 and sentencing him to pay a $25 fine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Kealoha contends that the district court reversibly erred when it (1) expressly concluded that his Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 703-302 (1985) \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense applied to crimes but not violations and (2) failed to conclude that Kealoha\u2019s justification (\u201cchoice of evils\u201d) defense raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, HRS \u00a7 701-115(2)(A) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">With respect to (1), the State correctly concedes that the \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense applies to violations. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 703-301, 701-107(5), 701-107(7) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">With respect to (2), Kealoha states that the question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">[wjhether the Trial Court erred in failing to rule that [Kealoha\u2019s] knowing refusal to pay a parking violation appropriately constituted an appropriate act of conscience under the \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense set forth in Hawai\u2018i Revised Statute Section 703-302, on the grounds that as a member of the community of Native Hawai\u2018ians who are entitled to specific rights and entitlements pursuant to the Hawai\u2018ian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended, and are also \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of lands which were originally \u201cceded lands\u201d to be held for the benefit of descendants of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands at the time of its annexation by the specific language of the Joint Resolution of Annexation of Hawai\u2018i, [Kealoha] was justified in symbolically refusing to make a small monetary payment as a result of his \u201cviolation\u201d of the plenipotentiary power of the state (or its appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>delegated political subdivision) to make traffic rules as to Molokai) [sic] in light of the continuing breach of fiduciary duty by said state of these two covenants which constituted preconditions to the annexation of Hawai\u2018i as a territory and subsequently the admission of the territory as part of the U. S.?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We note for the record that Kealoha was found guilty of unauthorized overnight parking and not for refusing to pay a fine imposed on him for unauthorized overnight parking. We also note that in his opening brief Kealoha stated that the reason he parked overnight was \u201cthat he missed a plane and could not depart from Hilo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">When the defendant introduces evidence of facts constituting justification, the State has the burden of disproving those facts beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. McNulty, </em>60 Haw. 259, 588 P.2d 438 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 961 (1979). The issue is whether Kealoha introduced evidence of facts constituting justification. We conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cchoice of evils\u201d justification defense is set forth in HRS \u00a7 703-302(1)(a) (1985). It specifies the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">(1) Conduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to himself or to another is justifiable provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">(a) The harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">HRS \u00a7 703-300(1) (1985) states as follows: \u201c \u2018Believes\u2019 means reasonably believes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>54 Haw. 450, 509 P.2d 1095 (1973), the defendants had trespassed into Honeywell Corporation\u2019s Honolulu office in protest of Honeywell\u2019s actions related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Vietnam conflict. In a case charging them with criminal trespass they interposed, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense. The supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">In essence, the \u201cnecessity\u201d defense exonerates persons who commit a crime under the \u201cpressure of circumstances,\u201d if the harm that would have resulted from compliance with the law would have significantly exceeded the harm actually resulting from the defendants\u2019 breach of the law. The defense is not effective in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">(1) Where there is a third alternative available to to [sic] defendants that does not involve violation of the law, the defendants are not justified in violating the law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">(2) A closely related required element is that the harm to be prevented be imminent----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">(3) Thirdly, and most importantly, . . . [defendant\u2019s] actions [must be] reasonably designed to actually prevent the threatened greater harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">54 Haw. at 471-72, 509 P.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Since the offenses in <em>Marley </em>predated the effective date of the Hawai\u2018i Penal Code, HRS Title 37, of which HRS \u00a7 703-302 is a part, Marley\u2019s analysis of the \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense was based on the common law. In our view, however, the <em>Marley </em>rationale is applicable in the construction of HRS \u00a7 703-302(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">In Kealoha\u2019s case, the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged was the unauthorized parking of an automobile in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-111 (1985). Kealoha describes the harm or evil sought to be avoided by his unauthorized parking in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[E]very Hawaiian faces a choice not forced on other, consenting Americans \u2014 that the small daily decisions require decisions of assimilation or defiance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">[Hawai'ians] truly feel that they are prisoners within their own sovereign land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Hawai\u2018ians are the only people who America has denied the essential right to self-determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">During the territorial and statehood regimes, homelands were exchanged for state lands when such exchanges benefitted the purposes of the state. The required consent of congress was never obtained for these exchanges until these airports, including those at Hoolehua and Hilo[,] were fait accomplit [sic]. Congressional approval had been required for these exchanges and Congress had little choice but to so stamp its approval in one fell swoop for all such exchanges only recently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">[T]he airport itself, its parking meters, and its parking tickets, are a daily challenge to Hawai'ians such as Mr. Kealoha \u2014 to accept without resistance the implications of a history that even Congress admits was a wrong to the Hawaiian people, or to challenge, in the smallest ways, on a daily basis, those wrongs constantly reaffirm a chain of legal consequences that give credence to the wrong of the original taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">In other words, Kealoha contends that he illegally parked his car overnight to protest the State\u2019s alleged breach of duty to the community of Native Hawai\u2018ians.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Applying the HRS \u00a7 703-302(1)(a) and the <em>Marley </em>standards, we conclude that the \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense was unavailable to Kealoha under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">1. Kealoha did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to commit the crime to avoid an imminent harm or evil to himself or to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">a. Other forms of noncriminal action were available to Kealoha regarding the State\u2019s alleged breach of duty to the community of Native Hawai\u2018ians.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">b. Kealoha\u2019s unauthorized parking was not reasonably designed to avoid the State\u2019s alleged breach of duty to the community of Native Hawai\u2019ians. In other words, it was reasonably foreseeable that Kealoha\u2019s unauthorized parking would not stop or redress the historic harm or evil he asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">c. The alleged harm or evil sought to be avoided failed to meet the imminence test. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Bachman, </em>61 Haw. 71, 595 P.2d 287 (1979); <em>State v. Horn, </em>58 Haw. 252, 566 P.2d 1378 (1977). Kealoha admits that the State\u2019s alleged breach of duty to the community of Native Hawai\u2018ians has been ongoing during the \u201cterritorial and statehood regimes\u201d or, in other words, since the beginning of the twentieth century. An alleged harm or evil which has been ongoing for that many years is not an \u201cimminent\u201d harm or evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">2. We need not decide whether the alleged harm or evil sought to be avoided was greater than the harm or evil generated by the crime committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Therefore, we conclude that the district court correctly ruled, although for the wrong reason, that the \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense was unavailable to Kealoha.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s April 24, 1991 judgment finding defendant Samuel L. Kealoha, Jr. guilty of unauthorized overnight parking at the Molokai airport on April 22, 1990, and sentencing him to pay a $25 fine.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Williamson B.
