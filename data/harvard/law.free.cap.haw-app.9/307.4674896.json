We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Sometime in 1988, a group of women investors, including Katherine Ogata (Ogata), the complainant in this case, loaned money to Defendant to open \u201cClub Porky\u2019s,\u201d a nightclub in Pearl City. Defendant operated the nightclub for about a year, but in October 1989, transferred the club to Ogata. Although there is contrary testimony by Ogata, Defendant apparently kept her master key to the nightclub after the transfer and continued to work there, tending the bar, manning the disco booth, running newspaper ads, and performing other duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On October 15, 1989, Ogata and Defendant entered into an \u201cAgency Agreement,\u201d whereby Defendant agreed, for a fifteen percent (15%) commission, to be Ogata\u2019s exclusive agent to solicit and obtain entertainment for the nightclub. However, the relationship between Ogata and Defendant soured after a few months, and although neither party terminated the agency agreement, Defendant stopped going to work at Club Porky\u2019s. Defendant later found a job bartending at another bar, only to be fired after Ogata complained to that bar\u2019s owner about her hiring Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">This \u201cbadmouthing\u201d angered Defendant and on August 8, 1990, at about 5:00 p.m., she telephoned Ogata at Club Porky\u2019s and allegedly threatened to kill her. About an hour later, Defendant stormed into the nightclub through the back door, and began searching the club\u2019s interior for Ogata. In the process, she yanked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the air pump and tubing from an aquarium near the bar, and pulled a telephone plug out of the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Eventually, Defendant entered the rear portion of the club, through a kitchen door marked \u201cprivate.\u201d Once inside the kitchen, she approached an adjacent door, which led to what was once a storeroom, but which had recently been renovated into Ogata\u2019s bedroom and bathroom. Defendant kicked this door twice, and when it did not open, she turned the knob, found it unlocked, and opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Upon entering the converted storeroom, Defendant \u201csaw a fancy, brand new bed, new carpets, and it was like a bedroom and she heard the shower running.\u201d Transcript at 307. She then went into the bathroom, found the door open, found Ogata in the shower, grabbed Ogata by the hair* and pulled her to the floor. Subsequently, several club patrons and employees rescued Ogata, the police were called to the scene, and Defendant was arrested and charged with Burglary in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">After a jury trial, Defendant was. convicted of Burglary ira the First Degree. This timely appeal; followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Defendant was charged with violating HRS \u00a7 708-810, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">Burglary in the first degree. (1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the first degree if he <em>intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a person </em>or against property rights, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">(b) He <em>intentionally, </em>knowingly, or recklessly <em>inflicts </em>or attempts to inflict <em>bodily injury on anyone in the course of committing the ojfense[.]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">(2) <em>An act occurs \u201cin the course of committing the offense\u201d if it occurs </em>in effecting entry or <em>while in the building </em>or in the immediate flight therefrom. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Defendant conceded at trial that she \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly inflicted bodily injury upon Katherine Ogata.\u201d Transcript at 343. Defendant maintains, however, that she lawfully entered and remained at Club Porky\u2019s on the night of the assault, and thus could not be convicted of Burglary in the First Degree. Defendant contends that she was privileged to enter all areas of Club Porky\u2019s, including the converted storeroom, because she was an \u201cemployee\u201d of the club, by virtue of the October 15, 1989 agency agreement, and because she had a master key which allowed her access to all parts of the club. Moreover, Defendant asserts that because Club Porky\u2019s was open to the general public at the time of her entry, and she was never asked to leave, she did not \u201cintentionally enter or remain unlawfully\u201d in the building, an essential element of the crime of First Degree Burglary. We find Defendant\u2019s contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Our review of the agency agreement between Defendant and Ogata reveals that it did not create an employment relationship but merely granted Defendant, for a commission, \u201cthe exclusive right to solicit and obtain bookings and/or musical playing engagements\u201d on Ogata\u2019s behalf. The agreement is silent about Defendant\u2019s having access to all areas of the nightclub. On its face, the agreement provides no explicit authority for Defendant to enter what once was the club\u2019s storeroom and which, at the time of Defendant\u2019s entry, was Ogata\u2019s bedroom and bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Moreover, the fact that Defendant may have retained a master key to Club Porky\u2019s when she transferred the nightclub to Ogata does not make her entry to Ogata\u2019s bedroom lawful. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>evidence that Ogata was aware of or approved the retention, nor that any authorization or invitation that Defendant may have had to enter Club Porky\u2019s, extended to Ogata\u2019s private bedroom and bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Defendant urges us to follow the precedent of the Alaska appellate court in <em>Arabie v. State, </em>699 P.2d 890 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985). In <em>Arabie, </em>the defendant entered the rear of a 24-hour grocery and liquor store and was apprehended inside a walk-in cooler that had an \u201cemployees only\u201d sign posted on it, with a case of beer in his hands. The Alaska court reversed the defendant\u2019s burglary conviction, concluding that: (1) the walk-in cooler was not a separate unit but a storage area within a single business structure which included a store; and (2) since the store was open to the public when the defendant entered, the defendant\u2019s entry into the walk-in cooler and rear storage area was not unlawful under the burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We decline to follow <em>Arabie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Unlike Alaska, Hawaii\u2019s Penal Code includes definitions of \u201cbuilding\u201d and \u201center or remain unlawfully,\u201d which, for purposes of the burglary statute, clearly distinguish buildings, such as Club Porky\u2019s, which are only partly open to the public. Those definitions are set forth in HRS \u00a7 708-800 (1991 Supp.) and provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cBuilding\u201d includes any structure,. . . ; <em>each unit of a building consisting of two or more units separately secured or occupied is a separate building.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">\u201cEnter or remain unlawfully.\u201d <em>A person \u201centers or remains unlawfully\u201d in or upon premises when he is not </em>licensed, invited, or <em>otherwise privileged to do so. A </em>person who, regardless of his intent, enters or remains in or upon premises which are at the time open to the public does so with license and privilege unless he defies a law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him by the owner of the premises or some other authorized person. <em>A license or privilege to enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the public is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of the building which is not open to the public[.) </em>[Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Under the plain language of HRS \u00a7 708-800, even if Defendant may have entered the premises of Club Porky\u2019s lawfully, she cannot claim a privilege to enter Ogata\u2019s bedroom and bathroom if such an area is not \u201copen to the public.\u201d In reviewing the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to indicate that this area (i.e., bedroom and bathroom) was not open to the public. The area consisted of two units which were separ ately secured, and required a separate key for entry. The area could be secured from the inside and was used as Ogata\u2019s private dwelling. Furthermore, no one was allowed to enter the area without first obtaining Ogata\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Moreover, even if Defendant had previously been authorized to enter what was once the storeroom, she admitted that at the time of her entry, it was \u201cvery clear\u201d to her that this area was no longer being used as such:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Q. Miss Vowell, when you went into the bedroom on August 8th, 1990, there was no desk in there was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Q. There was no refrigerator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">A. I have no \u2014 only thing that I recognize ... that was there was the bed and carpeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">Q. <em>Was it clear to you that this was not a storeroom any more when you walked ini</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALq\">A. <em>Very clear.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Transcript at 455 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Based on the foregoing, there was substantial evidence to indicate that Ogata\u2019s bedroom and bathroom constituted a \u201cbuilding\u201d not open to the general public within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 708-800, and Defendant was therefore not privileged to enter the private area. Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Defendant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit evidence that Ogata\u2019s bedroom and bathroom existed in violation of the building code and that this refusal \u201cviolated her constitutional right to compulsory process.\u201d Defendant submits that evidence of the bedroom\u2019s illegal existence was relevant to her state of mind at the time of her entry into the converted storeroom and whether she believed she had authority to enter and remain therein. Defendant asserts that because she knew that it was illegal for a bedroom to exist within a nightclub, \u201ceven upon seeing the bed and carpet in the storeroom, it never occurred to her that it was a bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">We note initially that the responsibility for maintaining the delicate balance between the probative value and prejudicial effect of any evidence lies largely within the discretion of the trial court, <em>State </em>v. <em>Iaukea, </em>56 Haw. 343, 349, 537 P.2d 724, 729 (1975), and even where error occurs in the admission of evidence, there will be no reversal where, on the record as a whole, no prejudice to the appellant has resulted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nakamura, </em>65 Haw. 74, 80, 648 P.2d 183, 187 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">In the instant case, we fail to see how the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit evidence of the illegality of Ogata\u2019s bedroom. The fact that Ogata could be prosecuted for having the illegal bedroom was irrelevant to the issue of whether Defendant was authorized to be there. Moreover, the trial court did allow Defendant to testify that it was her \u201cbelief\u2019 that the former storeroom could not be a private bedroom because such was not allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>in a nightclub. Therefore, Defendant was allowed to testify as to her state of mind.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3pq\"><em>Edie A.
