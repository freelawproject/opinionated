Myers (Defendant) refused to submit to a breath or blood test. Consequently, the district court revoked Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year. Defendant appealed the revocation. After the supreme court affirmed the revocation, the district court granted the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of Hawaii\u2019s (State\u2019s) \u201cMotion to Execute Sentence.\u201d In this, his second appeal, Defendant contends that the district court erred in ordering execution of the sentence because the State inexcusably failed to enforce the revocation order for more than three years after the supreme court\u2019s entry of the judgment on Defendant\u2019s first appeal. We vacate the district court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s \u201cMotion to Execute Sentence\u201d and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On December 2, 1986, after an evidentiary hearing, the district court revoked Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for a period of one year pursuant to Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 286-155 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon Defendant\u2019s oral notice of appeal, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>continued the matter to January 2, 1987, for execution of sentence or perfection of appeal, stating that upon posting of a $ 1,000 bond, the revocation would be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. Defendant perfected his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On October 6, 1987, the supreme court affirmed the revocation of Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license by a memorandum opinion in Appeal No. 11855. On November 16, 1987, the supreme court entered its judgment on appeal and notice of judgment on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">On January 9, 1991, more than three years after the filing of the judgment on appeal and the notice of entry of the judgment on appeal, the State filed a \u201cMotion to Execute Sentence\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the district court. On February 1, 1991, Defendant filed a memorandum in opposition to the State\u2019s motion, arguing that the State\u2019s inexcusable lengthy delay in seeking execution had prejudiced him and a revocation of his driver\u2019s license would be inequitable. In an accompanying affidavit, Defendant stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">5. In 1987 his profession in the development industry consisted in major part of office work which did not necessitate a great deal of travel by automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">6. His business has evolved, however, to a point where all of the conduct of his business requires driving to different projects in which he is involved around the island;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">7. He will suffer great hardship if he is unable to operate his automobile for business reasons, in fact, he will not be able to carry on his business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>At a hearing on February 7, 1991, the district court heard the arguments of the parties and granted the State\u2019s \u201cMotion to Execute Sentence.\u201d Defendant obtained a stay of execution and timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Defendant starts with the premise that an implied consent action under HRS \u00a7 286-155 is \u201c\u2018civil\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Severino, </em>56 Haw. 378, 380, 537 P.2d 1187, 1189 (1975) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also State v. Uehara, </em>68 Haw. 512, 515, 721 P.2d 705, 706-07 (1986). Defendant then argues that the district court should have concluded that the equitable doctrine of laches precluded the State from seeking execution of the driver\u2019s license revocation order more than three years after the supreme court\u2019s October 16, 1987 entry of the judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. District courts, which are courts of limited jurisdiction, have no equity jurisdiction because the same is reserved to the circuit courts. HRS \u00a7 603-21.7(a)(3) (1985)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> grants the circuit courts \u201coriginal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>exclusive jurisdiction\u201d of suits in equity. Thus, the district court was without jurisdiction to apply the equitable doctrine of laches in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On the other hand, the State relies on HRS \u00a7 657-5 (1985),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provides for a ten-year statute of limitations for domestic judgments and decrees. The State contends that the district court\u2019s December 2, 1986 order revoking Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year was a \u201cjudgment\u201d of a court of record that could be enforced at any time before the expiration of ten years. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">First, although the district court is a court of record, the supreme court has stated that \u201cimplied consent violation... \u2018hearings before a district judge, pursuant to statute, are in the nature of administrative proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Uehara, </em>68 Haw. at 515, 721 P.2d at 706-07 (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Severino, </em>56 Haw. at 380, 537 P.2d at 1189). Thus, an HRS \u00a7 286-155 license revocation order is more like an administrative order than a judgment subject to the HRS \u00a7 657-5 ten-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Second, in our view, the legislative policy supportive of the implied consent law would not condone allowing the State the discretion of enforcing an HRS \u00a7 286-155 license revocation order any time within a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The purpose of the implied consent law is to facilitate the enforcement of the DUI laws. As the supreme court stated, \u201c \u2018implied consent\u2019 to [breath or blood] testing remains the linchpin of the program to keep [intoxicated drivers] off the highways.\u201d <em>State v. Tengan, </em>67 Haw. 451, 457, 691 P.2d 365, 369 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>HRS \u00a7 286-155(a) requires the arresting officer to submit an affidavit to the district judge \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d HRS \u00a7 286-156 then provides that a hearing \u201cshall be held within twenty days after the district judge has received the affidavit.\u201d The twenty-day hearing requirement is mandatory, not directory. <em>State </em>v. <em>Himuro, </em>70 Haw. 103, 761 P.2d 1148(1988). Thus, the thrust of the implied consent law is to get the arrested driver, who refuses to submit to a breath or blood test, off the highway as soon as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Accordingly, where an appellate court enters a judgment on appeal affirming a district court\u2019s HRS \u00a7 286-155 order revoking a driver\u2019s license, it behooves the State to proceed to enforce the revocation order as soon as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Citing <em>Walsh v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, </em>137 Pa. Commw. 549, 586 A.2d 1034 (1991), Defendant contends that, due to the State\u2019s inexcusable delay, the order revoking his driver\u2019s license should have been voided. In <em>Walsh, </em>the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (DOT) administratively suspended the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year for failure to submit to a chemical blood alcohol test. The defendant appealed to the court of common pleas. Later, the defendant withdrew his appeal. Evidence indicated that the DOT received notification of the withdrawal of the appeal. Four and one-half years later, the DOT reinstated the suspension. After the court of common pleas denied his appeal of the suspension reinstatement, the defendant appealed to the commonwealth court. The commonwealth court reversed, stating that the rule in Pennsylvania is that \u201cundue delay of a license suspension coupled with prejudice suffered by the operator is a basis to void a suspension.\u201d 137 Pa. Commw. at 552-53, 586 A.2d at 1036. However, the prejudice must result from the driver having \u201cchanged [his] position in reliance upon [the DOT\u2019s] inaction[.]\u201d <em>Rea v. Commonwealth of Pa., Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>132 Pa. Commw. 145, 150-51, 572 A.2d 236, 238 (1990).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AyTG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Frederick W. Rohlfing III (James A. Stubenberg </em>and <em>Kim H. Dietz </em>with him on the briefs; Stubenberg &amp; Durrett, Attorneys at Law, of counsel) for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKO\"><em>James H. S. Choi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The State has the obligation of enforcing an HRS \u00a7 286-155 license revocation order in the time frame intended by the legislature. We believe that the adoption of a modified Pennsylvania rule is necessary to pressure the State in meeting this obligation. We therefore hold that, where an appellate court affirms the district court\u2019s HRS \u00a7 286-155 license revocation order, where after the appellate court\u2019s entry of the final judgment on appeal the State\u2019s commencement of a proceeding to enforce the revocation order is unreasonably delayed, and where the defendant is substantially prejudiced because of such delay, the district court should void the license revocation order. Unlike the Pennsylvania court in <em>Rea, </em>however, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s prejudice need not result from a change of position in reliance upon the State\u2019s delay. Such element is too subjective in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Here, the State\u2019s delay of over three years to enforce the license revocation order after the filing of the final judgment on appeal was clearly unreasonable. However, the record is devoid of any finding by the district court whether Defendant was substantially prejudiced. We must, therefore, remand the cause with directions that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing and make findings on the issue of prejudice, if any, suffered by Defendant during the period of the State\u2019s delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s \u201cMotion to Execute Sentence\u201d and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> Hawai\u2019i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 286-155 (1985) provided that, if a person arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI) refuses to submit to a breath or blood test, the arresting officer shall submit to a district judge an affidavit which shall state that (1) at the time of the arrest, the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested person was DUI; (2) that the arrested person had been informed of the sanctions contained in \u00a7 286-155; and (3) the arrested person refused to submit to a breath or blood test. The section further provided that upon holding a hearing, if the district judge finds the statements in the affidavit to be true, the judge shall revoke the driver\u2019s license of the arrested person for a period of one year for the first revocation and for a period of not less than two years and not more than five years for any subsequent revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In 1990, when the legislature enacted the \u201cAdministrative Revocation of Driver\u2019s License\u201d law, it repealed HRS \u00a7\u00a7 286-155, -156, and -157, effective July 1, 1991. Act 188, \u00a7 10, 1990 Haw. Sess. Laws 399, 412. However, in its 1991 Special Session, the legislature enacted HRS [\u00a7 286-155.5] (Supp. 1991) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">Revocation of privilege to drive motor vehicle or moped upon refusal to submit to breath or blood test.
