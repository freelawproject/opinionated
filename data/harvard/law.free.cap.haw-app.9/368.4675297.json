Defendant had gone there to confront Enos because Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>girl friend had informed Defendant that earlier that day Enos had threatened to harm her and Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">When Defendant arrived on Sand Island, he found Enos outside a tent in which Enos and Arva were living. Defendant pointed the rifle at Enos, struck Enos in the face with the rifle butt, and threatened to kill Enos if he threatened Defendant\u2019s \u201cwife\u201d again. Defendant then entered the tent, pointed the rifle at ArVa and made a motion like he was going to hit her. Defendant then took the pouch Arva was wearing around her waist and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The court instructed the jury that the essential elements of Count V were (1) the ownership, possession, or control of a firearm, and (2) a previous felony conviction. We agree with Defendant\u2019s argument that the instruction was incorrect because it did not advise the jury that the State had to prove a third element: that the Defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possessed the firearm. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Pinero, </em>70 Haw. 509, 778 P.2d 704 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">At trial, Defendant did not object to the instruction nor offer an instruction that outlined the elements of the offense. Consequently, the question is whether the court committed plain error. An appellate court may take notice of errors which were not brought to the attention of the trial court where the errors are obvious or otherwise affect a party\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>70 Haw. 46, 760 P.2d 670 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The State argues that Defendant\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudiced because the following instructions satisfactorily instructed the jury that the State had to prove intent as an element of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">The burden is always upon the prosecution to prove both an act and intent to commit that act beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In every crime, there exists a union or joint operation of act and intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">The purpose of requiring both an \u201cact\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d is to insure that no one would be convicted for an act done because of mistake, or accident, or other innocent reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">A person acts intentionally with respect to his <em>conduct </em>when it is his conscious object to engage in such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">A person acts intentionally with respect to <em>attendant circumstances </em>when he is actually aware of the existence of such circumstances, or believes or hopes that they exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">A person acts intentionally with respect to a <em>result </em>of his conduct when it is his conscious object to cause such a result [emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">In Pinero, the supreme court pointed out that the statutory definition of the offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not include the applicable state of mind element. Consequently, the applicable state of mind element \u201cis established when a previously convicted felon possesses or controls a firearm \u2018intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\u2019 HRS \u00a7 702-204.\u201d <em>Pinero, </em>70 Haw. at 526, 778 P.2d at 715. Stating that \u201c[e]rroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 527, 778 P.2d at 716 (quoting <em>Turner v. Willis, </em>59 Haw. 319, 326, 582 P.2d 710, 715 (1978)), the supreme court held it was error for the trial court not to inform the jury about the mental element of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In this case the court gave the jury separate instructions setting forth the essential elements of each of the charges against Defendant. For each of the charges, other than Count V, the court instructed the jury that the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant had acted intentionally. The instruction on Count V\u2019s elements did not inform the jury that the State had to prove any state of mind. The fact that the court specifically instructed the jury that the State was required to prove a mental element for each of the other charges against Defendant but did not so instruct them as to Count V could have misled the jury into thinking that the mental element was not an essential element of Count V. The jury could have compared the instructions and decided that the State was not required to prove a mental element in Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The instructions relied on by the State are not specifically related to Count V. Consequently, they cannot, in our view, be said to amount to an instruction that the State was required to prove an intentional, knowing or reckless state of mind in order to convict Defendant on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The record does not affirmatively show that the error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Defendant claimed at trial that he was intoxicated to the point where he was not responsible for his actions. Defendant argues that prosecutorial misconduct occurred when the prosecutor, during rebuttal, argued that Defendant\u2019s expert was not an authority on intoxication or on the effect that Defendant\u2019s claimed intoxication may have had on Defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. The prosecutor told the jury, \u201cHe\u2019s no more of an expert than you and I.\u201d Defendant\u2019s objection to the argument was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Prosecutorial misconduct may be the basis for a new trial where the prosecutor\u2019s actions deprived the defendant of a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>trial. <em>State v. Hirano, </em>8 Haw. App. 330, 802 P.2d 482 (1990), <em>cert. denied </em>71 Haw. 668, 833 P.2d 901 (1990). The question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions substantially prejudiced the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to have the jury fairly evaluate the merits of his defense. In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct resulted in substantial prejudice we consider (1) the nature of the alleged misconduct; (2) the promptness of any curative instruction; and (3) the strength of the evidence against the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We are not convinced that the argument amounted to a personal opinion on the witness\u2019 credibility. Moreover, in view of the overwhelming nature of the evidence, the statement did not deprive Defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The trial judge imposed mandatory minimum sentences for each of Defendant\u2019s convictions in accordance with Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-660.1 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the court erred because the record contains no evidence that Defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction involved the possession, use, or threat to use a firearm. Our review of the record confirms the lack of evidence. Therefore, HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(b) was inapplicable. The proper sentencing statute is \u00a7 706-660.1 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8K\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Finally, Defendant argues that the court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the burglary in the first degree count on the ground that, since the tent he was charged with having entered was not a building, it was not a dwelling within the definition of HRS \u00a7 708-810 (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The evidence in this case clearly showed that Defendant entered a tent which was used by the victims for lodging.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the only question is whether the tent was a building within the definition of HRS \u00a7 708-800(1) (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">HRS \u00a7 708-800(1) defines a building as \u201cany structure, and the term includes any vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft used for lodging of persons therein[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) defines a structure as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmU\">Any construction, or any production or piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner. That which is built or constructed; an edifice or building of any kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">A combination of materials to form a construction for occupancy, use or ornamentation whether installed on, above, or below the surface of a parcel of land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1424.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Once erected, as in this case, a tent is clearly a structure by those definitions and, therefore, a building.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aly\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Edward K.

Choi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, City and County of Honolulu, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A5L\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We vacate Defendant\u2019s Count V conviction and affirm his other convictions. However, we vacate the mandatory minimum sentences imposed by the court on the convictions we affirm. This matter is remanded for retrial on Count V and for resentencing to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment on the affirmed convictions in accordance with HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> In this opinion, the charge of Possession of a Firearm by a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes will be referred to as Count V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-12\"> The record in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinero, </em>70 Haw. 509, 778 P.2d 704 (1989), shows that the trial court gave the jury a general instruction defining the intentional, knowing, and reckless states of mind.
