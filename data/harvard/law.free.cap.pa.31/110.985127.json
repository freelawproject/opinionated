Wilson, on a contract of guarantee, under seal, dated the 11th April 1843, hut executed on the 11th April 1842; whereby the defendant guarantied to the plaintiff the payment of $1000, with interest, loaned by him to the Northampton Bank, and to be repaid in one year, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">On the 11th April 1842, the Northampton Bank assigned to the plaintiff the bond of Peter Hubei\u2019, Abraham Worman, and Abraham Worman, Jr., of the same date, in favour of the bank, conditioned for the payment of $1000, on the 1st April 1844, with interest. This assignment was made as collateral security for the sum of $1000, on that day, loaned to the bank, by the plaintiff, in specie, and to be repaid to him, in like currency, on the 1st April 1843.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-11\">Upon this assignment was endorsed the contract of guarantee on which the plaintiff brought this action, as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-12\">\u201c I, Thomas B.

In June 1848, a fire occurred in Allentown, by which Huber lost much of his property; the defendant thereupon requested the plaintiff to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>suit upon the bond, which was done, and 50 p\u00e9r cent, only was realized. The plaintiff then brought this action on the defendant\u2019s guarantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">The defendant filed a special plea, alleging that he was discharged from liability, because the plaintiff had not used due diligence in collecting the bond from the obligors, who were, at the maturity of the bond, and a long time afterwards, solvent, and could and would have paid the same, if payment had been demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">To this the plaintiff replied, that he did proceed against the obligors in said bond, when notified to do so by the defendant; and that the defendant\u2019s covenant with the said plaintiff was for the payment of the said money in the said bond, at a day certain, in gold or silver; and that, by the force of his covenant and agreement, the defendant became liable to pay the same on that day, or on any other day thereafter, if the obligors in the said bond should fail to do so, without the said plaintiff being required to pursue the said obligors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">On the trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence the following letter from the cashier of the Northampton Bank to himself:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">\u201c Northampton Bank, Allentown, April 12, 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-10\">\u201c Mr. Martin Kemmerer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-11\">\u201c Dear Sir: The bearer, Mr. Samuel Horn, will hand to you a certificate of deposit for one thousand dollars, payable on the first of April next, in gold or silver coin, with interest; to secure which certificate he will also hand you a bond, Peter Huber and others, to the bank, assigned to you, and guarantied by Mr. Thos.

An exception was also taken to the admission of evidence of the solvency of the estate of Abraham Worman until 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-17\">The court (McCartney, P. J.) charged the jury, that the defendant\u2019s contract was not an original undertaking, but a technical guarantee; and that, if the obligors in the bond were all, at the maturity thereof, able to pay it, and remained so until 1848, the defendant was discharged from all liability, by the plaintiff\u2019s omission to collect the debt during that period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-18\">To this charge the plaintiff excepted, and a verdict having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>rendered in favour of the defendant, and judgment entered thereon, the plaintiff removed the cause to this court, and here assigned for error: 1.

But the facts in the two cases were entirely different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">In Leser <em>v. </em>Frantz the bond was payable on the 1st April 1850 ; the guarantee endorsed on it, was in the following words : \u201c I hereby guaranty the payment of the within bond, at the time therein specified. Witness my hand and seal, this 2d day of May 1850. William Frantz. [Seal.]\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">The question as to whether an agreement that a third party shall pay money at a future time, and that at a time different from that specified in his bond, is an original undertaking, or a general guarantee could not have been raised in the case of Leser <em>v. </em>Frantz. The guarantee was dated after the bond was due, and the words, \u201c <em>at the time therein specified,\u201d </em>were very properly rejected as insensible, and the writing was treated as an ordinary case of the guarantee of a bond assigned after it became due. The court below were reversed, because they treated a guarantor as a surety. In Leser <em>v. </em>Frantz this court says, \u201c Now it is well settled in Pennsylvania, that the contract of one who guaranties the existing debt of another, is a mere warranty of the debtor\u2019s solvency.\u201d Viewed by this rule, the case of the defendant in error is gone. He did not warrant the solvency of Huber and the Wormans; but he undertook that, on the 1st April 1843, they should pay to Kemmerer one thousand dollars, with its interest, in gold and silver. If they paid at the time, he was discharged; if not, he was to do it for them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-12\"><em>A. JE. Wright </em>and <em>S. A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9J\">It is a mistake to suppose that the instrument on which this action is brought is a guarantee of the bond of Huber and others. It is certainly a guarantee, and not an original undertaking, because the word \u201c guarantee\u201d is used in it without any words tending to show that it was not used in its ordinary sense. The contract guarantied is described in the guarantee to be one in which there was an obligation to pay to Martin Kemmerer \u201c the sum of one thousand dollars, with interest, in gold or silver coin, on the said first day of April, A. D. 1843.\u201d The contract containing this engagement is the one which immediately preceded the guarantee on the same sheet of paper. We refer, of course, to the engagement of the bank, contained in the instrument assigning the bond of Huber and others to Kemmerer, as collateral security for his claim. It was not improper to call it an \u201c obligation,\u201d for it is an engagement under the corporate seal of the bank. ,It is not very strange that Wilson should speak of the parties bound by it as \u201c obligors,\u201d because it is signed by both of the officers of the bank. Although this description of them was not technically correct, such an inaccuracy of expression is not sufficient to outweigh the other controlling points of description. There is nothing whatever in the bond given by Huber and others which can substantially answer the description contained in the guarantee. There is no engagement in that bond to pay money on the first of April 1843 \u2014 there is no engagement to pay \u201c in gold or silver coin.\u201d This construction is an answer to the argument founded on the supposition that the instrument on which the action is brought, contains an engagement for the payment of the money at an earlier day than that provided for in the principal contract. The principal contract is that entered into by the bank. The bond against Huber and others was assigned as collateral security for that contract. It was a part of the assets of the bank pledged to Kemmerer as a security for his demand, and although he might have brought his action immediately after the 1st of April 1843, still, as he did not bring suit until long after the bond of Huber and others became due, the defendant below, by virtue of his equity as guarantor, had a right to show that by the exercise of due diligence, the plaintiff below might have recovered his claim out of the assets of the bank in his hands. A loss of those assets, through negligence, is as fatal to his recovery from the guarantor as a loss of the debt through a want of diligence in prosecuting the bank itself. That' these assets were sufficient to pay the debt, and that they were lost through a want of diligence on the part of the plaintiff below, is admitted in the pleadings; The facts con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>stituting this' defence, as set forth in the special plea, are not denied in the replication. The plaintiff below replies that he \u201c did proceed against the obligors in the said bond <em>when notified to do so by the said defendant.\u201d </em>The value of this allegation depends upon the question, whether the instrument signed by the defendant below is of such a character as to require him to give the plaintiff notice to proceed against the principal debtor\u2019s property. As we are of opinion that it is nothing more than an ordinary guarantee, it follows that the replication contains no sufficient answer to the special plea; and this entitles the defendant to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">It was right to admit the letter of Q-eorge Heck in evidence, to show the mistake id the date of the guarantee. But we cannot see any error in rejecting it when offered in evidence generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
