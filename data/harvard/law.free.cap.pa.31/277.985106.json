Grim, his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">Jacob Numer died intestate and insolvent, in September 1855, indebted to Gish &amp; Henzey, in a judgment obtained to November Term 1854, for a debt contracted prior to the Act of 9th April 1849, and to other creditors, whose debts were subsequently contracted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">Letters of administration on his estate were granted to A. Grim, who, at the request of the widow, had appraised and set apart for her use, under the Act of 26th April 1850, property valued at $299.97, and filed an inventory thereof, which was submitted for the approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The approval of this appraisement was afterwards, on the application of Gish &amp; Henzey, stricken off, and the matter held under advisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">When the case was called up for the final action of the court, the inventory, upon a search in the office \u2019 of the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court, could not be found. Whereupon, the court said that as the appraisement and inventory had not received their approval, by virtue of which alone the widow could retain the property, no further decree was necessary; and the subject was thus dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\">On a settlement of the administration account, there was found to be in the hands of the administrator for distribution, after payment of expenses, and of the claims entitled to preference under the Act of 1834, a balance of $141.68. This was claimed by the appellants as applicable to the payment of their debt, which exceeded the whole fund in amount. The subsequent creditors also claimed, that it should be distributed <em>fro rata </em>among all the creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-11\">The court below decreed that all the creditors should come in for a rateable proportion of the fund; and from that decree this appeal was taken by Gish &amp; Henzey.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-12\"><em>Blair, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayu\">cited Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 <em>Harris </em>310; Harleman <em>v. </em>Buck, 6 <em>Casey </em>267; Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver, 11 <em>Harris </em>167; Light <em>v. </em>Leininger, 8 <em>Barr </em>403.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-13\"><em>Mattern, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aos\">cited Davis\u2019s Estate, 1 <em>Phila.

From what is said, on both sides, of the lost inventory, and from the short minute of the court\u2019s action, the widow seems to have prevailed over the younger creditors. Certainly she would have prevailed over them, but for the action of the appellants, who came in and snatched from her hands the property about to be retained. On her consequent withdrawal, the creditors returned indiscriminately to the contest, and the question is, whether those who existed before 1849, against whom she had no rights, shall take the money, or whether they shall share it with those who would have been-cut out, if the appellants had not stepped in. We decide for the former. However it might have been if the widow had remained inactive, it is plain to us that, as she had done what was necessary to establish her claim to the property in controversy, the creditors before 1849 ought not to be deprived of the rights which they acquired by their own vigilance; nor ought those since 1849, wrho, but for the appellants, would certainly have lost their entire claims, be allowed to make use of the promptness of their opponents to regain wThat was once thus clearly gone. It is something like the case of two execution creditors, one arising before, and the other after the exempting act, one prevailing over the defendant, and the other prevailed over by him. In the distribution of a fund thus raised by the sheriff, we can perceive no reasonable ground on which the older creditor can be deprived of the money by an interference of the younger, or in any other way than his own failure to claim to participate in the distribution. This was very much the case in Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 <em>Harris </em>310, in which the first effort was made to distinguish between the rights of creditors before and after the act. We are disposed to follow it. Let the appellants take the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Decree reversed, and the fund in the accountants\u2019 hands awarded to the appellants, at the costs of the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
