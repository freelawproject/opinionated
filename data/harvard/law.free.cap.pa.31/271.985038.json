The defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>thereupon, removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-6\"><em>B.

They also cited Kramer <em>v. </em>Sandford, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>328; Mechanics Bank v. Griswold, 7 <em>Wend. </em>165; Spencer <em>v. </em>Harvey, 17 <em>Wend.489; </em>Gowan <em>v. </em>Jackson, 20 <em>Johns. </em>177: 7 <em>Mann., Grang. &amp; Scott, </em>401, 411.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-7\"><em>B. G. Eshelman, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amf\">The object of the notice is to enable the- endorser to secure himself. Now, if the endorser, has all the estate of the maker in his hands, or under his control, whether it be sufficient to pay all the debts or not, the reason of the rule requiring notice fails. In this case, the endorser not only had all the estate that the maker had, or ever could have (which was sufficient to pay all the debts of the maker), under his control, hut by his position as executor the <em>obligation to pay the note when it was due fell upon himself: </em>Barton <em>v. </em>Baker, 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>334; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Griswold, 7 <em>Wend. </em>165; Spencer <em>v. </em>Harvey, 17 <em>Wend. </em>489 ; Bond <em>v. </em>Farnham, 5 <em>Mass. </em>170; 5 <em>Maryland R. </em>265 ; Porthouse <em>v. </em>Packer, 1 <em>Camp. N. P. </em>82; Gowan <em>v. </em>Jackson, 20 <em>Johns. </em>176; Caunt <em>v. </em>Thompson, 7 <em>Mann., Grang. &amp; Scott </em>400; Kramer <em>v. </em>Sandford, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>328;</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">The case of the Juniata Bank <em>v. </em>Hale is not decisive upon this question. In that case the endorsers were administrators. The holders did no act for a number of years by which it was indicated that they Iooke'd to the endorsers for payment; and when suit was at length brought, the lands of the maker had ceased to be a fund for the payment of debts. The endorsers were therefore injured by not receiving notice. Judge Duncan, in his opinion, page 162, puts the case upon the peculiar position of the administrator: <em>\u201c </em>The lands, the fund here for the payment of debts, do not come into the possession of the administrator ; he has no right of entry, and can bring no ejectment; the possession descends to the heir. The executor or administrator have, by virtue of thgir office, in no case a right to the possession of the deceased\u2019s lands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A34p\">In this case, there was no delay in claiming from the endorser; he was an executor, and not under the disabilities of administrators. The whole estate came into the hands of the executors. They were authorized by the will to sell all their testator\u2019s estate, real, personal and mixed. The lands, therefore, came into their possession.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b272-12\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdDO\">The principle upon which the case of the Juniata <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Bank <em>v. </em>Hale, 16 <em>S. &amp; </em>R. 157, was decided, is conclusive in favour of the defendant below in this case, and we discover no sufficient reason for rejecting it. That case might have been decided upon its special circumstances, but it was not. It follows the rule that requires that payment of a note shall be demanded of the maker at maturity, and that notice of its dishonour shall be immediately given to the endorser, and refuses to make an exception in a case where, during the currency of the note, the maker dies, and the endorser becomes his administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">And the case of Kramer <em>v. </em>Sandford, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>328, makes no exception, while it does recognise existing exceptions, especially in cases where, from the nature of the transaction, it is the duty of the endorser himself, in relation to the maker, to take up the note; as in the case of a note for his accommodation, or where funds have been put into his hands for the purpose of paying it, or in some way, as between him and the maker, he has become the real debtor. In such cases, he will have to pay first or last, notice or no notice, and therefore notice can be of no use to him, and its omission can do him no harm: 19 <em>State R. </em>400; 23 <em>Id. </em>476.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The principle of such exceptions does not apply to an*%ndorser, who, during the currency of the note, becomes the executor or administrator of the maker. As executor he is not personally bound, and the purpose of demand and notice is to make him so, and to warn him of the fact that the holder looks to him individually. This may not aid him in saving anything out of the maker\u2019s estate; but it warns him to calculate and arrange his own with reference to it. Without such notice, most of men, when they are not themselves the true debtors, would suppose themselves discharged, and would be very much surprised to find themselves, after five years perhaps, as it was in The Bank <em>v. </em>Hale, or perhaps after the maker\u2019s estate had been distributed to other creditors, sued as endorsers. We see no adequate reason for making this case an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Judgment reversed, and judgment is now here entered in favour of the defendant, with costs, and the record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
