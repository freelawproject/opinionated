Hagarman and Owen Coleman, garnishees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-17\">A <em>fieri facias </em>was issued out of the court below, at the suit of Tilard Gery against Enos Gery, the defendant, to April Term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>1856. The defendant claimed the benefit of the exemption law; and his personal property, appraised at $7, was set apart to him. He then claimed the balance of the $300, allowed by law, out of his real estate. The appraisers reported that the real estate, consisting of a small house and lot of ground, could not be divided without prejudice to, or spoiling the whole, and returned a valuation of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">At November Term 1856, the real estate was sold by the sheriff for $1010; and the court awarded to the defendant $293 of the proceeds, to make up the amount to which he was entitled under the exemption law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">On the 10th November 1856, this sum of $293 was paid by the sheriff to J. Hagarman, the defendant\u2019s attorney; and, before it could be paid over, this writ of attachment, at the suit of Henry Ehrgood, was served on him as garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">The court below adjudged the fund to the attaching creditor, which was here assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-9\"><em>Banks, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVG\">cited Wray <em>v. </em>Tammany, 1 <em>Harris, </em>395, 396; Yelverton <em>v. </em>Burton, 2 <em>Casey </em>354.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-10\"><em>T.

We do not think that any logical result of legal analogies ought to sustain this proceeding. The plain sense of the law is, that $300 worth of property is to be saved .to Gery from his execution creditors; and this money, which is given in its stead, cannot be attached while passing from the court to his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">The decree on the attachment execution is reversed, and is now entered in favour of the defendant below, with costs, and the record is remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
