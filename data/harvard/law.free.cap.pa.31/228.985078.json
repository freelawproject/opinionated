That the facts as proved in this case, do not exhibit such a disposition of the bond and mortgage by George M. Phillips, the husband, as did divest the right of survivorship of his wife, Mrs. Jane Phillips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">2. Unless Mr. Myers knew, at the time he paid the money to Mrs. Phillips, that the bond had been assigned previously, the payment to her was good and discharged the mortgage <em>pro tanto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">3. That, in the absence of the bond, even if James Colwell did indemnify Mr. Myers for the payment to his sister, it is not such a notice, express or implied, as should vitiate his payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">4. That there is no evidence in the case, which amounts to either express or implied notice to Mr. Myers, that the bond had been assigned. Nor is there any evidence of such notice to him, as would justify his withholding the money. There being a mortgage on record to secure the same money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">In answer to these points, the learned judge (Graham, P. J.) instructed the jury as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">\u201c 1. In this case the husband had possession of the bond, he assigned it for value, and, so far as the money was paid by the assignee, the assignment defeats the wife\u2019s right as survivor, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. We, therefore, answer the first point presented by defendant\u2019s counsel in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">\u201c 2. But defendant contends, that Myers paid this bond to Mrs. Phillips, without notice of the assignment, and is, therefore, protected from a recovery in this suit.brought for the use of the assignee. The law is, that if an obligor in a bond pays to the obligee without notice of an assignment, the assignee cannot recover; but, if it is paid under circumstances which ought to put a man of ordinary caution and prudence upon inquiry, which would enable him to ascertain the truth, then such payment would not defeat a recovery by the assignee. If Mr. Myers did not know, at the time of payment, that the bond was assigned, and did not pay it under circumstances which ought to have put him upon inquiry, which would have resulted in a knowledge of the assignment, the payment to Mrs. Phillips was good, and satisfies the mortgage <em>pro tanto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\"><em>\u201c </em>3. The absence of the bond, and the indemnity of James Colwell to Mr. Myers, is not notice to Mr. Myers that the bond was assigned; but is evidence, in connection with the other evidence in the case, for you to consider, in determining whether the payment was made under circumstances which ought to have induced inquiry, as we have before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-12\">\u201c4. We cannot instruct you as requested by this point. The evidence is for you to pass upon, and we would not be justified in withdrawing it from the jury. There is evidence which we think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tends strongly to show that if Mr. Myers did not know the bond was assigned, he paid it under circumstances which ought to have put him upon inquiry which would have resulted in ascertaining the truth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">To this charge the defendants excepted ; and a verdict and judgment having been given for the plaintiff, the defendants sued out this writ, and here assigned for error the charge of the court in answer to the 1st, 3d, and 4th points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-6\"><em>Watts </em>and <em>Colwell, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-l\">Marriage is not a gift of the wife\u2019s choses in action to the husband, but merely bestows on him a naked power to make them his own: Dennison <em>v. </em>Nigh, 2 <em>Watts </em>90; Shay <em>v. </em>Sessaman, 10 <em>Barr </em>432; 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>137. An absolute assignment is an unequivocal act of dominion by the husband, with intent to make the subject-matter his own, and of course bars the wife\u2019s right of survivorship. But it is well settled, that reduction into possession, so as'to work a change of ownership, is a question of intention: Gochenaur\u2019s Estate, 11 <em>Harris </em>463. In the present case, the husband assigned merely as collateral security for a temporary loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">An assignment as collateral security is to be considered merely as a pledge: 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>577; <em>Addison on Contracts </em>318; Garlick <em>v. </em>James, 12 <em>Johns. </em>146. The only distinction between this case and Hartman <em>v. </em>Dowdel, 1 <em>Rawle </em>279, is, that, in the latter, the claim was assigned to secure the payment of a precedent debt, while here it is to secure a debt presently contracted; but the decision in that case rests wholly on the ground that the assignment was a mere pledge. And it is well established that a pledging does not change the title: Cortelyou <em>v. </em>Lansing, 2 <em>Caine\u2019s Cas. </em>200; 2 <em>Kent's Com. </em>581; <em>Addison on Contracts </em>318; Latourette <em>v. </em>Williams, 1 <em>Barb. </em>9; Webb\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em>250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">The receiving of this bond by the husband, and executing the release to the executors, shows an evident intent that it should be for the wife\u2019s separate use: Siter\u2019s Case, 4 <em>Rawle </em>468; Shay <em>v. </em>Sessaman, 10 <em>Barr </em>433; 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>137, note <em>a; </em>2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., </em>\u00a7 1204; Borst <em>v. </em>Spelman, 4 <em>Comst. </em>284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-9\">The money was paid by Myers to Mrs. Phillips, before he had any notice that a third party claimed it. The law does not impose upon an obligor the necessity of making inquiry to find whether his obligation has been changed; on the contrary, it casts upon the party who claims it, to give notice of the change: Bury <em>v. </em>Hartman, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>177, 188; Woodbridge <em>v. </em>Perkins, 3 <em>Day </em>364; Brindle <em>v. </em>McIlvaine, 9 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>74; Hodgson <em>v. </em>Naglee, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>217; Northampton Bank <em>v. </em>Balliet, 8 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>311; 1 <em>Barr </em>266; Gaullagher <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 10 <em>Harris </em>302.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>Williamson </em>and <em>S. </em>Hepburn, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOT\">The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>position of the plaintiffs in error is, that George M. Phillips did no more than pledge the bond. A pledge is a deposit as security for a debt: <em>Story on Cont., </em>\u00a7 717. But here, there was an equitable alienation and transfer of the title and ownership. A party taking and holding property, real or personal, defeasible on the performance of a subsequent condition, is, so long as the condition continues unperformed, deemed to have the same title and ownership, as if no such qualification had been annexed: 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>125; 2 <em>Preston on Abstracts </em>185; Darling <em>v. </em>Chapman, 14 <em>Mass. </em>103 ;. Barrow <em>v. </em>Paxton, 5 <em>Johns. </em>258-61; Brown <em>v. </em>Bement, 8 <em>Johns. </em>97; <em>Addison on Cont. </em>318; 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., </em>\u00a7 1030. In Garlick <em>v. </em>James, 12 <em>Johns. </em>146, there were no circumstances whatever indicating an intent <em>to </em>assign or transfer the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ank\">The case of Latourette <em>v. </em>Williams, cited by the plaintiffs in error, is against them; it is there shown that though the pledging of a note does not pass the title, jt sale or mortgage of it does. In Webb\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em>250, it is merely said, that the wife\u2019s right of survivorship is not barred by an assignment without value, or by pledging it; and to the same effect is Hartman <em>v. </em>Dowdel, 1 <em>Rawle </em>279. For this also there is the high authority of Lord Hardwick, in Bates <em>v. </em>Dandy, 2 <em>Atk. </em>207, a case which has the sanction of Chancellor Kent, in Schuyler <em>v. </em>Hoyle, 5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>207, and which is said by Chief Justice Gibson, in. Siter\u2019s Case, 4 <em>Rawle </em>273, to be \u201c one of the highest authority.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGD\">There is nothing to show that this bond was intended to be for the separate use of Mrs. Phillips. - A bequest to a trustee, in trust for the use of a married woman, does not exclude the husband\u2019s rights: Evans <em>v. </em>Knorr, 4 <em>Rawle </em>66; Torbert <em>v. </em>Twining, 1 <em>Yeates </em>432; Clevenstine\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>Harris </em>496. Words used to create a separate exclusive interest in the wife, must manifest an unequivocal intent to exclude the power and marital rights of the husband : 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq.., </em>\u00a7 1381-2; <em>Clancy </em>262. Where the husband and wife acquire a joint right or interest in personalty, the husband alone may dispose of it as he pleases: Paschall <em>v. </em>Thurston, 2 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>10; McConnell <em>v. </em>Wenrich, 4 <em>Harris </em>365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">The instruction of the court below on the subject of notice, is founded upon the soundest principles of law and equity, as well as of common and equal justice: Anderson <em>v. </em>Van Alen, 12 <em>Johns. </em>343 ; Guthrie <em>v. </em>Bashline, 1 <em>Casey </em>80-1.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"Asp\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcG\">Prior to the Act of Assembly of April 11th 1848, marriage, though not an absolute gift of the wife\u2019s choses in action, vested in the husband a right to them, on condition that he should reduce them into possession during the coverture. Her separate civil existence being suspended and merged in his, he succeeded necessarily to all her power and dominion over her chose, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>could exercise that power as fully as she could have exercised it, had she remained sole. <em>That </em>reduction into possession, which made the chose absolutely, as well as potentially, the husband\u2019s, was a reduction into possession not of the <em>thing, </em>but of the <em>title </em>to it. Consequently, his legal assignment of her chose in action, barred the wife\u2019s right of survivorship, for it took away her legal title, upon which alone that right rested. The only reason why an equitable assignment did not always work the same results, was, that the assignee was compelled to go into equity (a thing in action not being assignable at law), and when in equity, a chancellor would not interpose in favour of a volunteer against the conjugal rights of the wife. But when the assignee had an equity resulting from the payment of a valuable consideration, an equitable assignment was as available as a legal one \u2014 equally transferred the wife\u2019s title and equally barred her survivorship. The equitable assignment was a declaration of trust, and a valuable consideration paid, moved the chancellor to decree its execution. While, therefore, the husband\u2019s equitable assignment of a wife\u2019s chose in action, without value received, was unavailing to deprive her of the right of survivorship, an assignment for a valuable consideration did defeat it, and passed the title to the assignee, as fully as if it had been made by the wife before coverture.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It is unnecessary to pursue this subject further. The masterly discussion of Chief Justice Gibson, in Siter\u2019s Case, 4 <em>Rawle </em>468, has left almost nothing unsaid. If, then, the transaction between George M. Phillips and William Graham was an assignment of the bond of Mrs. Phillips for a valuable consideration, it must prevail against the wife, even though she survived her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It is, however, contended that it was not an assignment, but a pledge. Undoubtedly, a pledge is insufficient to bar the wife\u2019s right, for it is no reduction into possession of her title. The instrument now before us is an assignment, not a pledge. It contains all the operative words fit and necessary to pass the title. It needs but one more witness, to make it a legal assignment under the Act of 28th of May 1715, such as to enable an assignee to sue in his own name. That it passed the bond to Graham, as a security collateral to the obligation expressed in the instrument, makes the transaction no less an assignment. The title was in the assignee, defeasible on the performance of a condition subsequent, to wit, the payment of the debt. That the existence of such a condition subsequent, does not prevent the title from vesting in the assignee, is the result of all the authorities, so far as I know, without exception. The case of Hartman <em>v. </em>Dowdel, 1 <em>Rawle </em>279, relied upon by the plaintiff in error, in truth, asserts no other doctrine. Chief Justice Gibson, the author of the opinion, in speaking of it in Siter\u2019s case, remarks that, \u201c However the opinion of the court may have been expressed, it certainly was intended to rule the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>case expressly on the distinction between a voluntary assignment and one for value.\u201d There the consideration for the equitable assignment was not, as here, an advance of money at the time, but a pre-existing debt, which had been held in Petrie <em>v. </em>Clark, 11 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>377, not to be a valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Bates <em>v. </em>Dandy, 2 <em>Atk. </em>207, a case fully recognised in this state as of fundamental authority, was itself but an agreement to assign the wife\u2019s chose in action, as a collateral security for a present loan of money, yet it was decreed to prevail against the wife. A mortgage is only a collateral security, yet it passes the title. This is universally conceded: 2 <em>Kent Com. </em>581; <em>Addison on Contracts </em>318; <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>1030. If, then, the assignment of George M. Phillips conveyed to Graham the title to the chose, as we have seen that it did, and was for a valuable consideration, the court below correctly instructed the jury that it defeated Mrs. Phillips\u2019s right of survivorship. As was said in Woelper\u2019s Appeal, 2 <em>Barr </em>71, it is the husband\u2019s assumption of title, and not the form of the act by which it is indicated, which is the criterion. An actual use of the wife\u2019s chose in action for his own purposes, works a transfer of her ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">__^The second error assigned is, that the court refused to charge the jury, \u201cthat the facts, as proved, established, that the transaction between the executors of John Colwell, in taking the bond in the name of the wife and the release of the husband, was an appropriation by him of the fund to the separate use of the wife, and took from the husband the right to dispose of it either absolutely or conditionally.\u201d Conceding now, that it was a question for the court, and not for the jury, what were the facts proved ? There was no direct evidence that Phillips consented that the bond should be taken in the name of the executors for the use of the wife, and when he received it, it was endorsed for his use as well as for that of Mrs. Phillips. He merely united with her in a release to the executors. To hold that these acts constituted an appropriation to the sole and separate use of the wife, would be giving to them an effect far beyond what equity has ever allowed. While no particular language is indispensable, yet the claim of the wife to a separate use being against common right, the instrument under which it is made must clearly speak the donor\u2019s intention to bar the husband\u2019s marital rights, or it cannot be allowed: <em>Clancy </em>262.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The only remaining error assigned is, to the charge of the court, relative to the knowledge of the defendant that the bond had been assigned when he paid it to Mrs. Phillips the <em>cestui que use. </em>The evidence showed, that at the time when payment was made, he asked where the bond was, and was told by Mrs. Phillips that she did not know, and that he received indemnity and took a receipt. The court instructed the jury, that \u201c if it was paid under circumstances which ought to have put a man, of ordinary caution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>prudence, upon inquiry which would enable him to ascertain the truth, then such payment would not defeat a recovery by the assignee.\u201d \"Why was not this proper instruction ? Payment to an equitable assignee is certainly a good payment. And after notice that there is such a holder, payment to the legal holder is unavailing to discharge the debt. This is conceded. But why is this so ? Because it is inequitable that a debtor should pay to one who, in equity, is not entitled to receive, when he knows that such payment is injurious to another. In equity, the assignment has the same force as if it had been legally made. The reason why a debtor is discharged by payment to the assignor, without notice of such assignment, is, that he has been guilty of no wanton or heedless disregard of the rights of another. But when he has reason to believe that another has become the owner of the chose, and, uninfluenced by that belief, makes payment to the original creditor, he cannot aver that he has been guiltless. In accordance with this view, it was said by Thompson, C. J., in Anderson <em>v. </em>Van Alen, 12 <em>Johns. </em>343, \u201c It is a well settled principle, that courts of law will notice the assignment of a chose in action, and protect the interest of a <em>cestui que </em>trust, against any person who has notice of the trust; and it seems also to be pretty well settled, that actual notice is not necessary. If a person acts in the face of facts and circumstances which were sufficient to put him upon inquiry, he acts contrary to good faith and at his peril.\u201d This is also the doctrine of Johnson <em>v. </em>Bloodgood, 1 <em>Johns. Ca. </em>51; and our own court, in Guthrie <em>v. </em>Bashline, 1 <em>Casey </em>81, ruled that it was not necessary that direct notice of the assignment of a judgment be given by the assignee or his agent. It is sufficient if the information be given under circumstances and in terms to arrest the attention of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The charge of the court below was, therefore, unexceptionable, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
