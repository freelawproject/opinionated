Stating in a bill a particular fund from which the drawee is to be reimbursed will not vitiate it: Kelley <em>v. </em>Mayor, 4 <em>Hill </em>263; Leonard <em>v. </em>Mason, 1 <em>Wend. </em>522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">The drawer of a bill may maintain an action thereon against the acceptor, though it has not been endorsed by the payee: Zebley <em>v. </em>Voisin, 7 <em>Barr </em>527; <em>Chitty on Bills </em>537; Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter, 1 <em>Wils. </em>185; Kingman <em>v. </em>Hotaling, 25 <em>Wend. </em>423.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">The acceptance of a bill is evidence against the acceptor, under the money counts, in an action by the drawee: Benjamin <em>v. </em>Tillman, 2 <em>McLean </em>213; Byrne <em>v. </em>Schwing, 6 <em>B.

Law Dic. </em>tit. <em>Bill of Exchange; </em>2 <em>Id. </em>tit. <em>Negotiable Paper; Story on Bills </em>60; Gerard <em>v. </em>La Coste, 1 <em>Dall. </em>194; Barriere <em>v. </em>Nairac, 2 <em>Id. </em>249 (this case was cited and approved in Leidy <em>v. </em>Tammany, 9 <em>Watts </em>358); Reynolds <em>v. </em>Richards, 2 <em>Harris </em>205 ; Bircleback <em>v. </em>Wilkins, 10 <em>Id. </em>28 ; Esling <em>v. </em>Zantzinger, 1 <em>Id. </em>50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-10\">Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter, 1 <em>Wils. </em>185, is the sole authority on which all the cases cited by the plaintiff in error, avowedly depend; and the ground for the decision there, was expressly held to this, that the consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise was averred in the <em>narr. </em>to be, that the plaintiff, by reason of defendant\u2019s neglect to pay, was obliged to pay, <em>and did pay the bill. </em>This, the court held to be a good consideration to raise the promise. There is no such averment in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration here, nor was there any proof offered to that effect on the trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b508-12\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYOp\">It is not essential to the validity of a bill of exchange, that it be in form negotiable. An endorsement on a bond ordering the contents \u201c to be paid to order for value received, is a good bill of exchange:\u201d 1 <em>Bay </em>66. The words \u201cfor value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>received\u201d are held not essential: Benjamin <em>v. </em>Tillman, 2 <em>McLean </em>213 ; 3 <em>Metcalf </em>363; 3 <em>Rich. </em>413.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">If it be for the absolute payment of money, at all events, it will not invalidate it, if the fund, on account of which it is drawn, is named as a means whereby the drawee is to be indemnified: 3 <em>Marsh. </em>184; 2 <em>Greenl. </em>123 ; 4 <em>Hill </em>263; 2 <em>Sandf. Sup. C. Rep. </em>328; 2 <em>Maine Rep. </em>442; 25 <em>Miss. Rep. </em>143; <em>Byles on Bills </em>74 (note).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The paper, therefore, in evidence in this case, although not in negotiable form, may be treated as a bill of exchange. And a material inquiry arises to be considered, as to the right of the plaintiff, the drawer, to sue the acceptor, in his own name, the bill having been returned to him by the payee in default of payment by the acceptor. That he may do so,' seems to have been settled in the affirmative, in every case I have been able to find, where the point was distinctly made. The case of Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter, 1 <em>Wilson\u2019s Rep. </em>185, in the King\u2019s Bench, before Lee, C. J., and associates, determined after much consideration by that court, and affirmed upon a writ of error in the House of Lords, is the first precedent cited in argument, or that I have discovered for this position, and it fully affirms it. The same doctrine is to be found in <em>Chitty on Bills </em>537, for which is cited Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter. See also 4 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>604; Louviere <em>v. </em>Laubray, 10 <em>Mod. </em>36 ; <em>Chitt. Jr. </em>230. In Kingman <em>v. </em>Hotaling, 25 <em>Wend. </em>423, the same doctrine is held: Nelson, C. J., after citing Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter, saying, that the plaintiff in that case was held to be entitled to recover without taking title under the payee. So in Zebley <em>v. </em>Voisin, 7 <em>Barr </em>527, the plaintiff recovered in exact accordance with this doctrine. There was no assignment by the payee, and the point was directly made, that the suit must be in the name of the payee for the use of the drawer, the plaintiff; but the objection was overruled, the court declaring, in affirming the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue, in his own name, that the <em>\u201c </em>drawer was in fact and in law the legal plaintiff.\u201d In Simmonds <em>v. </em>Parminter, the plaintiff declared upon the bill as within the custom of merchants, and recovered, as we have seen. So here, in addition to the special counts on the bill, there are also the common money counts, upon which, as for money had and received, the plaintiff might recover if the evidence entitled him so to do. That it did, I cannot doubt, for it is settled, in innumerable cases, that the acceptance of a bill is an admission of funds of the drawer in the hands of the acceptor: 6 <em>B. Monroe </em>179; 4 <em>Dev. </em>358; 2 <em>Wheat. </em>385 ; 3 <em>Shepley </em>131; 3 <em>McLean </em>272; 2 <em>Eng. </em>321; 2 <em>Br. </em>56; 9 <em>Watts </em>359 ; <em>Byles on Bills </em>245. There was, however, no objection in the court below as to the sufficiency of the <em>narr., </em>the pleas being <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The remaining point for our determination in this case is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>whether the bill in question, on its face, negatives the ordinary presumption of funds in the hands of the acceptor, belonging to the drawer ? There was evidence in the case to show -that Ledlie was the owner of the property upon which the judgment and mortgage referred to in the bill rested, \u2014 that it was due and owing to Coursin. This was independent of the bill. The bill itself proved the same thing. What then was the bill other than a draft on a debtor who had funds in his hands of the drawer ? The reference to the satisfaction of the judgment and mortgage was, at most, but an instruction or direction to the drawee as to the manner and mode of reimbursement. In <em>Bayley on Bills </em>34, it is laid down that a direction for reimbursement does not vitiate the bill. It was then a bill\u2019 drawn on an acknowledged debtor and accepted by him. That the acceptor could not set up want of consideration, is established by the cases of Fisher <em>v. </em>Beckwith, 19 <em>Vermont Rep. </em>31; Walker <em>v. </em>Sherman, 11 <em>Metcalf </em>170. After careful consideration of the whole case, we think the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and we think the court erred in entering judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Judgment reversed, and judgment to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-7\">Strong, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
