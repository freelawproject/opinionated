Veach against John M. Irvine, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Dr. John Mitchel-tree, deceased, to recover a sum of $200, paid by the plaintiff into the Western Reserve Bank, for the use of the defendant\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-12\">On the 23d December 1846, the plaintiff paid into the Western Reserve Bank $200, which was placed to the credit of Dr. John Mitcheltree, for his use. Dr. Mitcheltree died on the 6th February 1852; and, on the 14th August 1855, this action was brought. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>payment, and the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-13\">On the trial, the court below (McCalmont, P. J.), under the authority of McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>Oasey </em>360, instructed the jury that the statute of limitations was no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-14\">To this charge the defendant excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiff for $254.25, the defendant sued out this writ, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-15\"><em>A. H. Snyder, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsRL\">cited Bailey <em>v. </em>Bailey, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>197; Allison <em>v. </em>James, 9 <em>Watts </em>381; Farley <em>v. </em>Kustenbader, 3 <em>Barr </em>419; Emerson <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 <em>Casey </em>279; Harbold\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Kuntz, 4 <em>Harris </em>213; Morgan <em>v. </em>Walton, 4 <em>Barr </em>322; Nixon <em>v. </em>Brownfield, 2 <em>Harris </em>321; Shitler <em>v. </em>Bremer, 11 <em>Id. </em>414; Kensington Bank <em>v. </em>Patton, 2 <em>Id. </em>481; <em>Angell on Lim. </em>146-7.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-16\"><em>W. M. Stephenson, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4B\">cited and relied upon McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>Casey </em>360.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b455-17\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b455-18\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV0\">With all the changes which we have made in our common law actions against executors and administrators for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>debts of a decedent, there is still some difference between them and the equitable proceeding by creditor\u2019s bill for an account and settlement of the estate, which is substantially the mode in which we pay debts of decedents in the Orphans\u2019 Court. The former proceeding is still in form a personal action, and retains some of the substance of one, while the latter is rather a proceeding <em>in rem; </em>that is, against the decedent\u2019s estate, out of which the complainant demands payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Now it is plain enough that this claim against the estate, founded on the statutory lien given to the creditors of a decedent, does not keep alive the right of action at common law <em>in personam. </em>An assignment for the benefit of creditors does not stop the running of the statute; yet the assignee cannot set up the statute when distribution is claimed from him, on a debt not barred at the time of the assignment. A debt secured by a pledge or lien may be barred by the statute, without divesting the security which the lien affords. The court below fell into error in applying the rule of McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 29 <em>State Rep. </em>360, by overlooking this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
