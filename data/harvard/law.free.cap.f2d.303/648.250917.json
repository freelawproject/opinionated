Chase promptly answered and counterclaimed for interpleader. This was granted in a well-reasoned opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Judge Bryan, D.C., 155 F.Supp. 30 (1957). Many further motions ensued; the docket entries alone fill six and a half printed pages. Among other things, appellant sought to relitigate Chase\u2019s right to interplead and opposed, unsuccessfully, the intervention of the Acting Consul General of Estonia. Ultimately a settlement was reached, the action was dismissed with prejudice, and Chase was allowed attorneys\u2019 fees of $8500 and costs and expenses of $2076.41. From the latter portion of the order of dismissal this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">It ought not to have been. Appellant does not dispute that a defendant properly invoking interpleader is entitled to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Bondurant, 27 F.2d 464, 466 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 278 U.S. 630, 4 S.Ct. 30, 73 L.Ed. 548 (1828); 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), \u00b6 22.16, and cases cited in fn. 5. Its claims that an allowance should have been denied here because there was no need for interpleader in the light of N.Y. Banking Law, \u00a7 134, subd. 7 and other circumstances, or because Chase did not itself institute an action for interpleader at an earlier date, and that any allowance must be limited to the period before the order allowing interpleader was entered, are not even colorable. The same is true of its criticism of the amount allowed, which represents, in no small measure, services of Chase\u2019s attorneys occasioned by appellant\u2019s unjustified resistance to the interpleader and the hearing of other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The case would be an appropriate one for invoking our Rule 26(b), 28 U.S.C. whereby damages at a rate not exceeding. 10%, in addition to interest, may be awarded \u201cwhere an appeal shall delay the proceedings on the judgment, decree, or order of the lower court, and shall appear to have been sued out merely for delay, * * * \u201d see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912, and Ginsburg v. Stern, 295 F.2d 698 (3 Cir. 1961). However, since this is an action in which attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded in any event, it will be sufficient to grant defendant an additional $1,000 for its attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal, together with the cost of printing its brief and appendix and any other costs normally taxable, and to dismiss the appeal as frivolous. It is' so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
