The action sought damages from defendant for breach of an alleged joint venture agreement. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship, the trial being before Judge Sugarman of the District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting without a jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Plaintiff Bevelheimer, at the pertinent times a broker and Vice-President of an engineering company, testified that one Rentzel, Chairman of the Board of Directors of defendant Slick Airways, Inc., was very anxious to obtain air freight business for Slick in connection with the construction of the Dewline (Distant Early Warning System) by the United States Air Force. According to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, Rentzel told plaintiff in the Fall of 1955 that if he put him in touch with the people who could let such contracts, Slick would share the actual net profits with him, Bevelheimer, on a 50-50 basis and would treat it as a joint, venture. Bevelheimer then told Rentzel that one Hamerskol, an associate of plaintiff\u2019s, had the right contacts and requested that Rentzel put the proposition in writing. On November 29, 1955, Rentzel sent plaintiff the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">\u201cDear Paul:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">\u201cAttached is my personal check for $1,000.00, which is to cover expenses incurred by Aero Electronics Associates, you and Alec Plamerskol in connection with the Canadian \u2018Dewline\u2019 movement, which we understand is to begin December 15, 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">\u201cThis letter and the enclosed check is in accordance with our telephone conversation which we understand to be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-15\">\u201c1. Your group will use its best offices to obtain a satisfactory understanding with those controlling the \u2018Dewline\u2019 movement in which Slick Airways would participate to the extent of approximately one-third of the eastern area movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">\u201c2. If we are able to successfully negotiate an understanding with <em>those controlling or operating </em>the \u2018Dewline\u2019 movement, based on the extent of potential profits to Slick Airways, Slick will reimburse your group in proportion to the potential return to Slick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">\u201c3. If we are unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion to participate in this movement, I would be entitled to receive from you one-half of the $1,000.00 which I have personally advanced against expenses which you and your associates may incur\u2014or have incurred\u2014and this would terminate any agreement or understanding between either me or Slick Airways and your group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">\u201cI sincerely hope we can work out something that can be beneficial to Slick Airways\u2014and you may be sure we will do what is fair in ac-cox-dance with the above understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-19\">\u201cSincerely yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-20\">/s/ D. W. Rentzel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5B\">D. W. Rentzel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuW\">Chairman\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Although he realized at the time the letter was not an accurate reflection of his understanding of the agreement, either as to performance or amount of compensation, Bevelheimer did not bring it to Rentzel\u2019s attention. Plaintiff testified, however, that Rentzel repeated his joint venture offer for being \u201cput in touch\u201d in later conversations. Hamerskol was unsuccessful, and Bevelheimer became associated with one McDaniel. McDaniel believed two contacts of his, a Mrs. Cress-well and a Mr. Benton, might be able to help Rentzel. They insisted, however, that Rentzel writ a letter expressing his interest. On December 14, 1955, Rentzel sent the following letter to McDaniel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cDear Tom:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cSlick Airways, Inc. is very much interested in participating in the \u2018Dewline\u2019 lift requirements. We have DC-6 A, C-54 and C-46 aircraft, which could be made available for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cI would like very much for you and my good friend, Paul Bevelheimer to do whatever you can to assist us in this regard, and, of course, I regret extremely that Paul became innocently involved with Alex Hamerskol. I don\u2019t know Mr. Hamerskol but I do know that Paul Bevelheimer is a gentleman and a man of honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201cI hope you and Paul can put us in touch with the proper people to give us the opportunity to negotiate for participation in this lift. Slick\u2019s reputation is well enough known I am sure, to guarantee that we can satisfy any reasonable requirement for cargo lift to any point in the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cSincerely yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">D. W. Rentzel (Signed by J. Murphy)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">D. W. Rentzel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">Chairman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">(Above dictated by Mr. Rentzel but not read. J. M. Murphy, Secy.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">On December 19, 1955, Bevelheimer passed this letter along to Mrs. Cresswell with the following letter of his own:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At4\">\u201cAircraft Purchasing and Service Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2W\">75 West Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ars\">New York 6, N. Y.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-18\">\u201cAtt: Mrs. E. C. Cresswell</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">\u201cDear Mrs. Cresswell:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-19\">\u201cRelative to our various conversations regarding the \u2018Dewline\u2019 lift operations, we are enclosing a photostatic copy of a letter from Mr. D. W. Rentzel of the Slick Airways, Inc. expressing his interest in participating in the \u2018Dewline\u2019 operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-21\">\u201cAnything that you may be able to do, or do through your attorney, Mr. Benton, that will enable Mr. Rentzel to participate in this operation will be greatly appreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-22\">\u201cHe has also advised us that he is willing to pay a fee should he get this contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-23\">\u201cThank you for your cooperation in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-24\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-25\">Butler Engineering Associates, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-26\">Paul F. Bevelheimer Vice President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-27\">A meeting was held on December 20, 1955, between Bevelheimer, McDaniel, Cresswell, Benton and Rentzel. Benton represented to Rentzel that he had acquired some knowledge as to Dewline contracts through work for a client. Rentzel asked Benton to do what he could to assist Slick. Benton then left the meeting and called the Western Electric Company, the prime contractor on the Dew-line operation. He asked to speak to someone who might inform him as to the status of air freight contracts on the Dewline operation. The call was referred to a Mr. Lohman who told Benton there had been a meeting in Ottawa that day at the Department of Transportation and certain facts as to the commencement of air carriage, tonnage, and destination were known for the first time. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that Western Electric did not control the letting of contracts, that being handled solely in Canada. Lohman advised Benton to get his people to Canada as soon as possible to check on the facts and negotiate the contracts. Benton then conveyed that information to Rentzel. Neither Benton, Mrs. Cresswell, McDaniel, nor Bevelheimer took any further action to aid Slick in its successful obtaining of a Dewline contract. Benton did not know Lohman but merely called Western Electric and asked for somebody to speak to. He had no special influence with Lohman or anyone else at Western Electric, and the information he obtained was concededly public and would have been given to anyone that called. Benton did not mention Slick Airways to Lohman or anyone else connected with the Dewline.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"> After plaintiff rested, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A. Extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law were made. 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2d Ed. \u00b641.13 [4]; Huber v. American President Lines, 240 F.2d 778 (2 Cir. 1957). The District Judge disbelieved plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding conversations with Rentzel as to the amount of compensation and found the sole request for services by Slick was that contained in the letter of November 29, 1955. He denied relief, therefore, on the alternative grounds that the alleged contract was too vague and indefinite as to the amount of compensation to justify legal enforceability and that, in any event, plaintiff was not the effective or procuring cause of defendant\u2019s obtaining the contract. On this appeal, plaintiff contends the performance requested by Rentzel can be determined only by reading the November 29 and December 14 letters together and asks the Court to upset the credibility findings as to the amount of compensation. We affirm on the sole ground that plaintiff did not render the requisite performance and is, therefore, not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is elementary that recovery upon a contractual theory such as is advanced here, whether it be on a promise to pay a specific sum or on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis, requires a showing that the necessary services have been performed. Sainderichin v. Gabrilovitch, 274 App.Div. 100, 79 N.Y.S.2d 726 (1st Dept. 1948); Towers v. Doroshaw, 5 Misc.2d 241, 159 N.Y.S.2d 367 (2d Dept. 1957). Plaintiff failed to make such a showing. Even when the December 14 and November 29 letters are read together, the performance rendered falls short of that requested. Bevelheimer himself testified he believed his obligation was either by himself or through a third party \u201cto make contact with people with whom he [Rentzel] could sit down and negotiate a contract * * \u201cto introduce him to the people who could make the contract * * or to \u201copen the doors for him to go to those people.\u201d Benton\u2019s activities fell far short of this. He did not \u201cintroduce\u201d Rentzel, \u201cput him in touch,\u201d or \u201copen the doors\u201d with the right people. All he did was call Western Electric, obtain admittedly public information as to the contracts, and then tell Rentzel the contracts were being let in Canada. Benton did nothing to aid contact with the \u201cproper people\u201d in Canada, offered no good offices or special means of access, and in fact never even mentioned Slick Airways to anyone connected with the Dewline operation. To be sure, \u201cput in touch\u201d is not the clearest possible request, but we believe the factual context of this case and Bevelheimer\u2019s own understanding of the agreement demonstrate that more was required than the negligible performance rendered. Assuming, therefore, plaintiff has managed to avoid the other obvious pitfalls inherent in his case, we hold he did not render the services required for recovery under his version of the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">A review of the entire record shows plaintiff had more than a fair opportunity to present his evidence on the issue we deem material to a resolution of this case. We need not, therefore, discuss plaintiff\u2019s sweeping attacks on the fair-mindedness of the District Judge and his conduct at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
