It raises them in sharp focus. In its reply brief the Board states that the procedure followed in \u201cthis case has been developed out of long years\u2019 experience in handling proceedings of this type,\u201d which we take to mean that we have before us the Board\u2019s general views and not simply a special situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">On April 6, 1959, at the request of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, known as the IUE, a representation election was scheduled at the plant of respondent Trancoa Chemical Corporation. The union\u2019s campaign had been proceeding since December 1958. On April 5 it distributed a leaflet consisting of a single sheet, printed on both sides, and folded once. The first of the resulting four pages proclaimed that voting for the union would mean \u201cmore money in your paycheck;\u201d indicated that Trancoa was not \u201cpaying wages and benefits comparable to other workers in our industry;\u201d and concluded, \u201cwe [workers} can\u2019t find out the truth * * * but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>IUE has the facts and figures and we can see for ourselves! ! ! SEE INSIDE.\u201d The two inside pages contained alleged facts and figures about three contracts the union had allegedly negotiated. The back page consisted of generalizations, one half of which concerned the dangers the employees were said to face from radioactive materials and a poison, and against which the union offered to protect them. The following day, immediately before the election, the company published a partial reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The balloting disclosed 85 in favor of the union, 47 against and 10 challenged or void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No question arises as to the tally. The company filed objections to the election on the basis of misrepresentations in the leaflet. The Regional Director appointed an investigator who made an ex parte investigation, following which he overruled the objections. The company filed detailed objections to his report, but the Board upheld the director and certified the election. The company refused to accept the union and bargain with it, from which has come the present unfair labor practice charge. At the hearing on this charge the trial examiner, upon specific instructions from the Board, ruled that he could accept only evidence discovered since the company\u2019s original objections. He found against the company. His action was confirmed by the Board, which now seeks a decree enforcing its order that the company bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Respondent raises the following issues: (1) The Board\u2019s alleged view that misrepresentations are to be overlooked if, in its opinion, they were not so misleading as necessarily to \u201cpreclude the election results from reflecting the true desires of the employees.\u201d (2) The Board\u2019s refusal to consider \u201cexaggerations, incomplete disclosures or half truths,\u201d or anything not amounting to \u201cforgery or other campaign trickery.\u201d (3) The conclusion that misrepresentations may be disregarded if the company has had an opportunity to dispute them. (4) The refusal, in the absence of proof of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d action in connection with the certification, to reconsider at the unfair labor practice hearing any matter previously decided, whether correctly or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The underlying question is how far the \u201cfacts and figures\u201d supplied in the union\u2019s leaflet were materially untrue. The company, apparently failing to realize the negative effect of pressing inconsequentialities, has over-extended all stages of the proceeding. Campaign material is not to be subjected to an electron microscope. At the same time we are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s view that the effect of even major misrepresentations may be diminished if, in the total picture, they are few in number. It is particularly unsound where, as in the case of the Monsanto contract here, some of the other misstatements, although not substantial in themselves are at least of some consequence. Many a girl has been seduced one step at a time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Respondent\u2019s first major complaint concerns the second, or Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory contract. The published grades and wage rates were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>spicuously stated to be for \u201cIUE Members Doing Similar Work,\u201d adding, in connection with insurance benefits, \u201cand they don\u2019t have our hazardous conditions.\u201d The union omitted, however, the word \u201cAtomic\u201d from the employer\u2019s title, and omitted the special letters designating the local involved as atomic-working. This was scarcely inadvertent. Without the omissions its remark about less hazardous conditions would have been demonstrably false. In fact, Knolls\u2019 conditions were not less hazardous, but more so. We are surprised at the Board\u2019s suggestion that this is not a matter of moment. In addition, the company complains that the union advertised the Knolls\u2019 contract as providing piecework pay \u201cupward to $4.00 and better per hour\u201d and a \u201cSeverance Pay Plan.\u201d The record does not permit us to say whether or not severance pay which was provided only in case of a total shutdown of the plant is within the commonly understood meaning of a \u201cseverance pay plan,\u201d but we must agree with the company that $4.00 for pieceworkers when that could be achieved only during premium pay periods was highly misleading. This seems a good example of a \u201chalf truth\u201d which the Board feels it is appropriate to disregard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The union\u2019s third alleged contract was with Metal Hydrides. The company makes much of the fact that the Metal Hydrides plant shut down before the contract went into effect and that the union failed to disclose this. The relevancy of the contract was the fact that the union had negotiated it. This was in no wise affected by the further fact that the plant closed because of loss of its government business due to a change in government requirements. The company\u2019s complaint that no employee ever actually received these wages would have been irrelevant to the union\u2019s having negotiated the contract except for one circumstance, not discovered by respondent until after certification. The total agreement with Metal Hydrides was that the wages and benefits advertised in the union\u2019s leaflet would be effective only if the company continued in special government work, but that if it engaged in commercial work new terms would be negotiated. The announced identity between Metal Hydrides and Trancoa was thus broken; precisely where it occurred there was no contract. We agree with the Board that the union did not have to parade its poor agreements along with its good ones. But it was a manifest misrepresentation to indicate that it had achieved a similar contract when there was such a pertinent exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The union further advertised that its Metal Hydrides contract contained \u201cPension and severance pay plan Fully paid for by company.\u201d Even on the assumption that the contract was in full force and effect these particular statements were pure invention. No such plans had been negotiated or offered, whether paid for by the company or otherwise. It must be obvious that this falsification reflected on every other advertised term of the Metal Hydrides agreement. Hourly rates with a pension, and without, are different matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Finally, the last page of the leaflet was devoted to the union\u2019s assertion that it was planning for the future and for its members\u2019 protection. Prominent mention was made of the growing use of radioactive materials. \u201c[T]hese mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>rials can be very dangerous, but the danger can\u2019t be seen or felt. Are radioactive materials being used in your plant? If so, have you been told about it? And what kind of safety measures have been taken?\u201d After further development of this none too veiled insinuation, entirely unjustified in fact, the leaflet stated, \u201cNot long ago beryllium poisioning claimed the lives of many workers in this industry and in our plant.\u201d The inclusion of respondent\u2019s plant was completely false.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">This is a sorry record. Of the three contracts advertised, the first was at least considerably exaggerated; the benefits of the second were paraded under the general assertion that the working conditions were less hazardous when actually they were more so, and at least one benefit was substantially misstated; the third contract was not in fact negotiated for competitive commercial work, and was claimed to contain fully paid-for pension and severance plans, certainly substantial matters, when it contained none at all. Finally, with no basis in fact, there was the emotional appeal to apprehensions over radioactivity and poisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">There is no suggestion that the leaflet was prepared to meet some last-minute impropriety by the company. Nor was the union otherwise pressed. The election campaign had been in progress over three months, and the contracts described had been negotiated before that. It is obvious that the whole proceeding was a calculated move, at a deliberately selected moment when, due to the shortness of time to learn the true facts or effectively reach the employees, the company\u2019s ability to correct misstatements would be minimal. The Board\u2019s response that the company had an opportunity to reply and did so \u201ceffectively\u201d is, in our opinion, simply not so. The employees, except for ten per cent who did not see it at all, received the company\u2019s leaflet fifteen minutes before they voted. One may wonder how many conversions are made at such a moment. Furthermore, there is an important distinction between a reply and what the Board chose to regard in oral argument as \u201crefutation.\u201d As to some matters a reply may be a refutation; but to others, not. If a union says it negotiated such and such contracts with A, B &amp; C, and the company says it did not, whom are the employees more likely to believe? We think there can be little doubt. There is much merit in the court\u2019s suggestion in N. L. R. B. v. Houston Chronicle Publishing Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 273, 279, that the very attempt to deny what the union presumably has the only first-hand knowledge of may put the company in a worse light. Moreover, the company made no reply, and there is no suggestion that it had the opportunity to do so, to any but one of the Monsanto half truths listed in fn. 2, supra, to the Knolls exaggerated pieceworker rate, to the implication that the Metal Hydrides agreement covered commercial work, and the false assertion that that contract contained company-paid plans for pension and severance pay. These misrepresentations alone were substantial and serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">We do not believe that even the company\u2019s positive denial that it had radioactive or other lethal poisons could be said to be a complete refutation. The Board describes the union\u2019s statements as propaganda. Giving them a name does not dismiss them. This was a subject charged with emotion. Even in a court trial, where an authoritative judge can instruct a jury to disregard prejudicial matter, it is recognized that there are limits. Here there was no instruction, but merely a partisan counter-assertion. The Board says the employees could be counted on to know the union was wrong. There is no evidence that they knew. The union insidiously put in its statement, \u201cthe danger can\u2019t be seen or felt.\u201d We do not think the union made a half-page statement that it expected would affect no one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>A word about standards. We do not accept the Board\u2019s proposition that reversal of an unfair labor practice finding for non-acceptance of an election requires proof of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d action. It is desirable in the interests of giving a union immediate status that certification be permitted without a hearing. And we would agree that on matters of procedure the Board should have almost unlimited powers. But this does not mean that if the company seeks eventual review substantive rights are not to be given customary consideration. N. L. R. B. v. Houston Chronicle Publishing Co., supra; cf. Cross Company v. N. L. R. B., 6 Cir., 1961, 286 F.2d 799. The act provides that the employees shall have representatives \u201cof their own choosing.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157. We do not think that the Board\u2019s view of what impairs freedom of choice is more sacrosanct than its other fact-finding powers. Likewise, the Board\u2019s corollary ruling that the trial examiner at the unfair labor practice hearing could reconsider no matters previously decided was error. Respondent is entitled to have all of the misrepresentations viewed together.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">We are not clear whether the Board\u2019s expression \u201cpreclude * * * freedom of choice\u201d means that the burden is upon the respondent to show that the employees were necessarily misled, or only that it is sufficiently likely that it cannot be told whether they were or were not. The latter is the appropriate rule. N. L. R. B. v. Trinity Steel Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 120. Nor are we entirely clear what is the Board\u2019s view of the role of deliberateness, but it seems to be, since it restricts consideration to \u201cforgery or other campaign trickery,\u201d that no misrepresentation, no matter how serious, is material if it was not intentionally false. See also Cross Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra. Since it is clear that the misstatements here were consciously false we are not faced with the question of how far the Board can properly depart from ordinary rescission principles, but we make one comment. In speaking of the fact that there was no affirmative evidence that any employee relied on certain of the misstatements (an odd remark since the Board does not ordinarily take employee testimony, see Cross Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra, 286 F.2d at 801, and took none here), the Board fails to realize the significance of intentional fraud. An innocent mistake might occur for a number of reasons. One must regard deliberateness as an admission that the matter was important. No one is in a better position than the union to know what the voters need to be told.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Finally, we are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s claim that if it must \u201cpolice\u201d election campaigns, by which seemingly it means be required to look at something beyond the most patent outrage, it will be overcome by a flood of objections to certification. Arguments that tribunals are too busy to do their duty, cf. LaBuy v. Howes Leather Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>1957, 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290, or that it is more expeditious not to recognize rights, are not agreeable ones. Moreover, we think it a false issue. We cannot believe that unions as a class choose to fabricate, or that it is hopeless to supervise them. However, some persons will make misstatements when they are allowed to. If the Board tolerates low standards, that is where they will stop. The Board twice asserts that it does not \u201ccondone\u201d untruthfulness, but standards will be set by what it does, not by what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">A decree will be entered denying the petition for enforcement and setting aside the order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. The Board considered the relative onesidedness of the election a reason to discount the consequences of the union\u2019s leaflet. We note this argument only to remark that exactly the opposite conclusion is possible. In N.L.R.B. v. Gorbea, Perez &amp; Morell, 1 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 886, the Board in argument dismissed the fact that a large number of employees testified in the company\u2019s favor by saying that it went only to show how successfully they could be led.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. The leaflet\u2019s first inside page purported to set forth the terms of a contract the union had negotiated with Monsanto Chemical Corporation. Along with the quoted table of grades and wages it was stated that there was \u201cpremium pay\u201d for \u201cSaturday as such.\u201d Only a careful reading would disclose that the premium pay was not time and one-half. The advertised provision for \u201cmilitary leave allowance\u201d proved to be simply a voluntarily-adopted company policy to pay for summer encampments ; advertised \u201cmedical examinations\u201d were in fact only after absence due to illness, and the \u201cmaximum\u201d insurance benefits, the only ones the leaflet gave figures for, were available to a mere handful of employees. While these matters are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>not worth considering individually, taken as a whole they produced far loss than a fair picture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">. We shall not further refer to the Board\u2019s frequently announced policy of countenancing \u201cexaggerations, incomplete disclosures or half truths,\u201d except to say that we do not approve of disposition by generalization, including the reverse of the Board\u2019s as exemplified by Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 7 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 613, 616. A half truth means a half lie, and a half lie may be, or may not <em>be, </em>a substantial misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\">. We are reminded of the lady who sought to persuade her butcher to meet the price quoted for lamb chops across the street. When asked why she didn\u2019t buy there she replied, \u201cThey don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. In its brief the Board concludes, \u201cthe common sense of the electorate can be trusted to evaluate and fairly discount campaign utterances.\u201d If this means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>know instinctively what factual statements are untrue, this is a bit <em>of </em>hyperbole this court will not indulge in. Nor can we help observing that the Board would apply no such standards if the misrepresentation had been by an employer. If an employer merely makes a prediction that unionization will prevent raises, this is serious unfair labor practice unless the employer can demonstrate facts to prove it. N.L.R.B. v. Whitelite Products Division, 1 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 12, cert. den. 5/21/62. But cf. Olson Rug Co. v. N.L.R.B., 7 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 255, 256, fn. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\">. We are not sure as to the full measure of this <em>ruling. During the </em>hearing counsel for the general counsel obtained a telegraphed ruling from the Board, as a result of which all evidence already introduced but not shown to have been newly discovered was struck from the record. To the extent that the respondent was seeking reconsideration of something previously decided, this ruling was correct. N.L.R.B. v. Worcester Woolen Mills Corp., 1 Cir., 1948, 170 F.2d 13. But to the extent it led the trial examiner to consider whether the document was substantially misleading viewed only in the light of matters newly discovered and not as a whole it was error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
