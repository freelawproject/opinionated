Osborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The petition to cancel was filed June 16, 1958, as of which date Reg. No. 524,-413 had been in effect more than five years. A combined affidavit under section 8(a), accepted pursuant to section 8(c), and section 15 of the Lanham Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1058 (a, c), 1065, was filed on March 20, 1956. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the petitioner to meet at least one of the requirements of section 14(c), permitting the filing of a petition to cancel \u201cat any time.\u201d The sole provision of section 14(c) relied on by petitioner is that the registered mark \u201chas been abandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The board held that the mark, \u201cHY-CROSS,\u201d had not been abandoned and, after considering an extensive Request for Reconsideration, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-7\">\u201cThe Board remains of the opinion that the record is insufficient to establish that the registered trademark \u201cHY-CROSS\u201d has been abandoned * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Whether the board was correct in so deciding is the sole issue in the case, for in the absence of a showing of abandonment the petitioner has no right under the statute to pursue this cancellation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">This case was heard and decided below on the pleadings, respondent\u2019s registration, and testimony and exhibits introduced into this cancellation on motion from Opposition No. 36611 between the same parties, entitled Hy-Cross Hatchery, Inc. v. Welp, 120 USPQ 323 (TT &amp; A Bd., 1959). In this court petitioner-appellant filed a brief and appeared for oral argument. Respondent-appellee did neither. We have therefore not had the benefit of such light as might have been shed on the issue by an answer to appellant\u2019s arguments, which, it seems to us, deal to a large extent with irrelevant questions. We would point out that this is a wholly statutory matter, determined by provisions of the Lanham Act which did not come into effect until July 5, 1947, modifying in many ways aspects of trademark law discussed in earlier cases such as some of those cited and quoted from in appellant\u2019s brief. The registration sought to be cancelled enjoys a status, having been in effect more than five years before the petition to cancel was filed, which no registration enjoyed prior to the effective date of said act. Appellant, having elected to bring itself within the provisions of section 14(c) by showing abandonment of the registered mark, cannot prevail unless abandonment has been shown. We turn now to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">Appellant predicates abandonment primarily on an assignment of the trademark from the original registrant, Percy J. Osborne, to Joseph H. Welp, dated October 10, recorded November 1, 1955. The primary argument is that this was \u201cno more than a naked assignment,\u201d of the \u201cbare mark,\u201d which assignment is \u201cinvalid\u201d because, to quote appellant, <em>\u201cno business is transferred\u201d </em>with it. As we understand appellant\u2019s contention with respect to the relation of this contention to the issue of abandonment, it is that Osborne\u2019s acts in attempting to make an assignment, which assignment is invalid, constituted an abandonment of the mark by him and that whatever rights the assignee, Welp, may have as a result of use subsequent to the assignment are <em>new rights, </em>unrelated to the original mark and its registration. A subsidiary argument is that Osborne used \u201cHY-CROSS\u201d on one type of chicken and Welp uses it on a different type of chicken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">The assignment, omitting the \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-13\">\u201cBE IT KNOWN that for and in consideration of the sum of One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and other good and valuable consideration to him in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, said Percy J. Osborne by these presents does sell, assign and transfer unto the said Joseph H. Welp the entire right, title and interest in and to the said trade-mark and the registration thereof, No. 524,413, together with that part of the good will of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Section 10 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1060 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">\u201cA registered mark or a mark for which application to register has been filed shall be assignable with the goodwill of the business in which the mark is used, <em>or with that part of the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark, </em>and in any such assignment it shall not be necessary to include the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by any other mark used in the business or by the name or style under which the business is conducted: * * *.\" [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">The board found as facts (and we do not find that appellant disputes these findings) that there is nothing in the record to show that Osborne, the assign- or, was not using \u201cHY-CROSS\u201d at the time when he assigned that mark, or that he used the mark after the assignment, or that Welp\u2019s Hatchery (the business enterprise, a partnership, operated by the assignee) did not use the mark continuously after the assignment. It is on these facts that the board made its finding of no abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Appellant\u2019s argument that there was abandonment is stated thus in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-11\">\u201cThe facts relied upon by Petitioner, in support of its position, are the clear admissions made by the Respondent, Welp, that he did not acquire:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-12\">\u201c(1) Any part of the business of Osborne,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-13\">\u201c(2) Any chickens or eggs from Osborne, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-14\">\u201c(3) Any formula or principle for breeding chickens of the type sold by Osborne as \u2018Hy-Cross\u2019 chickens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">\u201cWelp received only the name \u2018HyCross\u2019 \u2014 that was all he wanted \u2014 and nothing more whatever was acquired. Welp wasn\u2019t even interested in knowing the Osborne \u2018Hy-Cross\u2019 breeding formula. <em>These facts should prevail over the wording of the assignment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">Appellant would apparently have us hold \u201cabandoned\u201d a trademark which has never been out of use because Osborne did not transfer to Welp any \u201cbusiness\u201d or any chickens or eggs or any know-how or trade secrets, notwithstanding there was an assignment, in the precise words of section 10 of the Lanham Act, of \u201cthat part the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark\u201d which was assigned, as well as the assignment of the mark and the registration thereof. No ease has been cited to support that precise proposition. Appellant quotes at length from the opinion of the District Court for the Southern District of New York in a trademark infringement suit, Avon Shoe Co. v. David Crystal Inc., D.C., 171 F.Supp. 293,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which case it admits there was abandonment of the trademark <em>prior </em>to an attempted assignment thereof. The quoted portion of the opinion, dictum for the most part, refers to a number of pre-Lanham Act cases on the necessity of assigning some \u201cbusiness\u201d with a trademark in order to have a valid assignment. Nothing quoted tends to show that an invalid assignment is, ipso facto, an abandonment of a mark. One case subsequent to the Lanham Act, cited in the Avon case and further discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>by appellant, is the decision of this court in 1955 in Nettie Rosenstein, Inc. v. Princess Pat, Ltd., 220 F.2d 444, 42 CCPA 806. There was a purported assignment to the applicant of a trademark, discussed in that opinion on a subsidiary issue of laches, by one Rubin, not a party to the opposition. The alleged assignment was dated February 7, 1947, which was prior to the effective date of the Lanham Act. The application assigned was filed under the Act of 1905 and was abandoned by the assignee. But of most significance was the finding by the court that at the time of the alleged assignment Rubin had no going business and had not sold any perfume (the mark was for perfume) for five years prior to the purported assignment. In all of this the court said it could find no basis of a finding for laches and acquiescence on the part of opposer amounting to an estoppel of op-poser\u2019s right to oppose. The case is a long way from the issue in this case. The part quoted and most relied on by appellant was in turn a quotation from the opinion of the Examiner-in-Chief citing another decision of this court, in 1939, Kelly Liquor Co. v. National Brokerage Co., Inc., 102 F.2d 857, 26 CCPA 1110. In that pre-Lanham Act case the court pointed out (102 F.2d 857, 26 CCPA 1115):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\">\u201cBy reason of the particular facts in this case, however, we do not hold that the claimed transfer from Kelly Brothers Company to appellant constituted an abandonment of its trade-mark by Kelly Brothers Company. That question is not before us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">We do not find, therefore, any authority in support of the contention that Osborne\u2019s assignment, even if it did not effect a valid transfer, necessarily resulted in an abandonment of the mark within the intent of section 14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">However, we do not believe that the assignment was invalid. Unlike the cases relied on, Osborne, so far as the record shows, was using the mark at the time he executed the assignment of it. He had a valid registration which he also assigned. With these two legal properties he also assigned, in the very words of the statute, \u201cthat part of the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark * * He was selling chicks which his advertising of record shows were designated as \u201cNo. 111 HY-CROSS (Trade Mark) AMERICAN WHITES.\u201d As part of his assignment, by assigning the goodwill, he gave up the right to sell \u201cHY-CROSS\u201d chicks. This had been a part of his \u201cbusiness.\u201d By the assignment Welp, the assignee, acquired that right. The record shows that he began selling \u201cHy-Cross Hatching Eggs\u201d and chicks designated as \u201cHY-CROSS 501,\u201d \u201cHY-CROSS 610,\u201d and \u201cHY-CROSS 656.\u201d Thus, what had once been Osborne\u2019s business in \u201cHY-CROSS\u201d chicks became Welp\u2019s business. We do not see what legal difference it would have made if a crate of eggs had been included in the assignment, or a flock of chickens, destined to be eaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">As for the argument that the transfer should have been held illegal' because Osborne sold one kind of chick and Welp sold another another under the-mark, whereby the public would be deceived, we think the record does not: support this. The <em>type </em>of chick appears, to have been otherwise indicated than-by the trademark, as by the numbers, above quoted as well as by name. Osborne, moreover, was not under any obligation to the public not to change the-breed of chicks he sold under the mark from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">For the foregoing reasons we believe that appellant has failed to show error in the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">MARTIN, J., did not sit or participate-because of illness.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-18\">.
