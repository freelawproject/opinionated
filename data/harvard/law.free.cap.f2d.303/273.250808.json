We denied the motion without prejudice to renewal at time of argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">The summary judgment was entered on January 11, 1961. The record shows that a copy of the journal entry of judgment was received by Appellant\u2019s local counsel of record in Wichita, Kansas forthwith, and the records of the District Court Clerk show that notice and copies of the journal entry of judgment were mailed to all of the attorneys of record, including David M. Palley, Appellant\u2019s chief counsel in New York City, New York. No attempt to appeal was made by Appellant within the thirty-day period provided by Rule 73(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. but on March 8, 1961, after the time for appeal had expired, Mr. Palley filed an affidavit asking the trial court to extend the time for appeal on the ground that, he had not received notice of the entry of judgment. On that date, the trial court issued an ex parte order extending the time to appeal for thirty days and Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed' within the extended time. Appellees\u2019 motion in the trial court to set aside the order extending the time to appeal was denied on the basis that the filing of the notice of appeal had divested that. Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number> Under these circumstances, it is extremely doubtful whether, as a matter of law, the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d contemplated by Rule 73(a) was present. See: Nichols-Morris Corporation v. Morris, 2 Cir., 279 F.2d 81. In any event, since the motion in the form of an affidavit for an extension of time in which to appeal was not made within the initial thirty days allowed by Rule 73 (a), the trial court was without power to act without giving notice to all adverse parties. See: Rules 6(b), (d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and North Umberland Mining Company v. Standard Accident Insurance Company, 9 Cir., 193 F.2d 951. The trial court\u2019s ex part order extending the time for appeal was therefore void ab initio, and Appellant\u2019s subsequent notice of appeal was untimely and insufficient to vest this Court with jurisdiction of the appeal. Cf. Sutherland v. Fitzgerald, 10 Cir., 291 F.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
