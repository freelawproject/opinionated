Government officers arrested Robert Gordon who was then at the farm, and with him went to see the defendant. Defendant told the officers that he was the owner of the whiskey and that his brother Robert had nothing to do with the crime. Defendant\u2019s admissions were later reduced to a written confession which he signed. Upon arraignment on a charge of illegal possession of distilled spirits (\u00a7 5205(a) (2), Title 26, U.S.C.A.) defendant entered a plea of not guilty. He was duly tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Upon trial, defendant testified that when the officers, with defendant\u2019s brother Robert in their custody, came to him, they stated that unless defendant admitted ownership of the whiskey the brother, then on parole, would be sent back to prison. He claims that his admission of ownership was made only to protect his brother and that his confession was coerced and involuntary. Government evidence made an issue of defendant\u2019s claim that his confession was coerced. Preliminary consideration, by the District Judge, of the voluntariness of the confession was waived, and he submitted this question to the jury. It was proper for him to do so. Wright v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 250 F.2d 4, 13 (1957); Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 602, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 88 L.Ed. 1481. The jury resolved the issue against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
