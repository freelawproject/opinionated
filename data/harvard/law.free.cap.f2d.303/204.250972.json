After the Boesche application was filed, Cuccia and Conley filed an application which complied fully with the law and the regulations. The Secretary directed the cancellation of Boesche\u2019s lease and the District Court, we think correctly, sustained his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">By \u00a7 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a noncompetitive lease must be issued to the first applicant who qualifies. The Secretary is authorized to make rules and regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To promote efficient exploitation of mineral deposits on unproven lands,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Secretary requires by regulation that an application must cover at least 640 acres, with two exceptions, one of which is \u201cWhere the land is surrounded by lands not available for leasing under the act * * *.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court that this is a reasonable and valid regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cNot available for leasing\u201d may well mean, not available for leasing <em>to anybody. </em>Accordingly the Secretary \u201chas always considered lands covered only by an outstanding application to be available for leasing.\u201d Natalie Z. Shell, 62 I.D. 417, 419 (1955). This interpretation is reasonable and we should not reject it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In interpreting \u201can administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt.\u201d Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). When Boesche filed his application, an adjoining 40-acre tract had been applied for but not leased. Since that tract was \u201cavailable for leasing\u201d the Boesche application was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Although the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his regulation had \u201cgeneral applicability and legal effect\u201d, it was not necessary to publish it in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe function of filling in the interstices of the Act should be performed, as much as possible, through * * * quasi-legislative promulgations of rules * * *. But any rigid requirement to that effect would make the administrative process inflexible and incapable of dealing with many of the specialized problems which arise.\u201d Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">This court has held that the Secretary not only has authority to cancel a lease issued on a defective application but may be required to do so.
