Substantial evidence in the record also justifies the Board\u2019s finding (and its consequent back pay order) that the Respondent did not unconditionally offer reinstatement to the employees involved until July 22, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-21\">The order of the Board will be enforced. A proposed decree to that effect may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
