By motion filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 he seeks vacation of sentence alleging that the sentencing court denied him the right of allocution in violation of Rule 32(a), Fed.Rules of Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A. The motion is one of many post-trial motions filed by appellant several of which have reached this court. Johnston v. United States, 260 F.2d 345; Johnston v. United States, 292 F.2d 51, cert. den. 368 U.S. 906, 82 S.Ct. 186, 7 L.Ed.2d 100. The trial court considered the present motion as presenting a new issue but refused relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Appellant was tried together with a co-defendant, one Riley, and each was represented by the same attorney. The transcript of proceedings indicates that the following transpired at the time sentence-was imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201cThe Court: The defendants will stand for sentence at this time. I\u2019ll make this inquiry: Is there any reason why sentence should not be imposed at this time that either one of you have to present ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201cMr. Cook (counsel): I would like-to make a brief statement before: sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201cThe Court: This question doesn\u2019t involve that. This involves a legal, question. Now then, I\u2019ll hear you on mitigation of the sentence, if you want to be heard. You may be seated while he\u2019s presenting this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-16\"> Failure to follow the formal requirements of Rule 32(a) is not of itself' an error that can be raised by collateral attack under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 although aggravating circumstances may indicate-the denial of a right surpassing formal error. Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417. Here it. seems clear that the question posed by the trial court was unambiguously addressed to the defendants and in this regard meets the requisite suggested by Mr. Justice Frankfurter speaking for a divided court in Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">It is also clear that the court\u2019s question was intended to reach a legal right peculiar to the defendants personally and so presents a stronger procedural background than that considered to be sufficient compliance with Rule 32(a) by the Supreme Court in Green and by the Second Circuit in interpreting Green in United States v. Miller, 293 F.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">We hold that appellant was not denied due process and was granted an opportunity to address the court in his own behalf. The trial court properly refused to vacate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
