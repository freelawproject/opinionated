The Julie Ann was being towed down the Mississippi River by Crescent pursuant to its contract with Dixilyn. Crescent and Dixilyn jointly paid the amount of the libelants\u2019 claim under a stipulation approved by the court, which provided in part that \u201cthe libelees, as between themselves, may litigate to a final conclusion all questions of negligence, liability, contribution, indemnity and ultimate responsibility on the part of each or both of the libelees.\u201d After a full trial on the merits, the district court entered a final decree holding Crescent solely at fault and liable to repay to Dixilyn its half of the satisfied claim with interest and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">The district court found Crescent at fault for not furnishing enough power to hold the Julie Ann while her legs were lowered sufficiently to clear the underside of the bridge, and that Crescent\u2019s Tug-Orleans had an engine failure which caused or contributed to the lack of sufficient power. It further found that Crescent\u2019s Captain Brechtel was guilty of negligence in failing to make an earlier test of the holding power of the tugs with the legs lowered to the required depth, in not causing the Julie Ann to be brought to a complete stop for the lowering of her legs, and in failing to notify Dixilyn\u2019s employee Hughes at an earlier time to start the lowering of.the legs. Those findings are vigorously attacked by Crescent as clearly erroneous, and' Crescent insists that the collision was caused by a misunderstanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Dixilyn personnel aboard Julie Ann as to the operation of her legs, and by their failure properly to call the draft of the legs, thereby leading Captain Brechtel to the belief that the legs would clear the underside of the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">A review of the district court\u2019s findings of fact would confront us with an extremely difficult decision. Instead, we examine first the towage contract between Dixilyn and Crescent. If that contract validly shifted liability for the collision damages to Dixilyn or its insurer, whether or not Crescent was negligent, the fact findings as to negligence are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The facts necessary for our consideration of the towage contract are not in substantial dispute, and are restated l\u00e1rgely from the briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Julie Ann, constructed at the LeTourneau plant at Vicksburg, is a self-contained, submersible type drilling rig. She is 193 feet long, 151 feet wide, and has a displacement of 2500 tons. She is triangular in shape, with legs of open truss steel frame construction 175 feet long set on each corner of the triangle. Approximately 30 feet of the legs had not been installed at the time of the collision. The lower end of each leg consists of spud tanks or feet 35 feet in diameter and about 35 feet in height. The legs provide a tripod on which the hull of the barge can be raised or lowered for drilling operations or for navigational purposes. The legs are operated from a control room situated above the quarters. They are lowered and retracted by three 60 cycle motors powered by three generators, any one of which is capable of lowering or retracting all three legs simultaneously. The legs are controlled by three levers, all of which can be manipulated so that each leg can be raised or lowered by itself or with one or both of the other legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The barge hull itself is 20 feet in depth (from main deck to bottom), and at the time of the collision the hull afloat was drawing approximately 13 feet. Below the main deck is a machinery deck containing a complex of equipment and tanks necessary for drilling operations, Including mud tanks, water tanks, and fuel tanks. On the main deck are located draw works, pipe racks and anchor winches. Two story living quarters are situated above the main deck, completely equipped as spacious and comfortable accommodations for 45 men, all air-conditioned and equipped with a modern galley, laundry and recreation lounge. The rig is a complete self-contained unit, capable of drilling in more than 100 feet of water, and includes in her equipment slush pumps, a Schlumberger unit, cement unit, mud lab, water evaporator, mud pits and mixers, jets and guns, six diesel engines, and six electric generators.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The Natchez-Vidalia bridge is a fixed highway bridge over the Mississippi River. The lowest member of the bridge is 142.9 feet above mean sea level. The surface of the river at the bridge is 17.28 feet above mean sea level at zero on the Natchez gauge. On December 27, 1957, the date of the collision, the Natchez gauge reading was 33.2 feet, so that there was a clearance of 92.4 feet between the surface of the water and the lowest steel on the bottom side of the bridge. The legs of the rig being 143 feet long, they had to be lowered so that at least 51 feet were below the water in order for the rig safely to clear under the bridge. The legs could not be lowered to a depth that would cause them to foul on the river bottom during the approach to the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The channel of the river (the deepest portion, in which safe navigation is afforded) approaching the bridge is no less than 1200 feet wide for a substantial distance above it. The contour of the bottom, however, is not level a short distance above the bridge, there being a ledge or bar less than 55 feet below the surface about 2500 feet above the bridge. Accordingly, until the flotilla passed that point, it was impractical for the legs to have been lowered more than 35 feet. All of these facts were generally known, although, of course, the exact level of the water and the exact conditions which would be encountered on the day that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the proposed movement would take place could not be foreseen in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Julie Ann was scheduled for departure from the builder\u2019s yard at Vicksburg for the day after Christmas. Upon hearing that the rig was nearing completion, Crescent solicited the business of towing her to New Orleans, and a letter of solicitation was written. Whether due to this solicitation or otherwise, Dixilyn contacted Crescent in mid-December and suggested a meeting to negotiate a tow-age contract. A meeting was held at Dixilyn\u2019s office in New Orleans in mid-December, attended by Messrs. Tidwell, Boring and Brigham, corporate officers of Dixilyn, Messrs. Wood and Blakely, whose capacity will be hereafter adverted to, and Messrs. Apgar, Smith and Lanman of Crescent. (Mr. Lanman died prior to the trial.) At this meeting, there was a discussion of the general characteristics of the rig and of the timing of the movement, and it was tentatively agreed that Crescent would undertake the towage. Mr. Wood specified that he desired Captain Brechtel to be in charge of the tow, because he had brought one or more rigs down the river on prior occasions. Crescent stated that it proposed to use Captain Brechtel with its small Tug Orleans and two upriver push boats, the Toltec and the Ouachita, if those vessels were available. The navigation of the flotilla was to be under the command of Crescent\u2019s pilot, Captain Brechtel.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Toltec is a triple s.erew, 3975 horsepower push boat, 130 feet long by 30 feet wide. It was only six months old at the time of the collision and was the sixth most powerful towboat then running on the Mississippi River. The Ouachita is a twin screw, 1800 horsepower push boat, 90 feet long by 26 feet wide. The Orleans is a single screw tug of 700 horsepower, 100 feet long by 26 feet wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The exact role of Mr. Wood does not appear by the evidence. Mr. Wood died before the case was tried, and Mr. Blakely was not called to testify. Wood, however, was the president and owner of a marine surveying company in New Orleans and had had substantial experience in the engineering and moving of submersible drilling rigs comparable to Julie Ann. Blakely was one of his staff. Evidently they represented Dixilyn in this instance, or Dixilyn\u2019s underwriters, for they were at the meeting and participated in the conference and did not represent or have any connection with Crescent.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The district court found that the question of a provision in the towage agreement releasing Crescent of all liability was not determined at that meeting, and that nothing definite was agreed on other than that Crescent would undertake the towage and would place it in charge of Captain Brechtel.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Following the discussion at the meeting, Crescent\u2019s vice president, Mr. Apgar, after consulting with its admiralty counsel, Mr. Kohlmeyer, wrote a letter to Dixilyn as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">\u201cDecember 19, 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">\u201cDixilyn Drilling Corp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">Saratoga Building</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARHE\">New Orleans, Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">\u201cAttention: Mr. H.

So they had me to read it again and studied it and talked about it. So there was one sentence in there they said they wouldn\u2019t like to sign at all with that .sentence in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApO\">\u201cThey said they wouldn\u2019t like for me to sign that letter at all with that one sentence in it and said, in fact, all the letter was objectionable, that they wouldn\u2019t like for me to sign it at all, but I could go ahead and sign it with that one sentence if it was stricken out, and said even though .the rest of the letter\u2014\u2018We don\u2019t like it; it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s not legal by a prior case in court; that it\u2019s not a legal document, but if they insist on you signing it, it will be all right to go ahead but we don\u2019t like it, but you can sign the rest of it.\u2019 So I called Mr. Apgar and told him I couldn\u2019t sign it at all with that one sentence in it; that I would sign it if they would strike that sentence out. So he said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll re-write the letter verbatim, just leaving out that sentence.\u2019 And he wanted to know if I would sign it if they would do that. He did; sent me another letter, and I called Mr. Gifnn and Stentz and read that letter to them and told them it was exactly the same except that one sentence was left out, and they advised me to go ahead and sign it. That is why I signed it, on their advice, because I felt like I needed some help because I didn\u2019t understand it. But I did sign it, not understanding, on their advice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">As indicated, the letter was redrafted with the objectionable sentence omitted and, as thus redrafted, was signed by Mr. Apgar for Crescent and by Mr. Tidwell for Dixilyn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">As to whether the towage contract should be construed to shift to Dixilyn liability for collision damages in any event, including damages due to negligence of Crescent, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APJ\">\u201cThe second question presented by this record for determination is whether or not the Dixilyn agreed to indemnify Crescent for any and all damages that might be suffered by third parties and, as heretofore stated, Crescent relies upon the second letter of December 23. The evidence and correspondence is clear to the effect that Dixilyn declined so to do and declined to execute the towage release clause requested by Crescent. Crescent, of course, knew before the refusal of Dixilyn to execute those documents that Dixilyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>did not intend to release Crescent from any liability to third parties due to the negligence of Crescent. In order for one to release the other party for damages due to its own negligence, the contract of indemnity must be clear and definite in its terms that such is the intention. \u2666X- -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cSince the damages to the bridge flowed from the negligence of Crescent, it is clear under the above authorities that Dixilyn did not indemnify or agree to indemnify Crescent by its letter of December 23.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We have re-stated all of the evidence in the record which would support the district court\u2019s finding as to the intent of Dixilyn and as to Crescent\u2019s knowledge or notice of that intent. Mr. Tidwell signed the letter contract on behalf of Dixilyn in reliance upon advice from Giffin and Stentz, the underwriter\u2019s representatives. That advice was not communicated to Crescent, nor was Crescent advised of the reasoning or intention upon which that advice was based. Actually the advice which Giifin and Stentz gave Tidwell recognized that the meaning and intent of the contract were unfavorable to Dixilyn, but expressed the view that the contract was illegal. \u201cWe don\u2019t like it; it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s not legal by a prior case in court; that it\u2019s not a legal document, but if they insist on you signing it, it will be all right to go ahead but we don\u2019t like it, but you can sign the rest of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Dixilyn\u2019s rejection of the Tower\u2019s Release Clause attached to Crescent\u2019s letter of December 19 and its rejection of the sentence stricken from Crescent\u2019s first letter of December 23 are not necessarily inconsistent with an intent on the part of Dixilyn to release Crescent from any liability to third parties due to the negligence of Crescent. To the contrary, Dixilyn\u2019s refusal to accept the Tower\u2019s Release Clause and its insistence on eliminating the sentence from the letter may have been because Dixilyn was not willing to accept liability, (1) for fault and negligence on the part of Toltec and Ouachita and their owners, and (2) for collision damages occasioned by Crescent\u2019s tug Orleans on its voyage up river to pick up the Julie Ann. If the second letter of' December 23 which Dixilyn approved as a part of the agreement of towage expressed plainly and unequivocally that Dixilyn accepted liability for any damage claims of third parties, including those caused by Crescent\u2019s negligence, or that Crescent was to have the benefit of Dixilyn\u2019s insurance, then the intention so expressed is not inconsistent with Dixilyn\u2019s earlier rejections of the Tower\u2019s-Release Clause and of the sentence stricken from Crescent\u2019s first letter of December 23. On the other hand, if that letter is doubtful or ambiguous, then we should place ourselves as nearly as possible in-the situation of the parties and should consider the language of the agreement in the light of the previous meeting and correspondence and of all of the attendant and surrounding circumstances. Compare Restatement of Contracts, Sections. 230-235.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of interpretation of indemnity contracts is the same as in the case of other types of contracts, namely, the ascertainment of the intention of the parties.\u201d Annotation 175 A.L.R. 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">This Court has held in many cases that the failure of an indemnity contract to refer expressly to negligence evidences an intention not to indemnify against losses resulting from the indemnitee\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">In two cases where the contract did expressly refer to negligence, it was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to provide indemnity for losses resulting from the indemnitee\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The more recent case of Batson-Cook Co. v. Industrial Steel Erectors, cited in note 3, supra, while holding against the indemnitee, did so both because of failure to use the \u201ctalismanic words,\u201d and also because of inability \u201cto find the equivalent clear intent in other language of the agreement.\u201d 257 F.2d at 412. Finally, our most recent opinion on the subject expressed the view that the rule requiring that, in order to relieve the indemnitee from liability for losses caused by his own negligence, the contract must contain an express stipulation to that effect \u201crests on an unsound and dangerous foundation\u201d for reasons well stated by Chief Judge Tuttle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cIt presumes, first of all, that one party\u2019s assumption of liability for losses due to another\u2019s negligence is an \u2018unusual\u2019 and \u2018hazardous\u2019 undertaking. We cannot agree. In the light of modern conditions, we perceive little justification for so characterizing the indemnitor\u2019s obligation. Insurance companies assume this obligation every day, especially in connection with automobile liability policies. And, it is common knowledge that the device of insuring against one\u2019s own negligence through indemnity contracts is frequently employed in other business ventures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cPerhaps more important, even assuming that the burden imposed on the indemnitor is \u2018unusual\u2019 or \u2018hazardous\u2019, the majority rule presumes that courts have the power to alleviate or eliminate this burden by construing the indemnity agreement in a manner which is patently inconsistent with the plain and clear meaning of the language employed by the contracting parties. This is a dangerous and unwarranted extension of the judicial function. If a court feels that a contract imposes an extraordinary liability on one of the parties, it may, in certain instances, pronounce the contract void as being contrary to public policy. But where, as here, a contract does not violate public policy, we have no authority to achieve the same result by concluding that the parties did not really mean what the unambiguous language of their agreement imports.\u201d Jacksonville Terminal Co. v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 5 Cir., 1962, 296 F.2d 256, 262, 263.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Thus the strict rule so frequently expressed in the cases appears to be giving way somewhat to the modern practice of providing liability insurance, and of bargaining as to which party shall bear the expense of such insurance. According to Mr. Apgar\u2019s testimony that expense was large; recently, in towing another drilling rig, Crescent had been charged one per cent of the value of the craft to be towed as a premium to protect for the one trip against liability for any damages. If Crescent had assumed that expense, it would have been reflected in its charge for towage. Actually, the rate charged on the Tug Orleans was $35.00 an hour, which Mr. Apgar testified was the customary charge for a normal operation with the Orleans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">The letter contract plainly stated that the \u201cadditional clause\u201d was \u201cpart of the consideration for our undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the towage.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The contract then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">\u201cIt is particularly understood and agreed that you are authorized to and by this agreement do release and relieve us from any liability for account of your underwriters and that any damage claims urged by third parties as well as any claim which may be urged by virtue of damage to the drilling rig in the course of the towage shall be for your account and account of your underwriters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Some liability might have rested on Crescent for unseaworthiness not caused by negligence, but the most substantial liability to which Crescent might be subjected was that based on its own real or claimed negligence. If \u201cany claims urged by third parties,\u201d as used in the exculpatory sentence, is interpreted not to include claims based on Crescent\u2019s negligence, then the provision is deprived of any real meaning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">If Dixilyn had any doubt of Crescent\u2019s intention that doubt should be removed by the next paragraph of the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cIt is further understood that the amount of the insurance protection which you have in force equals the value of the hull of the barge as to hull insurance and amounts to four million dollars as to third party claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Why should Crescent be interested in Dixilyn\u2019s insurance unless that was meant also to protect Crescent? As to third-party claims, Dixilyn\u2019s insurance was to amount to four million dollars. When that agreement is coupled with the agreement in the preceding paragraph \u201cthat any damage claims urged by third parties * * * in the course of the towage shall be for your account and account of your underwriters,\u201d the conclusion is inescapable that Dixilyn agreed to afford Crescent the benefit of Dixilyn\u2019s insurance. There seems little doubt that Giffin and Stentz, representatives of Dixilyn\u2019s underwriters, clearly understood Crescent\u2019s intent, but chose to rely on their opinion that \u201c * * * it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s not legal by a prior case in court * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">The district court having held that the contract was not sufficiently specific to require Dixilyn to indemnify Crescent against third-party claims based on Crescent\u2019s negligence, or to bind Dixilyn to afford Crescent the benefit of Dixilyn\u2019s liability insurance, did not reach the question of whether such a contract is valid. The \u201cprior case in court\u201d which led Giffen and Stentz to think the contract invalid was, in all probability, Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corporation, 1955, 349 U.S. 85, 75 S.Ct. 629, 99 L.Ed. 911, or its companion case, Boston Metals Co. v. The Winding Gulf, 1955, 349 U.S. 122, 75 S.Ct. 649, 99 L.Ed. 933. In those cases the Supreme Court created, or accepted as based upon public policy, a judicial rule in admiralty invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">In Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co., Inc. v. River Terminals Corp., 1959, 360 U.S. 411, 79 S.Ct. 1210, 3 L.Ed.2d 1334, the Court held that where the exculpatory clause had been filed as part of a tariff with the Interstate Commerce Commission it should not be struck down as a matter of law until the parties had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>obtain the views of the Commission, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201cThe rule of Bisso, however applicable where the towboat owner has \u2018the power to drive hard bargains,\u2019 may well call for modification when that power is effectively controlled by a pervasive regulatory scheme.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">\u201cFurther, it may be noted that the clause relied on in this case is by its terms restricted to the situation where shipments are transported in barges furnished by others than the towboat owner. Whatever may be the considerations involved in forbidding a towboat to contract for exemption from liability for negligence in other circumstances, it may be that different considerations apply when the towboat moves barges which are delivered to it loaded, so that it never has an opportunity adequately to inspect them below the waterline, and which, if defective, may create emergency situations where a small degree of negligence can readily lead to very substantial monetary loss. <em>If the peculiar hazards involved in towing a barge supplied by the shipper are great, and the methods of guarding against those hazards uncertain, it .may be that in an area where Congress has not, expressly or by fair implication, declared for a particular result, the federal courts should creatively exercise their responsibility for the development of the law maritime to fashion a particularized rule to deal with particularized circumstances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) 360 U.S. 418, 419, 420, 79 S.Ct. 1215, 1216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Virtually the same distinction suggested in the part of the last quotation which we have emphasized was adopted by the Second Circuit in an opinion by Judge Frank the year before the decision in Bisso. North River Barge Line v. Chile S.S. Co., 2 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 882. The Southern. District of New York has since held that the stricture of Bisso is not applicable to invalidate an exculpatory clause where the tower had undertaken to tow a scow in an ice-clogged river. The district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">\u201cHere, the tower, perceiving that there was unusual danger in towing in ice, made it a condition of his. assuming a contract of towage that, he be spared the difficulty and expense of defending himself in lawsuits resulting from accidents which, were likely to result in the extra-hazardous situation into which the tow owner had voluntarily put his property. Accordingly, the stricture of the Bisso case is not applicable to-the limited relief from liability at issue.\u201d Chile Steamship Co. v. The Justine McAllister, S.D.N.Y., 1958, 168 F.Supp. 700, 702.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The rationale of the rule in Bisso was; thus expressed in the opinion of the.Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">\u201cThe two main reasons for the creation and application of the rule-have been (1) to discourage negligence by making wrongdoers pay damages, and (2) to protect those in need of goods or services from being overreached by others who have-power to drive hard bargains.\u201d Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., supra, 349 U.S. at 91, 75 S.Ct. at 632.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Reason (1) is inapplicable to the facts-of the present case upon much the same-ground as that expressed in Southwestern Sugar <em>&amp; </em>Molasses Co., Inc. v. River Terminals Corp., supra. Reason (2) is clearly inapplicable to the facts of this case. Crescent\u2019s acquiescence in Dixilyn\u2019s rejections of two exculpatory provisions indicates that there was no economic pressure exercised by Crescent in the negotiation of the contract. The evidence showed that Crescent had competition on movements of this kind from three harbor towing companies in New Orleans and from others in Mobile and in the <em>Gal</em>veston-Houston area. Crescent was in no position to overreach Dixilyn or to drive a hard bargain. We conclude that, under all of the circumstances of this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Bisso rule is not applicable to prevent Dixilyn from indemnifying Crescent against third-party claims based on Crescent\u2019s negligence or to prevent Dixilyn from binding itself to afford Crescent the benefit of Dixilyn\u2019s liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">It was stipulated that Crescent carried hull insurance and protection and indemnity insurance on the tug Orleans in an amount more than sufficient to cover the amount of the claims of the libel-ants in this case. Dixilyn insists that, if it must indemnify Crescent, the measure of damages is the cost of Crescent\u2019s insurance and relies on Standard Oil Co. of Texas v. Wampler, 5 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 768, 771. In that case, Standard, after being furnished a certificate showing that the policy of insurance secured by Wampler did not protect Standard, made no objection. Judge Allred writing for this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, it seems to us the proper measure of damages would be the premiums paid for this insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, in the case cited, had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cWhere an applicant contracts for a certain character of insurance policy and such policy is refused, and he can then only obtain a like policy at an increased annual premium, the proper measure of damages, we think, is the difference between the premiums of the policy contracted for and the policy he can get.\u201d (199 S.W. at 875.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In the instant case Crescent had received no notice prior to the collision that Dixilyn had failed to obtain insurance to indemnify it and Crescent against third-party claims whether based on Crescent\u2019s negligence or not.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This case is therefore distinguishable from Standard Oil Co. of Texas v. Wampler, supra, and Dixilyn is liable to Crescent for the amount, with interest and costs, paid by Crescent to the libelants.
