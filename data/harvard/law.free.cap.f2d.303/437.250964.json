Following a jury verdict for the plaintiff the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the operation of the defendant hospital is a governmental function of Blount County, a political subdivision of the State of Tennessee, and is, therefore, immune from liability for tort.

Baroness Erlanger Hospital, 43 Tenn.App. 128, 306 S.W.2d 41, 1957, and the cases cited therein, that a non-profit public welfare hospital corporation owned by a political subdivision of the State of Tennessee and operated as a governmental function of such subdivision was not liable for the torts of its agents, servants and employees; and</p>\n<p id=\"b489-27\">IT FURTHER APPEARING after consideration of the record, arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>and briefs of counsel that there is no reversible error in the action of the trial judge;</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
