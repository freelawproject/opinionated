Jurisdiction under \u00a7 1006 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1486, is established. The Board\u2019s order, with one member dissenting, vacated its examiner\u2019s ruling dismissing the complaint filed by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency. We, in turn, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The question is whether Pike, although he was a certificated commercial pilot, violated the applicable statute and regulations by giving dual flight instruction to three students at a time when he, Pike, did not possess a flight instructor\u2019s certificate. There is no challenge here to the findings of fact which have been made and we are confronted with no problem of the sufficiency of the evidence to support those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Pike, born in 1922, operates an airport at Caruthersville, Missouri, owns aircraft and hangars there, engages in crop dusting and charter flights, and is a pilot in the Air Force Reserve. He possesses flight time of over 12,000 hours, 4,400 of which were in military aircraft. At all times material here Pike has held an airman certificate with commercial pilot privileges and airplane single and multiengine land and instrument ratings. In December 1959 the Administrator issued to him, in addition, a limited flight instructor\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In October 1959, while Pike held his airman certificate but before he acquired his limited flight instructor\u2019s certificate, he was served with notice of charges by the Administrator. On January 12, 1960, after an informal hearing, the Administrator revoked Pike\u2019s airman certificate because of claimed violations of \u00a7 610(a) (2) of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended, and of \u00a7 610(a) (2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 560(a) (2) and \u00a7 1430(a) (2). Pike, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 609 of the 1958 Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1429, appealed to the Board; the Administrator then filed his complaint with the Board for affirmation of the order of revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">This complaint alleged among other things (a) that Pike, on about thirty stated occasions in the years 1955 to 1959, inclusive, gave dual flight instruction to Darrell A. Dugger, John M. Cantrell and William E. Morris, holders of student pilot certificates; (b) that on each of these occasions Pike did not hold an airman certificate authorizing him to serve in the capacity of a flight instructor ; (c) that in so doing he was in violation of \u00a7 610(a) (2) of the applicable Act; (d) that because of these and other violations of the Acts and of the Civil Air Regulations, Pike had demonstrated a disregard for regulation and safety in air commerce so as to warrant, in the public interest, the revocation of his airman certificate; and (e) that the order of revocation of his certificate was accordingly issued. Pike\u2019s responsive pleadings contained a general denial and other defenses not pertinent on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">An examiner\u2019s hearing ensued. He found that Pike did give the flight instruction to the three students prior to his acquisition of a separate limited flight instructor\u2019s certificate. Pike had denied this but the examiner gave no credence to his testimony and actually noted a question as to his veracity. Nevertheless, the examiner dismissed the Administrator\u2019s complaint. He did so primarily on the grounds that the term \u201cairman\u201d is not defined by the statute to include \u201cflight instructor\u201d; that the statute\u2019s prohibition against one\u2019s serving as an airman in an uncertified capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>therefore did not apply to Pike\u2019s acts; and that the Regulations also did not prohibit Pike\u2019s flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On the appeal to the Board, however, its majority held that both the statute and the Regulations barred Pike\u2019s instruction. In so doing they stated, \u201cApparently there has not been a direct ruling on this question under the current framework of the regulations\u201d. Member Gilliland, in dissent, emphasized that the majority\u2019s decision did not rest on the ground that Pike endangered anyone or lacked qualification to perform the acts complained of but merely on the ground that he had not been formally authorized at the time to perform those acts. He noted that since December 18, 1959, Pike has had his limited flight instructor\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The case thus basically concerns only the construction of the statute and the interpretation of the Regulations. We look initially at these.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 973, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 401-681, and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 731, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1542, which supplanted the 1938 Act, clearly embody a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the safety aspects of aviation. See Nebraska Department of Aeronautics v. C. A. B., 8 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 286, 291; Lee v. C. A. B., 1955, 96 U.S. App.D.C. 299, 225 F.2d 950, 951; Air Lines Pilots Ass\u2019n International v. Quesada, 2 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 892, 894, 897, cert. den. 366 U.S. 962, 81 S.Ct. 1923, 6 L.Ed.2d 1254. This is evident from a review of \u00a7\u00a7 601-610 and 701-702 of the 1938 Act, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 551-560 and 581-582, and of \u00a7\u00a7 601-610 and 701-703 of the 1958 Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1421-1430 and 1441-1443. In particular, \u00a7 601(a) (6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of each Act confers upon the Administrator (or, under the 1938 Act, upon the Board) general rule-making authority governing practices as may be found \u201cnecessary to provide adequately for * * * safety in air commerce\u201d. Then \u00a7 602(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> empowers the Administrator \u201cto issue airman certificates specifying the capacity in which the holder's thereof are authorized to serve as airmen in connection with aircraft\u201d; \u00a7 602(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> authorizes the issuance of a certificate if the Administrator finds that the applicant possesses \u201cproper qualifications\u201d therefor; \u00a7 610 (a) (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> declares it unlawful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-17\">\u201cFor any person to serve in any capacity as an airman in connection with any civil aircraft, * * * in air commerce without an airman certificate authorizing him to serve in such capacity, or in violation of any term, condition, or limitation thereof, or in violation of any order, rule, or regulation issued under this sub-chapter ; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">and \u00a7 609<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> authorizes, under certain conditions, the issuance of an order suspending or revoking any type of certificate, including an airman certificate. \u00a7 102(b) and (e), \u00a7 103(a) and (c) and \u00a7 307(c) of the 1958 Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u00a7 2(b) and (e) of the 1938 Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are other statutory provisions emphasizing safety. \u00a7 901<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides for a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for each violation of the statute. Except for those specified in \u00a7 902,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> not applicable here, there are no criminal penalties for safety violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Pursuant to the rulemaking authority granted by \u00a7 601 of the 1938 Act, the Board did in fact issue safety regulations for airman licenses. These were adopted by the Administrator in 1958 when he assumed the safety rulemaking function and have been continued without substantial change pertinent to the present proceeding. The Board and the Administrator in their brief concede that the Regulations do not expressly forbid unlicensed instruction. Yet the Regulations do seek to spell out, with respect to a flight instructor\u2019s certificate, the \u201cproper qualifications\u201d mentioned by \u00a7 602(b). A flight instructor is defined to be \u201ca certificated pilot authorized by the Civil Air Regulations to give flight instruction\u201d. One is not to pilot a civil aircraft without \u201cappropriate ratings issued by the Administrator\u201d. An applicant obtains a limited flight instructor\u2019s certificate by demonstrating his ability properly to instruct students and by showing his familiarity with the methods and procedures set forth in the Plight Instruction Manual. A limited flight instructor\u2019s duties and responsibilities include the examination of the student pilot to determine his competency to make solo flights and solo cross-country flights, the entering of appropriate indorsements on the student pilot certificate, the signing of the student\u2019s log book for each period of flight instruction, and the maintenance of his own records of flight instruction time and indorsements entered. The student, in applying for a private pilot certificate, must present a reliable log book record and his student certificate appropriately indorsed by a certified instructor. Upon meeting certain requirements, including a satisfactory one year probationary period, a limited flight instructor is entitled to a regular certificate. There are specified limitations, too, in flight instruction as to aircraft category, hours of instruction per day and per week, and the like. 14 C.F.R. 20.5, 20.16, 20.23-4, 20.34, 20.130-8, 43.40, and 43.64.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We state initially that we entertain no doubt whatever that the Administrator has the power, in view of his broad rulemaking authority under the Act and the statute\u2019s emphasis on safety, to prescribe that dual flight instruction shall be given only by a certified commercial pilot who also possesses a flight instructor\u2019s certificate. See Wilson v. C. A. B., 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 244 F.2d 773, cert. den. 355 U.S. 870, 78 S.Ct. 119, 2 L.Ed.2d 75; Hard v. C. A. B., 7 Cir., 1957, 248 F.2d 761, cert. den. 355 U.S. 960, 78 S.Ct. 543, 2 L.Ed.2d 534. The issue, then, is whether there has been an exercise of that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Certainly the statute is not specific. \u00a7 101\u2019s definition of \u201cairman\u201d, so far as it is pertinent here, is directed toward a pilot in actual navigation of an aircraft. \u00a7 602 merely authorizes the issuance of \u201cairman certificates\u201d although it does prescribe that these certificates are to specify \u201cthe capacity in which holders thereof are authorized to serve as airmen in connection with aircraft\u201d. It goes on further to prescribe that a certificate shall be issued with such conditions and limitations as are determined \u201cto be necessary to assure safety in air commerce\u201d. \u00a7 609 provides for the amendment or revocation of any type of certificate including an airman certificate. And \u00a7 610 declares it unlawful for anyone to serve \u201cin any capacity as an airman in connection with any civil aircraft * * * in air commerce without an airman certificate authorizing him to serve in such capacity * * *\".</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">One searches these statutory provisions in vain for any reference to flight instruction, to capacity as a flight instructor, or to a flight instructor\u2019s certificate. Although the statute does speak in terms of various capacities, it contains no definiteness of description in that respect. Perhaps we should not expect the statute to be more positive for capacity limitation seems to be ap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>propriate material for the more flexible area of administrative regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The Regulations themselves are scarcely more specific. They do refer to flight instruction and to flight instructor and to the issuance of flight instructor\u2019s certificates and the qualifications therefor. The gap, however, lies in the absence of a provision stating, or providing a basis for an unquestionable inference, that the holding of an airman certificate is not equivalent to qualification as a flight instructor or to the holding of a flight instructor\u2019s certificate. This is the gap which the Administrator and the Board attempt to bridge by their arguments about implied prohibition in the Regulations of unlicensed flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">This lack of specificity and completeness of the Regulations disturbs us for this case. Because of this, we are disinclined to reach a result, drastic in its application to the individual concerned (whether it be Pike or any other), which deprives an airman of admitted experience and ability of his primary means of livelihood. Compare Carey v. C. A. B., 1 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 518, 524; Garber v. C. A. B., 2 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 321, 323; Walker v. C. A. B., 2 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 954, 956. We prefer to have, where a result of that magnitude is to be forthcoming, a statute or regulation which is more positive and definite than those here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">This, however, is not the only reason for our conclusion. There are others:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">1. The actual issuance of a flight instructor\u2019s certificate to Pike in December 1959. This fact, if it does not belie, is at least inconsistent with the strenuously urged claim of lack of Pike\u2019s trustworthiness. It must imply, too, the Administrator\u2019s acceptance and approval of his ability, not only as a pilot, but as an instructor of student pilots. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the issuance of this certificate was due to any newly acquired prowess or repentant attitude on the part of Pike between the time of the challenged instruction in 1955-1959 and the issuance of this additional certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">2. The Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations may well be entitled to great weight. Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 1945, 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700. See Danielson v. C. A. B., 2 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 266, 268, and Outland v. C. A. B., D.C. Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 224, 228-229. But the Board in its own order here concedes the absence of <em>\u201ca </em>direct ruling on this question under the current framework of the regulations\u201d and, in its brief, further concedes that it has not \u201cheretofore had occasion to rule on this precise point\u201d. Administrative interpretation of long standing is thus not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">3. The alleged violations here, if they concern safety at all, are obviously of lower degree than certain others which have been involved in reported litigation. They are less vital than, for example, the violation which bore directly upon the safety and welfare of commercial passengers in this court\u2019s recent case of Specht v. C. A. B., 8 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 905, 78 A.L.R.2d 1135. We cannot take issue with the Board and the Administrator when they stress the importance of adequate flight instruction under properly qualified instructors. Here, however, there seems to be little question of Pike\u2019s basic training and his capability as a pilot and, for that matter, as evidenced by his acquisition of a flight instructor\u2019s certificate, as a flight instructor. And any particular student pilot\u2019s progress is dependent upon more than one man\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">4. Our feeling that the revocation provisions of the statute in their application to Pike on this record have at least some penal aspect. We may accept for present purposes \u2014 although we need not and do not now pass upon the question\u2014that revocation of an airman\u2019s certificate for safety considerations is remedial rather than penal and that the rule that a penal statute is to be strictly construed is perhaps not applicable here. In the Specht case, supra, we said, p. 917 of 254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>F.2d, with respect to the revocation of a pilot\u2019s airline transport pilot rating, <em>\u201c </em>* * * the primary effect of that revocation is remedial, in that a pilot not qualified to command an airline transport aircraft has been denied the authority to do so\u201d. See also Wilson v. C. A. B., supra, p. 774 of 244 F.2d. Compare Didriksen v. F. C. C., 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 17, 254 F.2d 354, 356. But it is logical to assume\u2014and it is borne out by the very example of Pike\u2019s own 1952 experience when he was charged with similar violations\u2014that suspension or revocation will be followed by the imposition of a civil penalty under \u00a7 901.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such a penalty certainly is punitive. This at least prompts us to view the statute with an attitude of reasonable strictness and to demand for this case a stronger statutory or regulation basis than we are presently able to discover. See Judge Prettyman\u2019s dissent in Lee v. C. A. B., supra, p. 953 of 225 F.2d. Compare Helvering v. Mitchell, 1938, 303 U.S. 391, 399-404, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">5. The confusion attendant upon past changes in the Regulations. From September 1, 1942, to July 1, 1945, \u00a7 20.80 of the Civil Air Regulations did expressly prohibit the giving of flight instruction without a flight instructor\u2019s rating. That provision, however, was deleted from the Regulations on the latter date. Moreover, \u00a7 43.66 embraced, but only until April 11, 1957, the somewhat enigmatical provision, \u201cInstrument flight instruction may be given only by a person holding an effective instrument rating. A flight instructor rating is not required\u201d. Certainly this history gives some substance to the argument that the deletion of a positive requirement indicates that the requirement is no longer in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">6. The inconclusiveness of Pike\u2019s 1952-3 difficulties. In 1952 the Board held that Pike, in spite of warnings, had violated the Regulations by giving flight instruction when he did not have a flight instructor\u2019s rating, and suspended his airman certificate for three months. 13 C.A.B. 539. Upon his continuing to pilot and instruct when he was without his certificate during that period, a civil penalty under \u00a7 901 of the 1938 Act was imposed by consent judgment entered in the Eastern District of Missouri. Civil Action No. 1567. However, only the question of personal hardship was at issue before the Board. The question of violation wasmot raised on that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Our holding does not imply that we are unaware of possible resulting inconsistencies in the existing Regulations. The Board\u2019s majority felt that the Examiner\u2019s holding \u201cproduces the incongruous result of allowing a person who does not hold a flight instructor\u2019s certificate to give instruction in a situation where a certificate holder is forbidden to do so\u201d, as, for example, where a flight instructor is limited as to category of aircraft. This may or may not be true, for we can conceive of a situation where a certificated pilot\u2019s instruction area may reasonably be deemed limited to the very area of his piloting restrictions. We suspect, however, that any inconsistency which may exist is directly attributable to the lack of specificity of the Regulations themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Let Pike in no way misunderstand the significance of our holding. We do not condone violations, where they exist, of the statute or of the Regulations. We do not approve misstatements or false entries or an attitude of defiance or an above-the-law approach to proper regulatory authority. In view of his difficulties in 1952-3 and in view of the very fact of the present proceeding, it should be evident enough to him that his activities have apparently been at the law\u2019s edge for too long a time already. With an appropriate revision of the Regulations perhaps to be anticipated as a result of this case\u2014assuming that the Administrator continues in his present position\u2014so that there will be no re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>maining doubt of certification requirements, it is strongly indicated that Pike\u2019s operations in the future are to be well within the overall framework of the law and the Regulations. His history is too damaging to afford him much assurance in further near-the-line activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The petition for review is therefore granted. The Board\u2019s order of March 8, 1961, is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to affirm the examiner\u2019s initial decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 551(a) (6), \u00a7 1421(a) (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(a), \u00a7 1422(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(b), \u00a7 1422(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1430(a) (2).
