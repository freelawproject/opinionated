The plaintiffs in one suit are executrices of the estate of Mark Peter Miller, pilot of one of the aircraft, who was killed in the accident. The plaintiff in the other suit is Terminal Flour Mills Company which owned the aircraft operated by Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">In both cases the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based on allegations of negligence on the part of Government employees in the control tower at Boeing Field. The United States denied negligence and alleged contributory negligence on the part of Miller. The cases were consolidated for a non-jury trial which resulted in judgments in favor of the plaintiffs, the total award being $123,085.60. The United States appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">On June 21, 1956, when this accident occurred, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) was an agency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>United States authorized to maintain facilities and employ personnel for the regulation and protection of air traffic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among such facilities were airport control towers manned by CAA personnel. CAA operated such a tower at Boeing Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">At the time of the collision the weather was clear, the visibility and ceiling were unlimited, and the wind was calm. These conditions called for aircraft pilots using Boeing Field to proceed under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) as set forth at 14 CFR 60.30-33, and in the Army, Navy and Civilian (ANC) Procedures for the Control of Air Traffic.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Some few minutes before the accident Miller, who was piloting his Beechcraft en route from Portland, Oregon to Boeing Field, radioed the tower from an unknown point south of the field, requesting landing instructions. The tower responded \u201cBeech 06 Charlie cleared to enter right traffic, runway 30, wind calm, report turning base.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon receipt of these instructions Miller inquired as to whether 30 was the short runway, and he was advised by the tower: \u201c30 is the short runway.\u201d No further transmission was made to, or received from, Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">At the time of and prior to the accident, the personnel of the tower knew that the pilot of the Cessna, which was the other plane involved in the accident, had with him a student who was practicing \u201ctouch-and-go\u201d landings on the field and was following a right traffic pattern.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Cessna was being given landing and take-off instructions by means of light signals from a light gun operated from the tower. The tower personnel assumed that the Cessna was being operated by the student pilot. At least one other aircraft from the Boeing-based Forrest Taylor School of Flying was also using runway 30 for that purpose at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">After the above-described radio communication between Miller and the tower, the Cessna and other aircraft based at Boeing Field continued their touch-and-go landings, being directed in this by light gun signals from the tower. Shortly thereafter the Cessna completed a \u201ctouch-down\u201d and was climbing to pattern altitude (one thousand feet) on the crosswind leg. The tower personnel did not recall looking at the Cessna after it turned into the crosswind leg.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>As the Cessna was climbing along the crosswind leg at a speed of about seventy to ninety miles per hour, the Beechcraft, piloted by Miller, came over the hills to the northeast of the field. The latter plane, which was traveling 140 to 160 miles per hour, was then at an altitude of one thousand to eleven hundred feet, which was slightly higher than the Cessna. It was descending in a turning left bank of about ten to fifteen degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">While the Beechcraft was engaged in this maneuver about sixteen hundred to two thousand feet north of the point of impact, the Cessna executed a ninety-degree right turn off of the crosswind leg onto the downwind leg. It had almost completely leveled out on that leg at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Miller\u2019s Beechcraft was visible from the control tower for from eighteen to twenty-four seconds immediately prior to the collision. Had the tower operator seen Miller\u2019s plane during that time he would have recognized that it might constitute a hazard to the operation of the Cessna, and that the Cessna might constitute a hazard to the operation of the Beechcraft. Neither operator saw the Beechcraft at any time prior to the collision, nor did they see the collision itself. Hence no effort was made by the tower to inform Miller by radio of the proximity of the Cessna.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">On the basis of these facts the trial court found and concluded that the tower operators were negligent in eight different respects, as set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court also found and concluded that the negligence of the tower operators was the proximate cause of the collision between the two airplanes. Finally, the court found and concluded, Miller was not contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Appellant challenges each of these ultimate findings and conclusions as to negligence, proximate cause, and contributory negligence. We turn first to the question of contributory negligence. If the finding and conclusion that Miller was not contributorily negligent cannot stand, the judgment must be reversed, without regard to whether the court was correct as to negligence and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The Government argues that, under the established facts, Miller was contributorily negligent in several respects. One of these, it was asserted, was his violation of the right-of-way rules prescribed by the CAA with regard to converging and overtaking aircraft. The pertinent part of the Air Traffic Rules in question, 14 CFR, part 60, section 60.14(b) and (d), is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The basic facts as to the relative positions of the aircraft immediately prior to the collision are not in dispute. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Cessna approached the point of impact from the right of Miller\u2019s Beechcraft and turned to a course approximately parallel to that of the Beechcraft. The Beechcraft overtook the Cessna, the right wing of the Beechcraft striking the left wing of the Cessna from the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">It follows that, both as the aircraft on the right, and as the overtaken aircraft, the Cessna had the right-of-way over the Beechcraft, providing that under the circumstances then existing, the right-of-way rules referred to above were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">But appellees argue that, under conditions then existing these right-of-way rules were not applicable. This argument is predicated upon a \u201cnote\u201d which appears under section 60.14, reading in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cNote: Right-of-way rules do not apply when, for reasons beyond the pilot\u2019s control, aircraft cannot be seen due to restrictions of visibility * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Appellees contend that this note governs, and renders the right-of-way rules inapplicable, because the trial court found as a fact that \u201c * * * Miller could have maintained a reasonable lookout while approaching the point of impact and not have seen the Cessna because of his limited visibility and the camouflage effect of the background.\u201d 'On the other hand, the Government contends that if it be assumed that this finding of fact is correct, it still would not have excused Miller from performing the duty imposed by the regulations to accord the right of way to the Cessna.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">It is axiomatic that any regulation should be construed to effectuate the intent of the enacting body. Such intent may be ascertained by considering the language used and the overall purpose of the regulation, and by reflecting on the practical effect of the possible interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">The phrases \u201cbeyond the pilot\u2019s control\u201d and \u201ccannot be seen\u201d appear to contemplate that only physical impossibility, due to such factors as weather or terrain, should excuse application of the right-of-way rules. Had mere difficulty of recognition or perception been intended as the relevant criterion, more appropriate language would have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-19\">This conclusion is supported by reference to the specific language of the right-of-way rules. Several pilots testified that it is much more difficult to see an aircraft which is at a lower altitude, where it may be partially camouflaged, than to see an aircraft against the horizon or sky. Presumably this fact was known to the CAA when these rules were promulgated, yet no consideration was given to this factor in prescribing the right-of-way rules.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-20\">It is unlikely that the CAA would provide in a rule that the aircraft at a higher altitude must give way to one at a lower altitude, then in a note to the rule excuse the pilot of the former of this duty because it is difficult to observe the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">Practical considerations of air safety also tend to support this interpretation of the rules. It is in and around cities, with their concomitant background camouflage, that most airports, and hence most air traffic, will be found. It is most improbable that under these circumstances, where the utmost of vigilance is demanded, the CAA would choose to relieve a pilot of the duty to obey the right-of-way rules because of conditions which are characteristically normal for such an area.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>With this construction in mind, we turn to the question of whether the above-quoted finding of fact is sufficient to excuse the duty to comply with the right-of-way rules. This finding refers to two circumstances, either of which assertedly might have prevented Miller, in the exercise of reasonable care, from seeing the Cessna. One of these circumstances was the \u201ccamouflage effect of the background\u201d which was found to exist in the area around Boeing Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">Under certain ideal conditions an object which is camouflaged may be invisible for practical purposes. When such conditions exist one can accurately say that it \u201ccannot be seen.\u201d Under the undisputed facts, however, such conditions did not prevail at the time of this collision. The flight path of Miller\u2019s plane was at approximately a ninety-degree angle to the path of the Cessna until immediately prior to the impact. The motion of the white-winged Cessna across a stationary background composed of multi-colored objects would have made it visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The trial court did not find that, by reason of the camouflage effect, the Cessna was physically invisible. It found only that a \u201creasonable lookout\u201d might not have revealed the Cessna. This was actually more of a conclusion of law than a finding of fact. The \u201clookout\u201d which Miller actually maintained obviously did not reveal the Cessna to him. But whether that was a \u201creasonable\u201d lookout depends upon the legal duty of care imposed upon Miller as a pilot, under the circumstances then existing. We think the court erroneously discounted the degree of care incumbent upon Miller with regard to the lookout to be maintained by him in approaching Boeing Field at that time and place.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">It may be that in order to have seen the Cessna against this background. Miller would have had to look thoroughly and diligently in the area in which the Cessna was flying. But if this is the degree of care required of the ordinarily prudent pilot, then such is the standard to which Miller must be held. We believe that this is the standard imposed by the rules, and it is not for the courts to .say that the standard is too exacting.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Miller knew, or should have known, that the greatest likelihood of conflicting traffic would come from the precise area in which the Cessna was flying. He should have anticipated the possibility of aircraft on the crosswind leg of the traffic pattern, and should have made a thorough surveillance of that area his prime concern.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In the other part of the finding in question it is stated that Miller\u2019s visibility was limited. Inasmuch as the weather was clear and the visibility at the field was unlimited, this finding must relate to the fact that Miller was seated in the left seat and was, just prior to the impact, banking slightly (ten to fifteen degrees) to the left, thus placing the fuselage and right wing in such position as to obscure his vision in the area in which the Cessna was flying. Under appellee\u2019s own version of the facts this was the attitude of the Beeeheraft. It therefore appears that the probable reason Miller did not see the Cessna was not because of the camouflage effect, but because his aircraft was in such an attitude that he could not even observe the area in which the Cessna was flying.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Assuming that this properly may be called a limitation on visibility, it is nevertheless not sufficient to invoke the exception to the right-of-way rules. This is not a condition beyond the pilot\u2019s control ; all that was required to remove this limitation was a momentary bank or roll in the opposite direction. As indicated above, Miller should reasonably have anticipated conflicting traffic on his right and below him; he cannot relieve himself of the duty to observe this traffic by voluntarily placing an obstruction in his line of sights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">We conclude that neither because of the camouflage effect of the background, nor the position of Miller in the left seat of a left-banking plane, was Miller excused from according the Cessna the right of way under the note to section 60.14 (the right-of-way rule) quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-16\">In finding that Miller was not contributorily negligent the trial court may have felt that where a control tower is present to direct traffic, the controllers have the primary responsibility for controlling aircraft so as to prevent colli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>sions, and that pilots are under such circumstances relieved from the duty otherwise placed upon them to accord the right of way as prescribed by rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Such a view would be erroneous, because the focal point of ultimate responsibility for the safe operation of aircraft under YFR weather conditions rests with the pilot.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under such conditions he is obligated to observe and avoid other traffic, even if he is flying with a traffic clearance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The CAA has recognized that with increasing density of traffic, increasing speed, and increasingly complex aircraft which require more attention inside the cockpit, safe operation is facilitated by providing assistance from ground personnel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such assistance is provided by the towers. The duties of tower operators are delineated in great detail in the manuals provided for the use of those personnel. Some of these duties overlap with the duties which other regulations placed on pilots.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It may be this overlap which has led some to believe that if these duties are imposed on the tower operators, the rules governing the duties of pilots under similar circumstances are only applicable where there is no tower.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">The rules governing the duties of pilots, however, make it clear that none of those duties are rendered inapplicable merely because a clearance from a tower has been received.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is stated and reiterated that the function of tower per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>sonnel is merely to assist the pilot in the performance of the duties imposed, not relieve him of those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The optimum of safety is sought to be achieved by imposing concurrent duties on the pilots and tower personnel. In any given case, one, both, or neither could be guilty of a breach of the duties imposed. This view is implicit in the decision of the court in Eastern Air Lines v. Union Trust Co., 95 U.S.App.D.C. 189, 221 F.2d 62, affirmed, sub nom., United States v. Union Trust Co., 350 U.S. 907, 76 S.Ct. 192, 100 L.Ed. 796. The ultimate result reached in that case recognized that both the Government and the airline had concurrently breached their duties, and each was held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We conclude that Miller was not excused by reason of the control tower operation from his duty, under the YFR weather conditions prevailing at the time of the collision, to give way to the Cessna which was in the favored position, or from doing whatever was necessary to clear the area in which the Cessna was flying.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Miller\u2019s violation of the right-of-way rules was negligence which proximately contributed to this accident and therefore precluded any recovery for his wrongful death under the controlling law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In view of this conclusion, .it is unnecessary for us to decide whether Miller was contributorily negligent in any of the other respects asserted by the Government.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is likewise unnecessary to decide whether the trial court erred in finding and concluding that the tower operators were negligent in one or more of the eight respects listed in footnote 6, and in finding and concluding that such negligence was a proximate cause of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">.

There was substantial disagreement among the pilots who testified as to whether the phrase \u201ccleared to enter right traffic\u201d should have indicated to Miller that there was traffic in the pattern. The trial court apparently found that it did not indicate that traffic existed, since it found the tower negligent in failing to inform Miller of the other traffic. In our view the language of the regulations requires the pilot to operate on the assumption that there is other traffic, and the testimony of pilots as to their understanding should not be permitted to alter the meaning expressed in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">14 CFR Part 617, \u00a7 617.25(b) (2) (ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIu\">\u201cA normal clearance to enter the traffic pattern shall be issued to a pilot whenever the controller desires that the aircraft approach the landing area in accordance with current traffic patterns.

A footnote to section 60.21-1 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201c * * * It is the direct responsibility of the pilot to avoid other aircraft when flying in VFR conditions <em>even with a traffic clearance. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b762-11\">. It is anticipated that at some future time many of the duties presently imposed on pilots may be assumed by ground personnel. In THE ADVANCE IN AIR SAFETY, Report of the Civil Aeronautics Board, May 1958, page 19, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-12\">\u201cThe air traffic control system of the future, unlike our present system, is designed to provide for the separation of all aircraft at all times regardless of weather. This is known as <em>positive control.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-13\">\u201cThere is no element of aviation which has advocated or is ready to advocate positive control <em>today </em>of all airspace. To do so with the \u2018men, money, and machines\u2019 now available would instantly ground 85 percent of traffic.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b762-15\">. The ANC manual of air traffic control procedures (Revised 2nd Ed., effective July 15, 1955), which is the \u201cbible\u201d for tower operators, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-16\">\u201c3.400 General \u2014 An airport traffic controller shall issue such traffic clearances and other information as are necessary for the prevention of collisions between aircraft under his jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-19\">\u201c3.500 * * * (D) ue to the restricted space on and around landing areas, it is often essential that traffic information be issued to aid the pilots to avoid collision between aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-21\">\u201c3.510 Detailed essential local traffic information shall be issued when, in the judgment of the controller, such information is necessary in the interests of safety, or when requested by a pilot.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b762-22\">. See United States v. Schultetus, 5 Cir., 277 F.2d 322, where the court stated at pages 326-327:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-23\">\u201cIt seems apparent that the district court had an erroneous concept of the functions and duties of the operators of the control tower. * * * The theory followed by the district court would place upon the operators of control towers the primary responsibility for the operation of aircraft at the field. Governmental regulations, having the force of law, have assigned this responsibility to the operators of aircraft.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b762-25\">. In addition to Schultetus, at least two other courts have recognized that a clearance from the tower does not relieve the pilot of any of the duties imposed by the regulations.

The other respects in which, it is asserted, Miller was contributorily negligent, are as follows: (1) failing to enter the traffic pattern at the prescribed point or altitude; (2) entering the traffic pattern at excessive speed, and (3) entering the traffic pattern in an improper manner, i. e., in a ten to fifteen degree left bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
