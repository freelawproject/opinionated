This type of arrangement is called an \u201cagency shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">The National Agreement which the Union sought to supplement contained provisions creating a \u201cunion shop\u201d which required all employees to become members of the Union within sixty days after the date of the agreement or of their employment and to pay initiation fees and membership dues uniformly required. These existing provisions with respect to the \u201cunion shop\u201d did not apply however to employees \u201cemployed in any state which prohibits or otherwise makes unlawful, membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment.\u201d A state statute in Indiana known as the Indiana Right to Work Law makes void and unenforceable any agreement conditioning em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ployment upon union membership. Bums\u2019 Indiana Statutes Ann. Section 40-2703.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The employer refused to bargain with the Union over this proposal on the ground that any agreement containing such a provision would be in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Union filed with the National Labor Relations Board a charge of unfair labor practice against the employer which was based upon the refusal of the employer to bargain with respect to this proposal. The Board heard the complaint and issued an order upholding the validity of the \u201cagency shop\u201d and finding that the employer violated Section 8(a) (1) and (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the Union with respect to it. The employer has petitioned this Court for review of the order and the Board cross-petitioned for enforcement. The Union was granted leave to file a brief amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The pertinent provisions of the Act are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">Section 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201cEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8(a) (3).\u201d [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">Section 8(a) (1) and (3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">\u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">\u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">\u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization: Provided, That nothing in this Act, or in any other statute of the United States, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization * * * to require as a condition of employment membership therein on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of such agreement, whichever is the later * * * Provided further, That no employer shall justify any discrimination against an employee for nonmembership in a labor organization (A) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or (B) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.\u201d [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">Section 14(b)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-18\">\u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the execution or application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.\u201d [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 164(b).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-19\">Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401-531.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-20\">Section 3(o)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-21\">\u201c \u2018Member\u2019 or \u2018member in good standing,\u2019 when used in reference to a labor organization, includes any person who has fulfilled the requirements for membership in such or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ganization, and who neither has voluntarily withdrawn from membership nor has been expelled or suspended from membership after appropriate proceedings consistent with lawful provisions of the constitution and bylaws of such organization.\u201d [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(o).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">It is the position of the Board that the legislative history of the Act indicated an intent on the part of Congress to authorize union security agreements to eliminate free riders and that the statutory provision permitting union shops is broad enough to include the lesser form of an \u201cagency shop arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We do not regard the \u201cagency shop arrangement\u201d as being something lesser than a \u201cunion shop.\u201d We believe it is entirely different. A Union security agreement is premised upon membership in a labor organization. An \u201cagency shop\u201d on the contrary is based upon an employee paying charges in lieu of union membership as a condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">It is asserted that an \u201cagency shop arrangement\u201d is valid under Indiana law as was held by an intermediate court in that state. Meade Electric Co. v. Hagberg, 129 Ind.App. 631, 159 N.E.2d 409. The Supreme Court of Kansas, however, reached a different conclusion in construing the constitution of that state. Higgins v. Cardinal Manufacturing Co., 188 Kan. 11, 360 P.2d 456, cert. denied General Drivers Allied Auto. etc. v. Higgins, 368 U.S. 829, 82 S.Ct. 51, 7 L.Ed.2d 32. The question, however, to be decided in the present case is whether this type of arrangement is lawful under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">We think the provisions of the Act are clear and unambiguous and need no judicial construction. The language of Section 7 of the Act which provides \u201cEmployees * * * shall also have the right to refrain * * * except to the extent that such right may be affected by <em>am agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment </em>as authorized in Section 8 (a) (3).\u201d [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157.] \u201cmeans what it says and excepts from the operation of the law only agreements requiring membership in a labor organization. (italics ours) An employee involuntarily subjected to the \u201cagency shop arrangement,\u201d as a condition of his employment, is not a Union member or the equivalent of it. If Congress intended to permit the exaction of these types of charges in lieu of Union membership, as a condition, of employment, it could easily have so provided in apt language. It is not for us, under the guise of construction, to enlarge the clear language of this statute. In our opinion, the provision for an \u201cagency shop\u201d would violate Section 7 and Sections 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act as this type of arrangement is not excepted from the Act. The employer was therefore not required to bargain with respect to a proposal which was in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The order of the National Labor Relations Board is set aside and the Board\u2019s request for enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
