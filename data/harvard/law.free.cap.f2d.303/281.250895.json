In this situation, defendant leased the station to plaintiff, subject to the obligation of defendant to Shell, the lease providing that plaintiff \u201cshall purchase all gasoline to be sold upon the premises described herein, from the Shell Oil Company or from any other company that\u201d defendant so indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Because of financial assistance which defendant had received from Globe, the latter acquired a mortgage on the premises, which obligated defendant to purchase from Globe all of his requirements for gas and oil on said premises. So, after the parties had been operating under the lease for about six months, defendant directed plaintiff to switch his purchases to Globe, whereupon plaintiff ordered his gas and other products from Globe by telephoning to a man connected with a trucking firm delivering gas for defendant. Defendant arranged for the trucking company to pick up the gas and deliver it to plaintiff as required and paid the haulers for their services. When plaintiff needed gas and oil he ordered directly through defendant or by calling the latter\u2019s truckers.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">At first, defendant billed plaintiff for gas and oil delivered and instructed him to make his check in payment to Globe, which was delivered to Globe and credited to defendant\u2019s account. The bills as rendered by defendant for gas showed a price fixed by defendant which was more than defendant had to pay Globe. Globe credited the surplus in payment to defendant\u2019s account with Globe. Later, by arrangement with defendant, plaintiff, upon delivery, made payment by his checks payable to Globe and delivered them to defendant\u2019s haulers for delivery to Globe.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Plaintiff never dealt with or contacted Globe and never ordered gasoline or oil from it. Globe never billed plaintiff, with which it never had any business dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Various contentions by plaintiff require mention at this point. He argues that the contract between Globe and defendant is ambiguous. His counsel characterizes him as \u201ca trusting fellow just following directions as required in the lease and [who] paid no attention to details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">While he admits that he never directly ordered his products from Globe, his counsel asserts that \u201che was led to believe he was doing so by the machinations of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Plaintiff characterizes Terzaikis\u2019 conduct as \u201ccommercial bribery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">And purposefully, plaintiff refers to-the payment to defendant for the service and profit to which defendant claims to-be entitled, as a \u201crebate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Quite aside from the contention of defendants that interstate commerce is-not involved (which we do not decide), we are impressed with the argument that this matter comes \u201cunder the jurisdiction of the State Court and does not invoke the Federal Law in any way,\u201d as-urged by defense counsel in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\"> Aside from the use of conventional antitrust language in describing the share of defendant Terzaikis in the-transaction as a rebate, the claims advanced by plaintiff amount to overreaching, imposition and fraud in a business-transaction. All this occurred in the state of Illinois, of which all the parties are citizens. Even if the products involved might have been in interstate commerce, the wrongs alleged are actionable under the law of Illinois, which has jurisdiction over all the parties. We held in Parmelee Transportation Company v. Keeshin, 7 Cir., 292 F.2d 794, at 804:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">\u201c* * * However, the use of conventional antitrust language in drafting a complaint will not extend the reach of the Sherman Act to wrongs not germane to that act, even though such wrongs be actionable under state law. We are not concerned with labels. Otherwise, an adroit antitrust lawyer might use his skill in the use of words to convert many unlawful acts into an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>titrust violations. The antitrust laws were never meant to be a panacea for all wrongs.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKe\">In Parmelee, we relied on Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311; Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464, and Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, 65 S.Ct. 1545, 89 L.Ed. 1954. It is, of course, immaterial that the appeal of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees afforded by federal law may be more attractive than the simple compensatory damages available under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">For this reason, we affirm the judgment order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">Judgment order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-25\">. Certiorari was denied, 368 U.S. 944, 82 S.Ct. 376, 7 L.Ed.2d 340.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
