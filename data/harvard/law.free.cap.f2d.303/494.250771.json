Together with a French cheese exporter, another French agent, and an American cheese packaging concern, the Community filed a complaint against William Faehndrich, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Faehndrich), a New York cheese importer. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Faehndrich was infringing the Community\u2019s \u201cRoquefort\u201d certification mark; and, in general, it sought to enjoin Faehndrich from selling cheese not produced in accordance with that mark but labeled or represented as \u201cImported Roquefort Cheese.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. At the same time they announced that if relief were granted on the Community\u2019s cause of action for infringement, the other claims would be withdrawn. The defendant denied infringement, and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. From a judgment in favor of the Community of Roquefort, and the issuance of a permanent injunction against continued infringement of the certification mark, the defendant Faehndrich appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">It appears that for centuries there has been produced and cured in the natural limestone caves in and about the municipality of Roquefort a sheep\u2019s milk blue-mold cheese,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which has been marketed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>in this country for many years as \u201cRoquefort Cheese.\u201d In an effort to protect themselves against unfair competition, producers of such French \u201cRoquefort Cheese\u201d frequently have asked our courts to prevent misleading use of the \u201cRoquefort\u201d designation. See, e. g., Douglas v. Mod-Urn Cheese Packing Co., Inc., 161 Misc. 21, 290 N.Y.S. 368 (Sup.Ct.1936); Douglas v. Newark Cheese Co., Inc., 153 Misc. 85, 274 N.Y.S. 406 (Sup.Ct.1934). For similar reasons the Community of Roquefort, in 1953, obtained a certification mark so that the term \u201cRoquefort,\u201d as applied to cheese, would be used exclusively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201c * * * to indicate that the same has been manufactured from sheep\u2019s milk only, and has been cured in the natural caves of the Community of Roquefort, Department of Aveyron, France, in accordance with the historic methods and usages of production, curing and development which have been in vogue there for a long period of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Since that time the Community has been diligent in protecting the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Nevertheless, in 1960, Faehndrich imported into the United States a quantity of sheep\u2019s milk blue-mold cheese, labeled \u201cImported Roquefort Cheese\u201d (at Faehndrich\u2019s direction), which had been produced in Hungary and Italy. Of course, it was not (and could not be) produced by authority of the Community of Roquefort under its mark. When imported, Faehndrich\u2019s cheese was packaged in a manner clearly indicating the countries of origin. On the other hand, when Faehndrich prepared the cheese for resale, the labels prominently displaying the words \u201cProduct of Italy\u201d and \u201cProduct of Hungary\u201d were replaced with new wrappers printed \u201cImported Roquefort Cheese\u201d and \u201cMade from Pure Sheep\u2019s Milk Only,\u201d <em>without any indication of origin. </em>Hence, there was nothing on the wrappers which would suggest to the retail-buying public that Faehndrich\u2019s cheese came from Hungary or Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In order to clairfy our discussion of the single question presented by this appeal, i. e., whether Judge Metzner was correct in granting the Community of Roquefort\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it will be helpful to summarize the law applicable to certification marks such as the mark involved in this case, and by way of explanation, to point out certain distinctions between <em>trade-marks </em>on the one hand, and <em>certification marks </em>on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Until the Lanham Act of 1946, a geographical name could not be registered as a <em>trade-mark. </em>This prohibition operated to prevent a single producer from appropriating the name of a particular place or area in which he was located to the exclusion of other and similarly situated producers. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 80 U.S. 311, 20 L.Ed. 581 (1872). \u201cIf the name was to be found in an atlas * * *, that was sufficient to preclude registration.\u201d Robert, Commentary on the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 1024, 265, 271 (1948). Nevertheless, if a geographical name which had become distinctive of certain goods was registered by oversight, it was protected against infringement, Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 221 U.S. 580, 591-593, 31 S.Ct. 669, 55 L.Ed. 863 (1911); moreover, if the name acquired such new significance as an indication of origin of goods, i. e., a secondary meaning, its use was protected from unfair competition even though it could not be registered as a trade-mark. Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., 179 U.S. 665, 674, 21 S.Ct. 270, 45 L.Ed. 365 (1901); Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 4.60, 4.70 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Section 2(e) of the Lanham Act continued to prohibit registration of a geographical name as a trade-mark, if \u201cwhen applied to the goods of the applicant [it] is primarily geographically descriptive * * *,\" 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (e) (2), <em>unless </em>such a name \u201chas become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods * * *,\" 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f). Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>der the Lanham Act, therefore, if a geographical name acquires a secondary meaning, it can be registered as a trademark. Vandenburgh, op. cit. supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In addition to this extension of trade-mark law, the Lanham Act created an entirely new registered mark which was denominated a \u201ccertification mark.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1054; Robert, op. cit. supra, at p. 270.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018certification mark\u2019 means a mark used upon or in connection with the products * * * of one or more persons other than the owner of the mark to certify regional or other origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristics of such goods * * *\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">A geographical name does not require a secondary meaning in order to qualify for registration as a certification mark. It is true that section 1054 provides that certification marks are \u201csubject to the provisions relating to the registration of trademarks, so far as they are applicable * * *.\" But section 1052(e) (2), which prohibits registration of names primarily geographically descriptive, specifically excepts \u201cindications of regional origin\u201d registrable under section 1054. Therefore, a geographical name may be registered as a certification mark even though it is primarily geographically descriptive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This distinction, i. e., that a geographical name cannot be registered as a <em>trade-mark </em>unless it has secondary meaning, but can be registered as a <em>certification mark </em>without secondary meaning, has significance. A trade-mark gives a producer exclusive rights; but a certification mark, owned by a municipality, such as Roquefort, must be made available without discrimination \u201cto certify the goods * * * of <em>any </em>person who maintains the standards or conditions which such mark certifies.\u201d (Italics added.) 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1064(d) (4). See 4 Callmann, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks \u00a7 98.4(c) (2 ed. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">On the other hand, a geographical name registered as a certification mark must continue to indicate the regional origin, mode of manufacture, etc. of the goods upon which it is used, just as a trade-mark must continue to identify a producer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201cWhen the meaning of a mark that had previously served as an indication of origin changes so that its principal significance to purchasers is that of indicating the nature or class of goods and its function as an indication of origin is subservient thereto, it is no longer a mark but rather is a generic term.\u201d Vandenburgh, op. cit. supra, \u00a7 9.20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Therefore, if a geographical name which has been registered as a certification mark, identifying certain goods, acquires principal significance as a description of those goods, the rights cease to be incontestable, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1065(4), and the mark is subject to cancellation, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1064(c); Robert, op. cit. supra, at pp. 280-281.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\"> In the present case Faehndrich does not contest the validity of the mark\u2019s registration, as to which the Community\u2019s certificate of registration is prima facie proof. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1057 (b). Instead, Faehndrich argues that there is a genuine issue of fact concerning the existence of generic meaning, i. e., whether the term \u201cRoquefort\u201d has acquired principal significance as a description of blue-mold sheep\u2019s milk cheese, regardless of its origin and without reference to the method of curing employed in the limestone caves of Roquefort, France. The difficulty with Faehndrich\u2019s position, however, is that nowhere in the affidavits submitted below on the motion for summary judgment is there any allegation of facts which suggests that such a genuine issue exists; nor does Faehndrich make any al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>legation that it could prove such facts at a trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The affidavits are barren of any allegations or facts that consumers understand the word \u201cRoquefort\u201d to mean nothing more than blue-mold cheese made with sheep\u2019s milk. Indeed, the Community\u2019s affidavits indicate the contrary. They allege that the only other cheese of this nature commercially sold in the United States, a product of Israel, is marketed as \u201cGarden of Eden\u2014Heavenly Cheese \u2014 Sheep\u2019s Milk Blue-Mold Cheese\u201d; that a similar Tunisian product is marketed abroad as \u201cBleu de Brebis\u201d; and that the same cheese which Faehndrich imports from Hungary and sells with the label \u201cImported Roquefort Cheese\u201d is sold in Belgium as \u201cMerino-fort.\u201d Moreover, we have already noted that producers of French Roquefort cheese have diligently protected the name from unfair competition in this country.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The purpose of summary judgment is to dispose of cases in which \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and * * * the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P. 28 U.S.C.A.; see 6 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b656.04 (2 ed. 1953). Since the object is to discover whether one side has no real support for its version of the facts, the Rule specifically states that affidavits shall \u201cset forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.\u201d Rule 56(e), Fed.R.Civ.P. In view of this, we agree with Judge Metzner that Faehndrich \u201chas failed to show * * * that there is any possibility on a trial that he can raise an issue of fact\u201d in regard to generic meaning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Moreover, since Faehndrich\u2019s wrappers indisputably bore the inscription \u201cImported Roquefort Cheese,\u201d we believe that the District Court was justified in finding, as a matter of law, that appellant\u2019s use of an identical mark on substantially identical goods was \u201clikely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of the origin of the goods.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114. Accord, Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc. v. Triumph International Corp., 191 F.Supp. 937, 940 (S.D.N.Y.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">We are well aware of the dangers involved in haphazard use of summary judgment procedures. However, summary judgment cannot be defeated where there is no indication that a genuine issue of fact exists; to permit that would be to render this valuable procedure wholly inoperative and to place a \u201cdevastating gloss\u201d on the rule. See Clark, \u201cClarifying Amendments to the Federal Rules?\u201d 14 Ohio St.L.J. 241, 249-250 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">. Plaintiffs below also alleged that Faehndrich\u2019s acts violated an international treaty, constituted unfair competition, and violated the Lanham Act\u2019s proscription of false and misleading designations of origin and description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-11\">. Judge Metzner did not consider the other claims, which were treated as withdrawn. Community of Roquefort v. William Faehndrich, Inc., 198 F.Supp. 291 (S.D.N.Y.1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-19\">. A French law, adopted in 1925, prohibits the sale of this type of cheese in France unless it is made in that general area according to traditional methods and standards of production.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-13\">. Where no prohibition against registration exists in section 1052(e), resort to section 1052(f), which is the \u201csecondary meaning\u201d exception to section 1052(e), is obviously unnecessary,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\">. It is interesting to note that Faehndrich\u2019s statement in compliance with Rule 9(g) General Rules of the Southern District of New York, submitted in connection with the Community\u2019s motion for summary judgment, .did not allege the existence of a genuine issue of fact relating to generic meaning. Moreover, Faehndrich, in a similar statement submitted with its cross-motion for summary judgment, alleged that no such issue of fact existed. Of course, the Rule 9(g) statement is not a substitute for affidavits alleging facts. It is intended to serve the convenience of the court in pinpointing the issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\">. Faehndrich\u2019s voluminous affidavits were directed to a showing that there existed a genuine issue of fact concerning the existence of secondary meaning in the term \u201cRoquefort.\u201d But, as we point out above, existence of secondary meaning (or lack thereof) does not affect the validity of a certification mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-14\">.
