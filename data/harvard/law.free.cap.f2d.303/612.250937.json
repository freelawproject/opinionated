Verdict was in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $7,500 and defendant has appealed from the judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The collision occurred on Lincoln Way West in South Bend, Indiana. Defendant was driving \u201cwestward\u201d, stopped in the inner lane, signalled a left turn, started the turn into an alley to the south, heard an \u201cimpact\u201d and stopped her car. Decedent\u2019s body was found about thirty feet east of the alley near the south curb and his motorcycle was on its side across the south curb just east of the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Defendant contends the District Court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in her favor for failure of proof of the essential elements of negligence and financial dependency of plaintiff on decedent. She argues that there is no substantial factual basis for finding her negligent, and no evidence locating decedent before the collision to justify an inference that if she had kept a proper lookout she ought to have seen decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">There is evidence that the collision occurred about 6:40 P.M. on dry pavement on a clear July evening; that defendant having stopped in the inner west-bound lane at the east line of the alley, waited for east-bound traffic to clear; that she made a left turn to go south into the alley and as she did she struck \u201csomething\u201d; and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see it before, * * * didn\u2019t know where it came from * * * didn\u2019t know which direction it was travelling.\u201d It is admitted decedent was travelling \u201ceasterly\u201d and there is evidence that he was in the east-bound lane just before the collision. There is evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the collision occurred about fourteen feet south of the center line when the left front of defendant\u2019s station wagon struck decedent\u2019s motorcycle throwing him thirty feet in a southeasterly direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">The complaint alleged defendant \u201ccarelessly and negligently\u201d operated her automobile. We think the evidence and inferences referred to justified the District Court\u2019s refusal to direct the verdict for defendant. The decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana in Whitaker v. Borntrager, 233 Ind. 678, 122 N.E.2d 734 (1954) and Hubble v. Brown, 227 Ind. 202, 84 N.E.2d 891 (1949) are authority for our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">The Hubble case is especially pertinent to meet defendant\u2019s argument here that there was no eye witness. There was no direct evidence where Mrs. Hubble was just before the accident or to show that anything defendant did, or omitted to do, was negligence. The court there discussed defendant\u2019s argument, similar to defendant\u2019s argument here as to negligence, that inference of proximate cause would be surmise and speculation. It said that there was no evidence that Brown\u2019s drunken \u201cweaving\u201d just before Mrs. Hubble fell or \u201cflew\u201d from the car, had discontinued and that there was evidence that he had just before \u201cwhisked by.\u201d The court thought the jury could infer reasonably that Mrs. Hubble was thrown from the car by the weaving and speed or that she had leaped in fear. There is no evidence in the case at bar that decedent\u2019s easterly course had discontinued and there are sufficient circumstances upon which the jury could conclude that if defendant had been keeping a proper lookout she should have seen him.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>It was essential to plaintiff\u2019s case that he prove \u201cdependency\u201d of himself and his wife, for whose benefit he is also suing, upon decedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the rule is that being in derogation of common law the Indiana wrongful death statute may not be extended beyond the legitimate meaning of its words, Shipley v. Daly, 106 Ind.App. 443, 20 N.E.2d 653, 655 (1938). Defendant argues that on the uncontradicted evidence there was room for only one reasonable inference, 1. e., that plaintiff and his wife were not dependent upon decedent. The test on this question is whether, considering the evidence and inferences favorable to plaintiff, there is evidence that plaintiff and his wife needed support and that decedent contributed to that need. New York Central R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 234 Ind. 457, 127 N.E.2d 603 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The favorable testimony is that plaintiff was a barber in Kennett, Missouri, that he borrowed $200.00 for the payment of decedent\u2019s expenses for three semesters at a university, that in response to needs of plaintiff and his wife decedent in 1953 gave plaintiff \u201csomething over $300.00,\u201d in 1954, $150.00 to $200.00, in 1955 \u201csomething over $600.-00in 1956, $150.00 to $200.00, and in 1957 to July, when decedent was killed, more than $300.00; and that these contributions were used to pay household bills and medical bills. These contributions were in addition to cash gifts decedent gave his parents for Mother\u2019s Day, birthdays, and Christmas.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">We think that we are not expanding \u201cdependent\u201d beyond its statutory meaning in holding that the evidence was sufficient to take the question of dependency to the jury. Novak v. Chicago &amp; Calumet Dist. Transit Co., 235 Ind. 489, 135 N.E.2d 1 (1956); New York Central R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 234 Ind. 457, 127 N.E.2d 603 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Defendant claims error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury upon \u201cspecial rights and duties,\u201d under Indiana law governing turns at intersections.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court could properly have refused to give the instruction upon deciding as a matter of law, on the physical evidence and oral testimony, that decedent was clearly \u201cso close\u201d to the \u201cintersection\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as to \u201cconstitute an immediate hazard.\u201d And on this finding the court would have been justified in refusing to give the instructions because there was no basis for defendant\u2019s theory that she had the right of way when making the left hand turn. There was no error in the ruling on the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">For the reasons given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-17\">.
