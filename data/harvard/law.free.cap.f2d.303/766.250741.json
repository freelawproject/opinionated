On November 4, 1960, the Commission authorized WMRO, Inc., intervenor herein, to operate an FM station in Aurora, Illinois, on Class B, FM Channel 236. After the Commission denied appellant\u2019s \u201cPetition for Reconsideration\u201d for reasons set forth at length in its Memorandum Opinion and Order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of February 17, 1961, ABC noted its appeal in our case No. 16,264.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">Partial reconsideration of that Memorandum Opinion and Order was then sought by WMRO to the end that the Commission set forth an additional ground for its ruling. WMRO in its opposition to ABC\u2019s petition^ for reconsideration had urged in part that the interference of which WENR complained affected only \u201c5,316 persons,\u201d equivalent to about 1/10th of 1 per cent of the more than 5 million persons within the 1 mv/m contour in the area served by WENR. The Commission by its Memorandum Opinion and Order of July 10, 1961 agreed. It was found that the loss in population served by WENR \u201cis obviously insignificant\u201d in terms of that station\u2019s total service and did not result in a modification of the WENR license. When the intervenor\u2019s petition for partial reconsideration was thereupon granted, ABC noted its further appeal in our case No. 16,528. We have consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">ABC would have us say that the grant to WMRO modified its license and violated its KOA rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus it is claimed that the Commission erred in failing to order a public hearing said to be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>by section 316 of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, ABC argues, in effect, that it is entitled to be free from interference within its 1 mv/m contour, no matter how slight the interference. \u201cEither a license is or it isn\u2019t modified by a given grant\u2014depending on whether interference occurs within the contour to which a given station is normally protected,\u201d ABC tells us on brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The Commission argues on the other hand that its rules applicable to frequency modulation service are not subject to the construction for which ABC contends. In the first place, section 3.204(a) of the Commission\u2019s FM rules provides that the \u201cservice area of a Class B station will not be protected beyond the 1 mv/m contour.\u201d ABC\u2019s license to operate WENR incorporated the Commission\u2019s rules within the KOA doctrine and thus included the importantly detailed provisions of section 3.313(c) of the FM rules. That section provides in part that a Class B facility may be authorized in a nearby city, on a channel 400 kc removed, in order to provide an equitable and efficient distribution of facilities notwithstanding some possible interference within the 1 mv/m contour of another FM station, it is argued. Accordingly, ABC was not entitled to an interference-free service area. Moreover such interference as it here would receive would be insignificant, and not sufficient to amount to a modification of its license. Thus the case did not present an issue turning upon section 316 rights. The Commission deemed the parties to be in substantial agreement as to the facts which, the Commission said, \u201cform the basis of the controversy herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">On July 27, 1960 the Commission granted an application filed by the partnership of Cofey and Oswalt for a permit to construct a new FM station in Aurora, Illinois, on Class B Channel 300. The Commission as a result of rule-making proceedings during the 1940s had allocated in the 88-108 megacycle portion of the spectrum 100 numbered channels for FM broadcasting. According to the table appearing in 12 F.R. 4027 (1947),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Channel 300 was the highest assigned for use by Class B stations and was to operate on a frequency of 107.9 me. The Class B Channel 300 station, WMRO, would have rendered its principal service to Aurora from a transmitter site some 36 miles distant from that of WENR in Chicago. It is not shown that operation on Channel 300 would have caused objectionable interference to any other FM licensee, and the grant seems not to have been contested by any objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">By application dated September 10, 1960, Cofey and Oswalt requested a modification of the outstanding construction permit for Station WMRO to permit operation on FM Channel 236 with a frequency of 95.1 me. The engineering report accompanying the application showed that the proposed modification would result \u201cin a negligible amount of objectionable interference to WENR-FM, Chicago, Ill. operating on Channel 234 (94.7 mc/s) and to WDHF, Chicago, Ill.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> operating on Channel 238 (95.5 mc/s).\u201d Exhibits readily disclosed the interference areas. The report\u2019s \u201callocation considerations\u201d revealed precisely the extent of the interference areas as related to the service areas of the two named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Chicago stations and the affected population ratios.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">On November 8, 1960, the Commission\u2019s Broadcast Bureau announced that on November 4, 1960 the WMRO application for modification of its construction permit to operate on Channel 236 had been granted. Some two weeks later, ABC filed its petition for reconsideration. It alleged that the grant \u201cwithout first affording ABC an opportunity to be heard contravenes the provisions of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 316 and the <em>KOA </em>doctrine (319 U.S. 239 [63 S.Ct. 1035, 87 L.Ed. 1374]).\u201d Its supporting engineering statement reflected that after calculations, \u201cWENR-FM is in agreement with the population and area figures with regard to interference caused WENR-FM as set out in the Aurora application * * The Commission thus could understand at a glance that of 2,079 square miles within the 1 mv/m contour of WENR, only 30 square miles would receive interference from the proposed operation by WMRO. Likewise, of 5,-215,983 persons within the same area, only 5,361 persons would be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The Commission treated the loss in population served by WENR as \u201cobviously insignificant\u201d\u2014de <em>minim</em>i<em>s\u2014</em>in terms of WENR\u2019s total service. The loss area was seen to be 30 miles west of Chicago and about 5 miles east of Aurora. The same number of persons and that very area, the Commission concluded, would receive service from WMRO. \u201cWe believe it reasonable to conclude that the needs of the population residing. therein are more nearly identified with Aurora than with Chicago.\u201d In the respects noted, WMRO\u2019s service, in short, would be in <em>substitution </em>of that previously provided by WENR.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">So, discussing only the first ground of the ABC section 405 petition, the Commission explained in its July Memorandum and Order that its November 4, 1960 decision to make the WMRO grant was \u201cbased upon the theory\u201d that it retains a \u201cdiscretion\u201d under its FM rules which it had \u201cproperly exercised.\u201d We may observe that ABC at that time was not in the case. It had not been given the section 316 notice \u201cin writing of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons therefor.\u201d The Commission explained, furthermore, ABC had no normally protected contour of 1 mv/m, despite its contrary understanding. Thus, the Commission concluded, ABC\u2019s license had not been modified \u201cwithin the meaning of Section 316 or the <em>KOA </em>decision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The unusual result was reached without a hearing on the WMRO application in the first place and without a hearing thereafter on WENR\u2019s petition under section 405. The Commission rested on the \u201cfacts\u201d as to interference as disclosed by the pleadings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">As it did so, however, the Commission completely overlooked the second ground of WENR\u2019s petition. Neither the February or the July Memorandum and Order makes any reference whatever to WENR\u2019s \u201cpublic interest\u201d contention. WENR had pointed out that if Aurora had had no FM channel, the \u201cpublic interest\u201d might justify condoning some interference by a new facility. But Aurora already had the Class A grant on Channel 240 when the Commission made the public interest determination [in July 1960] that a further Class B grant should be made to WMRO on Channel 300. ABC alleged accordingly: \u201cNo compelling reason is disclosed by the instant application why WMRO-FM should be allowed to shift to a different Class B channel, where as a result of such shift objectionable adjacent channel interference will be caused to two existing Chicago FM operations\u2014to Sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tion WENR-FM on Channel 234 and to Station WDHF on Channel 238.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">If public interest considerations had been set forth and supported in the record, we would find it difficult on the previously stated \u201cfacts\u201d taken by themselves, to disagree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the claimed \u201cinterference\u201d might seem lacking in substantiality. But when the allegations as to modification by interference are coupled with the allegations as to the completely unexplored reasons for and the basis of the transfer from Channel 300 to Channel 236, a substantial public interest issue emerges. There should have been a hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">As we read the Commission\u2019s FM Rule 3.204,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> WENR, as a Class B station, is entitled normally to protection for its service area <em>up to </em>its 1 mv/m contour, subject to FM Rule 3.313(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The latter section provides that stations \u201cmay be authorized to operate in nearby cities with a frequency separation of not less than 400 kc where necessary in order to provide an equitable and efficient distribution of facilities.\u201d We agree with the Commission that both sections should be read together. But if in taking account of section 307 requirements, it shall be made to appear that the existing licensee shall be required to accept <em>some </em>interference, it <em>is </em>entitled to a showing as to the circumstances justifying the modification. If an adequate record demonstrates the need, the Commission\u2019s order will be sustained.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The Commission insists that its FM rules<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are <em>sui generis, </em>so to speak. It says it has \u201creserved for itself the power or discretion to determine in each case whether a particular grant is necessary to provide an equitable and efficient distribution of facilities. * * * <em>notwithstanding resulting interference to existing stations in their 1 mv/m contours.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Perhaps so, but the rule does not so read. Its Memorandum and Order further recites the Commission\u2019s determination \u201cthat a Class-B FM station is not entitled to unlimited [sic] protection within its 1 mv/m contour * * The test for exercising its power to permit interference to a Class B station, the Commission says, is one of \u201creasonableness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">Even granting the Commission the wide scope to which it is entitled in construing its own rules, we are not now dealing with the former section 312 which concerned the Court in Federal Communications Comm. v. WJR, 337 U.S. 265, 278, 279, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 93 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>1353 (1949). After that decision came down, Congress amended the Act. The present section 316 is the result. In our view Congress intended to protect the right to be heard<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2014not where a purported issue of no substance is presented, to be sure<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2014but certainly so (1) where no public interest criteria are found to justify an initial grant without hearing and to support the refusal of hearing to an objector as in the circumstances shown here; and (2) where the Commission\u2019s claimed \u201cdiscretion\u201d as to what constitutes modification is so broadly asserted as to read section 316 right out of the Act. We find nothing in the Commission\u2019s FM rules permitting the interpretation now asserted. Congress authorized the Commission to promulgate appropriate rules for the conduct of its business, to be sure, but it did not grant the Commission \u201cthe congressional power of repeal.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We will shortly conclude. The Commission\u2019s Memorandum and Order noted that \u201cin making [a \u2018nearby cities\u2019] assignment, the Commission would not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d To support its exercise of discretion here, it noted that \u201cWMRO-FM would provide the first Class-B assignment for Aurora.\u201d In its July 1961 Memorandum and Order, in slightly altered form, it recited \u201cthat the grant of WMRO\u2019s application provides Aurora with a second FM facility in contrast to the 15 commercial FM stations now licensed in Chicago.\u201d But all that was true when the Commission first authorized Class B Aurora service on Channel 300. We suggest such findings offer no support for the action here complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. 21 R.R. 467 (1961); and see 21 R.R. 472 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-19\">.
