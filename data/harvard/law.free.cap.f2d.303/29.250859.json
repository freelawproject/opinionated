An earlier recovery had been set aside by this court. McNello v. John B. Kelly, 3 Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 96. In ordering a new trial we ruled that the evidence at the first trial sufficed to create a jury question whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s conduct might cause such harm as in fact resulted. It has been ably argued that the plaintiff\u2019s case on second trial did not contain certain evidence relevant to foreseeability that was introduced at the first trial and, therefore, that a jury case was not made out. The plaintiff\u2019s case on second trial was not a strong one but, under our ruling on first appeal, we think it was enough to warrant submission to the jury. No other point requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
