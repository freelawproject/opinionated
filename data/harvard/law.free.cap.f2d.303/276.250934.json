It seems clear that neither plaintiffs nor the corporation they assume to represent will suffer irreparable injury by delay in achieving their goal until after trial on the merits, while the corporate affairs will be placed in chaotic state by the sudden termination of the service contracts as sought. A preliminary injunction should be directed toward preserving the <em>status quo, </em>so far as possible, in order that ultimate adjudication may come on a complete record after a full trial which resolves the now disputed issues. We think that end will be best achieved here by withholding the injunction at this time. Foundry Services, Inc. v. Beneflux Corp., 2 Cir., 206 F.2d 214, 216. It should be understood that we now make no determination as to the interpretation and application of the governing statutory provision or choice between the restrictive view advanced by Judge Dawson on the one hand, Willheim v. Murchison, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 203 F.Supp. 478, or the broader construction supported by the plaintiffs and the Securities and Exchange Commission as <em>amicus curiae </em>on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
