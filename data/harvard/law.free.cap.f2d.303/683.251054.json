MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Libelant-appellant appeals from an order granting the respondent-appellee\u2019s (the Government) summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule 58(b), Rules of Practice in Admiralty and Maritime Cases, 28 U.S.C.A., dismissing the libel on the grounds that libelant failed to effect service of process on the United States in that he failed to serve a copy of the libel on the Attorney General of the United States and file an affidavit of service as required by 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 742 and 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">The libel alleged in substance that on October 15, 1959, libelant, while working as a stevedore aboard the U.S.N.S. Francis X. McGraw, owned and operated by the Government, was injured as a result of negligence and unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-17\">Section 745, 46 U.S.C.A., provides for a two-year statute of limitations. On June 8, 1961, and within the statutory period, the libel was filed in the Southern District of New York and on the same day a copy was served on the United States Attorney for the District, thus complying with the requirement of Section 742 that the \u201clibelant shall forthwith serve a copy of his libel on the United States attorney for such district.\u201d He failed at that time to \u201cmail a copy thereof by registered mail to the Attorney General of the United States\u201d and to file an affidavit of \u201cservice and mailing.\u201d The section then provides that \u201cSuch service and mailing shall constitute valid service on the United States * * <em>*.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-18\">On October 25, 1961, the Government made its motion claiming defective service. The next day, October 26, 1961, libelant attempted to remedy the defect by mailing a copy of the libel to the Attorney General, and on November 2, 1961, filed an affidavit of service and mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-19\">Libelant argues that the action was timely commenced by the filing of the libel and that prompt service on the United States Attorney satisfied what he calls \u201cthe primary, but indefinite procedural requirement\u201d of sections 742 and 782. He regards the mailing to the Attorney General as a \u201cminor, secondary item\u201d which is \u201can ancient historical exhibit\u2014interesting, but no longer needed today.\u201d The double requirement of service and mailing he characterizes as \u201cobviously a superfluous formula.\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>fore, he would force the Government, when it complains of failure to mail, to prove some prejudice thereby. Libelant also would gain support for his position from the fact that Congress did not repeat \u201cforthwith\u201d before \u201cmail\u201d in section 742 and did not define \u201cforthwith\u201d in terms of months or any specified period. Thus, he asks \u201cwhat practical difference did it make to the interests of the United States that there was a delay of a little over 4 months in mailing a copy to the Attorney General?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The libel here was filed well within the two-year statutory period so that the suit was not time-barred by the statute of limitations. \u201cThe institution of a suit in admiralty is marked by the filing of the libel.\u201d United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration v. The Mormacmail, D.C., 99 F.Supp. 552, 554. See, also, as to libels, petitions and complaints, Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States, 303 U.S. 567, 58 S.Ct. 694, 82 L.Ed. 1020 (1938); Hoffman v. Halden, 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 280, 281; Ore S.S. Corp. v. Hassell, 2 Cir., 1943, 137 F.2d 326; Huffmaster v. United States, D.C., 186 F.Supp. 120; Fugle v. United States, D.C., 157 F.Supp. 81; In re Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, D.C., 146 F.Supp. 516. Filing of the libel having been made within the statutory period and \u201cforthwith\u201d service having been made on the United States Attorney, the only question before us is whether the failure to mail a copy of the libel to the Attorney General for a period of over four and one-half months, regardless of whether such mailing was within or beyond the statutory period, prevented the court from obtaining jurisdiction over the United States. Compare Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\u201cSuits against the United States can be maintained only by permission, in the manner prescribed and subject to the restrictions imposed. Reid v. United States, 211 U.S. 529, 538 [29 S.Ct. 171, 53 L.Ed. 313].\u201d (Munro v. United States, 303 U.S. 36, 41, 58 S.Ct. 421, 423, 82 L.Ed. 633 (1938).) Decisions, therefore, which might apply between ordinary litigants are not controlling where a suit against the United States is involved. There can be little doubt of the power of the sovereign to declare the manner in which it may be haled into court. Grammarians may debate whether the adverb \u201cforthwith\u201d modifies only the adjacent \u201cserve\u201d and not the subsequent verb \u201cmail\u201d; or because \u201cserve\u201d and \u201cmail\u201d are connected by the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d the adverb modifies both. From a practical point of view, the latter conclusion is more logical. First the section itself is revealing. \u201cThe libelant * * * shall file a sworn return of such service and mailing.\u201d It would scarcely be likely that \u201csuch\u201d service, namely, \u201cforthwith,\u201d would be linked to any mailing no matter how dilatory. The next sentence supplies a further clue in its declaration that \u201cSuch service and mailing shall constitute valid service on the United States.\u201d If, as libelant argues, service on the United States Attorney is the only primary requisite, the coupling of the words \u201csuch\u201d and \u201cmailing\u201d is virtually read out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Libelant\u2019s argument that notice to the United States Attorney should be adequate notice to the United States is not realistic. His conception of a United States Attorney \u201cin his office snowbound\u201d eventually using his \u201chorse and buggy\u201d to carry notice of the libel to the Attorney General may be somewhat altered by a more modern communication system but it ignores the function of the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The Attorney General is responsible for handling the nation-wide litigation against the Government. For convenience of litigants, actual personal service may be made in the appropriate district, thus avoiding the necessity of traveling from North Dakota (for example) to Washington, or engaging local Washington counsel, to make service. It is, nevertheless, equally important, if not more important, for the Attorney General to receive almost simultaneous notice. In final analysis, the ultimate final responsibility for the handling of cases, both as to pleading and trial tactics as well as possible settlements, is vested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Attorney General. The local United States Attorneys are his deputies who possess such authority as he chooses to bestow upon them. See discussion of statutory responsibilities of the Attorney General in Judge Hincks\u2019s concurring opinion in Messenger v. United States, 2 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 328, 332. This practical situation combined with the wording of section 742 impel the conclusion that \u201cforthwith\u201d applies both to service and mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In City of New York v. McAllister Brothers, Inc., 2 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 708, this court held that service upon the United States Attorney and the Attorney General more than two months after filing was not sei-viee \u201cforthwith\u201d and affirmed a dismissal of the impleading petition against the United States. In Mc-Allister, the service and mailing were made within the two-year limitation period. The court specifically rejected the argument that service could be made at any time within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">As to libelant\u2019s argument that mailing is an historic relic of the past, this court has said \u201cthat the mailing to the Attorney General could not \u2018be dispensed with as purely formal.\u2019 \u201d (Messenger v. United States, supra). See also Glover v. United States, 109 F.Supp. 701 (S.D.N.Y.); Marich v. United States, 84 F.Supp. 829, 832 (N.D.Calif.); California Cas. Indem. Exchange v. United States, 74 F.Supp. 404 (S.D.Cal.); Barnes v. United States, 67 F.Supp. 571 (S.D.N.Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Libelant suggests that McAllister should be overruled. The problem is more basic than refusing to follow McAllister, Messenger and the other cases cited. Section 742 was enacted for a purpose. If Congress in the future decides that the Attorney General no longer needs to be notified by forthwith mailing, section 742 may be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Finally, the Government\u2019s delay in answering or in calling libelant\u2019s failure to mail promptly to his attention is not material because \u201cThe District Attorney had no power to waive conditions or limitations imposed by statute in respect of suits against the United States\u201d (Munro v. United States, supra, 303 U.S. p: 41, 58 S.Ct. p. 424).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b738-10\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3t\">(concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Judge MOORE\u2019S opinion is wholly convincing that there is no basis for believing the \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement of 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742 to be any less applicable to the mailing of a copy of the libel to the Attorney General than to the service of a copy upon the United States Attorney. Hence, if, as the opinion assumes, every failure by a libelant to comply with a procedural step outlined in the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525 (1920), is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d but only if so, its Draconian conclusion inexorably follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">I cannot believe Congress meant anything of the kind; I should have supposed that, once Congress gave the basic consent to sue the United States, as it did in the first sentence of \u00a7 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742, it was content to have the courts decide the effect of various procedural lapses in the same manner as \u201cif such vessel were privately owned or operated.\u201d The Act was \u201ca comprehensive waiver by the United States\u201d whereby \u201cthe government, in entering the shipping world as a participant, simply assumes a normal role in the antecedent pattern.\u201d Gilmore and Black, Admiralty (1957), pp. 773-774.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Nothing to the contrary was decided by this court in Osbourne v. United States, 164 F.2d 767 (2 Cir., 1947), which held only that the \u201cbuilt-in\u201d two-year statute of limitations, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 745, should be applied in the same way as were similar provisions in statutes relating to suits against private defendants. Indeed, even Schnell v. United States, 166 F.2d 479, 482 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 334 U.S. 833, 68 S.Ct. 1346, 92 L.Ed. 1760 (1948), a decision which Judge Frank, the author of the Osbourne opinion, characterized in dissent as resting \u201con the sheerest formality,\u201d 166 F.2d at. 484, did not speak in jurisdictional terms but sought to show the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>prejudice to the United States. However, the majority opinion in Messenger v. United States, 231 F.2d 328 (2 Cir., 1956), arising under the Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2401, 2671 et seq. and F.R.Civ.Proc. 4(d) (4), 28 U.S.C., proceeds on \u201cjurisdictional\u201d lines, and City of New York v. McAllister Brothers, Inc., 278 F.2d 708, 710 (2 Cir., 1960), reaches a result explicable only on that basis, a basis altogether natural in view of the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d characterization of the statute of limitations in the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 745, in recent <em>in banc </em>opinions, American-Foreign SS. Corp. v. United States, 265 F.2d 136, 149 (dissenting opinion of Judge Clark) (2 Cir., 1958), vacated, 363 U.S. 685, 80 S.Ct. 1336, 4 L.Ed.2d 1491 (1960) ; 291 F.2d 598, 603-604 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 895, 82 S.Ct. 171, 7 L.Ed.2d 92 (1961), but see 291 F.2d at 616. The body of authority thus accumulated in this circuit is too heavy for a panel to overcome, and I perceive no indication of dissatisfaction with the course of decision by my brothers sufficient to warrant requesting consideration <em>in banc, </em>see Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s opinion in Western Pacific Railroad case, Western Pacific R. R. Corp. v. Western Pacific R. R. Co., 345 U.S. 247, 270, 73 S.Ct. 656, 97 L.Ed. 986 (1953). I therefore reluctantly concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
