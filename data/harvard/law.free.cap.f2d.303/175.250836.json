Wilson, an employee of the Farmers\u2019 Home Administration, Department of Agriculture, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>a department of <em>the </em>appellee United States. Appellant in its answer admitted that Max E. Wilson was its employee and that he was acting in the scope of his employment when the accident occurred. However, appellant denied that Wilson was negligent and alleged that Mr. Grissler had been contributorily negligent, which negligence would be imputed to Mrs. Grissler. The district court had jurisdiction under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1402(b). The district court awarded damages to appellees. This appeal followed and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The district court made findings of fact that appellant\u2019s employee had been negligent and that appellees had not been contributorily negligent. Upon this appeal, appellant does not complain of the district court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s employee was negligent, but contends that Charles Grissler, the driver of appellees\u2019 car, was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In this intersection accident the evidence shows and the court found that appellee Charles Grissler was driving in a northerly direction upon his proper side of the street in the lane closest to the center line, and that appellant\u2019s vehicle being driven in a southerly direction made a left turn into the lane occupied by appellees in violation of the Arizona law. The evidence showed and the court found that the appellees\u2019 automobile had the right of way and that the collision occurred wholly within appellees\u2019 proper lane of traffic. The evidence showed and the court further found that the accident occurred as a direct and proximate result of appellant\u2019s employee\u2019s failure to maintain a proper lookout, his failure to grant appellees the right of way, his violations of the statutes, and his failure to exercise due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellant, while admitting that there was substantial evidence of its own negligence, argues that appellee Charles Grissler was contributorily negligent because he failed to see appellant\u2019s automobile in time to prevent the collision. The question of whether appellee Charles Grissler was contributorily negligent is a pure question of fact. The court found that appellee Charles Grissler was operating his automobile in a reasonably prudent manner in all respects and in accordance with all applicable traffic laws. The court\u2019s finding is amply supported by the evidence. We cannot set aside a finding of the district court unless it is clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. The findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
