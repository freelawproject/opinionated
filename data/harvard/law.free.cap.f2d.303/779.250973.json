That money was for payment of coats delivered to the Government by the manufacturer prior to bankruptcy in part performance of a coat contract with the Government. The testimony was that such payment would not have been authorized if the plant was not going to be reopened because the Government knew it would cost more than the original contract price to have the coats made elsewhere. The Referee found that \u201c * * the Government did, and had a right to, rely upon this court\u2019s orders which were designed to open the bankrupt\u2019s place of business, whereby it paid over $15,-879.38 to the Banks. The Government paid over the fund as part of the whole scheme of operation whereby it would secure the additional garments called for by the contract.\u201d He ordered that the Government be reimbursed out of said money for its actual losses due to the bankrupt\u2019s breach of the contract and that the balance of the sum be retained by the banks to be applied on their claims against the bankrupt estate. The district court affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Our own examination of the case reveals that the Referee\u2019s disposition of the matter is substantially supported by the record and is the proper solution of the problem involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
