We granted the motion for interlocutory appeal because we considered that the final disposition of the litigation would be expedited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court on the well considered opinion of District Judge Crowe holding that the three-year statute of limitations contained in the Canal Zone Code, \u00a7 4-85 is applicable rather than the two-year statute contained in the Federal Tort Claims Act. We agree with the District Court that</p>\n<p id=\"AQT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>claims against the Panama Canal Company are excluded from the provisions of the Tort Claims Act and that the limitation period contained in that Act has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
