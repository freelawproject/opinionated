After hearing the testimony of plaintiff, the driver of defendant\u2019s Post Office tractor-trailer, a police officer who took brief statements from plaintiff and the driver, the driver of a cement mixer who observed the tractor-trailer passing the mixer and a mechanic who tested the tractor-trailer\u2019s brakes, the trial court concluded that the operator of the government vehicle \u201cacted with reasonable prudence under the circumstances and that the negligence of the plaintiff contributed to the happening of the accident.\u201d A review of the entire transcript and the exhibits received in evidence supports the trial court\u2019s opinion that the credible evidence shows that plaintiff, a pedestrian, while attempting to cross a vehicular roadway between street intersections, became confused upon the approach of defendant\u2019s vehicle and that the swerving to the left by the truck was an attempt by the driver to avoid the accident. Plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of proving defendant to have been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
