(\u201cInnovative\u201d) (referred to collectively as \u201cthe owners\u201d), in the owners\u2019 action for injunctive and declaratory relief as to allegations that they are operating illegal gambling devices at the Birmingham Race Course (\u201cthe race course\u201d). We reverse that judgment and render a judgment for Barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">\n<em>I. Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">On December 15, 2005, the owners began operating at the race course an activity they advertised as a \u201cQuincy\u2019s Me-gaSweeps\u201d (\u201cthe MegaSweeps\u201d). The activity was interrupted on December 22, 2005, when Jefferson County Sheriff Mike Hale began executing a warrant authorizing the seizure of all records and computer equipment related to the operation of the MegaSweeps. That same day, the JCRA filed a complaint against Sheriff Hale seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the seizure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The JORA alleged that it was \u201cconducting a <em>sweepstakes </em>promotion at the race course to promote the race course and its lawful activities as well as the <em>opening of an internet caf\u00e9 and digital communications center.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The JCRA sought a judgment (1) declaring that its MegaSweeps operation was lawful and (2) enjoining Sheriff Hale from interfering with its MegaSweeps operation. It also sought a judgment declaring that the \u201cAlabama gambling statutes ... upon which the ... search and seizure [were] based\u201d are \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d It more specifically challenged the constitutionality of Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-12-20(4), which <em>defines gambling. </em>By consent of the parties, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining further seizure of equipment and ordering the return of all property that had been removed from the race course. The court, however, also enjoined operation of the Mega-Sweeps pending resolution of the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On December 29, 2005, Innovative, as the owner of the computer equipment and system at issue in this case, moved to intervene. That motion was granted on January 4, 2006. On January 17, 2006, Barber moved to intervene and filed a counterclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief. Barber sought a judgment declaring (1) \u201cthat the components of the [Mega-Sweeps] operation ... are in fact illegal gambling devices that are subject to forfeiture\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the operation ... is an illegal lottery under Section 65 of the Alabama Constitution and Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-12-20, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>He also sought an order permanently enjoining the operation of \u201csuch gambling devices and/or a lottery in Jefferson County.\u201d That same day, the trial court granted Barber\u2019s motion to intervene. The Alabama Attorney General appeared in the case and filed a memorandum in opposition to the owners\u2019 constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Subsequently, on January 31, 2006, following a bench trial, the trial court \u2014 without specifically referring to Barber\u2019s counterclaims \u2014 entered a judgment declaring that the MegaSweeps operation was not a lottery and that it did not involve the use of slot machines or gambling devices. The court permanently enjoined Sheriff Hale \u201cfrom further actions against [the Mega-Sweeps] operations at the [race course], provided [the owners] operate the [Mega-Sweeps] as represented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Sheriff Hale did not appeal. However, on February 14, 2006, Barber filed a notice of what purported to be an interlocutory appeal in case no. 1050625, challenging the injunctive aspect of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Specifically, the issue, as Barber framed it on his docketing statement, was \u201c[w]hether the trial court properly enjoined law enforcement from seizing equipment used in such operation or otherwise taking action against the MegaSweepfs] operation at the Birmingham Race Track.\u201d Concurrently, he filed a motion in the trial court to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment, or to grant a new trial. In that motion, Barber contended, among other things, that the January 31 judgment was not final because it did not refer specifically to his counterclaims. That same day, the owners moved this Court to dismiss Barber\u2019s interlocutory appeal. They contended that the January 31, 2006, judgment was, in fact, a final judgment, effectively disposing of Barber\u2019s counterclaims and precluding an <em>interlocutory </em>appeal. Furthermore, they argued, Barber\u2019s pending postjudgment motion rendered an appeal of a <em>final </em>judgment premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">On March 21, 2006, the trial court denied Barber\u2019s postjudgment motion. The following day, the owners apprised this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Court of that order and asserted that Barber\u2019s interlocutory appeal merged with the final judgment, from which he had a right to appeal. On that ground, they urged us to dismiss the appeal in case no. 1050625. Also, on March 22, 2006, Barber appealed from the postjudgment order, in case no. 1050857. The appeals were consolidated for briefing. Various amici curiae filed briefs in support of Barber, namely, (1) Governor Bob Riley, (2) Attorney General Troy King, (3) the Alabama District Attorneys Association, and (4) the Foundation for Moral. Law (\u201cthe Foundation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The parties now agree that all the issues presented in this dispute are subsumed in case no. 1050857. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal in case no. 1050625 as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>II. Case No. 1050857</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Two dispositive issues are presented: (1) whether the MegaSweeps operation at the race track involves the use of slot machines and, if so, (2) whether the definition of gambling in \u00a7 13A-12-20, Ala.Code 1975, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Our review of a declaratory judgment is ordinarily governed by the <em>ore tenus </em>standard. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>894 So.2d 643 (Ala.2004); <em>Alfa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Small, </em>829 So.2d 743 (Ala.2002). However, the standard \u201cis not applicable where the evidence is undisputed, or where the material facts are established by the undisputed evidence.\u201d <em>Salter v. Hamiter, </em>887 So.2d 230, 234 (Ala.2004). Neither does the <em>ore tenus </em>rule apply to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions or misapplications of the law to undisputed facts. <em>Eubanks v. Hale, </em>752 So.2d 1113, 1144-45 (Ala.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The material facts in this case are undisputed or uncontroverted and the questions presented are legal ones, as the trial court expressly acknowledged. Therefore, our review is <em>de novo. Brown, </em>894 So.2d at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">\n<em>B. Slot Machine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">Barber contends that the MegaSweeps operation involves the use of slot machines, in violation of Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-12-27. Section 13A-12-27 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">\u201c(a) A person commits the crime of possession of a gambling device if with knowledge of the character thereof he manufactures, sells, transports, places or possesses, or conducts or negotiates any transaction affecting or designed to affect ownership, custody or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">\u201c(1) A slot machine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWv6\">\u201c(2) Any other gambling device, with the intention that it be used in the advancement of unlawful gambling activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">A \u201cslot machine\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">\u201cA gambling device that, as a result of the insertion of a coin or other object, operates, either completely automatically or with the aid of some physical act by the player, in such a manner that, depending upon elements of chance, it may eject something of value. A device so constructed or <em>readily adaptable or convertible to such use is no less a slot machine because </em>it is not in working order or because <em>some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. Nor is it any less a slot machine because apart from its use or adaptability as such it may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-12-20(10) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u201cA person engages in gambling if he stakes or <em>risks something of value </em>upon the outcome of a contest of <em>chance </em>or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will <em>receive something of value </em>in the event of a certain outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-12-20(4). \u201cSomething of value\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny money or property, ... or article exchangeable for money or property or any form of credit or promise directly or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest therein, or involving extension of a service entertainment or a privilege of playing at a ... scheme without charge.\u201d Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-12-20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Barber insists that the trial court erred in discounting the operation and effect of key pieces of computer equipment when they are integrated within the Mega-Sweeps network. He contends that when those pieces are considered \u201ccollectively,\u201d they are gambling devices within the context of \u00a7 13A-12-27. This contention requires a description of the components of the MegaSweeps system and how it functions as an integrated whole in its historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>1. Function of the System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">On January 14, 2006, before Barber moved to intervene, the parties filed a joint stipulation of facts (\u201cthe stipulation\u201d). According to the stipulation, as supplemented by facts that are undisputed or un-controverted, Innovative is a wholly owned subsidiary of Multimedia Games, Inc. (\u201cMultimedia\u201d), which \u201cprovides computer equipment and software to promote the gaming activities of Native American, charitable gaming establishments, and state, national, and international lotteries.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2005, Multimedia began discussions with the owners of the race course regarding the development of a project to promote the race course, the \u201cprimary business activity\u201d of which \u201cis pari-mutual wagering and racing activities for its patrons.\u201d Those discussions produced the scheme for the MegaSweeps operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">To implement its plan, Multimedia devised a sophisticated computer system to be installed at the race course.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The JCRA describes it as a \u201cunique one-of-a-kind system that was basically developed from scratch.\u201d JCRA\u2019s brief, at 58 n. 18. Essentially, it involved the <em>sales of Internet access </em>in conjunction with <em>chances to win cash prizes. </em>\u201cInnovative was incorporated to continue Multimedia\u2019s implementation, design and deployment of\u2019 the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">The Internet-access aspect of the system installed at the race course is variously described as a \u201ccyber caf\u00e9\u201d or \u201cthe CyberCenter.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201c8. Patrons obtain access to the services of the CyberCenter by purchasing computer access time (\u2018cybertime\u2019) at a rate of one (1) dollar for four (4) minutes ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">\u201c9. <em>The rate[] charged for [cyber-time] is fair market value.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA6Yl\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201c22. The products and services offered at the CyberCenter ... provide for[, among other things,] ... personal computer usage, Internet access and voice communications via the Internet, and information on pari-mutual wagering. ... The CyberCenter features computer terminals that provide access to a personal computer with broadband Internet connection where users can browse the Internet, access email, and learn about and use commercial software applications licensed for use on that computer terminal. The package offered at the CyberCenter includes ... services such as photocopying, printing, photographic reproduction ...; access to software programs for use in preparing tax returns, computer games, and basic computer skills tutorials (for Windows, Microsoft Office, other programs and the Internet itself); and the sale or rental of certain computer hardware, including headsets that can be used for voice communications and flash drives for data retention and transfer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA-Od\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c24. Customers must have an account in order to purchase cybertime. With that account number, the System keeps track of how much cybertime a customer has purchased and how much that customer has used. The account is accessed through a plastic account access card containing an encoded magnetic strip similar to a credit card. Once cybertime has been purchased, it can be used at any one of the ... computer terminals located in the CyberCenter on both floors of the Birmingham Race Course facility. The computer terminals have restricted access requiring use of attached card swipe readers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The <em>gaming aspect </em>of the system is explained in the stipulation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201c10. The Birmingham Race Course offers a sweepstakes called the [Mega-Sweeps]. For every one (1) dollar of cybertime purchased, the consumer receives 100 entries in the [MegaSweeps]. The results of the respective entries, i.e., whether each is a winning or losing entry, are <em>predetermined when the consumer purchases cybertime at the point of purchase.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c11. The customer determines whether the sweepstakes entries are winners by reading the results online or on one of the 116 computers in the Cy-berCenter, calling a toll-free phone number, or by <em>placing the computer access card in one of more than 1,300 electronic readers </em>[\u2018the readers\u2019] that <em>display winning and losing entries in an entertaining format, </em>but standing alone are otherwise <em>dumb terminals. </em>Once the results have been revealed, winning entries are paid....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAh7e\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201c18. All sweepstakes entries, whether obtained with the <em>purchase of cyber-time, </em>by mail <em>[without a purchase </em>], or by request at the facility <em>[without a purchase </em>], are drawn in the same manner. Entries cannot be changed or altered at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201c19. Although a customer does not immediately know the sweepstakes results when the entries are [assigned] to him, the customer is provided with a number of ways to reveal the results. The customer can learn the outcomes of his sweepstakes entries by accessing a website remotely, using the computer terminals, by calling a toll-free phone number, or by revealing the outcomes on a reader.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201c20. The Birmingham Race Course has <em>over 1,300 readers. </em>The readers are divided among different entertainment scenarios, and each reader reveals a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>batch of entries in a quantity selected by the customer. The customer swipes his account card to activate a reader. Once activated, the customer <em>presses a button on the reader </em>to see the results of the selected number of entries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201c21. The entries the customer receives after the purchase of cybertime are the same entries that are revealed. When a customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries are revealed, those sweepstakes entries are marked as revealed and they cannot be revealed again. If a customer chooses to use a reader to reveal entries, a server selects the order in which a customer\u2019s outcomes are revealed. The <em>total prize value of the subset is sent to the reader </em>so the reader can show the outcome to the customer. For example, when a customer elects to reveal five of the customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries, a server might select five of the customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries that happen to be non-winners, in which case the appropriate communication would be relayed to the reader, and the reader would display that outcome to the customer. Alternatively, a server might select five of the customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries that happen to be winners and relay the appropriate communication to the reader. The reader will ultimately display the exact value of the customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The trial court found that the \u201creaders are designed and arranged so that they look and sound like slot machines.\u201d Lt. Paul Logan, who conducted preseizure \u201cundercover operations\u201d at the race track, stated that the readers would indicate a winning entry by \u201cdings, tones and simulated change falling as in a slot machine.\u201d According to Lt. Logan, the readers also had casino-style names \u201csuch as Bunch O\u2019Luck, Crazy Blue Streak, Reel Thrills, Sun Dogs, Flamingo 7\u2019s, Major Money, Krazy Farm, Ed McMahon\u2019s Star Magic, Cherry Pop, Fruit Cocktail Deluxe, China Seas, Lock and Win, Double Cash Money, and many others.\u201d The payout percentage, that is, the ratio of winnings to the amount expended by the players, is 92%. Indeed, the typical reader was originally manufactured as a slot machine and had been modified for use in conjunction with the peculiar components of the Mega-Sweeps system, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c26. <em>Central Database. </em>The central component of the System is a database where the customer\u2019s account is tracked. The account maintains the cardholder\u2019s information, the balance of purchased cybertime remaining, the quantity of sweepstakes entries issued, and the balance of sweepstakes winnings revealed, but not yet redeemed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201c27. <em>Point of Sale Terminals. </em>The Point of Sale Terminals allow customers to purchase cybertime for their accounts and to redeem any revealed winning sweepstakes prizes. The Point of Sale Terminal is connected to the Universal Point of Sale server which handles all transactions and connections with the Central Database. When a customer purchases cybertime a request is forwarded from the Point of Sale to the Universal Point of Sale server where it is credited to the customer\u2019s account in the Central Database. This sale of cy-bertime also triggers the System to give a customer promotional sweepstakes entries by associating them with the Customer\u2019s account <em>at the time of purchase.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201c28. <em>Computer Terminals. </em>The Computer Terminals are state-of-the art personal computers that are the primary access point for the services sold by the CyberCenter. The Computer Terminals are equipped with a suite of licensed commercial software applications (like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Microsoft Office) that can be used by customers on the local computer and they allow broadband access to the Internet. The Computer Terminals have attached swipe card readers that provide customers access by swiping their account access cards. The Computer Terminals are connected to a server called the CyberCenter Kiosk Webservice (\u2018Computer Terminal server\u2019) that deducts cybertime from the customer\u2019s account as the customer uses access time at the Computer Terminal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201c29. <em>The Readers. </em>The Readers reveal sweepstakes entries. The Readers are designed to show sights and sounds that heighten the suspense and excitement of the sweepstakes. The Readers reveal the outcomes to the customers in groups. The Readers do not determine the outcome of the sweepstakes; rather, they merely reveal the outcome to the customer in an entertaining manner. The only random process that takes place on the Reader is the determination of which entertaining display to use to show a losing outcome or a winning outcome of equal value. For example, a Reader might have several hundred different ways of showing a non-winning sweepstakes outcome to the customer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c30. <em>Servers. </em>The Point of Sale Terminals, Computer Terminals, and Readers are connected to three separate servers. The Universal Point of Sale server runs from the CyberCenter back office and handles requests from both the Point of Sale and Recharge Kiosks. The Universal Point of Sale server credits the customer\u2019s account in the database with cybertime when purchases are made at either the Point of Sale or the Recharge Kiosks and gives the customers sweepstakes entries. The Computer Terminal server also runs from the CyberCenter back office and controls access to the Computer Terminals. When a customer swipes an account access card at a Computer Terminal, the Computer Terminal server determines whether the customer has cybertime available. If so, the Computer Terminal server allows the customer access to the Computer Terminal. The Computer Terminal server keeps a record of the cybertime available on the customer\u2019s account. The Reader server determines which of the customer\u2019s sweepstakes entries will be revealed on any given request. For example, if a customer makes a request at a Reader to reveal five sweepstakes entries and the customer has 100 available, the Reader server determines which five entries to reveal. The Reader server then sends the information on the five entries to the Reader and marks those five entries as revealed in the database.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201c31. <em>Customer Tracking Terminal (\u2018CTT\u2019). </em>The CTT provides a mechanism for entering the customer\u2019s account data into the System and issuing a customer account card. Customers new to the CyberCenter must sign up and get an account card to begin tracking cyber-time. The CTT interfaces with the Customer Tracking System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">\u201c32. <em>Customer Tracking System (\u2018CTS\u2019). </em>The CTS provides an interface between the central database and the CTT. In addition to facilitating account creation and data entry, the CTS can be leveraged to facilitate promotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201c33. <em>Recharge Kiosk. </em>The recharge kiosks are automated stations that allow existing customers with account access cards to <em>purchase additional cybertime and add it to their accounts. </em>If customers have won cash prizes in the sweepstakes, <em>they can use the Recharge Kiosks to [apply] those winnings towards additional cybertime purchases. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The Recharge Kiosks are connected to the Universal Point of Sale server.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201c34. <em>Management Terminal. </em>The management terminals allow users to monitor and control the system. They provide access to reports on how the System works and on the current state of the System. Management Terminals are personal computers running proprietary software that provides them with a means of requesting and displaying information from the Central Database. Customers who call in to determine the outcome of their sweepstakes entries will be serviced by employees of the CyberCenter through the Management Terminals. Management Terminals provide access to information from the database through their connection to the Management Terminal Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaUO\">\u201c35. <em>Management Terminal Service (MTS\u2019). </em>The MTS connects the Management Terminals to the Central Database. The MTS packages requests for information from the Management Terminals and returns the data requested from the database. The MTS runs on a server in the back office of the Cyber-Center.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In a nutshell, the MegaSweeps system functions as follows: A consumer wishing to play the readers opens an account by obtaining a magnetically encoded card, either by mail or at the point of sale at the race track. In either event, the account is simultaneously assigned, by the central database and a server, a number of MegaSweeps entries corresponding to the amount of cybertime the consumer obtained. The assignments are selected from any 1 of 20 pools containing 200 million entries in each pool. According to Clifton Lind, Multimedia\u2019s chief executive officer, the entries in each pool are \u201crandomized by chance\u201d before they are assigned to a consumer. The consumer activates one of the 1,300 readers by inserting his slide card into a slot on the reader. Once activated, the reader allows a consumer to reveal his entries. The consumer chooses an option and presses a button. Subsequently, the reader server reveals the selected number of entries. Whether those entries correspond to any of the <em>winning </em>entries that were assigned to the consumer\u2019s account at' the point of sale is determined by a computer algorithm. The consumer may continue selecting options until all of his entries have been revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">When the consumer \u201clogs off\u2019 the reader, his account status is maintained in the central database. The system will print out a report of the transaction, including the amount of winnings, if any. Subsequently, the consumer may collect his winnings at a \u201ccash advance cage.\u201d In the alternative, he may exchange his winnings for <em>more cybertime </em>and, consequently, additional MegaSweeps entries, by inserting his card into one of the recharge kiosks and entering the amount of his winnings to be applied toward the purchase of more cybertime.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Barber contends that the \u201creaders are slot machines with certain parts removed.\u201d Barber\u2019s brief, at 48 n. 12. Thus, he insists, the readers are illegal because they are \u201c \u2018readily adaptable or convertible\u2019 to slot machines\u201d within the definition of \u00a7 13A-12-20(10). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">In its order, the trial court concluded that the readers are not slot machines because the \u201creaders are \u2018dumb terminals,\u2019 \u201d reasoning (1). that \u201cno element of chance is present <em>at the </em>readers,\u201d and (2) that \u201cno consideration is paid or <em>can be paid </em>to use the readers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Barber, however, contends that <em>both </em>these elements are present if the components of the system are understood as working \u201ccollectively\u201d and that \u201cthe trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>court erred in looking <em>solely at the readers </em>to determine whether gambling devices were present.\u201d Barber\u2019s brief, at 47 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">With a payout percentage of 92%, the owners do not \u2014 and could not \u2014 argue that the <em>third </em>element of gambling is absent in this case, that is, they do not contend that <em>prizes are not being awarded. </em>Instead, echoing the rationale of the trial court, Innovative insists that because the winning entries are <em>predetermined within the central database </em>at the moment the \u201cplayer receives his card,\u201d prizes are not awarded on the basis of a \u201cfuture contingent event,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 13A-12-20(4). Innovative\u2019s brief, at 66. Thus, this case turns on whether the MegaSweeps involves the elements of chance and consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>2. Chance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">By \u201cchance,\u201d we mean \u201ca lack of control over events or the absence of \u2018controllable causation\u2019 \u2014 \u2018the opposite of intention.\u2019\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices No. 373, </em>795 So.2d 630, 635 (2001) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>231 (6th ed.1990)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u201cSlot machines have come a long way since Charles Fey invented the first nickel three-reeler in a small machine shop in San Francisco in 1895.... There are slot machines that have eliminated the handle, requiring only the pressing of a button to set the wheels spinning.

Nelson Rose, <em>Gambling and the Law </em>83 (Gambling Times, Inc. 1986) (emphasis added).

More and more, such machines are controlled by computer. <em>Id. </em>at 441, nn. 382 &amp; 383. Indeed, modern slot machines may be \u201cstand-alone <em>or network computers.\u201d </em>Jeff Dense, <em>The Socioeconomic Impact of Gaming in the Virgin Islands, </em>8 Gaming L.Rev. 175, 176-77 (2004) (emphasis added). Thus, a device is no less a slot machine because it operates within a <em>network, </em>that is, because it shares computer-processing equipment with a number of similar devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">In that connection, Innovative states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">\u201cBy [constructing its system so that] winning and losing entries [would be determined] <em>before the card is handed to the person </em>and by not charging any consideration for the entries themselves, Innovative designed the [MegaSweeps] so that [the] required statutory element[s] of \u2018gambling device\u2019 \u2014 something staked \u2018upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent <em>event\u2019 </em>\u2014 would <em>be missing.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">Innovative\u2019s brief, at 12 (emphasis added). However, Barber and certain amici curiae argue that when a consumer obtains his or her card with the assigned MegaSweeps entries, <em>\u201cchance occurs at [that] point of sale.\u201d </em>The Foundation\u2019s brief, at 7 (emphasis added). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">It is axiomatic that one may not lawfully do indirectly what is unlawful to be done directly. It is uncontroverted that at least some of the readers had been adapted for such use from their former function as stand-alone, or mechanical, slot machines. The adaptation was described by Robert Sertell, Sheriff Hale\u2019s expert witness, in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, did you see any [of the] readers on [January 4, 2006, that were seized by the sheriff in December]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApx\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u201cA. [By Sertell]. There was one, sir, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cQ. Did you take it apart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cQ. And what did you see in it that was anything of note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">A. The cabinet had a Bally Manufacturing name plate on the side. <em>[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>The <em>internals of the cabinet had been removed and replaced with what was apparently a computer or a personal computer unit. </em>There was provision inside for the bill-acceptor mechanism to be replaced if necessary. It was missing when I saw it. <em>There was, indeed, the traditional cash box still in place. </em>There was a ticket printer validator loaded still in place, that could have received and/or issued bar-coded tickets. That magazine was full. There was, I believe, a power supply in the cabinet and that is about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Significantly, the statutory definition of a slot machine includes any device that is \u201cconstructed or <em>readily adaptable or convertible to such use,\u201d </em>regardless of whether it is \u201cin working order or <em>[whether] some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability.\u201d </em>\u00a7 13A-12-20(10) (emphasis added). Just as the readers were adapted to function within the computerized MegaSweeps network, they could be retooled to operate as they were originally designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">In this case, the element of chance is satisfied at the point of sale \u2014 -before the readers are activated \u2014 by the same central database and other computer equipment that serve to operate the readers. It is immaterial that the readers do not, themselves, assign values to the entries. In short, the element of chance is as much a feature of the MegaSweeps network system as of a stand-alone slot machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">\n<em>3. Consideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">Barber contends that the trial court erred in holding that the element of consideration was absent in the operation of the MegaSweeps system. Arguing to the contrary, the owners first insist that the only consideration paid by consumers is not for MegaSweeps entries, but for <em>cyber-time, </em>which is sold at <em>fair market value. </em>The owners\u2019 argument, however, ignores the last sentence of \u00a7 13A-12-20(10): \u201cNor is it any less a slot machine because apart from its use or adaptability as such <em>it may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">This portion of the statute deals with the recurring attempts by gaming interests to invest slot machines with legitimacy as ordinary vending machines. See, e.g., <em>Higdon v. McDuff, </em>233 Ala. 497, 172 So. 636 (1937); <em>Skates v. Hartsfield, </em>216 Ala. 618, 114 So. 10 (1927); <em>Cagle v. State, </em>18 Ala.App. 553, 93 So. 206 (1922) (machine yielding either chewing gum or nickels upon the deposit of a nickel was an illegal slot machine); and <em>Painter v. State, </em>163 Tenn. 627, 45 S.W.2d 46 (1932). \u201cSlot machines were invented that dispensed al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>most worthless mints with every nickel played so the operator could say that the customer always received something for his money.\u201d Rose, <em>Gambling and the Law </em>89. \u201cThe early courts were split on whether this converted the slot machine into a legitimate vending machine, <em>until it was pointed out that players continued to put in their nickels long after the mints had run out.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Consequently, the statute impels us to inquire beyond the fact that the consumer always receives something for his money. It requires us to consider the substance of the transaction, rather than its form.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Doing so accords with the general rule that \u201ca slot machine which, in return for a coin deposited therein, dispenses merchandise represented to be of the value of such coin, accompanied at occasional and uncertain intervals by a varying amount of money ..., or more broadly, one which provides an element of chance, is a gambling device.\u201d 38 Am.Jur.2d <em>Gambling </em>\u00a7 104 (1999). Thus, \u201c[w]here the return to the player is ... dependent on an element of chance, a slot machine is a gambling device, <em>even though the player is assured of his money\u2019s worth of some commodity and hence cannot lose.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Such inquiry is also consistent with Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 8-1-150 (\u201cAll contracts founded in whole <em>or in part </em>on a gambling consideration are void.\u201d), and with this Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018general disposition\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d in the gambling context to \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018regard! ] always the substance and not the semblance of things, <em>so as to prevent evasions of the law.\u2019\u201d\u2019\u201d Ex parte Ted\u2019s Game Enters., </em>893 So.2d 376, 380 (Ala.2004) (quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices No. 373, </em>795 So.2d 630, 640 (Ala.2001), quoting in turn <em>Opinion of the Justices No. 277, </em>397 So.2d 546, 547 (Ala.1981) (emphasis added in <em>Opinion No. </em>373)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">To be sure, MegaSweeps \u201cdelivers something of value,\u201d namely, cybertime, on the basis of something \u201cother than chance.\u201d Upon the tender of a minimum payment, consumers invariably receive four minutes of cybertime, in addition to 100 MegaSweeps entries. The owners contend that the consideration is paid <em>for the cybertime; </em>and, consequently, that the MegaSweeps entries are <em>free. </em>This argument does not pass statutory muster, however, if, looking through the form of the operation to its substance, consumers are <em>paying for the entries, in whole or in part, </em>regardless of the cybertime acquired in conjunction with those entries. See \u00a7 13A-12-20(11) <em>(\u201c[a]ny </em>money or property\u201d paid or received is consideration). In other words, if they are paying to play the readers, rather than to acquire, <em>or in addition to acquiring, </em>cybertime, the element of consideration set forth in \u00a7 13A-12-20(10) and (11) is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The evidence on this issue was undisputed or uncontroverted. The trial court found that \u201cfew customers were using the [Internet kiosks],\u201d but that customers \u201cwere lined up at all hours to use the readers.\u201d Also, the fact that the owners provided more than 11 times as many readers as Internet kiosks suggests an expectation that the readers would be the major attraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Indeed, consumers purchased additional cybertime \u2014 with the accompanying entries \u2014 even though they already had large quantities of unused cybertime on their accounts. The recharge kiosks, which allowed consumers to apply their \u201cwinnings toward additional cybertime purchases,\u201d facilitated those transactions. In fact, consumers who purchased cybertime were apprised <em>only of the number of entries </em>credited to their account, not the amount of cybertime, unless they used the recharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>kiosks or specifically asked MegaSweeps personnel about the cybertime.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The payout percentage is 92%. This percentage coincides with the industry standard for <em>casino-style slot machines, </em>which \u201ctypically pay back 90% to 98% of all money played, thus providing a hold for the house of 2% to 10%.\u201d Mark G. Tratos, <em>Gaming on the Internet, </em>3 Stan. J.L. Bus. &amp; Fin. 101, 111 (1997). By contrast, the typical payout percentage for a \u201ctemporary promotional sweepstakes\u201d is \u201cone half of one percent.\u201d <em>Midwestern Enters., Inc. v. Stenehjem, </em>625 N.W.2d 234, 240 (N.D.2001). Moreover, the duration of \u201cpromotional sweepstakes occasionally offered by fast food chains, or in connection with candy, sodas, miscellaneous food or other established retail products,\u201d is typically \u201climited,\u201d Tenn. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 02-089 n. 5 (August 21, 2002), as opposed to the duration of the MegaSweeps, which is <em>indefinite. </em>The payout percentage and duration of the operation are indicative of \u201cthe true purpose of the game.\u201d <em>Stenehjem, </em>625 N.W.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Indeed, the trial court found it \u201cobvious that most of the customers are more interested in getting [the] MegaSweeps entries than they are in using the [Internet kiosks].\u201d The court further found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai_\">\u201cthe [owners] undertook [the Mega-Sweeps] to <em>attract customers who wanted to gamble, or, at least, those who could be made to think that they were gambling. </em>[The owners\u2019] advertising through television commercials and billboards promoted playing [the] Mega-Sweeps <em>as an alternative to attending gambling establishments </em>at Greentrack, [Alabama,] or Philadelphia and Biloxi, Mississippi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">(Emphasis added.) These facts and findings refute the owners\u2019 argument that, because cybertime is sold at fair market value, the MegaSweeps operation falls outside the statutory definition of a slot machine. Clearly, a substantial number, if not the majority, of customers pay to play the readers, rather than to acquire, or in addition to acquiring, cybertime.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The owners next contend that there is no consideration for the entries, because minimum quantities may be obtained by mail or at the point of sale <em>without charge. </em>However, this Court has held that the availability of free chances is not necessarily dispositive of whether the game is a gambling scheme. <em>Grimes v. State, </em>235 Ala. 192, 178 So. 73 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\"><em>Grimes </em>involved a \u201cbank-night\u201d scheme \u2014 common during the depression era, Roger J. Traynor, <em>Quo Vadis, Prospective Overruling: A Question of Judicial Responsibility, </em>50 Hastings L.J. 771, 786 (1999) \u2014 -in which, in order \u201c[t]o promote business, theaters conducted drawings and made prizes available to patrons who bought tickets or, in some cases, to individuals who registered for the drawing but were <em>not required to buy a ticket.\u201d </em>Roland J. Santoni, <em>An Introduction to Nebraska Gaming Law, </em>29 Creighton L.Rev. 1123, 1131 (1996) (emphasis added). Consistent with this practice, the operators of the Ritz Theater in Tuscaloosa held a drawing each Thursday night for a cash prize. <em>Grimes v. State, </em>28 Ala.App. 4, 178 So. 69 (1937) (setting forth the underlying facts). \u201cA registration booth was maintained during all hours of each day of the week in the marquee of the theater, where registration cards could be signed\u201d by individuals wishing to participate in the drawing. 28 Ala.App. at 5, 178 So. at 69. Stubs of all such cards were placed in a \u201chopper\u201d and made up the pot from which each drawing was taken. 28 Ala.App. at 6, 178 So. at 70. <em>\u201c[N]o charge of any kind was made or any consideration exacted from any one, and the signing of such card was absolutely free, no one being </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>required to purchase a ticket of admission to register.\u201d </em>28 Ala.App. at 5, 178 So. at 69 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cIn addition to the original registration card, [however,] those patrons of the theater <em>who attended a [matinee] performance </em>of the theater prior to the hour of the drawing on the day of the drawing, viz., Thursday of each week, were permitted, if they so desired, to sign <em>an additional card </em>[\u2018the matinee card\u2019] other than the registration card....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">28 Ala.App. at 6, 178 So. at 70 (emphasis added). Prizes were awarded <em>only to persons who had signed the matinee card, </em>unless the person whose name was drawn was present on the premises and <em>stepped forward within two minutes </em>to claim his prize. 28 Ala.App. at 6, 178 So. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Cecil B. Grimes, as \u201ccity manager of the ... [Tuscaloosa] theaters,\u201d was \u201cconvicted of conducting a lottery.\u201d 28 Ala.App. at 5, 178 So. at 69. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and Grimes sought certiorari review, which this Court denied with a written opinion. 235 Ala. at 192, 178 So. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The only issue presented to this Court was whether the element of <em>consideration </em>was satisfied, where \u201ceverybody [could] register, and [could] participate in the drawing by being either in the theater, or on the outside, in position to appear and claim the prize within two minutes.\u201d 235 Ala. at 193, 178 So. at 74. The Court inquired: \u201cHow can it be said patrons ... have paid anything for a chance, if they have a like chance without paying?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Holding that the element was satisfied, however, the Court focused on the <em>recipient </em>of the consideration, that is, \u201c[was] there a consideration <em>moving to him?\" </em>235 Ala. at 193, 178 So. at 74. Thus, the Court reasoned that \u201cthe lure of bank night [was] the show, <em>and </em>the chance for a prize, as against the chance <em>without the show.\u201d </em>235 Ala. at 193-94, 178 So. at 74 (emphasis added). \u201c[L]ooking through form and dealing with reality,\u201d the Court recognized that \u201cthe plan [was] intended to fill the theater, not the lobby outside,\u201d and that \u201cthe success of the plan in swelling the patronage, and consequent income through the scheme of chance [was] the final proof of a consideration paid and a consideration received.\u201d 235 Ala. at 194, 178 So. at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Finally, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">\u201cThat the prize may go to some one who has paid nothing <em>does not negative the fact that many have paid </em>for their chance. <em>Because some have not been drawn into the gambling phase does not render it any the less a lottery, </em>with whatever of evil it engenders, <em>as to the large public who have paid.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">235 Ala. at 194, 178 So. at 74 (emphasis added). <em>Grimes </em>thus stands for the proposition that the opportunity for free plays does not a negate the element of consideration, or obviate an inquiry into the purpose and effect of the operation as \u201cthe final proof of ... consideration.\u201d See also <em>Clark v. State, </em>262 Ala. 462, 462, 80 So.2d 312, 312 (1955) (the purpose and effect of the operation is a factor in deciding whether \u201cconsideration [is] <em>moving to the operator </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">In support of their argument that the opportunity for free plays negates the element of consideration, the owners cite <em>Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Luverne v. Coca-Cola Bottling </em>Co., 534 So.2d 295 (Ala.1988) <em>(\u201cPepsi Cola </em>\u201d), a short, per cu-riam opinion holding that an \u201c \u2018Instant Cash\u2019 promotion,\u201d operated by Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Luverne, Inc. (\u201cPepsi\u201d), did not constitute a lottery. 534 So.2d at 296. The promotion \u201coffered a prize of $10,000 to someone presenting [bottle] caps containing all the letters\u201d spelling \u201c \u2018Pepsi In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>stant Cash.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor [that] campaign, Pepsi distributed 25,000 cards with a similar opportunity at participating stores and advertised via store displays and radio that no purchase was required to participate in the game. Cards could also be obtained by telephone request and by writing the bottling plant or production center in Columbus, Georgia.\u201d 534 So.2d at 296. In holding as it did, the Court did not discuss, overrule, or attempt to distinguish <em>Grimes. </em>It merely stated that \u201cthe \u2018Pepsi Instant Cash\u2019 game [was] not a lottery, because participants were not required to purchase cards in order to play.\u201d 534 So.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">We need not decide whether <em>Pepsi Cola </em>conflicts with <em>Grimes, </em>because it is distinguishable from <em>this </em>case in at least two important respects. First, unlike the sweepstakes in <em>Pepsi Cola, </em>MegaSweeps is a permanent, high-stakes game. \u201c[I]t does not follow that simply because low-stakes, temporary promotional sweepstakes with pay-out rates of one-half of one percent that offer free play are not pursued as lotteries, we must conclude high-stakes, permanent games with pay-out rates of [ninety-two] percent are immune from the definition of [gambling].... \u201d <em>Midwestern Enters., Inc. v. Stenehjem, </em>625 N.W.2d at 240 (\u201cLucky Strike\u201d machine, which dispensed a \u201ctwo-minute pre-paid phone card\u201d in addition to a \u201cgame piece giving the buyer a chance to win up to $500 in cash,\u201d having a payout percentage of 65%, was an illegal gambling device, despite a limited opportunity to play the machine for free). Second \u2014 and more fundamentally\u2014 <em>Pepsi Cola, </em>unlike this case, did not involve the use of an alleged gambling <em>device. </em>The facts in <em>Pepsi Cola </em>did not require, or invite, an analysis of \u00a7 13A-12-27 and \u00a7 13A-12-20(10) and (11). In particular, there was no allegation, like the one here, that the game involved the use of a slot machine. Thus, <em>Pepsi Cola </em>is inap-posite.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">We think \u201cCharles Fey, [inventor of the slot machine,] if he were alive today, would recognize [the accessorized MegaSweeps readers] as refinements of his invention.\u201d Rose, at 83. Innovative conceded that it constructed its system \u201cso that [the] required statutory elements] of [a] \u2018gambling device\u2019 \u2014 something staked \u2018upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent <em>event\u2019 </em>\u2014 would <em>be missing.\u201d </em>Innovative\u2019s brief, at 12 (emphasis added). The flaw in Innovative\u2019s approach is that the elements are not \u201cmissing\u201d from the mechanics of the scheme. They are simply <em>dispersed </em>throughout the various units and processes of the integrated network.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The owners propose that they have found, and exploited, a \u201cloophole\u201d in the law. Indeed, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cThe evidence convinces the court that <em>through careful planning the [owners] have found a loophole in the patchwork of Alabama\u2019s anti-gambling laws and they have taken advantage of that loophole. </em>In the words of the Sheriffs expert witness, Robert Sertell, the [owners\u2019] sweepstakes promotion was \u2018trying to pull a tractor-trailer through a loophole.\u2019 This court agrees that the [owners] have taken advantage of weaknesses in the law....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">(Emphasis added.) Alabama\u2019s gambling law, however, is not so easily evaded. It is \u201c \u2018the policy of the constitution and laws of Alabama [to prohibit] the vicious system of lottery schemes and the evil practice of gaming, in <em>all their protean shapes.\u2019\u201d Opinion of the Justices No. 83, </em>249 Ala. 516, 517, 31 So.2d 753, 754 (1947) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>83 Ala. 65, 67, 3 So. 790, 791 (1887) (emphasis added)). In the computer age, the fact that <em>chance </em>takes place at the point of sale rather than at the readers themselves is simply inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Thus, the readers are slot machines <em>as to those who pay to play them. </em>Are they any less so because a few patrons play for free? We think not. \u201cBecause some have not been drawn into the gambling phase does not render it any the less [a slot machine], with whatever of evil it engenders, as to the large public who <em>have </em>paid.\u201d <em>Grimes, </em>235 Ala. at 194, 178 So. at 74 (emphasis added). Gratuitous entries obtained by mail or at the race track do not legitimize the high-stakes MegaSweeps any more than some opportunity for free plays could render innocuous a conventional slot machine. The trial court\u2019s contrary holding was, therefore, error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">\n<em>C. Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The JCRA challenges the statutory definition of gambling as unconstitutional as applied to this particular case. Because the trial court held in favor of the owners on their substantive claims, it did not address the JCRA\u2019s constitutional arguments. More specifically, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cThe [owners] have ... argued that the relevant statutes, Ala.Code (1975) Section 13A-12-20 <em>et seq., </em>are unconstitutional as applied to this case because of vagueness.... The argument may have merit, but because of the conclusion reached by the court that the plaintiffs\u2019 promotional scheme is lawful, the constitutional issue need not be addressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Because we disagree with the trial court as to the legality of the MegaSweeps operation, the constitutional issue is squarely before us, and we address JCRA\u2019s vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">\u201cIn reviewing the constitutionality of a statute, we \u2018approach the question with every presumption and intendment in favor of its validity, and seek to sustain rather than strike down the enactment of a coordinate branch of the government.\u2019\u201d <em>Moore v. Mobile Infirmary Ass\u2019n, </em>592 So.2d 156, 159 (1991) (quoting <em>Alabama State Fed\u2019n of Labor v. McAdory, </em>246 Ala. 1, 9, 18 So.2d 810, 815 (1944)). Overcoming that presumption is a heavy burden, which is borne by the party challenging the validity of the statute. <em>Densmore v. Jefferson County, </em>813 So.2d 844, 856 (Ala.2001); <em>Jefferson County Bd. of Health v. City of Bessemer, </em>293 Ala. 237, 301 So.2d 551 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The JCRA specifically challenges only \u00a7 13A-12-20(4), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">\u201cA person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks <em>something of value </em>[consideration] upon the outcome of a contest of <em>chance </em>or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">(Emphasis added.) The essence of the JCRA\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is that if this Court holds that the elements of <em>chance </em>and <em>consideration </em>are present in the MegaSweeps system, those terms are unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">\u201cVagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>City of Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 56, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999). However, \u201c \u2018[m]ere difficulty of ascertaining its meaning or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>fact that it is susceptible of different interpretations will not render a statute ... too vague or uncertain to be enforced.\u2019\u201d <em>Scott &amp; Scott, Inc. v. City of Mountain Brook, </em>844 So.2d 577, 589 (Ala.2002) (quoting <em>City of Birmingham v. Samford, </em>274 Ala. 367, 372, 149 So.2d 271, 275 (1963)). \u201c[F]ew words possess the precision of mathematical symbols, most statutes must deal with untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations, and the practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions.\u201d <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 340, 72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367 (1952). \u201cConsequently, no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded. Nor is it unfair to require that <em>one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.\u201d Id. </em>(footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Moreover, \u201c[a] statute is not vague when the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the <em>common law, dictionaries, </em>treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a <em>common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 125, 389 A.2d 341, 347 (1978) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The JCRA does not allege that the meanings of the words \u201cchance\u201d and \u201cconsideration\u201d are mysterious or new. Actually, \u201c[g]ambling is as old as man, and certainly as old as the common law.\u201d Rose, at 75. The elements of gambling under \u00a7 13A-12-20(4) are the same as those at <em>common law, </em>namely, the payment of (1) consideration, for the (2) chance to win (3) a prize. See <em>Grimes v. State, </em>235 Ala. at 193, 178 So. at 74; Kyle D. Craddock, <em>The Cardstock Chase, Trading Cards: A Legal Lottery? </em>8 Gaming L.Rev. 310, 314 (2004) (the \u201cthree basic [common-law] elements of gambling [are] consideration, chance, and prize\u201d). Thus, the meanings of the words \u201cchance\u201d and \u201cconsideration\u201d are easily apprehended by reference to \u201cjudicial determinations [and] the common law,\u201d at which they \u201cpossess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d at 347. Moreover, the element of consideration in the specific context of this case is meticulously defined in \u00a7 13A-12-20(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In that connection, the amicus curiae brief filed by the Attorney General contends that there is no \u201cvagueness,\u201d and \u201cno confusion about what the law requires,\u201d the only issue being one of fact, that is, how the MegaSweeps functions. Brief of Attorney General, at 10. Indeed, this case turns not so much on the <em>definitions </em>of \u201cchance\u201d and \u201cconsideration\u201d as on their applications to the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In the final analysis, Innovative created a system composed of what were formerly slot machines, which look like, sound like, and attract the same class of customers as conventional slot machines, and, when integrated with the servers, serve essentially the same function as did the slot machines. In a carefully planned venture, Innovative transferred the element of chance from the readers to a server, merged the Mega-Sweeps entries with cybertime, and staked the success of its venture on the legal efficacy of the transfer and merger. The owners have identified neither statutory law nor caselaw suggesting that such displacement and merger are legally significant. Having \u201ctake[n] the risk that\u201d their venture \u201cmay cross the line,\u201d it is not \u201cunfair to require\u201d that the owners bear the consequences of failure. Consequently, the JCRA has not demonstrated that the statutory scheme is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">\n<em>III. Case No. 1050625</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Our resolution of the issues in case no. 1050857 necessarily resolves the issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>case no. 1050625. Therefore, the appeal in case no. 1050625 is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\n<em>IV. Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In summary, the trial court erred in focusing on the function of the Mega-Sweeps readers in isolation. When integrated as they are with the servers, central database, and related computer equipment, the readers are slot machines as that term is defined by \u00a7 13A-12-20(10) and \u00a7 13A-12-27. Moreover, \u00a7 13A-12-20 is not unconstitutionally vague. For these reasons, the judgment in favor of the owners is reversed and a judgment is rendered in favor of Barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">1050625 \u2014 APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">1050857 \u2014 REVERSED AND JUDGMENT RENDERED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-9\">SEE, LYONS, HARWOOD, STUART, SMITH, BOLIN, and PARKER, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">STUART, SMITH, and BOLIN, JJ,, file statements of nonrecusal.</p>\n<author id=\"b639-11\">STUART, Justice</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_M\">(statement of nonrecusal).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Jefferson County Racing Association, Inc., d/b/a the Birmingham Race Course (hereinafter referred to as \u201cJCRA\u201d), has moved for my recusal in these appeals. In its motion the JCRA alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">\u201c1.

Justice Stuart has taken a political and ethical posture against gambling, has made her views public and has made her anti-gambling position a basis of why she should be re-elected a Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. This stance is indicative of a bias that could squarely impact the parties, interests, and issues in these appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">\u201c7. ...

Justice Stuart must disqualify/recuse herself from the above-styled cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">Innovative Sweepstakes Systems, Inc., has also moved for my recusal in these appeals on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">Canon 3.C., Ala. Canons of Jud. Ethics, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-22\">\u201c(1) A judge should disqualify [her] self in a proceeding in which [her] disqualification is required by law or [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201c(a) [She] has <em>a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party .... \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADAS\">Judges are required to make decisions based on the application of the law to the facts, despite their personal opinions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\">\u201cA judge\u2019s views on matters of law and policy ordinarily are not legitimate grounds for recusal, even if such views are strongly held. <em>See </em>Richard E.

After all, judges commonly come to a case with personal views on the underlying subject matter .... Far from necessarily warranting recusal, typically such views merely mark an active mind.

White, </em>536 U.S. 765, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694 (2002), the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue whether a judicial candidate\u2019s First Amendment rights were violated by a canon of the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct that prohibited him from announcing his views on disputed legal or political issues. The Supreme Court held that this prohibition, known as the \u201cannounce clause,\u201d did violate the First Amendment rights of judicial candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Thus, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a judicial candidate\u2019s First Amendment rights permit the candidate either to announce or discuss or to refuse to announce or discuss personal views on an issue such as gambling. Each individual candidate is therefore constitutionally permitted to express his or her views in a manner that allows those views to be disseminated to the citizenry \u2014 in this case, answers in response to specific questions on a questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\"><em>White </em>teaches that judicial candidates may respond to questions such as those that were asked in the 2004 Christian Coalition voter guide. I note that the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission, following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s release of <em>White, </em>withdrew an advisory opinion in which it had opined that a judicial candidate would be violating the Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics if the candidate answered certain questions on a questionnaire issued by the Christian Coalition in anticipation of the 2000 elections. See <em>Christian Coalition of Alabama v. Cole, </em>355 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2004). The withdrawal of this advisory opinion was in keeping with <em>White </em>and reflected the Judicial Inquiry Commission\u2019s view that answers to questions such as those in the Christian Coalition questionnaire were permissible free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">The question then arises as to whether answering such questions would violate Canon 3.C.(1), Ala. Canons of Jud. Ethics, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">\u201c(1) A judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his disqualification is required by law or his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201c(a) He has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As8t\">In this proceeding, I have no knowledge whatsoever of any disputed evidentiary facts not disclosed in the record nor any bias or prejudice either for or against any party, and there were no allegations in the recusal motion that I had such knowledge or bias. The only remaining issue is whether there is anything else by which my \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">All judges are presumed to be qualified and unbiased. <em>Gary v. Crouch, </em>867 So.2d 310 (Ala.2003). The burden of proof is on the party making a motion to disqualify or recuse to establish that the judge whose disqualification or recusal is sought is biased or prejudiced against a party. <em>Ex parte Monsanto Co., </em>862 So.2d 595 (Ala.2003). In 2004, I expressed the view that I \u201coppose the establishment of gambling.\u201d My position on that issue is consistent with the law of Alabama; gambling is illegal in this State. I also oppose other acts that violate the laws of the State of Alabama, such as murder, rape, and robbery, but my personal opposition to the above acts does not prevent me from fairly and unbiasedly participating in cases involving such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The main opinion in this case strictly applies the law as it exists in the State of Alabama to the facts that are before the Court. The opinion contains no bias or prejudice in favor of or against gambling, and I brought no bias or prejudice to my participation in it. Furthermore, the mov-ants\u2019 position in the present case is that their activities <em>do not constitute gambling </em>but instead constitute a promotional sweepstakes. Therefore, there is an inherent inconsistency in the movants\u2019 argument that I should recuse myself from this case because I have indicated an opposition to the legal establishment of gambling and their argument on appeal that their enterprise is not gambling at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">After due consideration, I decline to re-cuse myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">STUART and SMITH, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-19\">.
