CARNEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">In this appeal, we consider the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1325, 179 L.Ed.2d 379 (2011), on our 1993 decision in <em>Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, </em>10 F.3d 46 (2d Cir.1993), concerning what constitutes \u201cfil[ing a] complaint\u201d under the anti-retaliation provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">Section 215(a)(3) makes it unlawful \u201cto discharge or in any other manner , discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint ... related to\u201d FLSA\u2019s provisions. In <em>Lambert, </em>we read section 215(a)(3) to require that an employee pursuing a claim for unlawful retaliation have done more than voice an equal pay complaint to a supervisor. 10 F.3d at 55-56. To serve as a predicate for an FLSA retaliation claim, we held, a complaint must be \u201cformally]\u201d filed, <em>see id. </em>\u2014 a condition that we have subsequently interpreted to require (1) a written complaint, that is (2) filed with a government agency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">In its 2011 decision in <em>Kasten, </em>however, the Supreme Court held that the section\u2019s pivotal phrase \u2014 \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d \u2014 encompasses oral as well as written corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>plaints, so long as the complaint is \u201csufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1335. To the extent, then, that <em>Lambert </em>turned on the oral nature of the complaint made by the employee, <em>Kasten </em>rejected <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>analysis. The <em>Kasten </em>Court refrained, however, from addressing the second factor on which the <em>Lambert </em>analysis hinged: that the complaint must be directed to a government agency, not merely to a supervisor in the ranks of the defendant employer. <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1336. Although <em>Kasten </em>itself arose in the context of an oral complaint made to an employer, not a government agency, the <em>Kasten </em>Court declined to address specifically whether retaliation for a complaint made to an employer is actionable. <em>See id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>Kasten </em>overrules Lambert\u2019s requirement that an employee seeking section 215(a)(3)\u2019s protections file a written complaint. As we discuss below, <em>Kasten </em>also casts doubt on Lambert\u2019s second requirement: that, for an employee\u2019s complaint to fall within the protections of section 215(a)(3), it be made to a government agency. Indeed, we not long ago characterized <em>Kasten </em>(albeit in a footnote) as effecting an \u201cabrogation of our precedent in this area.\u201d <em>Kuebel v. Black &amp; Decker Inc., </em>643 F.3d 352, 358 n.3 (2d Cir.2011). <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>holding in this respect is at odds, moreover, with the weight of authority in our sister circuits, and with the consistently held position of the two authorities charged with section 215(a)(3)\u2019s enforcement: the Secretary of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Therefore, today, we overrule <em>Lambert </em>to the extent it holds that section 215(a)(3) requires an employee to have filed a complaint with a government agency as a predicate for an FLSA retaliation claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that an employee may premise a section 215(a)(3) retaliation action on an oral complaint made to an employer, so long as \u2014 pursuant to <em>Kasten </em>\u2014 the complaint is \u201csufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1335. Accordingly, because the District Court denied Greathouse damages on his claim for retaliatory discharge based entirely on <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>rule, we vacate the judgment insofar as it relied on <em>Lambert </em>and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">We recite the facts as found by the Magistrate Judge in a report and recommendation that was adopted by the District Court. <em>See Greathouse v. JHS Sec., Inc., </em>No. 11 Civ. 7845(PAE)(GWG), 2012 WL 3871523 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2012), <em>adopted by </em>2012 WL 5185591 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2012). Because both defendants defaulted, the Magistrate Judge properly accepted as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of Greathouse\u2019s complaint regarding liability, and provided for further proceedings to determine the appropriate damage award. <em>See SEC v. Razmilovic, </em>738 F.3d 14, 19 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>From September 2006 through October 14, 2011, plaintiff Darnell Greathouse worked as a security guard for defendant JHS Security Inc. (\u201cJHS\u201d). Greathouse considered defendant Melvin Wilcox, the president and part-owner of JHS, to be his \u201cboss.\u201d <em>Greathouse, </em>2012 WL 3871523, at *2. During the course of his employment with JHS, Greathouse was the victim of a number of improper employment practices, including non-payment and late payment of wages, and improper payroll deductions. Although Wilcox repeatedly told Great-house that he would receive his outstanding paychecks, those checks never arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">On October 14, 2011, Greathouse complained to Wilcox that he had not been paid in several months. Wilcox responded, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you when I feel like it,\u201d and, without warning, drew a gun and pointed it at Greathouse. <em>Greathouse, </em>2012 WL 3871523, at *2. Greathouse understood that response as ending his employment with JHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">About two weeks later, Greathouse filed his complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In addition to various FLSA and New York Labor Law (\u201cNYLL\u201d) claims related to his missing and improperly reduced wages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he alleged that Wilcox and JHS (through Wilcox) had effectively discharged him in retaliation for his October 14th complaint, thereby violating section 215(a)(3) and the NYLL.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Several months later, after neither defendant appeared or filed an answer, the clerk of court entered defaults against both. The District Court then referred the matter to a magistrate judge to evaluate Greathouse\u2019s claims for damages. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation in September 2012, recommending that the District Court enter a damages award in the total amount of $30,658.50, plus prejudgment interest, for Greathouse\u2019s claims for unpaid overtime, unpaid wages, improper deductions, and liquidated damages under the NYLL. <em>Greathouse, </em>2012 WL 3871523, at *12.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">As to the retaliation claim, however, the Magistrate Judge concluded that <em>Lambert </em>barred an award because Greathouse had not filed a complaint with any government agency or other prosecutorial authority, but had merely confronted his employer in person to demand his missing wages. The Magistrate Judge recognized that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kasten, </em>an oral complaint may serve as a predicate for an FLSA retaliation claim. The Magistrate Judge correctly acknowledged, however, that <em>Kasten </em>did not overturn <em>Lambert </em>insofar as we held there that a complaint made <em>to a supervisor </em>is not a complaint \u201cfiled\u201d under section 215(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Greathouse filed objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report in the District Court, contesting, <em>inter alia, </em>the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that Greathouse was not entitled to damages for his FLSA retaliation claim. The District Court rejected Greathouse\u2019s objection on this issue, agreeing with the Magistrate Judge about the continued import of <em>Lambert. </em>The District Court subsequently adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusions, subject only to two minor exceptions not relevant here, and the District Court entered default judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>On appeal, Greathouse argues primarily that, in light of <em>Kasten, </em>we should overrule what remains of <em>Lambert </em>and squarely hold that FLSA prohibits retaliation against employees who complain orally to their employers about perceived FLSA violations. Because defendants defaulted in the District Court and never filed an appearance in this Court, we appointed <em>pro bono </em>counsel to argue, as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of defendants, that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kasten </em>did not abrogate our holding in <em>Lambert </em>and that the <em>Lambert </em>rule with respect to intra-company complaints should survive. The two administrative authorities charged with administering FLSA \u2014 the EEOC and the Secretary of Labor \u2014 filed <em>amicus </em>briefs in support of Greathouse\u2019s position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Section 215(a)(3) forbids \u201cany person\u201d from \u201cdischarg[ing] or in any other manner diseriminat[ing] against any employee because such employee has <em>filed any complaint </em>or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter.... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3) (emphasis added). As described above, the Supreme Court held in <em>Kasten </em>that FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \u201cincludes oral as well as written complaints.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1329. The Court overruled <em>Lambert </em>and our precedent following <em>Lambert </em>to the extent that <em>Lambert </em>required an employee to have filed a written complaint to claim FLSA\u2019s protections. <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (citing <em>Lambert </em>as a contrary decision). But the <em>Kasten </em>Court expressly declined to address the question whether an employer\u2019s retaliation for an intra-company complaint is actionable under FLSA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">It is difficult to ignore, however, that the complaint at issue in <em>Kasten </em>was lodged not with a government agency, but with an employer. <em>See id. </em>at 1340-41 (Scalia, <em>J., </em>dissenting). Although slightly different concerns animated the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Kasten, </em>an interpretation that excludes clearly stated complaints from protection because they were made to the employer instead of a government agency would run counter to the broadly remedial purpose that the <em>Kasten </em>Court instructed FLSA serves. <em>See id. </em>at 1334. So, although we recognize that the Court has not yet ruled on this precise question, we conclude that its ruling in <em>Kasten </em>must be read as casting serious doubt on the second component of our ruling in <em>Lambert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">A. <em>Our Holding in </em>Lambert</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">In <em>Lambert, </em>three female employees alleged that their employer, Genesee Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d), retaliated against them in violation of the Equal Pay Act'of 1963 (\u201cEPA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), a statute that amended FLSA. 10 F.3d at 50. Two of the plaintiffs, Janine Lambert and Eva Baker, alleged that they complained to their departmental supervisor and to a member of the Hospital\u2019s employee-affairs department about Baker\u2019s salary, which in their view was unfairly lower than that of a male employee in the department (Francis Dupre), whose responsibilities were substantially equivalent to Baker\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">About one year after Lambert and Baker complained, the supervisor selected Dupre to manage the department. <em>Id. </em>Citing that incident and others, Lambert, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Baker, and one of their female colleagues sued the Hospital, their supervisor, and Dupre, alleging that Dupre\u2019s promotion over Baker was made in retaliation for Lambert and Baker\u2019s complaints to their supervisor about Baker\u2019s unequal pay. <em>Id. </em>This, they contended, violated the EPA and section 215(a)(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The district court assumed that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations stated a retaliation claim under section 215(a)(3), <em>Lambert, </em>10 F.3d at 56, and the case proceeded to trial, where a jury found for plaintiffs on them retaliation claim as well as on their equal pay claim, <em>id. </em>at 51-52. After trial, however, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 52. Plaintiffs appealed the resulting dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On appeal, we held that the district court erred in granting judgment to defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 retaliation claim because defendants had waived their legal argument. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Nonetheless, we dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 section 215(a)(3) claim, on our own accord, for failure to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 56. We determined that the plain language of section 215(a)(3) \u2014 to \u201cfile[ ] any complaint\u201d \u2014 \u201climits the cause of action to retaliation for filing formal complaints, instituting a proceeding, or testifying, but does not encompass complaints made to a supervisor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. Because plaintiffs premised their claim on \u201csimply oral complaints to a supervisor,\u201d they had not stated a claim for retaliation under section 215(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The <em>Lambert </em>court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that an employee pursuing a claim for unlawful retaliation must do more than voice an equal pay complaint to a supervisor to invoke section 215(a)(3)\u2019s protections \u2014 is contrary to the weight of authority in our sister circuits, even more so now than when <em>Lambert </em>was decided. Indeed, the First, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have all held that section 215(a)(3) protects employees from retaliation for their complaints made to employers, and the Sixth Circuit has assumed, without significant discussion, that complaints to an employer are covered by section 215(a)(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>EEOC has long maintained the position that the Act protects employees who make such intra-company complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">B. <em>The Supreme Court\u2019s Holding in </em>Kasten</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Nearly two decades after <em>Lambert </em>was decided, after these developments in other circuits and application of <em>Lambert </em>within our own, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Kasten </em>to resolve a \u201cconflict among the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected\u201d by section 215(a)(3). 131 S.Ct. at 1330. The question there arose from an employee\u2019s oral complaints to his shift supervisor and to other employees that their employer was violating FLSA by failing to compensate them for time spent donning and doffing their work-related protective g,ear. <em>.Id. </em>at 1329-30. The Seventh - Circuit had affirmed summary judgment for the employer, ruling that FLSA does not protect oral complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Deciding that the statutory phrase \u201cfiled any complaint,\u201d read in isolation, is \u201copen to competing interpretations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1330-31, the Supreme Court looked to FLSA\u2019s basic objectives for interpretive guidance. It also examined the range of meanings that the words \u201cfiled\u201d and \u201ccomplaint\u201d and the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d could bear and gave \u201ca degree of weight\u201d to the views of the agencies charged with enforcing FLSA \u2014 the Department of Labor and the EEOC, which argued for a broad reading of the section, one protective of employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The Court concluded that \u201conly one interpretation is permissible\u201d: an oral complaint is protected by FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision if the complaint is \u201csufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331, 1335. Despite framing the inquiry by reference to what a \u201creasonable <em>employer\u201d </em>would understand, <em>id. </em>at 1335 (emphasis added), the Court nevertheless expressly declined to address the logically prior question whether FLSA applies, in the first instance, to complaints made directly to employers, rather than to government agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 1336. It is to that question that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">C. <em>Looking Anew at the Statutory Language: \u201cFiled Any Complaint\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">Both impelled and guided by <em>Kasten, </em>we now look anew at the statutory interpretation question that we addressed of our own accord in <em>Lambert, </em>but that the <em>Kasten </em>Court did not resolve: does section 215(a)(3) prohibit retaliation against employees for oral complaints made to employers?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">1. The phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d admits of more than one meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">A statute generally \u201cshould be enforced according to its plain and unambiguous meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Livecchi, </em>711 F.3d 345, 351 (2d Cir.2013). The \u201cplainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). If we determine that a statutory provision is ambiguous, we then turn to canons of statutory construction for assistance in interpreting the statute. <em>See Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., </em>428 F.3d 408, 423 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">In <em>Lambert, </em>we determined that the plain language of section 215(a)(3) prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ited only \u201cretaliation for filing <em>formal </em>complaints, instituting a proceeding, or testifying.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>10 F.3d at 55 (emphasis added). But when we look again at section 215(a)(3), with the benefit of <em>Kasten </em>and the readings of our sister circuits, we now conclude that the statutory language is not as plain and unambiguous as it seemed when <em>Lambert </em>was decided. <em>See Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1330-31 (stating that section 215(a)(3) \u201cmay be open to competing interpretations\u201d). As the Supreme Court explained, \u201ceven if the word \u2018filed,\u2019 considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings, the phrase <em>\u2018any </em>complaint\u2019 suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Guided by this discussion, we must reevaluate the distinction drawn in <em>Lambert </em>and its progeny between \u201cformal\u201d complaints to government agencies and \u201cinformal\u201d complaints to supervisors. First, we observe that the text of the statute does not provide that a complaint must be filed \u201cformally,\u201d or exclude from its protections those complaints that are filed \u201cinformally.\u201d In short: it does not use either word. N\u00f3r does it expressly direct that, to be protected, a complaint must be filed with a government agency or any particular entity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, even if the word \u201cfiled,\u201d considered alone, might seem to contemplate lodging a complaint with a governmental body, the word\u2019s context counsels against a narrow reading: as the Supreme Court reasoned, the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>complaint\u201d suggests an expansive reading, one that could include complaints filed with or expressed to an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Citing Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent in <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1337 (Scalia, J., dissenting), <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of defendants argues that, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d clearly and unambiguously refers <em>only </em>to complaints made to government agencies, because every other use of the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d in FLSA refers to a governmental filing. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (explaining that the right to bring certain actions \u201cshall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 216(c) (explaining that the statute of limitations for an action for unpaid wages commences \u201con the date when the complaint is filed\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 218c(b) (setting forth the \u201cComplaint procedure\u201d by which one may \u201cseek relief\u2019 by filing a complaint with the Department of Labor). <em>Amicus </em>also contends that the phrase \u201cfilling a] complaint\u201d is not commonly used to describe the act of complaining to an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">But, as our sister circuits have recognized, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d may also plausibly be interpreted to include intr\u00e1-company complaints. The accepted definition of \u201cto file,\u201d as the First Circuit has noted, may include an employee\u2019s submission of a written letter of complaint to an employer: the concept is \u201csufficiently elastic to encompass an internal complaint made to a private employer with the expectation the employer will place it on file among the employer\u2019s official records.\u201d <em>Valerio v. Putnam Assocs. Inc., </em>173 F.3d 35, 41-42 (1st Cir.1999) (Campbell, <em>J.).</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, filing work-related griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>anees with employers is a common practice in many workplaces. <em>See, e.g., Lambert v. Ackerley, </em>180 F.3d 997, 1004 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (noting that \u201cany complaint\u201d is clearly broad enough to encompass complaints made to employers, and highlighting the widespread practice of \u201cfiling\u201d grievances and complaints with unions and employers before commencing other internal or external proceedings). In addition, \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d must be examined in context, contrasting it with the neighboring phrase, \u201cinstituted any proceeding\u201d: to avoid rendering one or the other surplus-age, we may construe the first to contemplate a communication (such as an intracompany complaint seeking a change in company practice) that does not ordinarily trigger a \u201cproceeding\u201d (such as an adjudicatory process).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In light of these competing interpretations, we conclude that the statutory phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d is variable in meaning and does not unambiguously denote submission of complaints to government agencies alone. To interpret the language of the statute, then, we must apply traditional tools of statutory interpretation. These include looking to the purpose of FLSA, and affording some degree of weight to the interpretations of the agencies charged with enforcing it. <em>See Minor v. Bostwick Labs., Inc., </em>669 F.3d 428, 436 (4th Cir.2012) (concluding that \u201c \u2018filed any complaint\u2019 is ambiguous as to whether intracompany complaints are protected activity under the FLSA,\u201d and \u201cmov[ing] to other interpretive tools\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">2. Statutory purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Congress declared its intention in FLSA \u201cto correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate\u201d labor conditions \u201cdetrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers,\u201d without substantially reducing employment or earning power. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202. To achieve this goal, FLSA sets forth minimum wage standards, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 206, and establishes certain payroll practice requirements, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 207, 211(c), among other mandates. Because the government cannot directly monitor every employer\u2019s payroll, FLSA also creates an enforcement mechanism that relies in significant part on employees\u2019 complaints. <em>See Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., </em>361 U.S. 288, 292, 80 S.Ct. 332, 4 L.Ed.2d 323 (1960). Congress enacted section 215(a)(3) to \u201cprevent[ ] fear of economic retaliation from inducing workers quietly to accept substandard conditions,\u201d <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1333 (internal quotation marks omitted), and to foster an atmosphere protective of employees who lodge such complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">We have repeatedly affirmed that \u201cthe remedial nature of the FLSA warrants an expansive interpretation of its provisions so that they will have the widest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>possible impact in the national economy.\u201d <em>Irizarry v. Catsimatidis, </em>722 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>Carter v. Dutchess Cmty. Coll., </em>735 F.2d 8, 12 (2d Cir.1984) (same); <em>see also Zheng v. Liberty Apparel Co., </em>355 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir.2003) (recognizing the \u201cremedial purpose\u201d of FLSA). FLSA\u2019s remedial goals counsel in favor of construing the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d in section 215(a)(3) broadly, to include intra-company complaints to employers as well as complaints to government agencies. <em>See, e.g., Valerio, </em>173 F.3d at 43 (concluding that the \u201cremedial and humanitarian purposes of [FLSA] ... would hardly be furthered by a narrow reading of \u00a7 215(a)(3)\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Prohibiting retaliation against employees who make internal complaints furthers the purposes of FLSA by encouraging speedier and more efficient resolution of employee grievances, and resolving FLS\u00c1related issues before employees have lost significant wages or other benefits. As the Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Kasten, </em>limiting the protections of section 215(a)(3) to employees who make complaints to government agencies \u201cwould discourage the use of desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1334. Even before <em>Kasten, </em>the First Circuit opined that \u201c[b]y protecting only those employees who kept secret their belief that they were being illegally treated until they filed a legal proceeding,\u201d a narrow interpretation of FLSA \u201cwould discourage prior discussion of the matter between employee and employer, and'Would have the bizarre effect both of discouraging early settlement attempts and creating an incentive for the employer to fire an employee as soon as possible after learning the employee believed he was being treated illegally.\u201d <em>Valerio, </em>173 F.3d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The protective purpose of FLSA, recognized and acted on by the <em>Kasten </em>Court, counsels unmistakably in favor of adopting a reading of the statutory phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d that includes lodging an internal complaint with an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">3. Administrative interpretations</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">We next examine another factor relevant to our analysis: the views of the EEOC and the Secretary of Labor, as the authorities charged with enforcing FLSA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.... \u201d <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 227, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The weight appropriately afforded an agency interpretation that lacks the force of law\u2014 such as an agency manual or litigation document \u2014 depends upon \u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). In <em>Kasten, </em>the Supreme Court ascribed \u201ca degree of weight\u201d to the views of the EEOC and the Secretary, finding them \u201creasonable\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u201cconsistent with the Act,\u201d and explaining that \u201c[t]he length of time the agencies have held them suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not <em>\u2018post hoc </em>rationalization].\u201d\u2019 131 S.Ct. at 1335 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Since no later than 1998, the EEOC Compliance Manual \u2014 a document intended, among other things, to \u201cprovide[ ] guidance and instructions for investigating and analyzing claims of retaliation under the statutes enforced by the EEOC\u201d \u2014 has provided that employees are protected from retaliation \u201cif an individual explicitly or implicitly communicates to his or her employer or other covered entity a belief that its activity\u201d is unlawful.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 2 EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation \u00a7 8-II(B)(1) (May 20,1998).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The agencies\u2019 litigation positions on this question have also been consistent for decades. Both the Secretary and the EEOC have filed numerous briefs in the various Courts of Appeals maintaining that section 215(a)(3) prohibits retaliation against employees who complain to their employers about FLSA violations. <em>See Minor, </em>669 F.3d at 439 (noting that \u201calthough it is not determinative, because the Secretary and the EEOC have consistently advanced this reasonable and thoroughly considered position, it adds force to our conclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). We are advised that this litigation position dates back to at least 1989 for the EEOC and 1999 for the Secretary. <em>See </em>Brief for the EEOC as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>at 2; Brief for the Secretary of Labor as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">For the reasons relied on by the Supreme Court in <em>Fasten </em>as to the question of oral complaints, then, we find that the agencies\u2019 longstanding, consistent interpretation provides additional support for the view that to \u201cfile[ ] any complaint\u201d includes to submit a complaint to an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">D. <em>To \u201cFile[ ] Any Complaint\u201d Encompasses Intra-Company Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that section 215(a)(3) does not restrict its protections to employees who file formal, written complaints with government agencies. Consistent with FLSA\u2019s text and remedial purpose, with the approach adopted in <em>Fasten, </em>and with Congressional design to encourage workers to report potential violations without fear of reprisal, we construe the phrase \u201cfile[ ] any complaint\u201d as encompassing oral complaints made to employers in a context that makes the assertion of rights plain. Our reading derives support from the provision\u2019s consistent, longstanding interpretation by the agencies charged with its enforcement. It brings us in harmony, too, with the decisions of the other Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Our reading is subject, however, to certain limitations. As observed in part by the <em>Fasten </em>Court, whether the \u201cfil[ing of a] complaint\u201d \u2014 especially an oral complaint delivered directly to an employer \u2014 constitutes an act protected by FLSA is a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>text-dependent inquiry. In some circumstances, an employer may find it difficult to recognize an oral complaint as one invoking rights protected by FLSA. It seems to us inconsistent with <em>Kasten </em>to elevate a grumble in the hallway about an employer\u2019s payroll practice to a complaint \u201cfiled\u201d with the employer within the meaning of section 215(a)(3). Indeed, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Kasten </em>that \u201cthe phrase \u2018filed any complaint\u2019 contemplates <em>some </em>degree of formality,\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1334 (emphasis added), but described the level of formality necessary in terms of the employer\u2019s interests in knowing when it need take care to avoid action that might be seen as retaliatory: \u201cwhere the recipient has been given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and does, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part of its business concerns,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Recognizing the potential for ambiguity in oral communications, yet desiring not to impair the enforcement framework adopted in the statute, the <em>Kasten </em>Court explained that \u201ca complaint is \u2018filed\u2019 [only] when a reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee to have put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting statutory rights under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The employee need not invoke the Act by name, but, as the Court concluded, \u201c[t]o fall within the scope of the anti-retaliation provision, a complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defining the exact contours of that standard is beyond the scope of this opinion, but it would, for example, exclude from the concept of \u201cfil[ing a] complaint\u201d a mere passing comment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This limitation, applied with the statute\u2019s remedial purpose in mind, informs and cabins our holding today.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We decline, however, to address here the question whether Greathouse\u2019s complaint provided an adequate basis on which to enter a default judgment against his employer on his retaliation claim. The decision whether to enter default judgment is committed to the district court\u2019s discretion, <em>see City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, </em>645 F.3d 114, 131 (2d Cir.2011), as is the decision whether to conduct a hearing before deciding the default judgment motion, <em>see Finkel v. Romanowicz, </em>577 F.3d 79, 87 (2d Cir.2009). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2) (\u201cThe court may conduct hearings or make referrals ... when, to enter or effectuate judgment, it needs to ... conduct an accounting; ... determine the amount of damages; ... establish the truth of any allegation by evidence; or ... investigate any other matter.\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cause to the District Court for a ruling in the first instance on Greathouse\u2019s default judgment motion with respect to his claim for unlawful retaliation under FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In sum, we overrule what is left of our holding in <em>Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, </em>10 F.3d 46 (2d Cir.1993), and conclude, in accordance with all of our sister circuits to have addressed the issue, that section 215(a)(3) prohibits retaliation against employees who orally complain to their employers, so long as their complaint is \u201csufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.\u201d <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1335. We therefore VACATE the District Court\u2019s judgment insofar as it relied on <em>Lambert, </em>and REMAND the cause to the District Court to determine, in the first instance, whether to grant Greathouse a default judgment on his retaliation claim under section 215(a)(3), and if so, what damages, if any, Greathouse is entitled to recover therefor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Al\">. <em>See, e.g., Nicolaou v.

This assumes that on remand, contrary to my understanding of <em>Hasten, </em>Greathouse would be entitled to recover damages if <em>Lambert </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>I agree that the district court erred by-denying an award of damages on the FLSA retaliation cause of action. I would hold that Greathouse is entitled to an award of damages in his favor pursuant to the anti-retaliation provision of the FLSA \u00a7 215(a)(3) and on his pendent NYLL \u00a7 215(2) claim. I reach this conclusion because the procedural posture of this case makes it inappropriate to do anything other than enter a default judgment on both causes of action after the failure of the defendants to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">I begin with a brief overview of the procedural history of the case. On March 15, 2012, the district judge ordered \u201cthat a default judgment be entered against [the] defendants ... with the amount of the judgment to be determined after an inquest before ... the magistrate 'judge.\u201d Default J. &amp; Inquest Order, <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec., Inc., </em>No. 11-cv-7845 (S.D.N.Y. March 15, 2012), ECF No. 15. On September 7, 2012, the magistrate judge issued a Report &amp; Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) that acknowledged that \u201c[b]ecause the default establishes defendants\u2019 liability ... the only remaining issue is whether plaintiffs [sic] have supplied adequate proof of \"their damages.\u201d R &amp; R, <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec., Inc., </em>No. 11-cv-7845 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2012) <em>(citing Bambu Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ozak Trading Inc., 58 </em>F.3d 849, 854 (2d Cir.1995)), ECF No. 26 at 2. Nevertheless, rather than address the issue of whether plaintiff had supplied adequate proof of his damages, he ignored the direction of the district judge, as well as the rule of law that he had previously cited, and went on to address the issue of whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Specifically, as relevant here, he found deficient the cause of action alleging that Greathouse was terminated because he had complained to his superior about the non-payment of wages. Relying on <em>Lambert, </em>he concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause Great-house does not allege that his termination was in response to the submission of a complaint to some relevant governmental or other prosecutorial authority, Great-house fails to state a claim for retaliation under the FLSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Consequently, he declined to recommend that damages be awarded on that claim, even though Greathouse presented evidence documenting the damages that he suffered as a result of the retaliatory termination. The magistrate judge did not address the plaintiffs NYLL anti-retaliation claim, which was not dependent on whether the employee\u2019s grievance was voiced to a judicial or administrative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Greathouse appealed to the district judge, who adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge that the allegations failed to state a claim under the FLSA. <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec. Inc., </em>No. 11 CIV. 7845(PAE)(GWG), 2012 WL 5185591, at <em>*5 </em>(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2012). Moreover, he rejected Greathouse\u2019s objection that he was entitled to a judgment under the NYLL retaliation statute because Great-house did not refer to that cause of action in the findings of fact and conclusions of law that he filed with the magistrate judge. <em>Id. </em>at *6. While he was not required to do so, the district judge held, <em>sua sponte, </em>that this constituted a waiver of Greathouse\u2019s objection. On appeal, we appointed Vilia B. Hayes, a partner at Hughes Hubbard <em>&amp; </em>Reed LLP and the then-President-elect of the Federal Bar Council, to argue on behalf of the absent defendants in favor of the judgment below to the extent that it relied on <em>Lambert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">I. The Effect of the Default Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Regardless of whether the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Lambert </em>is correct \u2014 an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>issue that I address later in this opinion\u2014 this is not the appropriate case in which to reconsider that decision. Specifically, we should exercise restraint here in light of this case\u2019s troubling procedural posture, arising as it does from a default judgment. There is something wrong when a case or controversy, to the extent that it exists, is principally between a plaintiff and the judges deciding the case. The way to avoid such an anomalous procedure here is to award damages based on the default judgment entered by the district court against JHS and its owner and president, Melvin Wilcox (\u201cWilcox\u201d), who failed to appear in the district court. I proceed to discuss the rules governing the entry of default judgments and demonstrate that the entry of default judgment would be particularly appropriate, if it was not compelled, in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A. The Default Judgment and the FLSA Retaliation Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b) sets out the procedures to be followed when a defendant defaults by failing to appear. First, Rule 55(b)(1) provides that, \u201c[i]f the plaintiffs claim is for a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, the clerk ... <em>must </em>enter judgment for that amount and costs against a defendant who has been defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor an incompetent person.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(1) (emphasis added). By these terms, the entry of default judgment for the damages requested is mandatory and there is no room for discretion to deny an award of damages because the complaint does not state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Rule 55(b)(2) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n all other cases,\u201d which would presumably include cases in which damages are not even sought, as well as cases where damages claimed are other than a sum certain, \u201c[t]he court may conduct hearings or make referrals ... when, <em>to enter or effectuate judgment, </em>it needs to: (A) conduct an accounting; (B) determine the amount of damages; (C) establish the truth of any allegation by evidence; or (D) investigate any other matter.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2) (emphasis added). There is no reason why the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would mandate the entry of a judgment without an examination of the allegations of the complaint where the amount sought is for a sum certain, but permit such an inquiry simply because the damages are not certain. The reason for the discretion vested in Rule 55(b)(2) is to permit proceedings facilitating the district judge\u2019s determination of damages or other relief sought in the complaint that fall within the discretion of the trier of fact. Thus, in <em>Flaks v. Koegel, </em>504 F.2d 702, 707 (2d Cir.1974), we held that a hearing was required to determine punitive damages because such damages were within the discretion of the trier of fact and were \u201cclearly not liquidated or computable and there is no basis at all here to award the amount set forth in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">This is not to say' that courts are obligated to enter default judgments no matter how frivolous the suit, so long as the defendants have defaulted. Courts have both statutory and inherent authority to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss frivolous suits. <em>See Fitzgerald v. First East Seventh Street Tenants Corp., </em>221 F.3d 362, 364 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]e hold that district courts may dismiss a frivolous complaint <em>sua sponte </em>even when the plaintiff has paid the required filing fee....\u201d). Indeed, in cases proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the discretion of the district court may even be greater. <em>Benson v. O'Brian, </em>179 F.3d 1014 (6th Cir.1999). The standard for frivolousness does not encompass otherwise well-pled claims for relief on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that they fail to state a claim, although there may be some overlap between those two classes of suits. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 326, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Frivolous suits are those that lack \u201can arguable basis either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (quoting <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Neitzke,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">Close questions of federal law, including claims filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, have on a number of occasions arisen on motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and have been substantial enough to warrant this Court\u2019s granting review, under its certiorari jurisdiction, to resolve them [even though they were initially dismissed]. It can hardly be said that the substantial legal claims raised in these cases were so defective that they should never have been brought at the outset. To term these claims frivolous is to distort measurably the meaning of frivolousness both in common and legal parlance. Indeed, we recently reviewed the dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of a complaint based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and found by a 9-to-0 vote that it had, in fact, stated a cognizable claim \u2014 a powerful illustration that a finding of a failure to state a claim does not invariably mean that the claim is without arguable merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 328-29, 109 S.Ct. 1827 (internal citations omitted). In this case, there has never been a suggestion that plaintiffs suit is frivolous, even as there has been much discussion as to whether it adequately states a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajd\">Moreover, an aggrieved party against whom a default judgment has been entered also has recourse to set aside the judgment after the fact. Rule 55(c) confers discretion on the district court to provide for relief from the entry of a default judgment for \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d and that a default judgment may be vacated \u201cin accordance with Rule 60(b).\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c); <em>see </em>10A Wright, Miller <em>&amp; </em>Kane \u00a7 2692 at 90, \u00a7 2693 at 103-04 (\u201c[Several courts [including the Second Circuit] have concluded that Rules 55(c) and 60(b) express a policy of liberality toward motions for relief from default entries and default judgments,\u201d and \u201cthey have ruled that on a motion for relief from the entry of a default or a default judgment, all doubts should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.); <em>see also Davis v. Musler, </em>713 F.2d 907, 915 (2d Cir.1983) (same). This provides significant protection against any miscarriage of justice that may result from a defendant\u2019s decision not to appear and a resulting default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In light of these protections, there seems little justification for granting defaulting parties the benefits they received in this case. Those benefits were substantial. The magistrate in the case essentially took it upon himself to act as counsel for parties who had not bothered themselves to appear in court. Acting as both counsel and judge, the magistrate \u2014 affirmed by the district <em>judge </em>\u2014 sua <em>sponte </em>denied damages on a previously entered default judgment on the basis of a defense that the defendants may have waived if they had appeared and not timely raised it. <em>See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 506-07, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (holding that an objection that a complaint failed to state a claim could not be asserted post-judgment). Then, we appointed counsel to defend on appeal the lawyering of these judicial officers on behalf of parties who, never even appeared in court. Thus, through the magistrate judge, the district court judge, and the able counsel appointed by this Court, defendants may have obtained far more capable representation than they would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>obtained had they not chosen voluntarily to default and instead retained their own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Separate and apart from the manner in which Rule 55(b) should be construed, we held in <em>Trans World Airlines v. Hughes </em>that, while a hearing was necessary on' the issue of damages, \u201cthere was no burden on [the plaintiff] to show that any of [the defendant\u2019s] acts pleaded in the complaint violated the antitrust laws nor to show that those acts caused the well-pleaded injuries, except as we have indicated that it had to for the purpose of establishing the extent of the injury caused [to the plaintiff], in dollars and cents.\u201d 449 F.2d 51, 70 (2d Cir.1971), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>409 U.S. 363, 93 S.Ct. 647, 34 L.Ed.2d 577 (1973). On the contrary, we held that \u201c[t]he default had the effect of admitting or establishing that the acts pleaded in the complaint violated the antitrust laws and that those acts caused injury to TWA in the respects there alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We reiterated this holding in <em>Bambu Sales, Inc. v. Ozak Trading Inc., </em>58 F.3d 849, 854 (2d Cir.1995), where Judge McLaughlin observed \u201c[t]here is no question that a default judgment establishes liability.\u201d Indeed, writing in. a later case, Judge McLaughlin held that this distinguishes default judgments from unopposed motions for summary judgment. <em>Vermont Teddy Bear Co., Inc. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., </em>373 F.3d 241, 242 (2d Cir.2004). There, the district judge granted an unopposed motion for summary judgment after assuming the truth of the allegations in the complaint and failing to analyze any of the complex legal and factual issues. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 245. Judge McLaughlin suggested that the district judge there had confused the procedure for addressing a motion for summary judgment with the procedure for addressing a default judgment. <em>Vermont Teddy Bear, </em>373 F.3d at 242; <em>see also Jackson v. Fed. Express, </em>766 F.3d 189, 196 (2d Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The majority expresses doubt, albeit in a footnote, whether these cases and, more particularly, <em>Trans World Airlines </em>\u201cremain!] good law in light of this court\u2019s subsequent jurisprudence.\u201d Majority Op. at 117 n.17 (citing <em>Finkel v. Romanowicz, </em>577 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir.2009)). This argument overlooks the principle that a panel of this Court is \u201cbound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an <em>en banc </em>panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. v. Jaldhi Overseas Pte Ltd., </em>585 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither <em>Trans World Airlines </em>nor the other cases which echo its language have been overruled in this <em>manner or </em>by the mini-e77 <em>banc </em>procedure that the majority employs here. Indeed, <em>Finkel v. Romanowicz, </em>upon which the majority relies, does not even acknowledge the existence of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">While there is dictum in <em>Au Bon Pain Corp. v. Artect, Inc., </em>653 F.2d 61, 65 (2d Cir.1981), suggesting that a district judge \u201cneed not agree that the alleged facts constitute a valid cause of action,\u201d that case did not allude to the prior Second Circuit cases to the contrary, and relied solely on the then-current version of \u00a7 2688 of Wright <em>&amp; </em>Miller, which has not changed. <em>Id. </em>The latter, in turn, had relied principally on <em>Ohio Cent. R. Co. v. Central Trust Co., </em>133 U.S. 83, 10 S.Ct. 235, 33 L.Ed. 561 (1890). 10A Charles Alan Wright, Alan R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Mary Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 </em>2688 at 60 (3d ed.1998). In that case, the Supreme Court held only that the complaint \u201cwas taken as confessed; but that fact did not, in itself justify giving complainant more than it claimed.\u201d <em>Ohio Cent. R. Co., </em>133 U.S. at 90, 10 S.Ct. 235. In this context, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>observed that, \u201cunder the rules and practice of this court in equity\u201d a defaulting defendant is not precluded \u201con appeal ... from insisting that the averments contained in it do not justify the decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 10 S.Ct. 235. Nevertheless, this language assumes a true adversary proceeding in which the defendant appears and challenges or asks to be relieved of the default judgment. <em>Ohio Central </em>does not sanction the proceeding in this case in which multiple judges \u2014 indeed, the judicial system itself \u2014 assumes an adversarial position on behalf of defaulting defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Moreover, the then-prevailing rules and practices of the Supreme Court preceded the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h), which requires that a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim must be made before judgment is entered in the district court,' otherwise it is waived and cannot be raised on appeal. <em>See Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 506-07, 126 S.Ct. 1235. Thus, if a defendant appeared and failed to timely challenge the allegations in the complaint, it would be deemed waived. By contrast, the majority holds that a defendant who defaults does not waive the defense and is in a_ better position than one who appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Nevertheless, there is recent Second Circuit authority relying solely on the dictum in <em>Au Bon Pain, </em>and overlooking the Second Circuit.cases to the contrary and discussed above, that hold that a district court has discretion to determine whether the allegations in the complaint, taken as true, establish a cause of action. <em>See Priestley v. Headminder, Inc., </em>647 F.3d 497, 506 (2d Cir.2011); <em>City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, </em>645 F.3d 114, 137 (2d Cir.2011); <em>Finkel v. Romanowicz, </em>577 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir.2009). In two of these cases, the language can arguably be viewed as dictum because the alternative holding in one case was that the complaint stated a cause of action, <em>Finkel, </em>577 F.3d at 84, and the holding in the other case that the issue was procedurally forfeited, <em>Mickalis, </em>645 F.3d at 137. Moreover, in the third case the allegations in the complaint were not well-pleaded because they not only failed to support .the theory of liability alleged, but \u201cactually disproved it.\u201d <em>Priestley, </em>647 F.3d at 506.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we need not resolve the conflict between the earlier and later cases because the district court ordered \u201cthat a default judgment be entered against [the] defendants ... with the amount of the judgment to be determined \u2022after an inquest before ... the magistrate judge.\u201d Default J. &amp; Inquest Order, <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec., Inc., </em>No. 11-cv-7845 (S.D.N.Y. March 15, 2012), ECF No. 15. The problem here is not the failure of the district judge to enter a default judgment on the basis of the defendants\u2019 failure to appear. Instead, it is the failure of the magistrate judge to follow the order of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">B. The Default Judgment and the NYLL Retaliation Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The district judge also rejected the plaintiffs unopposed objection to the R &amp; R that the magistrate judge failed to award damages on the NYLL retaliation claim. <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec. Inc., </em>No. 11 CIV. 7845(PAE)(GWG), 2012 WL 5185591, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2012). He reasoned that this claim had not been addressed because the plaintiffs \u201cproposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>findings of fact and conclusions of law did not make any request for damages on account of that claim,\u201d and \u201c[generally, courts do not consider new arguments ... raised in objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that were not raised, and thus were not considered, by the magistrate judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There are two problems with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">First, Greathouse\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law can be reasonably be read as seeking damages on both the FLSA and NYLL retaliation causes of action. Proposed Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusions of Law, <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec., Inc., </em>No. 11-cv-7845 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2012), ECF No. 22. In that document, Greathouse argued that \u201c[i]n addition to the damages related to the nonpayment and underpayment of wages, Plaintiff is also entitled to recover for damages related to his retaliation <em>claims </em>\u201d <em>Id </em>at 13 (emphasis added). The word \u201cclaims,\u201d by its plural form, clearly referred to both retaliation claims, not simply the FLSA claim. While Greathouse addressed the issue of whether he could recover on the FLSA claim in light of <em>Lambert </em>and <em>Kasten, </em>he had no reason to specifically address this issue with respect to the NYLL retaliation claim because unlike the FLSA claim as construed in <em>Lambert, </em>the NYLL claim was not dependent on whether the complaint which caused his employer to retaliate against the plaintiff was made to his supervisor, rather than a governmental agency. Under these 'circumstances, his failure to specifically address the latter cause of action should not have been viewed by the district court as a waiver of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Second, the district judge may have unintentionally led Greathouse astray by directing an inquest solely on the issue of damages. In so doing, he may have lulled Greathouse into believing that the liability phase of the case was over. Greathouse had no reason explicitly justify his NYLL claim because he had already prevailed on his FLSA claim \u2014 or so he (reasonably) thought. Had he known there was a problem with the FLSA claim, he might have acted to more explicitly address his NYLL claim, as he ultimately did when he objected to the R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Finally, the so-called \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d on which the district judge relied, is a judge-made rule that should not automatically be applied without regard to the circumstances of a particular case. Indeed, we have held that \u201can appellate court has discretion ... to review of its own motion any error not saved by a timely objection.\u201d <em>Curko v. William &amp; Son, Corp., </em>294 F.2d 410, 413-14 (2d Cir.1961); <em>see also Valdez ex rel. Donely v. U.S., </em>518 F.3d 173, 181 (2d Cir.2008). We do so when necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice or to remedy \u201can obvious instance of misapplied law.\u201d <em>Caruolo v. John Crane, Inc., </em>226 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir.2000). Moreover, while we apply a stringent standard for our consideration of trial errors, \u201cwhich implicate the significant policy considerations underlying the need for a timely objection, namely, the avoidance of an unnecessary retrial,\u201d we have suggested that a more forgiving standard is justified when such policy considerations are not present. <em>Valdez, </em>518 F.3d at 182. Indeed, in <em>Williams v. City of New York, </em>508 F.2d 356, 362 (2d Cir.1974), we held that one consideration weighing in favor of noticing a plain error in a jury instruction for punitive damages was \u201cthe remediability of [the] error without a new trial below.\u201d Indeed, in <em>United States v. Male Juvenile, </em>121 F.3d 34, 38-39 (2d Cir.1997), we held that a district judge had discretion to reconsider a ruling of the magistrate judge even where no objection to it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In the present case, the failure of the magistrate judge to award damages on the NYLL retaliation claim deprived Great-house of relief to which he was entitled based on the defendants\u2019 outrageous conduct. Moreover, a remand to the magistrate judge would not have involved a duplication of effort in which he had already engaged when he conducted the inquest on damages. A remand in the present case would not involve reopening a hearing at which testimony was taken. On the contrary, the magistrate judge did not address the amount of the damage award on either the FLSA retaliation or NYLL retaliation claim. A remand would simply require him to do a mathematical calculation based on the information that Great-house has previously provided regarding the damages to which he was entitled as a result of his retaliatory termination \u2014 a much easier task than the one the majority dumps in his lap on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">II. The Validity of <em>Lambert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">My dissent is not dependent on the continued validity of <em>Lambert. </em>Nevertheless, I add these words because it adds further support to my view that this case is not the appropriate one to reach that issue. In <em>Lambert, </em>we explicitly held that the retaliation cause of action created by the FLSA \u201cdoes not encompass [retaliation for] complaints made to a supervisor.\u201d <em>Lambert v. Genesee Hosp., </em>10 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir.1993). The case did not turn on whether the complaint was oral or written. Instead, it turned on the separate issue of the proper recipient of the complaint that triggered retaliatory action by the employer. Judge Walker, writing for the panel, explained that, while a retaliation cause of action under Title VII could be based on a complaint made to an employer, the language of the FLSA, as amended by the Equal Pay Act (\u201cEPA\u201d), was much narrower in scope.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">Title VII broadly provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The phrase \u201copposed any practice\u201d encompasses an individual\u2019s complaints to supervisors regardless of whether she also files an EEOC charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">In contrast, FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision makes it unlawful \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). The EPA is an amendment to the FLSA and is codified under the same chapter; thus retaliation for filing EPA complaints falls under \u00a7 215(a)(3). The plain language of this provision limits the cause of action to retaliation for filing formal complaints, instituting a proceeding, or testifying, but does not encompass complaints made to a supervisor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In reaching this conclusion, Judge Walker acknowledged that it was contrary to the holdings in a number of circuits and to the EEOC\u2019s \u201cinterpretation in its compliance manual that the EPA retaliation provisions should encompass informal workplace complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, he explained that \u201c[b]ecause we hold that the statute\u2019s language is plain and unambigur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ous we need not defer to the EEOC\u2019s interpretation in its compliance manual that the EPA retaliation provisions should encompass informal workplace complaints.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Supreme Court has subsequently held that a complaint by an employee that triggers retaliatory action by his employer need not be in writing. <em>Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1325, 179 L.Ed.2d 379 (2011). Unlike <em>Lambert, </em>which focused on the language relating to the issue of with whom a complaint must be filed, <em>Kasten </em>focused solely on the issue of whether an oral complaint is encompassed within the meaning of the word \u201cfiled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331. Relying on the \u201cdictionary definitions\u201d of the term, research that disclosed \u201cthat legislators, administrators, and judges have all sometimes used the word \u2018file\u2019 in conjunction with oral statements,\u201d and \u201cthat oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Act\u2019s passage,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018filed any complaint\u2019 might, or might not, encompass oral complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331-32. Indeed, Justice Breyer, writing for the majority, observed that oral complaints can be made to government agencies through \u201chotlines, interviews, and other oral methods of receiving complaints.\u201d <em>Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1334. Moreover, the Department of Labor, in accordance with its position that the FLSA retaliation provision covered oral complaints, had \u201ccreatfed] a hotline to receive oral complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335: Consequently, the Supreme Court looked at other factors relating to statutory interpretation to hold that the word \u201cfiled\u201d encompassed oral complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 1332-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Nevertheless, <em>Kasten </em>expressly left open the issue we decided in <em>Lambert </em>that a complaint \u2014 oral or written \u2014 made only to a supervisor may not provide the predicate for an FLSA retaliation claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1336. While the complaint in <em>Kasten </em>was made to a supervisor, the employer, Saint Gobain, did not properly preserve the issue for consideration by the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>Nor could Saint Gobain take advantage of an exception that would have permitted the Supreme Court to consider the issue on the ground that it was a necessary \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the oral written question that [it] granted certiorari to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). As Justice Breyer succinctly stated: \u201cThat is to say, we can decide the oral/written question separately \u2014 on its own. Thus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain\u2019s alternative claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the majority declines to take Justice Breyer at his word, and insists that <em>Kasten </em>compels us to consider in this case the issue that the Supreme Court declined to address. I do not agree that we must do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">I observed earlier that a panel of this Court is \u201cbound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an <em>en banc </em>panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Shipping Corp., </em>585 F.3d at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where an intervening Supreme Court decision \u201ccasts doubt on the prior ruling,\u201d however, that general rule does not apply. <em>Finkel v. Stratton Corp., </em>962 F.2d 169, 174-75 (2d Cir.1992); <em>see also In re Zarnel, </em>619 F.3d 156, 168 (2d Cir.2010); <em>Union of Needletrades, Indus. &amp; Textile Emps. v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 200, 201 (2d Cir.2003). The intervening decision \u201cneed not address the precise issue decided by the panel for this exception to apply.\u201d <em>In re Zarnel, </em>619 F.3d at 168; <em>see also Sullivan v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>424 F.3d 267, 274 (2d Cir.2005) (overruling prior panel when intervening Supreme Court decision \u201centirely undermine[d]\u201d the assumption underlying the prior panel\u2019s statutory analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>In re Zarnel </em>provides a particularly informative example of a case in which we overruled a prior holding based on an intervening Supreme Court ruling. The prior Second Circuit case held that the failure of the allegations in the complaint to satisfy the requirements to obtain relief under the statute deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>In re BDC 56 LLC, </em>330 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2003). A subsequent Supreme Court ruling set out a standard for resolving when a statutory limitation on coverage is jurisdictional. <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 515-16, 126 S.Ct. 1235. More specifically, it held \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.... But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdietional in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote and internal citation omitted). The statute at issue in <em>In re Zarnel, </em>was not the same statute that we had construed in <em>In re BDC 56. </em>Nevertheless, we explained that the standard set out in <em>Arbaugh </em>compelled the conclusion that the limitation on statutory coverage at issue in <em>In re BDC 56 </em>was not jurisdictional, and that <em>In re BDC 56 </em>should be overruled. <em>In re Zarnel, </em>619 F.3d at 169 (\u201cWe find that, in light of <em>Arbaugh, In re BDC LLC </em>can no longer be considered good law on this point.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The circumstances here do not approach those in <em>In re Zarnel, </em>if only because the Supreme Court in <em>Kasten </em>left open the issue that <em>Lambert </em>decided, and did not adopt a broad rule that would cover the facts in that case. Nor does the fact that \u201c[t]he <em>Lambert </em>court\u2019s conclusion ... is contrary to the weight of authority in our sister circuits,\u201d as the majority observes, necessarily provide a basis for rejecting its holding here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Judge Walker\u2019s unanimous opinion in <em>Lambert </em>acknowledged \u201cthat a number of our sister circuits have held to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lambert </em>10 F.3d at 55. Significantly, he cited with approval a dissenting opinion in one of those cases. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>EEOC v. Romeo Community Sch., </em>976 F.2d 985, 990 (6th Cir.1992) (Surheinrich, J., dissenting)). Moreover, he also declined to adopt the EEOC\u2019s interpretation of the statute in its compliance manual. <em>Lambert, </em>10 F.3d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In sum, three distinguished judges of the Second Circuit (Judges Lumbard, Winter, and Walker) and the only two Supreme Court Justices (Justices Scalia and Thomas) who have spoken to the issue agree that the FLSA does not encompass complaints made to a supervisor. Indeed, Justice Scalia, who reached the issue of to whom a complaint must be filed, makes a compelling argument supporting and supplementing the holding in <em>Lambert. See Kasten, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1336-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Kasten </em>majority did not respond to Justice Scalia\u2019s argument, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>cause it declined to reach the issue, and the majority here likewise does not do so. While I do not suggest that the majority\u2019s position is unreasonable, <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>continuing validity should not be resolved in the unusual procedural context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">III. The Application of <em>Kasten</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">There is one more reason why this case is not an appropriate one to reconsider <em>Lambert. </em>Simply stated, Greathouse cannot recover under the standard set out in <em>Kasten. </em>Even if the Supreme Court had overruled <em>Lambert, </em>the oral complaint made by the plaintiff in this case does not satisfy the standard the Supreme Court prescribed in <em>Kasten </em>for an employee to prevail on an FLSA retaliation cause of action. In that case, the Supreme Court described an oral complaint that would satisfy the FLSA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">To fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection. This standard can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by written ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">131 S.Ct. at 1335. The oral complaint in this case does not meet this standard. Nor does the majority hold that it does. As described in the majority opinion, Greathouse complained to the defendant Wilcox, the owner and president of JHS, that he had not been paid in several months. If this complaint had been made to a government agency, such as the Department of Labor, the very nature of the complaint and the entity to which it was made would have put the employer on notice of an assertion of rights protected by the statute. Id. at 1341 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cFiling a complaint with a judicial or administrative body is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of one\u2019s rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Greathouse\u2019s simple complaint to JHS when he was not paid did not put the employer on such notice. Indeed, the explicit complaint made by the employee in <em>Kasten </em>provides a useful contrast. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. There, the employee \u2014 Kasten\u2014 complained that the location of time clocks \u201cprevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent putting on and taking off their work clothes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Kasten not only repeatedly called the issue to Saint Grobain\u2019s attention in accordance with the latter\u2019s internal grievance review procedure, he also told his shift supervisor that \u201cit was illegal for the time clocks to be where they were.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Moreover, he told a human resources employee that \u201c \u2018if they were challenged on\u2019 the location in court, \u2018they would lose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, he told his lead operator that he \u201cwas thinking about starting a lawsuit about the placement of the time clocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The oral complaint in this case does not come close to approaching The specificity and clarity of the complaint in <em>Kasten. </em>By leaving this question undecided, the majority sets this case on a potentially wasteful and circuitous route. If the district court finds that the notice given to the employer was insufficient, then the case would presumably be headed back here once again and we would again be in the position of considering whether to appoint counsel for a defaulting defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In conclusion, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for the calculation of damages on Greathouse\u2019s claim of retaliatory termination. Because the damages overlap, and because Great-house is not entitled to a double recovery, it is not relevant on which cause of action the district judge makes that determination. Unlike the majority, I would not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>mand to the district court to determine whether the complaint that Greathouse made to his employer provided a sufficient predicate to an FLSA retaliation cause of action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. The term \"well-pleaded allegation\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that does not encompass the issue of whether the allegations in a complaint are sufficient to state a claim. <em>See Trans World Airlines, </em>449 F.2d at 63 (\"For example, an allegation made indefinite or erroneous by other allegations in the same complaint is not a well-pleaded allegation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-4\">. The fact that other circuits may disagree is not an answer to this argument. Indeed, it is worth recalling that in <em>McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), the Supreme Court rejected the unanimous construction of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, by all of the circuits. <em>See id. </em>at 376, 107 S.Ct. 2875 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">. While Justice Scalia's dissent in <em>Kasten </em>voiced concerns over the effect that the analysis in <em>Kasten </em>would have on the issue in the present case, it is helpful to recall Judge Friendly\u2019s admonition that \u201cdissenting opinions are not always a reliable guide to the meaning of the majority; often their predictions partake of Cassandra's gloom more than of her accuracy.\u201d <em>Local 1545 United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO v. Vincent, </em>286 F.2d 127, 132 (2d Cir.1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
