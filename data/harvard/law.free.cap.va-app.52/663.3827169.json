Parks (wife) appeals from the trial court\u2019s July-31, 2007, final equitable distribution order. On appeal, wife contends the trial court erred by: (1) awarding wife credit for only a 1.5% commission on the sale of husband\u2019s prior home and the purchase of the marital home; (2) requiring husband to pay one-half the value of stocks at the time of sale rather than one-half the value of stocks at the time the assets were to have been conveyed to wife; and (3) giving husband a post-separation credit for principal reduction on the mortgage of the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On appeal, wife presents no legal authority in support of her three arguments. Rule 5A:20(e) provides that the opening brief shall include \u201c[t]he principles of law, the argument, and <em>the authorities </em>relating to each question presented\u201d (Emphasis added). \u201cStatements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not permit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 302 n. 7, 605 S.E.2d 268, 275 n. 7 (2004) (citing <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992)). The Supreme Court recently announced that when a party\u2019s \u201cfailure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e)\u201d is significant, \u201cthe Court of Appeals may ... treat a question presented as waived.\u201d <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 520, 659 S.E.2d 311, 317 (2008). Here, we find wife\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 5A:20(e) as to each question presented to be significant. Accordingly, wife\u2019s questions presented are waived, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed without opinion as to whether error exists in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
