For the reasons below, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Under familiar principles, \u201cwe construe the evidence in the light most favorable to [father], the prevailing party below, granting to his evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 195, 571 S.E.2d 912, 914 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The parties were married in 1999, and three children were born of the marriage. For most of their marriage, the parties resided in Virginia in New Kent County. In early August 2006, mother indicated to father that she was taking the children to Fort Bragg, North Carolina to visit relatives. Then, without prior notice to father, she took the children to Caribou, Maine, where her mother and other relatives lived. On September 5, 2006, father filed petitions in the New Kent County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (JDR court) seeking custody of the three children. Two days later, on September 7, 2006, mother, unaware of father\u2019s petition for custody of the children in Virginia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> obtained an <em>ex parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>temporary protective order from the Caribou District Court in Maine (Maine court), alleging domestic violence on the part of father toward her and the three children. In the same <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, the Maine court awarded mother temporary custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Consistent with the terms of the UCCJEA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the JDR court communicated with the Maine court to determine which court should continue to exercise jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 child custody and visitation issues. No agreement was reached at that time regarding which court should exercise or cede jurisdiction. The Maine court continued to exercise its \u201ctemporary emergency jurisdiction\u201d based on the children\u2019s physical presence in Maine and mother\u2019s allegations of domestic violence by father.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The JDR court continued to exercise its jurisdiction based on Virginia\u2019s status as the \u201chome state\u201d of the children, and awarded physical custody of the children to father. Mother appealed the JDR court\u2019s decision awarding father custody of the children to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Pursuant to the UCCJEA, the circuit court discussed the jurisdictional issue with the Maine court. As a result of that discussion, the circuit court determined, \u201cafter consideration of all the statutory factors contained in Virginia Code [\u00a7 ] 20-146.18, <em>including the factor of domestic violence,\u201d </em>that Virginia, as the \u201chome state\u201d of the children, had \u201cexclusive continuing jurisdiction to decide th[e] [parties\u2019] custody case\u201d and that it was \u201cnot an inconvenient forum to decide th[e] case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Maine court thereafter entered an order \u201cjoin[ing]\u201d in the circuit court\u2019s determination that Virginia was not an \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d and was the appropriate jurisdiction to determine custody and visitation of the three children. The Maine court declined to continue to exercise jurisdiction, rescinded and vacated its protective order as it pertained to the parties\u2019 children, and rescinded and vacated its award of temporary custody to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On appeal of \u201ca determination [of whether Virginia is an \u2018inconvenient forum\u2019] made pursuant to [Code \u00a7 20-146.18], we consider whether the [circuit] court abused its discretion in making its ruling.\u201d <em>Swalef v. Anderson, </em>50 Va.App. 100, 108, 646 S.E.2d 458, 462 (2007). Here, mother contends the circuit court abused its discretion in not finding, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-146.18, that it was an \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d to determine the custody and visitation of the parties\u2019 children, based on father\u2019s history of domestic violence against her and the children, and that it erred in exercising its \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Code \u00a7 20-146.18 provides that a Virginia court \u201cthat has jurisdiction under [the UCCJEA] to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A). In making this determination, the court \u201cshall allow the parties to present evidence and <em>shall consider all relevant factors </em>...\u201d listed in Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B). Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B) (emphasis added). Among the statutory enumerated factors the court is required to consider in determining whether it is an \u201cinconvenient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>forum\u201d is \u201c[w]hether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20\u2014146.18(B)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Here, the circuit court heard the parties\u2019 evidence concerning each of the eight factors, including mother\u2019s evidence of domestic violence. In its order finding that it was not an \u201cinconvenient forum,\u201d the circuit court expressly stated that it considered the statutory factors, and specifically noted that it considered mother\u2019s assertions of domestic violence in determining that Virginia was not an \u201cinconvenient forum.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the record presented on appeal, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Virginia was not an \u201cinconvenient forum.\u201d Moreover, the Maine court, which had earlier entered the emergency protective order based on mother\u2019s assertion of domestic violence, concurred with the circuit court\u2019s determination that Virginia was not an \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d to determine the custody and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>visitation of the parties\u2019 children, and declined to continue to exercise its jurisdiction under its \u201cemergency order.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">From this record, we cannot conclude the circuit court abused its discretion in finding that it was not an \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d to determine the custody of the parties\u2019 children. For the reasons above, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order awarding custody of the parties\u2019 children to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\">. The General Assembly adopted the UCCJEA, Chapter 305, Acts of Assembly 2001, the stated purpose of which is to \"[a]void jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other states,\u201d and to \"[pjromote cooperation with the courts of other states to the end that a custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>decree is rendered in that state that can best decide the case in the interest of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.38(A)(l),(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">. \"Home state\u201d is defined in the UCCJEA as \"the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\">. Mother was not aware of father's institution of custody proceedings in Virginia until served with a copy of the petition in Maine. Father was not aware of mother\u2019s institution of custody proceedings in Maine until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>served with the temporary protective order prohibiting his contact with the three children and mother, and the order awarding temporary custody to mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.9(A) (\"Before finding and exercising jurisdiction, a court of this Commonwealth shall communicate with the court appearing to have jurisdiction in any other state concerning a proceeding arising under this act.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">. <em>See </em>19-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1748(1) (Supp.2001) (\"A [Maine] court ... has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in [Maine] and ... it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child or a sibling or parent of the child is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.13(A) (\"Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 20-146.15, a court of this Commonwealth that has made a child custody determination consistent with \u00a7 20-146.12 or \u00a7 20-146.14 has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction as long as the child, the child\u2019s parents, or any person acting as a parent continue to live in this Commonwealth.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\">. Mother argues that the eight factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B) require the court to give weight to each factor in the order that the factors are listed in the statute and that as the domestic violence factor is listed first among the factors, it should be given the greatest weight. Mother provides no binding authority for that assertion, and we are aware of none. We note, for instance, that in its adoption of the UCCJEA, the Tennessee legislature listed domestic violence as the seventh of eight factors to consider in determining whether that state is an \"inconvenient forum.\u201d <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-222(b)(7). Clearly, where credible evidence supports the assertion of domestic violence, the safety of victims of that violence is an important factor when considering jurisdictional issues under the UCCJEA. <em>See, e.g., Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>314 Mont. 139, 64 P.3d 997 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">. The record on appeal contains a lengthy <em>ex parte </em>affidavit of mother attached to her attorney\u2019s memorandum of law submitted to the circuit court for consideration. The record also reflects that father was charged with domestic assault, but that charge was <em>nolle prosequied </em>in October 2005. Additionally, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>reported that father had an \u201cinability to control his temper and[,] as a result, cause[d] traumatic verbal and possibly physical scenes in front of the children.\u201d Moreover, the record reflects that the JDR court sentenced father to four days in jail for violating the Maine emergency protective order by making threatening phone calls to mother on October 8, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b575-17\">. <em>See </em>19-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1750(2) (\"If [a] [Maine] court determines that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this chapter,\u201d and if \"the court of the state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this chapter does not determine that the [Maine court] is a more appropriate forum, the [Maine court] shall dismiss the proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
