Bandy argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress drugs discovered in his pocket during a pat down. Bandy claims that the pat down was the product of an illegal seizure, and, in the alternative, that the investigating officer exceeded the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, the Commonwealth in this instance, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 718, 722, 568 S.E.2d 403, 405 (2002). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">At approximately 5:00 p.m. on March 20, 2006, Officer Sorg of the Newport News Police Department was on patrol on Jefferson Avenue in Harbor Homes, a property of the Newport News Housing Authority. Harbor Homes is a \u201chigh-drug, high-crime area.\u201d Officer Sorg himself had made approximately 20 arrests involving narcotics in Harbor Homes over the past three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Officer Sorg saw Bandy and another man, later identified as \u201cMitchell,\u201d exit a vehicle and approach a residence. The two men knocked on the door, but received no answer. After a few moments, Bandy and Mitchell turned from the house and began walking down Jefferson Avenue away from the vehicle. Officer Sorg found the men\u2019s actions suspicious and called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Officer Nielson to help him investigate. As the officers approached the two men, Mitchell \u201cmade a throwing motion toward a bush.\u201d Officer Sorg walked over to the bush and discovered a plastic baggie with crack cocaine in it. Officer Sorg handcuffed Mitchell and began questioning him about the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As Officer Sorg spoke to Mitchell, Officer Nielson approached Bandy. Officer Nielson said to Bandy, \u201cPardon me bro, I need to speak with you for a minute if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Bandy replied \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d Officer Nielson asked Bandy who he was visiting in Harbor Homes. Bandy was unable to give a name or address and gave \u201cextremely evasive\u201d answers. Bandy was \u201cunable to point out a particular location in which he was even attempting to go to.\u201d Officer Nielson then asked Bandy where he was coming from. Bandy again gave \u201cevasive, inconsistent answers\u201d and \u201ccould not provide a particular point or location\u201d from which he had come. Harbor Homes has several \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs posted, and the Newport News police are authorized to enforce those signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">While Officer Nielson spoke to Bandy, Bandy appeared \u201crather nervous.\u201d \u201cHe was fidgeting, shifting back and forth his weight on his feet. His hands clinging to his pockets.\u201d As they spoke, Bandy continuously shifted his eyes and looked around, an action that Officer Nielson recognized as a \u201ctypical indicator of either flight or suspicious behavior.\u201d Officer Nielson twice asked Bandy to remove his hands from his pockets. Bandy complied both times, but \u201ckept moving around, motioning his hands up to his pockets.\u201d After having to ask Bandy to remove his hands the second time, Officer Nielson believed that Bandy might be concealing a weapon. Officer Nielson explained, \u201cHe kept putting his hands in his pockets. To me that\u2019s indication that he might be reaching for something which could harm me or my partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In light of those safety concerns, Officer Nielson told Bandy that he needed to pat him down to check for weapons. Officer Nielson later testified that during any pat down, he uses his open hand, with his \u201cfingers spaced\u201d to feel \u201cevery single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>portion\u201d of the person\u2019s body. He explained that by keeping his fingers spread, \u201c[his fingers] are able to move any loose items which may be in there as opposed to keeping [his fingers] tight together which would bundle everything inside.\u201d Due to the size of the average person\u2019s thigh in relation to Officer Nielson\u2019s hand, he must pat each thigh twice, once from the front and once from the rear, in order to cover the entire thigh. As Officer Nielson frisked Bandy, he felt a bulge with his palm and heard a crinkle in a small pocket on the side of Bandy\u2019s right thigh. Officer Nielson patted down Bandy\u2019s right thigh a second time, as he does in all pat downs. On his second pass, he patted the bulge in Bandy\u2019s pocket with his fingers. At that point, Officer Nielson was able to feel several small items that he described as \u201chard [and] rocky.\u201d Based on his training and experience, Officer Nielson immediately recognized the items as crack cocaine rocks. Officer Nielson later testified that he did not use his fingers to manipulate the items in Bandy\u2019s pocket and that he kept his hand on Bandy\u2019s thigh no longer than necessary to pat it. Officer Nielson then placed Bandy in handcuffs, reached into his pocket, and discovered a bag containing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Throughout the encounter, Officers Sorg and Nielson were the only officers on the scene. Their patrol car was parked a block away without its lights or sirens on, and neither officer drew his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The Commonwealth subsequently charged Bandy with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Prior to trial, Bandy filed a motion to suppress the cocaine. He argued that the discovery of the cocaine was the result of an impermissible seizure and/or an impermissible search. The trial court denied Bandy\u2019s motion to suppress and ultimately found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Bandy now appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Bandy makes two claims on appeal. First, he argues that he was \u201cseized\u201d by Officer Nielson when Nielson first ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>proached him, and that seizure was not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Second, he argues that, even if Officer Nielson had sufficient grounds to stop and frisk him, Officer Nielson\u2019s pat down exceeded the scope of a proper <em>Terry </em>frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Determining whether a seizure has occurred and whether a frisk for weapons is constitutional is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1661-62, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Accordingly, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997). However, we review the application of the Fourth Amendment to those facts <em>de novo. See Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 691, 116 S.Ct. at 1659.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>A. The Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In order to determine whether Officer Nielson could lawfully seize Bandy, we must first address when the seizure occurred. Bandy argues that the seizure occurred when Officer Nielson first approached him. The Commonwealth contends that Officer Nielson\u2019s initial approach was consensual and that he did not seize Bandy until after he discovered that Bandy was trespassing. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cIn order for a seizure to occur, an individual must be under some physical restraint by an officer or have submitted to the show of police authority.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 49, 54, 480 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1997) <em>{en </em>banc). \u201cThere is no \u2018litmus test\u2019 for determining whether an encounter is consensual or constitutes an illegal seizure. If, however, a reasonable person would not feel free to decline an officer\u2019s requests or would not feel free to leave, the encounter is not consensual and constitutes an illegal seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 28, 32, 581 S.E.2d 206, 209 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Various factors have been identified as relevant in determining whether a seizure has occurred, including the threatening presence of a number of police officers, the display of weapons by officers, physical contact between an officer and a citizen, an officer\u2019s language or tone of voice compelling compliance, the retention of documents requested by an officer, and whether a citizen was told that he or she was free to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Id. </em>Ultimately, \u201c[t]he decision whether the encounter was consensual must be made based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In light of all of the surrounding circumstances, it is apparent that Officer Nielson\u2019s initial interaction with Bandy was consensual. Officer Nielson made no show of force or authority and did not physically restrain Bandy. Officer Nielson approached Bandy and asked to speak with him. Bandy agreed, saying \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d The officers\u2019 patrol car was parked a block away without its lights on. Bandy was not surrounded by several police officers. Neither of the officers displayed their weapon or physically touched Bandy during the initial interaction. Nothing about Officer Nielson\u2019s initial approach would make a reasonable person conclude that they were not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The consensual nature of the encounter changed, however, when Officer Nielson told Bandy that he needed to pat him down. At that point, no reasonable person would have felt free to leave. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 782, 790, 595 S.E.2d 30, 34 (2004) (holding that a seizure had occurred when the officer \u201cexplained that he intended to pat down\u201d a suspect because, \u201cat this point, a reasonable person would not believe he could ignore the officer\u2019s requests and walk away\u201d). However, the fact that the encounter ceased to be consensual does not necessarily invalidate Officer Nielson\u2019s actions. \u201cAn officer may conduct a pat-down search for weapons if the officer can point to specific and articulable facts which reasonably lead him to believe criminal activity may be afoot and the person subjected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>search may be armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Lowe v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 656, 660-61, 536 S.E.2d 454, 456-57 (2000). By the time Officer Nielson seized Bandy, he had reasonable suspicion that Bandy had committed a crime and that Bandy was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Aside from Officer Nielson\u2019s drug-related suspicions arising out of Bandy\u2019s association with Mitchell, Officer Nielson had reasonable suspicion that Bandy was trespassing. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-119, it is a crime to \u201cgo[ ] upon ... the lands, buildings or premises of another, or any portion or area thereof ... after having been forbidden to do so by a sign or signs.\u201d At the time of the encounter, Bandy was on the property of the Newport News Housing Authority. Officer Nielson testified that there are \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs throughout the neighborhood and that the Newport News police have the authority to enforce trespassing in that neighborhood. When asked whom he was visiting in Harbor Homes, Bandy was unable to give a name or address and gave \u201cextremely evasive\u201d answers. Bandy was \u201cunable to point out a particular location in which he was even attempting to go.\u201d In light of Bandy\u2019s evasive and inconsistent answers and inability to provide a legitimate reason for his presence in Harbor Homes, it was reasonable for Officer Nielson to suspect that Bandy was trespassing. Because Officer Nielson had reasonable suspicion that Bandy was committing a crime, he was within his authority to seize Bandy for an investigative detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Officer Nielson also had reason to believe that Bandy was armed and dangerous. Bandy was trespassing in a \u201chigh-drug, high-crime\u201d area of Newport News, and Bandy\u2019s companion had just been seen throwing a bag of cocaine into a bush. Courts have often recognized that \u201c\u2018the connection between illegal drug operations and guns is a tight one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Grogins, </em>163 F.3d 795, 799 (4th Cir.1998)). As Officer Nielson spoke to him, Bandy appeared \u201crather nervous.\u201d Bandy \u201cwas fidgeting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>shifting back and forth his weight on his feet. His hands clinging to his pockets.\u201d He continuously shifted his eyes and looked around, an action that Officer Nielson recognized as a \u201ctypical indicator of either flight or suspicious behavior.\u201d As the two men spoke, Bandy put his hands in his pockets. Officer Nielson asked him to remove his hands, explaining that \u201cit was an officer safety issue.\u201d Bandy removed his hands from his pockets, \u201cbut he still kept moving around motioning his hands up to his pockets.\u201d Bandy then put his hands in his pockets a second time, despite Officer Nielson\u2019s instructions not to. At that point Officer Nielson had reason to believe that Bandy might have a weapon in his pocket and was preparing to use it. Bandy\u2019s nervousness, his inability to explain his presence on private property, his association with a man carrying cocaine, and his repeated motions toward his pocket made it reasonable for Officer Nielson to believe that Bandy was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Because Officer Nielson had reasonable suspicion that Bandy was committing a crime and was armed and dangerous, his decision to seize and frisk Bandy, as he investigated his suspicions, did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\n<em>B. The Scope of the Frisk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Bandy also claims that Officer Nielson exceeded the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk by patting his thigh twice and by doing so with spread fingers. Bandy argues that Officer Nielson impermissibly manipulated the items in Bandy\u2019s pocket because his spread fingers caused the items to separate when he patted them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Once a frisk is justified, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to undertake \u201ca carefully limited search of the outer clothing ... in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>892 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u201cThe purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence----\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). Such searches are \u201climited in scope to this protective purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 373, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993), the Supreme Court of the United States addressed \u201cwhether police officers may seize nonthreatening contraband detected during a protective pat-down search of the sort permitted by <em>Terry.\u201d </em>The Court decided that \u201cthe answer is clearly that they may, so long as the officers\u2019 search stays within the bounds marked by <em>Terry.\u201d Id. </em>It reasoned that \u201cif a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 113 S.Ct. at 2137.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In <em>Dickerson, </em>an officer initiated a valid <em>Terry </em>frisk. During the pat down, the officer felt \u201ca small lump\u201d in the suspect\u2019s jacket, and, after examining it with his fingers, concluded that the lump was crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 113 S.Ct. at 2133. The officer reached into the suspect\u2019s jacket and retrieved the item. The Court held that the officer exceeded the scope of a valid <em>Terry </em>frisk, noting that the officer \u201cmade no claim that he suspected this object to be a weapon\u201d when he felt it under the suspect\u2019s jacket. <em>Id. </em>at 378, 113 S.Ct. at 2138. The Court explained, \u201cthe officer\u2019s own testimony belies any notion that he \u2018immediately\u2019 recognized the lump as crack cocaine. Rather, ... the officer determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that the lump was contraband only after squeezing, sliding, and otherwise manipulating the contents of the defendant\u2019s pocket\u2014a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that where a \u201cprotective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 113 S.Ct. at 2136.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Bandy seizes upon the \u201csqueezing, sliding, and otherwise manipulating\u201d language from <em>Dickerson, </em>and argues that, by keeping his fingers spread, Officer Nielson impermissibly manipulated the items in Bandy\u2019s pocket. However, Bandy\u2019s argument is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of <em>Dickerson. Dickerson </em>does not stand for the principle that an officer may never squeeze, slide or manipulate items felt during a pat down. The purpose of a pat down is to protect the officer during a <em>Terry </em>stop by allowing him to determine whether the suspect is concealing a weapon. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. \u201cSuch searches necessarily involve a certain amount of \u2018squeezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating\u2019 of a suspect\u2019s outer clothing, in an attempt to discern whether weapons are hidden underneath.\u201d <em>United States v. Yamba, </em>506 F.3d 251, 258 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 378, 113 S.Ct. at 2138). The manipulation of an item under a suspect\u2019s clothing is only unlawful if the officer \u201cgoes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed.\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 373, 113 S.Ct. at 2136; <em>see also Hayes v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 647, 660, 514 S.E.2d 357, 363 (1999) (\u201cThe officer may not engage in \u2018squeezing,\u2019 \u2018sliding\u2019 or \u2018otherwise manipulating\u2019 the item <em>once he has concluded it is not a weapon.\u201d </em>(quoting <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 378, 113 S.Ct. at 2138) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The crux of any analysis of whether an officer exceeds the scope of a <em>Terry </em>\u201cfrisk\u201d is simply whether the actions of the frisking officer go beyond the basic determination of whether a suspect is armed. If the officer\u2019s actions are reasonably calculated to determine whether the suspect possesses a weapon, then the pat down is constitutionally proper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Conversely, the officer exceeds the constitutional constraints of a <em>Terry </em>frisk if he is trying to determine, through his sense of touch, the nature or identity of an object he knows cannot be a weapon. Here, Officer Nielson did not go beyond what was necessary to determine whether Bandy was armed. Officer Nielson testified extensively as to what measures he takes during a pat down to ensure that a suspect is not armed. He explained that, during a pat down, he uses his open hand to feel \u201cevery single portion\u201d of the person\u2019s body. In order to accomplish that, he has to pat each thigh twice, once from the front and once from the rear. Without patting the thigh twice, he would not be able to feel the entire thigh and could not adequately determine whether the suspect is armed. Officer Nielson also explained that, during a pat down, he keeps his fingers spread, in order to better identify any objects that he might feel under a suspect\u2019s clothing, including weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Officer Nielson frisked Bandy, as he does all suspects, by using his open hand to pat every portion of Bandy\u2019s body. His pat down was properly directed at making sure that Bandy was not armed. Officer Nielson did not focus his frisk on Bandy\u2019s thigh and, in feeling Bandy\u2019s thigh, did not use his hands differently than he did in feeling the rest of Bandy\u2019s body. The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Officer Nielson\u2019s frisk was limited in scope to its proper purpose: the discovery of weapons. He paid no greater attention to Bandy\u2019s thigh than was necessary to rule out the presence of a weapon. There was simply \u201cno invasion of [Bandy\u2019s] privacy beyond that already authorized by [Officer Nielson\u2019s] search for weapons.\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 375, 113 S.Ct. at 2137. Thus, the frisk did not exceed its proper constitutional scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that Officer Nielson\u2019s seizure of Bandy did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that the frisk did not exceed its permissible scope. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>we hold that the trial court did not err by denying Bandy\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">. Bandy does not argue that Officer Nielson did not ultimately have probable cause to believe that the \"hard, rocky\u201d items in his pocket were cocaine. <em>See, e.g. Cost v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 246, 253-54, 657 S.E.2d 505, 508-09 (2008) (holding that an officer lacked probable cause to recover capsules from a suspect's pocket following a pat down, where the illegal character of capsules \"could not have been immediately apparent\u201d from the pat down because the capsules \"may just as well be a legal medication dispensed in capsule form [rather than] a capsule containing an illegal drug\u201d). He merely claims that the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of the items was not immediately apparent because Officer Nielson could not identify the items after the first pat.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
