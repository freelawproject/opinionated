MILLETTE, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Jason William Anderson (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-22 and 18.2-58, robbery with the use of a gun or a simulated gun in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. On appeal, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, arguing the Commonwealth failed to establish that violence or intimidation was used to accomplish an unlawful taking, failed to establish specific intent to commit robbery, and failed to establish conspiracy to commit robbery. Finding insufficient evidence for a robbery conviction, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery, as there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding of guilt, and remand for a new sentencing proceeding on conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">On November 18, 2006, appellant and Edward Rinehart (Rinehart), employees of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (Dick\u2019s), were on duty. Appellant called Corey Edwards (Edwards), also a Dick\u2019s employee, in the morning and said \u201cit was time,\u201d there was \u201cenough money, and ... [Edwards] should come get it.\u201d Edwards told appellant he was sleeping and to call him later. Approximately one to one and a half hours later, appellant called Edwards again and said they had an hour to rob Dick\u2019s. Edwards recruited Noel McBride (McBride) to simulate a holdup at the cash register manned by appellant. McBride entered Dick\u2019s wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a bandana over his face. McBride made eye contact with Rinehart, turned his back to Rinehart, then walked sideways to the cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>register. McBride, with his back still to Rinehart, drew an air pistol from his waistband, pointed it at appellant, and demanded cash from the register. Appellant put cash into a shopping bag and handed it to McBride, after which McBride immediately exited Dick\u2019s. During the commission of the feigned holdup, Rinehart walked towards McBride until he saw McBride brandish the gun. At that point, Rinehart halted and stood approximately 15 feet behind McBride, with a children\u2019s baseball bat display separating them. Rinehart did not move from that position until after the hold up was completed, and McBride never turned back around towards Rinehart nor did he point the air pistol at anyone but appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Trial was held on March 28, 2007. At trial, Edwards testified that he and appellant \u201chad talked previously about possibly robbing Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\u201d Edwards further testified that about a week or two prior to November 18, 2006, he spoke with appellant and McBride together about carrying out a robbery of Dick\u2019s. Edwards had also spoken with appellant alone about robbing Dick\u2019s. When asked whether their plans involved the use of a gun, Edwards testified: \u201c[Appellant] said that it would be easy. We could go in there, just show them the gun, and it would be simple as one, two, three to threaten somebody and get us some money.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of Edwards continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">[Commonwealth\u2019s attorney] Okay. And did you\u2014At that time you\u2019re talking about this did you or [appellant] talk about where a gun might be obtained or what kind of gun would be used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">[Edwards] He said he could get one from a friend----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">[Commonwealth\u2019s attorney] When you were talking about this, were you talking about a look-alike gun or a real gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">[Edwards] No. A real gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">[Commonwealth\u2019s attorney] A real gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">[Edwards] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The trial judge found appellant was involved in a conspiracy to commit robbery, stating, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there was a conspiracy to rob Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge also found appellant guilty of robbery -with the use of a gun or a simulated gun and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">When considering sufficiency claims on appeal, this Court \u201creviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). \u201c[W]e \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence\u2019 to support it.\u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 746, 595 S.E.2d 9, 12 (2004) (quoting <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In Virginia, robbery is a common law crime proscribed statutorily by Code \u00a7 18.2-58 and defined as the \u201c \u2018taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, <em>by violence or intimidation.\u2019 \u201d Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 524, 659 S.E.2d 311, 319 (2008) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 528, 532, 138 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1964)) (emphasis added). The act of violence or intimidation must precede, or be concomitant with, the taking. <em>Bivins v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 752, 454 S.E.2d 741, 742 (1995). To sustain a robbery conviction, force or intimidation must be <em>directed at the person of the victim. Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 443, 449, 592 S.E.2d 400, 403 (2004); <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 590, 595, 347 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1986) (\u201cThe focus must be upon the actions directed toward <em>the person </em>robbed. The offense of robbery requires a theft and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>force or intimidation directed against a custodian of personal property.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">Intimidation is defined as \u201cunlawful coercion; extortion; duress; putting in fear.\u201d \u201cTo take or attempt to take, \u2018by intimidation\u2019 means willfully to take, or attempt to take, by putting in fear of bodily harm.\u201d Intimidation results when the words or conduct of the accused exercise such domination and control over the victim as to overcome the victim\u2019s mind and overbear the victim\u2019s will, placing the victim in fear of bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Bivins, </em>19 Va.App. at 752-53, 454 S.E.2d at 742 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">[W]here the victim\u2019s fear results from the taking itself, the taking is not accomplished through intimidation. The crime committed is larceny, not robbery. Whether the subjective fear induced by the accused\u2019s actions facilitated the taking or merely resulted from the taking will depend on the facts of the individual case. The intent of the accused, if it is merely to take, while not determinative, is a factor in this calculus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 454 S.E.2d at 743 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The taking in this case was not accomplished by violence or intimidation directed at Rinehart, who the Commonwealth alleges to be the victim. Rinehart testified that McBride\u2019s only contact with him was brief eye contact, which occurred before McBride arrived at the cash register and brandished the gun. Thereafter, McBride remained with his back to Rinehart without even so much as a glance over his shoulder in Rinehart\u2019s direction. McBride did not point the air gun towards Rinehart. Rinehart testified that when McBride pulled the gun out of his waistband, Rinehart \u201cstopped right where [he] was,\u201d approximately 15 feet behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>McBride, \u201c[b]ecause there was a weapon involved\u201d and its presence gave him some concern. When McBride exited Dick\u2019s, Rinehart \u201cfollowed at a safe distance\u201d to keep an eye on McBride while Rinehart was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. It is clear from the record that Rinehart\u2019s subjective fear induced by McBride\u2019s actions did not <em>facilitate </em>the taking, but merely <em>resulted from </em>the taking. <em>Id. </em>at 754, 454 S.E.2d at 743. No force or intimidation was <em>directed at </em>Rinehart\u2019s person. <em>Spencer, </em>42 Va.App. at 449, 592 S.E.2d at 403. Although the Commonwealth contends Rinehart was a custodian of the property of Dick\u2019s, Rinehart was never at the cash register or otherwise in a location where the property would be taken from his person or in his presence. In each case cited by the Commonwealth where a robbery conviction was upheld, violence or intimidation was directed at the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As no violence or intimidation was directed at Rinehart to accomplish the taking, appellant\u2019s conviction for robbery is unfounded. We therefore reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for robbery with the use of a gun or a simulated gun and, finding no robbery, we likewise reverse his conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>However, there is ample support in the record for the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant conspired to rob Dick\u2019s, notwithstanding his failure to carry out a robbery. When there is evidence to support a conviction, this Court must not substitute its own judgment for that of the fact finder, even if we might have reached a different conclusion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 466, 507 S.E.2d 72, 72 (1998). We must instead ask whether \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u2018\u201cConspiracy requires ... (1) an agreement between two or more persons, which constitutes the act; and (2) an intent thereby to achieve a certain objective[,] either an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charity v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 581, 586, 643 S.E.2d 503, 505 (2007) (quoting <em>Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 347, 619 S.E.2d 80, 87 (2005)). When the parties <em>agree </em>to commit an offense, they have committed the crime of conspiracy, regardless of whether an act in furtherance of the underlying crime has been performed. <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 675, 680, 537 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The evidence showed that Edwards and appellant agreed to rob Dick\u2019s and had discussed how to accomplish the robbery on several occasions. Edwards specifically testified that appellant said \u201c[they] could go in [Dick\u2019s], just show <em>them </em>the gun, and it would be simple as one, two, three to <em>threaten somebody and get us some money.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Edwards\u2019 testimony was sufficient proof of an explicit agreement between Edwards and appellant to carry out a taking of Dick\u2019s property, with the intent to steal, and to do so by violence or intimidation directed at whomever might pose an obstacle to the taking. Based on this evidence, a rational fact finder could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of a conspiracy between Edwards and appellant to rob Dick\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>robbery. We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery and remand for sentencing on conspiracy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed and dismissed in part, and remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. The trial judge did not find appellant to be a credible witness: \"So from everything I've heard, I just do not place a lot of credibility in [appellant\u2019s] testimony....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">. On brief, the Commonwealth acknowledged that \"[appellant] may be correct that the 'intimidation that must be proved to sustain a conviction for robbery must be directed at the person of the victim,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Winn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 179, 182, 462 S.E.2d 911, 912 (1995)), but contends that such intimidation is present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 284, 286, 591 S.E.2d 68, 70 (2004) (defendant pointed a firearm at victim when victim tried to thwart the taking and said, \"You better back ... off me.\u201d); <em>see also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 495, 211 S.E.2d 71 (1975) (defendant, armed with a pistol, seized victim and forced her to the cashier's office, then down to the floor at gunpoint); <em>Seaton, </em>42 Va.App. at 743, 595 S.E.2d at 11 (defendant approached victim and said, \"This is a bank robbery. Give me all your money,\u201d then warned victim \"had ten seconds to put the money in the bag,\u201d creating a situation described by a witness as \"very intimidating.\u201d); <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 254, 516 S.E.2d 684 (1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(defendant pointed a gun at victim while confederate conducted a \"patdown\u201d of victim); <em>Waters v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 133, 510 S.E.2d 262 (1999) (defendant, wielding a knife, ordered victim to move to the rear of the restaurant and, holding the knife close to another person, forced victim into a closet); <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 590, 347 S.E.2d 152 (1986) (defendant, with a handgun drawn, ordered one victim to put cash from a register into a bag and another victim to hand over money from his pockets, then ordered both to an office where one victim was further ordered to open a safe and put its contents in the bag).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b556-16\">. The sentencing order imposed \"[\u00a1Incarceration in the Virginia Department of Corrections for the term of: 5 years on the charge on [sic] Conspiracy, 7 years on the charge of Robbery with Use of a Gun or Simulated Gun, and 3 years on the charge of Use of A Firearm in the Commission of A Felony.\u201d The trial court conditionally suspended all but three years of the sentences, without specifying the charge(s) to which the suspension applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">The appropriate sentence for appellant's conspiracy conviction is unclear considering the reversal of the robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery convictions, and the vagueness of the sentencing order.
