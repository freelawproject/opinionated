At the time of trial, the putative firearm was in the possession of the Virginia Department of Forensic Science. After Copeland\u2019s conviction became final, DFS issued a certificate of analysis which, both Copeland and the Commonwealth agree, made factual findings that excluded the item tested from the statutory definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). <em>See Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 127, 131, 607 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2005) (defining \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 to include only weapons \u201cdesigned, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Based upon the after-discovered DFS certificate of analysis, Copeland filed a petition for actual innocence under Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10, <em>et seq. </em>To succeed, Copeland must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, among other things, the after-discovered information was \u201cpreviously unknown or unavailable to the petitioner or his trial attorney of record at the time the conviction became final in the circuit court,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(iv), and that neither he nor his trial counsel could have discovered this information \u201cby the exercise of diligence,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vi).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After conducting his own evaluation of the facts, the Attorney General concedes Copeland has met his burden of proof and affirmatively joins in Copeland\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We have no obligation to accept concessions of error, <em>see United States v. Hairston, 522 </em>F.3d 336, 340 (4th Cir.2008) (recognizing \u201cthe government\u2019s concession of error is not binding on this court\u201d), and, to be sure, we would never do so if the issue were a pure question of law, <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cOur fidelity to the uniform application of law pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>eludes us from accepting concessions of law made on appeal. Because the law applies to all alike, it cannot be subordinated to the private opinions of litigants.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such hesitation is particularly appropriate here given the need to ensure that the writ of actual innocence does not evolve into an omnibus substitute for the carefully crafted procedures of the habeas corpus writ, Code \u00a7 8.01-654, <em>et seq., </em>or impinge upon the Governor\u2019s exclusive power over executive clemency, Code \u00a7 53.1-229, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Having independently examined the record presented to us, we conclude the unique circumstances of this case make it prudent to accept the Attorney General\u2019s concession without \u201cfurther development of the facts\u201d under Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12. Accordingly, we grant the requested writ of actual innocence and vacate Copeland\u2019s conviction for possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). We further remand this matter to the circuit court with instructions to enter an order of expungement pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>Writ granted, conviction vacated, and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">. <em>See also Kingsbur v.

We analogize the Attorney General\u2019s position in this case to a confession of error sometimes submitted on direct appellate review. In such cases, as here, the \"public trust reposed in the law enforcement officers of the Government requires that they be quick to confess error when, in their opinion, a miscarriage of justice may result from their remaining silent.\u201d <em>Young v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 257, 258, 62 S.Ct. 510, 511, 86 L.Ed. 832 (1942). Even so, \"such a confession does not relieve this Court of the performance of the judicial function. The considered judgment of the law enforcement officers that reversible error has been committed is entitled to great weight, but our judicial obligations compel us to examine independently the errors confessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 62 S.Ct. at 511; <em>see also Gibson v.
