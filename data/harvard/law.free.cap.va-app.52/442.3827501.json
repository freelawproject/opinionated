Pilson was sentenced to one year of active incarceration pursuant to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence required by Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3) (applicable to second or subsequent offenses).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied Pilson\u2019s request to place him on home electronic monitoring in lieu of the one-year period of mandatory incarceration. Pilson also asked the sentencing court to \u201clet the sheriff impose\u201d home electronic monitoring if the court could not itself do so. The court likewise denied this request. \u201cWhile it is true that the sheriff can impose it on his own,\u201d the court stated from the bench, \u201cit is the court\u2019s opinion that he cannot do so when there is a mandatory minimum term of incarceration\u201d required by statute. In its sentencing order, however, the court narrowed its holding on this point. The order stated that \u201cthe Court did not have the authority to <em>authorize </em>the Sheriff\u201d to admit Pilson into the home electronic monitoring program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>J.A. at 35 (emphasis added). The court then released Pilson on an appeal bond. He has remained free on bond since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On appeal, Pilson argues that the sentencing court erred (i). by refusing to order that his one-year mandatory minimum sentence be suspended on condition that he participate in a home electronic monitoring program, and (ii) by \u201cprohibiting\u201d the sheriff from exercising any independent authority he might have to place Pilson in such a program. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We can summarily address Pilson\u2019s first argument. The sentencing court correctly held it had no authority to place Pilson on home electronic monitoring in lieu of his one-year mandatory minimum period of incarceration. \u201cBecause the one-year mandatory minimum sentence under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) may not be suspended, probation may not be imposed during this period and, thus, electronic incarceration pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2 may not be employed.\u201d <em>Cuffee-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 476, 483, 574 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">As for Pilson\u2019s second argument, we believe it overstates what the sentencing court actually held. Because a \u201ccircuit court speaks only through its orders,\u201d <em>Roe v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 453, 458, 628 S.E.2d 526, 529 (2006), we look to the sentencing order\u2014not the court\u2019s remark from the bench\u2014to discern its holding. The sentencing order did not <em>prohibit </em>the sheriff from considering home electronic monitoring. Instead, the order merely refused to <em>authorize </em>the sheriff to do so. By putting it that way, the court did nothing more than recognize how the statute subdivides decisionmaking authority. Subsection A of Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2 governs the sentencing court\u2019s authority to place a defendant on home electronic monitoring. Subsection C governs the sheriffs authority to do the same. As an independent constitutional officer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the sheriffs authority under subsection C does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>depend upon prior authorization from the sentencing order. Whatever authority the sheriff may have, it comes not from the sentencing order but from subsection C of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">It is true that, if the sentencing court disagrees with the sheriff\u2019s decision to place an offender in the home electronic monitoring program, the court retains \u201cauthority to <em>remove </em>the offender\u201d from the program. Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(0) (emphasis added). In our case, however, Pilson did not go to jail following his sentencing hearing. Nothing in the record suggests that Pilson ever asked the sheriff to release him under the supervision of the home electronic monitoring program. Thus, the sheriff has never had an opportunity to decide whether he has statutory authority under Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(C) to place Pilson\u2014an inmate serving a mandatory, minimum sentence\u2014into the home electronic monitoring program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Nor has the sheriff decided, assuming he has such authority, whether Pilson would be an appropriate candidate to be released from jail into the program. This discretionary decision would require consideration of Pilson\u2019s prior criminal record which includes, among other things, convictions for failure to appear, felonious escape, eluding police, resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, escape from custody, hit and run, assault and battery, destroying private property, trespass, breaking and entering, unlawful wounding, drunk driving, drunk in public, curse and abuse, several grand and petit larcenies, and various probation violations. Perhaps the sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>iff might nonetheless find it in the public\u2019s interest to release Pilson. We are reluctant to offer a prediction one way or another. As Pilson\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument on appeal: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can speculate as to whether or not the sheriff would or would not\u201d because \u201cquite frankly, that issue has not been put before the sheriff as to Mr. Pilson himself.\u201d Oral Argument at 1:58 (July 3, 2008). We could not agree more.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Given these circumstances, we view the trial court\u2019s remark from the bench (concluding the sheriff had no independent authority) as an opinion on a hypothetical question not ripe for decision. For us to answer that question favorably to Pilson\u2014by holding that the sheriff has authority to do under Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(C) what a sentencing court cannot do under Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(A)\u2014we would essentially be issuing an advisory appellate opinion reversing an advisory trial court opinion. This we cannot do. \u201cAdvisory opinions represent an attenuate exercise of judicial power,\u201d Va. <em>State Police v. Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. 551, 553, 633 S.E.2d 203, 204 (2006), one which we traditionally avoid in all but the most extenuating circumstances. None exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In sum, we find no error in the sentencing order, which we interpret as doing nothing more than recognizing the limitations imposed by <em>Cuffee-Smith </em>on the court\u2019s authority. Whether the sheriff has independent authority under Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2(0 to grant the relief Pilson seeks is a question to be answered if and when the sheriff decides to exercise that putative authority. Until then, the issue presents a purely hypothetical question not ripe for appellate adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\">.
