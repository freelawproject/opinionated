On appeal, he contends the trial court, by accepting an affidavit that he failed to register as a sex offender, violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process right of confrontation. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On March 15, 2005, appellant was convicted of failing to register as a violent sex offender in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1 and the trial court imposed, but suspended, a sentence, conditioned upon five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">On April 6, 2007, the trial court conducted a revocation hearing based on appellant\u2019s subsequent failure to register as a violent sex offender as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1. The only evidence of the violation was an affidavit subscribed and sworn to on May 4, 2006, by the custodian of records for the Sex Offender <em>&amp; </em>Crimes Against Minors Registry of the Virginia Department of State Police averring that appellant had not registered with the registry between November 18, 2005, and May 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The court found appellant had violated the terms of his probation, and by order dated April 13, 2007, the trial court revoked his probation, reinstated his previously suspended sentence, and re-suspended all but two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">On May 1, 2007, appellant filed a motion for rehearing contending he has a due process right of confrontation. The court vacated its April 13, 2007 order and conducted a hearing on the motion on June 29, 2007, at which time appellant argued he was deprived of his due process rights by not being able to cross-examine the affiant who had averred that appellant had not registered as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The trial court withheld its decision at the hearing, and by letter opinion dated July 18, 2007, opined that the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the affidavit \u201cdid not vitiate the due process guarantee of confrontation----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Appellant contends the admission of the state police affidavit as proof of his failure to register in the Sex Offender Registry violates his due process right of confrontation. The admissibility of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court, and we review its decisions only for abuse of discretion. <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). However, whether appellant\u2019s due process right of confrontation was violated is a question of law and is reviewed <em>de novo. Michels v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 465, 624 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">At the outset we note that both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have previously held that probation revocation hearings are not a stage of criminal prosecution and therefore a probationer is not entitled to the same due process protections afforded a defendant in a criminal prosecution. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 84, 402 S.E.2d 684, 686 (1991); <em>see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759-60, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2599-2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). We acknowledge that appellant does not maintain that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in order to understand the Fourteenth Amendment due process right to confrontation, we must begin with a review of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\"><em>Morrissey </em>affords a probationer a due process right to \u201cconfront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. However, there is no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>to confrontation or to cross-examination contained within the text of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, we look to the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation for guidance in understanding the due process right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The seminal case on Sixth Amendment confrontation, <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), held that the Confrontation Clause applies to testimonial hearsay and in order for such hearsay to be admissible, the witness must be unavailable and the accused must have had an opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1373-74. The Court noted that the Confrontation Clause targeted a specific \u201cevil,\u201d namely the \u201ccivil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 124 S.Ct. at 1362-63. The Court reasoned that the Confrontation Clause protects against \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements because, it only \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (quoting 2 N. Webster, <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1828)). In a concurring opinion, then Chief Justice Rehnquist opined that some hearsay exceptions, such as \u201cbusiness records and official records\u201d do not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 124 S.Ct. at 1378. <em>See also Jasper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 749, 754, 644 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2007) (holding the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation does not apply to business records).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In <em>Michels, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 624 S.E.2d 675, we found no error in the admissibility of a certificate from the Secretary of the State of Delaware concerning the absence of corporate registration. We held the certificates were \u201cnot testimonial for two primary reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 624 S.E.2d at 680. First,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">the certificates are not by their nature accusatory and do not describe any criminal wrongdoing of appellant. Rather they are a neutral repository of information that reflects the objective results of a search of public records.... [They] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>certif[y] that a search has been conducted and particular records do not exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 469-70, 624 S.E.2d at 680. Second,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0-\">the documents do not resemble <em>ex parte </em>communications, \u201cthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363-64____ While the certificates were requested by a law enforcement officer, the reports were prepared in a non-adversarial setting in which \u201cthe factors likely to cloud the perception of an official engaged in the more traditional law enforcement functions of observation and investigation of crime are simply not present.\u201d <em>[State v.] Dedman, </em>136 N.M. 561, 102 P.3d [628], 635 [(2004)]. The Delaware Secretary of State was not asked questions regarding appellant nor was she probed for information about appellant based on her personal knowledge. Rather, an officer requested that she prepare a document certifying the results of a routine search of business records, as is done for any number of reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"><em>Michels, </em>47 Va.App. at 469-70, 624 S.E.2d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">In <em>Jasper, </em>49 Va.App. 749, 644 S.E.2d 406, the challenged document was the defendant\u2019s Division of Motor Vehicles driving transcript. We concluded that the transcript \u201cwas generated as a result of a request by law enforcement personnel for a search of certain public records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 644 S.E.2d at 411. \u201c[T]he person completing the certification was the custodian of the records searched, and the underlying records were not created in anticipation of the litigation in which a summary of their contents was offered into evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We found no violation of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">As in <em>Jasper </em>and <em>Michels, </em>the affidavit in question here is a \u201cdoeument[ ] establishing the existence or absence of some objective fact, rather than detailing the criminal wrongdoing of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 644 S.E.2d at 410. It was prepared in a non-adversarial setting, is not \u201caccusatory,\u201d and it was not prepared in anticipation of litigation. The sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>offender registry is a \u201cneutral repository of information that reflects the objective results of a search of public records.\u201d <em>Michels, </em>47 Va.App. at 469, 624 S.E.2d at 680. The information contained in the affidavit simply summarizes the official registry of the Department of State Police, such registry being mandated by Code \u00a7 19.2-390.1. We find no meaningful distinction between the affidavit at issue here and the documents in <em>Jasper </em>and <em>Michels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In addition, we note that the affidavit falls within the official records exception to the hearsay rule, which is a firmly-established exception to hearsay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 643, 654, 587 S.E.2d 749, 754 (2003). \u201c \u2018The underlying rationale which justifies admitting facts contained in official records as an exception to the hearsay rule is that the concern for reliability is largely obviated because the nature and source of the evidence enhance the prospect of its trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 309, 311, 391 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1990) (quoting <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 335, 338, 338 S.E.2d 657, 658-59 (1986)). Thus, we conclude that the information contained in the affidavit is reliable as an official record.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">We now turn to whether introduction of the affidavit at the probation revocation hearing violated appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights. As previously noted, a probationer is not entitled to the same due process protections afforded a defendant in a criminal prosecution. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>a court may not summarily revoke a previously suspended sentence without notice, hearing, and benefit of counsel. <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 754, 756, 419 S.E.2d 294, 295 (1992). The Court in <em>Morrissey </em>applied due process protections to parole revocation proceedings, stating that minimum due process requirements include: (1) written notice; (2) disclosure of the evidence against the accused; (3) an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence and witnesses; (4) an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses; (5) a \u201cneutral and detached\u201d hearing body; and (6) a written statement as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole. <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Procedural protections were extended to probation revocations in <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. at 782, 93 S.Ct. at 1759-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 518, 525, 651 S.E.2d 403, 406 (2007), <em>petition for appeal granted, </em>No. 072342 (Va. Sup.Ct. Order of Feb. 28, 2008). Specifically, the United States Supreme Court has stated that in revocation hearings \u201cformal procedures and rules of evidence are not employed,\u201d <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. at 789, 93 S.Ct. at 1763, and that the process of revocation hearings \u201cshould be flexible enough to consider evidence ... that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial,\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Thus, hearsay evidence, which would normally be inadmissible in a criminal trial, may be admitted into evidence in a revocation hearing based on the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">While in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony, we emphasize that we did not in <em>Morrissey </em>intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony, including affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Scarpelli </em>411 U.S. at 782 n. 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1760 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Clearly, the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is a more rigorous right than the due process requirement in a revocation context because a revocation hearing is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d and the full panoply of rights due a defendant \u201cdoes not apply to [probation] revocation.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2599-2600. We concluded in <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">In revocation hearings \u201cformal procedures and rules of evidence are not employed,\u201d and that the process of revocation hearings \u201cshould be flexible enough to consider evidence ... that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Davis, </em>12 Va.App. at 84, 402 S.E.2d at 686 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We find <em>Davis </em>is instructive. There, appellant was instructed to reside in West Virginia with his family as a condition of his probation. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 402 S.E.2d at 685. The probation officer testified at his revocation hearing that Davis never reported to his assigned parole officer in West Virginia and that there was an outstanding Virginia Parole Board warrant for his arrest. <em>Id. </em>Among other things, the officer also notified the court that the Manassas Police Department informed her that Davis had been residing in Prince William County where there were outstanding warrants for his arrest. <em>Id. </em>Davis objected to the probation officer\u2019s hearsay testimony. We found that while part of the probation officer\u2019s testimony was \u201cbased on information provided to her by other governmental officials, ... the court may in its discretion admit such evidence in the relaxed process of a revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 402 S.E.2d at 686. The challenged hearsay that we approved in <em>Davis </em>is far less reliable than the contents of the affidavit at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">It is clear that appellant is entitled to some due process rights in his revocation hearing. We conclude that appellant was afforded all of the due process guarantees contemplated by <em>Morrissey, Scarpelli, </em>and subsequent jurisprudence generated by the holdings of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Appellant urges that we adopt the balancing test as set forth in a number of federal circuit court cases, which weighs the defendant\u2019s interest in confrontation against the reliability of the questioned evidence. <em>See U.S. v. Palmer, </em>463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>F.Supp.2d 551 (E.D.Va.2006). We find no need to embrace this balancing test since the reliability of official records has long been established. <em>Owens, </em>10 Va.App. at 311, 391 S.E.2d at 607. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held hearsay evidence is admissible in probation revocation hearings if it is sufficiently reliable. <em>United States v. McCallum, </em>677 F.2d 1024 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Department of State Police affidavit. We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\">. The Sixth Amendment right is limited to \"criminal prosecutions,\u201d and a revocation hearing is not a \"criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2599-2600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">.
