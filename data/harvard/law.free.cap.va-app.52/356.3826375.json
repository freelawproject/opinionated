Father argues that (1) the trial court did not adequately communicate the basis of its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>either orally or in writing, as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3, and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that awarding primary physical custody to mother was in J.H.\u2019s best interests. For the following reasons, we agree with father that the trial court did not sufficiently communicate the basis of its decision to the parties. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On appeal, we must view the evidence, and all reasonable inferences flowing from the evidence, in a light most favorable to mother as the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to \u2018discard the evidence\u2019 of [father] which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by [mother] at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002)). So viewed, the evidence proved the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Mother and father began dating in 1998. J.H. was born in 2002. Mother and father never married, and father ended the relationship after learning that mother was pregnant. Mother also has a son and a daughter from previous relationships. Her son was a fifteen-year-old high school student at the time of trial, and her daughter was a twenty-year-old student at Old Dominion University. Both children love their younger half-brother J.H., and they all have a close relationship with their mother. In the fall of 2002, mother began dating another man who was married at the time, but was already separated from his wife with a divorce pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The parties\u2019 relationship began to deteriorate when J.H. was around one year old, and the relationship has remained hostile ever since. For example, father has made numerous allegations of child abuse against mother to Child Protective Services (\u201cCPS\u201d), none of which CPS has acted upon. Father has also been both physically and verbally abusive toward mother in the past. One particular flashpoint for hostilities between the parties has been when the parties meet to exchange J.H. In March 2005, mother and father were ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>changing J.H. at a convenience store, and a friend of father\u2019s was also present with his child. After receiving J.H., mother asked father to move his car so that she could leave. Father then placed J.H. in the back of his friend\u2019s car so that he might move his car. Mother then apparently phoned the police and reported that father was kidnapping J.H. Father called mother a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cwhore\u201d in front of J.H. and mother\u2019s other children, who were also present.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">On October 20, 2004, the Chesapeake Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (\u201cJ&amp;DR\u201d) entered an order establishing joint legal custody and shared physical custody of J.H. Prior to the entry of this order, there had been no formal custody arrangement, but J.H. had spent the majority of his time with mother. This order also directed the parties to seek parental counseling to attempt to resolve the difficulties between them. Mother was uncooperative in seeking counseling, and was held in contempt of court once for not cooperating with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In May 2005, the parties began seeing Richard Tavolucci (\u201cTavolucci\u201d), a parental counselor. Tavolucci stated that both mother and father were good parents and that the two should share joint physical custody equally, thereby minimizing the number of times the parties would exchange J.H. and ensuring that the two would have less opportunity for hostilities to ensue. J.H. reported to Tavolucci that he was \u201cterrified\u201d of returning to mother\u2019s house from father\u2019s because mother always spanked him, and had also punched him in the back on at least one occasion. When Tavolucci asked J.H. if father had hit him, J.H. replied that he had not, but that mother had told him to say that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In October 2005, mother also began taking J.H. to see Margaret McDowell (\u201cMcDowell\u201d), a licensed clinical social worker and \u201cplay therapist,\u201d who provided J.H. with dolls and other playthings to act out various scenarios from his life. McDowell opined that one parent should have primary custody because it was detrimental to J.H.\u2019s well-being to be equally exposed to two different parenting styles. Despite only meeting \"with father for one counseling session, McDowell suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ed that, based on her assessments, mother was the more \u201cnurturing\u201d and \u201cprotective\u201d parent and that J.H. had a greater emotional attachment to mother than to father. However, McDowell did not specifically recommend that mother have primary physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On March 22, 2006, in response to father\u2019s petition to modify custody, the J&amp;DR awarded joint legal and physical custody to mother and father, with each parent having two weeks of continuous physical custody. Mother appealed to the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake (\u201ctrial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">At trial <em>de novo </em>over three days in September and October 2006, the parties presented the evidence referenced above, and Tavolucci and McDowell both presented their above-referenced opinions. Mother and mother\u2019s older children all testified that since the beginning of the two-week continuous custody arrangement, J.H. had started to cry whenever he was preparing to go back to father\u2019s house. Various witnesses, including J.H.\u2019s teachers, testified that J.H.\u2019s behavior became more aggressive, including hitting other students and using profanity, after the imposition of the custody arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The trial court apparently found neither parent\u2019s accusations against the other parent to be credible, stating that \u201cif one of these parties had been bitten by a snake and the other party is coming towards them to cut the poison out, the parties would describe it as they tried to attack me with a knife and kill me.\u201d The court also found McDowell\u2019s opinion regarding J.H. more credible than Tavolucci\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The trial court did not make a ruling orally, but, after finding that a change of circumstances had occurred for J.H. since the custody order from October 2004, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Now we go to the factors contained in [Code \u00a7 ] 20-124.3, which delineates all the factors to determine what would be in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">\u00edj\u00ed ijj</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">You know, ... there\u2019s both good and bad that both mom and dad bring to the situation. So I think I\u2019m going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>make\u2014I\u2019ve made a lot of notes.... I\u2019ll go back and review those notes and get a decision out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">* * * * * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">It seems to the Court ... one of [the parties] will be the primary custodian and the other one will have a relationship as best [as possible] under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">On February 5, 2007, the trial court issued its ruling in a letter opinion, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">The Court finds that the age of [J.H.] (2 at the time of the initial order and close to the age to begin school now), the difficult relationship of the mother and father\u2014marked by constant distrust of each other, complete lack of cooperation between the two regarding any consistency in [J.H.]\u2019s development or schedule, and in the opinion of the Court no probability exists that mother and father will be able to communicate or cooperate in [J.H.]\u2019s rearing, establishes a change in circumstance. The Court also finds that because [J.H.] is displaying difficulties due to the inconsistent parenting practices of mother and father combined with their contempt of each other, that [J.H.]\u2019s best interest would be met by a change in the order of October 20, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">The Court then pursuant to Virginia Code Section 20-124.2[,] giving primary consideration to the child\u2019s best interest considered all factors contained in Code Section 20-124.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The trial court then awarded primary physical custody to mother and granted reasonable visitation rights to father. Father timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">I. Compliance with Code \u00a7 20-124.3</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">Father first argues that the trial court did not adequately communicate the basis of its custody award to the parties as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-124.3 lists ten factors a trial court must consider when deciding the best interests of a child for determining custody and visitation of a child. The statute concludes by directing that the trial court \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis of [its] decision either orally or in writing.\u201d We have interpreted this statute as \u201crequiring] the trial court to identify the fundamental, predominating reason or reasons underlying its decision.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 372-73, 585 S.E.2d 349, 353 (2003). \u2018While communicating the \u2018basis\u2019 of the decision does not rise to the level of providing comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, it does mean that the trial court must provide more to the parties than boilerplate language or a perfunctory statement that the statutory factors have been considered.\u201d <em>Lanzalotti v. Lanzalotti, </em>41 Va.App. 550, 555, 586 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2003). \u201c \u2018The trial court must provide a case-specific explanation (one that finds its contextual meaning from the evidence before the court) of the fundamental, predominating reason or reasons for the decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 373, 585 S.E.2d at 353). \u201cThe statute requires \u2018an express <em>communication </em>to the parties of the basis for its decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 373, 585 S.E.2d at 353) (emphasis in original). A trial court that \u201c \u2018fails to provide at least some of the steps in [its] thought process leaves [it]self open to the contention that [it] did not in fact consider the required factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 344, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986) (quoting <em>Campolattaro v. Campolattaro, </em>66 Md.App. 68, 502 A.2d 1068, 1075 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At the conclusion of trial, the trial court stated orally that it found McDowell, who recommended a primary caretaker and stated that mother was more \u201cnurturing\u201d than father, more credible than Tavolucci. However, this is a credibility determination by the trial court, and not a communication to the parties as to why it ruled as it did. At no point did the trial court state why placement with mother would be in J.H.\u2019s best interests, nor did it state why the factors contained in Code \u00a7 20-124.3 influenced its decision. In fact, the record clearly shows that the trial court had not yet reached a decision at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>In its subsequent letter opinion, the trial court found that a change of circumstances had occurred, due to the \u201cdifficult relationship of the mother and the father\u2014marked by constant distrust of each other, complete lack of cooperation between the two regarding any consistency in [J.H.j\u2019s development or schedule, and ... no probability exists that mother and father will be able to communicate or cooperate in [J.HJ\u2019s rearing[.]\u201d The trial court then stated: \u201cbecause [J.H.] is displaying difficulties due to the inconsistent parenting practices of mother and father combined with their contempt of each other, that [J.H.J\u2019s best interest would be met by a change in the order of October 20, 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Thus, the trial court found that a change of circumstances had occurred, but did not explain how the factors contained in Code \u00a7 20-124.3 applied to determine how the best interests of the child would be served by the specific change that it ordered. Although this is more than a mere \u201cperfunctory statement that the statutory factors have been considered[,]\u201d <em>Lanzalotti, </em>41 Va.App. at 555, 586 S.E.2d at 883, this statement fails to communicate a case-specific explanation as to why the best interests of J.H. favor placement with mother, rather than father. As such, we hold that the trial court did not sufficiently \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis of [its] decision either orally or in writing,\u201d as mandated by Code \u00a7 20-124.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Father next argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that awarding primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>physical custody of J.H. to mother was in J.H.\u2019s best interests. Having held that the trial court did not adequately communicate the basis of its decision to the parties as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3, we do not address the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 648 S.E.2d 314 (2007), we addressed Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F)\u2019s requirement that a trial court provide written findings and conclusions of law identifying the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) which support the trial court\u2019s decision on a spousal support award. In doing so, we discussed our previous holding in <em>Woolley. Woolley </em>held that \u201cwhen a trial court failed to make factual findings or present any explanation of the circumstances that influenced its decision regarding spousal support, we could examine the record to determine if the trial court\u2019s decision was supported by evidence relevant to the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. at 195, 648 S.E.2d at 317 (citing <em>Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. at 345, 349 S.E.2d at 427). However, as noted in <em>Robinson, </em>the General Assembly amended the statute in 1998 to require the trial court to make the written findings mentioned above. Because the statute as amended did not contain a provision permitting such review by us, and specifically required the trial court to make written findings stating the basis for its decision, we concluded that the statutory amendment superseded our earlier precedent allowing us to \u201cexamine the record to determine if the decision was supported by evidence relevant to the [statutory] factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. at 345, 349 S.E.2d at 427). Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the spousal support award based on the existing record. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 648 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The same rationale applies here in the context of Code \u00a7 20-124.3. In 1999, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 20-124.3 to require the trial court to \u201cstate the basis for the decision either orally or in writing.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 371, 585 S.E.2d at 352. Prior to this amendment, \u201cthe statute did not expressly require the trial court to elaborate on its findings or, for that matter, to provide any explanation for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This amendment, like that of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F), contains no provision permitting an appellate court to review the record for evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision if the trial court does not communicate the basis of its decision as required by the statute. Accordingly, we refrain from reviewing the record ourselves. Instead, we remand the case to the trial court for a reconsideration of its custody award based on the existing record. <em>See Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. at 196, 648 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Because the record before us does not indicate that the trial court adequately communicated the basis of its decision to the parties, we remand to the trial court for reconsideration of its custody award based consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">. At oral argument, counsel for the appellee asserted that subsequent to the issuance of the letter opinion, a hearing was held during which the circuit court supplemented the rationale for its decision. However, no transcript, written statement of facts, or supplemental order with respect to such hearing has been made a part of the record before us. It is the duty of the parties to provide us with a record sufficiently complete to support their legal arguments. <em>Haugen v. Shenandoah Valley Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>274 Va. 27, 42-43, 645 S.E.2d 261, 270 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
