HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">UPON A REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">This matter comes before the Court on a rehearing <em>en banc </em>following a divided panel opinion of this Court. Brian McKee (\u201chusband\u201d) appeals from a final decree of divorce, terminating his marriage to Barbara McKee (\u201cwife\u201d). He presents three issues for <em>en banc </em>review, all stemming from the circuit court\u2019s award of spousal support to wife. He claims that the circuit court abused its discretion by (1) refusing to impute income to wife, (2) basing its award of support on speculative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>expenses claimed by wife and (3) providing for wife\u2019s mortgage payment in the spousal support award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In regard to husband\u2019s second issue presented, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision without further elaboration as the Court is evenly divided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In regard to husband\u2019s first and third issues presented, we affirm the circuit court for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Husband and wife married on August 22, 1987. Their marriage produced three children. In 1991, husband and wife agreed that wife would stop working in order to stay home \u2022with their children. Husband is an ophthalmologist and, as such, was able to support the family solely on his salary. Throughout the marriage, wife stayed at home raising the couple\u2019s three children, while husband focused on his professional pursuits. On April 3, 2004, husband abandoned the marriage. On June 29, 2004, wife filed for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The parties subsequently entered into a separation agreement (\u201cthe Separation Agreement\u201d) that settled all matters pertaining to the distribution of the couple\u2019s property. As part of the Separation Agreement, husband agreed to convey his interest in the marital home to wife. Wife agreed to become \u201csolely responsible\u201d and to \u201cindemnify and hold Hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>band harmless from any liability\u201d for the home\u2019s $200,000 mortgage. As part of the agreement, husband and wife waived their right to equitable distribution by a court. The couple also made it explicit in the Separation Agreement that the agreement was to have no effect on several unresolved issues, including spousal support. In a paragraph entitled \u201cEXTENT OF AGREEMENT\u201d the Separation Agreement declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">Husband and Wife further acknowledge that this Agreement does not contain any provisions as it relates to spousal support____ Husband and Wife agree that the terms of this Agreement shall have no effect on his or her claims or positions related to these matters and that each does hereby reserve all claims or position he or she has related to such matters which shall be determined by subsequent agreement between the parties or by determination by a court of competent jurisdiction. Husband and Wife further agree that neither waives any claim or position he or she has related to such matters despite any general or specific releases or waivers contained elsewhere in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWT\">On November 28, 2005, the circuit court held a hearing to address the issues left unresolved by the Separation Agreement. Wife\u2019s attorney explained that wife intended to borrow $250,000 against the home in order to pay off the remaining $200,000 owed on the original mortgage and make necessary repairs to the home. In the expense sheet wife provided to the court, she listed $1,500 in monthly housing expenses attributable to the new $250,000 mortgage. Husband argued that wife was not entitled to spousal support covering her mortgage payment because she had agreed to assume the mortgage in the Settlement Agreement. Husband claimed that the court was bound by <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 421 S.E.2d 635 (1992), to exclude the mortgage payment from its determination of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Also at the hearing, husband argued that the circuit court should impute income to wife because she was qualified to work and was not doing so. In support of husband\u2019s position, Frances Charles DeMark (\u201cDeMark\u201d), a \u201cvocational expert,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>testified regarding wife\u2019s earning capacity. He estimated that the annual earnings of respiratory therapists range from $40,000 to $52,000. DeMark testified that he had easily located advertisements of current openings for respiratory therapists at various hospitals in the area. He also stated that he \u201cwould imagine that there\u2019s [sic] also some openings in doctor\u2019s offices.\u201d DeMark concluded that wife could earn at least $30,000 to $40,000 per year working as a full-time respiratory therapist. However, he conceded that, in order to care for her three children before and after school, as she did while married, wife would only be able to work part-time. DeMark did not testify as to whether part-time work was available to a respiratory therapist, nor did he provide any specific information about the availability of jobs or wife\u2019s salary potential outside the field of respiratory therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In regard to her earning capacity, wife testified that, although she is a registered therapist, she is not licensed to practice respiratory care in Virginia. She explained that when she previously worked as a respiratory therapist, Virginia did not require licensure. She testified further: \u201cToday I believe continuing education credits and licensure is required [to practice respiratory care].\u201d When asked about the licensure issue, DeMark testified that he did not know whether wife would have to become licensed or complete continuing education courses in order to work as a respiratory therapist. When asked, \u201cDid you check to see what the education requirements were for somebody who had not worked for 14 years?,\u201d DeMark responded simply \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Wife also testified that she had applied to work as a substitute teacher in the public school system and was \u201con the list\u201d to substitute at her children\u2019s private school.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After the presentation of evidence by both parties, the circuit court granted spousal support to wife. The court denied husband\u2019s request that the court impute income to wife stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">I mean, it\u2019s somewhat incredible to think that you can be out of the job market for the length of time that [wife has], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and get a job earning 45 to 55, 60 thousand dollars a year. I mean, that would be the most remarkable thing I could imagine right now. I mean it\u2019s just not\u2014I mean, I can see you working somewhere, but the market is simply not that. I don\u2019t think the expert has enough documentation to say that those things are readily and easily available and suitable, and I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">^ $ ;|i $ &gt;\u00a1: !\u00a1!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">I\u2019m not saying that [wife] shouldn\u2019t try to work ... but I\u2019m not sure that the law says the moment your husband leaves the wife has to go to work, under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJP\">The court also held that <em>Gamble </em>did not prohibit the consideration of wife\u2019s mortgage payment in determining spousal support and accounted for the mortgage payment in the spousal support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Husband appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision. A divided three-judge panel of this Court held that the circuit court abused its discretion by applying an improper legal standard in determining that income should not be imputed to wife. Relying on <em>Gamble, </em>the panel unanimously held that the circuit court erred by considering wife\u2019s mortgage payment in determining spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">By order dated February 29, 2008, this Court granted wife\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">A. Imputation of Income</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">\u201cA court may under appropriate circumstances impute income to a party seeking spousal support.\u201d <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 734, 396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990). \u201cThe decision to impute income is within the sound discretion of the trial court and its refusal to impute income will not be reversed unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 102, 515 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1999). Husband claims that wife was voluntarily unemployed and that the circuit court abused its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>refusing to impute income to wife. He claims that the circuit court abused its discretion as a matter of law by applying an erroneous legal standard when it refused to impute income. In the alternative, he argues that, based on the evidence, the circuit court was bound to impute income to wife. We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Generally, \u201cone who seeks spousal support is obligated to earn as much as he or she reasonably can to reduce the amount of the support need.\u201d <em>Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. at 734, 396 S.E.2d at 679. However, so long as the spouse seeking support has not \u201cunreasonably refused to accept employment,\u201d the spouse is \u201centitled to a reasonable time to secure employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, in determining whether to impute income, the circuit court \u201cmust look to current circumstances and what the circumstances will be \u2018within the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future,\u2019 not to what may happen in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679 (quoting <em>Young v. Young, </em>3 Va.App. 80, 81-82, 348 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In support of his argument that the circuit court applied an erroneous standard, husband points to the following statement made by the circuit court in its ruling. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">This is not a case of imputed income so much as it is some sort of challenge that you are voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, and that law imposes a duty upon you to be employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the law is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">However, husband neglects the rest of the circuit court\u2019s holding in which the court goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">I\u2019m not saying that [wife] shouldn\u2019t try to work and that that wouldn\u2019t be helpful for your mind and give you some challenges, and that you shouldn\u2019t look forward to that, but I\u2019m not sure that the law says <em>the moment your husband, leaves </em>the wife has to go to work, under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The obligations and the resources of the parties, that each of you has done in this marriage make it so that [husband] should understand that while he may leave, the responsibilities to the three children and the wife reiriain <em>for a reasonable length of time. </em>I can\u2019t predict ... what is going to happen in the future, and I think it would be unwise to do. All I can do is make my best decision today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">When reading the circuit court\u2019s entire statement in context, it is clear that it did not hold that wife <em>never </em>has to return to work. The court merely held, consistent with <em>Srinivasan, </em>that the law does not require wife to return to work <em>immediately </em>in order to avoid the imputation of income. Under that proper standard, the court held that husband\u2019s responsibilities to his wife of seventeen years who, by mutual agreement, had not worked in fifteen years \u201cremain for a reasonable length of time.\u201d In light of the present circumstances and not \u201cwhat may happen in the future,\u201d <em>id., </em>the circuit court held that wife\u2019s failure to secure employment did not require the imputation of income. Based upon the record before us, we hold that the circuit court exercised its discretion appropriately and did not apply an erroneous legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Nor did the circuit court abuse its discretion by refusing to impute income to wife. \u201cThe burden is on the party seeking the imputation to prove that the other parent was voluntarily foregoing more gainful employment, either by producing evidence of a higher-paying former job or by showing that more lucrative work was currently available.\u201d <em>Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 421, 551 S.E.2d 10, 19-20 (2001). The party seeking the imputation is required to present evidence \u201csufficient to enable the trial judge reasonably to project what amount [of income] could be anticipated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 551 S.E.2d at 20. Husband, as the party seeking the imputation, had the burden to prove that \u201cmore lucrative work was available\u201d to wife, as well as the amount of income she could reasonably earn.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Husband did not present any credible evidence that wife was voluntarily unemployed or of wife\u2019s earning potential. Husband presented only one witness, DeMark, to testify regarding wife\u2019s job prospects. After listening to DeMark\u2019s opinions about wife\u2019s earning capabilities, the circuit court specifically found that DeMark\u2019s assessment was \u201csomewhat incredible.\u201d Referring to DeMark\u2019s predictions, the circuit court stated, \u201cI mean, that would be the most remarkable thing I could imagine right now.... I don\u2019t think the expert has enough documentation to say that those things are readily and easily available and suitable.\u201d \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). Husband had the burden of proving that wife was voluntarily forgoing employment. He presented one witness, and the circuit court found that witness\u2019 testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Moreover, DeMark\u2019s testimony was largely irrelevant because the evidence is uncontradicted that wife is not licensed in Virginia as a respiratory care provider. The only job openings and potential salaries that DeMark testified to were job openings and salaries for respiratory therapists. Wife, however, is not eligible to work as a respiratory therapist because she is not licensed to do so. It is \u201cunlawful for any person not holding a current and valid license from the State Board of Medicine to practice as a respiratory care practitioner.\u201d Code \u00a7 54.1-2955. Although wife previously worked as a respiratory therapist, she did so before Virginia required respiratory therapists to be licensed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wife is not currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>able to practice that profession and is therefore not eligible for <em>any </em>of the jobs about which husband presented specific evidence regarding wife\u2019s potential income. Husband, thus, did not meet his burden of proving that \u201cmore lucrative work was currently available\u201d to wife. <em>Joynes, </em>36 Va.App. at 421, 551 S.E.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In determining whether to impute income, the circuit court \u201cmust look to current circumstances and what the circumstances will be within the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679. The current circumstances are that wife cannot legally work as a respiratory therapist. She is currently trying to find employment that will not interfere with her maternal responsibilities. She has applied to be a substitute teacher in the public school system and has placed her name on the list of substitute teachers at her children\u2019s private school. The circuit court found that husband failed to meet his burden to prove she is voluntarily unemployed, and the record supports that conclusion. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the circuit court was plainly wrong or abused its discretion in refusing to impute income to wife. <em>See Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 573, 471 S.E.2d 809, 817 (holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to impute income to a spouse where the spouse \u201chad made preliminary efforts at reentering the workforce and that she had not refused any offers of employment\u201d), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>B. Spousal Support</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201cWhether and how much spousal support will be awarded is a matter of discretion for the trial court.\u201d <em>Barker v. Barker, </em>27 Va.App. 519, 527, 500 S.E.2d 240, 244 (1998). \u201cIn determining the amount of an award, the court must consider all of the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.1.\u201d <em>Stubblebine v. Stubblebine, </em>22 Va.App. 703, 707, 473 S.E.2d 72, 74 (1996). Where the trial court has considered all of the statutory factors, and has provided written findings and conclusions identifying the statutory factors that support its ruling, we will not disturb that decision on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 648 S.E.2d 314 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Husband claims that the circuit court abused its discretion by considering wife\u2019s mortgage payment in the spousal support award. He argues that <em>Gamble </em>mandates that when a spouse, as part of a divorce, receives ownership of the marital home with an outstanding mortgage, that spouse cannot seek support to pay the mortgage on that home. Husband argues that, in such cases, circuit courts can never consider a spouse\u2019s mortgage payment in determining spousal support. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We consider our holding in <em>Gamble </em>a narrow one, based on unique facts. The chancellor in <em>Gamble </em>awarded the marital home to the wife as part of the distribution of property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. 14 Va.App. at 561, 421 S.E.2d at 637. Along with her receipt of the marital home, the wife became liable for two mortgages encumbering the home. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 421 S.E.2d at 646. Those mortgage payments totaled $881 per month. <em>Id. </em>The chancellor then awarded the wife spousal support in the amount of $850. <em>Id. </em>However, in doing so, the chancellor committed several errors. First, the chancellor erred by failing to consider all of the wife\u2019s income. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 421 S.E.2d at 645. The wife was renting a room in her home, for which she received $250 per month. The chancellor did not include that $250 in its determination of the wife\u2019s spousal support need. Next, the chancellor\u2019s award of $850 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the wife resulted in the wife having more disposable income than the husband. <em>Id. </em>When that was brought to the chancellor\u2019s attention, the chancellor found that fact to have little significance. Finally, the chancellor also erroneously credited the wife with making one of the mortgage payments, when the husband was actually making the payment. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 421 S.E.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In light of all of those missteps by the chancellor, we held that the chancellor \u201ceffectively provided the financial means by which [the wife] could satisfy the monthly mortgage obligations on the marital property she sought and received [through equitable distribution].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted further that \u201cthe chancellor\u2019s reasoning [led] us to the conclusion that the award was fashioned primarily for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the chancellor abused his discretion by awarding spousal support for the sole purpose of satisfying the wife\u2019s mortgage payment. The chancellor was required to award spousal support in light of <em>all </em>of the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1, not solely the wife\u2019s mortgage expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Gamble </em>does not stand for the proposition that a circuit court cannot consider a spouse\u2019s mortgage payment in determining that spouse\u2019s need for support. In fact, we clearly held in <em>Gamble </em>that the chancellor erred, not by considering the wife\u2019s mortgage payments, but by misallocating the mortgage expenses in determining the wife\u2019s need:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">[T]he chancellor considered the monetary award and the required conveyance of the marital home to Mrs. Gamble and \u201cthe fact that she will be responsible for both the first and second mortgage payments\u201d on that property in the total monthly amount of $881. The record reflects that the first mortgage payment of $372 monthly was an obligation listed on Mrs. Gamble\u2019s expense sheet that the chancellor considered in determining her obligations and net monthly income under factor one. Thus, the second mortgage payment of $509 monthly, rather than $881, would have been the maximum amount <em>properly considered by the chancellor under factor eight. </em>Moreover, because Mr. Gamble had previously been making this second mortgage payment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>chancellor necessarily had to have considered that fact when making the adjustment to Mrs. Gamble\u2019s monthly expenses under factor one. In short, either Mr. Gamble has less disposable net income than determined by the chancellor because he has not been credited with making the second mortgage payment or Mrs. Gamble has more disposable income than determined by the chancellor because she has been credited with an obligation that she does not have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALh\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Not only did we explicitly hold that the chancellor could have \u201cproperly considered\u201d the wife\u2019s obligation on the mortgage, we remanded the case \u201c[because] we [were] unable to determine that the amount of the award would be the same had the chancellor properly considered ... the payment of the second mortgage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 421 S.E.2d at 647. The chancellor erred by improperly crediting the wrong spouse with the mortgage obligation, not by considering the wife\u2019s mortgage obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The facts of this case illustrate quite well the inequity that would occur if we interpreted <em>Gamble </em>to mean what husband says it means. Husband claims that wife cannot include her $1,500 mortgage payment in her list of expenses, because the mortgage encumbers property she received as part of the divorce. At the same time, husband listed a $5,000 mortgage payment on his expense sheet that he presented to the circuit court'. That $5,000 amounted to over one third of husband\u2019s total expenses and reduced his ability to pay by 25%. It would be fundamentally unfair to allow husband to reduce his ability to pay by including his mortgage payment as an expense, while refusing to allow wife to demonstrate her financial need by listing her mortgage payment as an expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Under Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, a circuit court is required to consider 13 factors in determining whether and in what amount to award spousal support. Code \u00a7 20-107.1. Among those factors are each spouse\u2019s financial obligations and needs, the standard of living established during the marriage, the decisions regarding employment made by the couple during the marriage, property interests of the parties, and the equitable distribution of the property. In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>those factors, it is clear that a spouse\u2019s reasonable housing related expenses must be considered when determining that spouse\u2019s needs, obligations, and ability to pay spousal support. That is not to say that those expenses must be included in the ultimate award, but Code \u00a7 20-107.1 requires that the court consider them. The mere fact that a spouse\u2019s housing expenses arise out of former marital property does not alter that spouse\u2019s need for housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Here, husband and wife agreed over fifteen years ago that wife would not work, in order to stay home with the children. The couple established a standard of living during the marriage that included living in a 6,100 square foot, $875,000 home. As part of the Settlement Agreement, husband agreed that wife would remain in the home following the divorce. He agreed further, that her assumption of the mortgage pursuant to the agreement would have \u201cno effect\u201d on her right to request spousal support. Remaining in that home after the divorce came at the expense of $1,500 per month. The circuit court properly considered that expense as part of wife\u2019s financial needs and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the alternative, husband argues that wife breached the Separation Agreement by listing her mortgage payment as an expense. He claims that the provision in the Separation Agreement that wife would \u201cindemnify and hold Husband harmless from any liability\u201d on the mortgage prevents her from listing the mortgage payment as an expense when requesting spousal support. He reasons that by requesting support to assist her in paying the mortgage, wife is not holding him harmless from liability on the mortgage. Husband is incorrect. The \u201cindemnify and hold harmless\u201d provision does not prevent wife from seeking spousal support for her reasonable housing expenses. Rather, it merely assures that wife bears the obligation of the debt by requiring her to indemnify husband for any claims made by their mortgage creditor in case of default. <em>See Bomar v. Bomar, </em>45 Va.App. 229, 237 n. 1, 609 S.E.2d 629, 633 n. 1 (2005). The \u201cindemnify and hold harmless\u201d agreement applies to each spouse\u2019s rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>surrounding their liability to the mortgage creditor, and in no way limits either spouse\u2019s right to seek spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-107.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to impute income to wife or by considering wife\u2019s mortgage obligations in awarding spousal support. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">. Both parties requested, and were denied, attorney\u2019s fees in the initial appeal of this case to a three-judge panel. However, neither party reiterated that request in their briefs <em>en banc. </em>Our grant of wife's petition for <em>en banc </em>review voided the decision of the panel only as to the issues before us <em>en banc. See Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 663 S.E.2d 505 (2008). Because neither party raised the issue of attorney\u2019s fees <em>en banc, </em>we reinstate the mandate of the panel opinion on that issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"><em>. </em>Chief Judge Felton, Judges Kelsey, McClanahan, Beales and Millette voted to affirm.

Prior to 1998, the statute did not require that a person be licensed in order to practice respiratory care. It merely forbid uncertified persons from using certain professional titles. Specifically, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person not holding a current and valid certificate from the State Board of Medicine to claim to be a respiratory therapy practitioner or to assume the title \"Respiratory Therapist,\u201d \"Respiratory Therapist Registered,\u201d \u201cCertified Respiratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Therapist,\u201d \u201cRespiratory Therapist Practitioner,\u201d \u201cRespiratory Practitioner,\u201d or \"Certified Respiratory Therapy Practitioner,\u201d or any similar term or to assume the designations \u201cR.T.,\u201d \"R.T.R.,\u201d \"C.R.T.,\u201d \"R.T.P.,\u201d \"R.P.\u201d or \"C.R.T.P.\u201d However, a person who has graduated from a duly accredited educational program in respiratory therapy shall be exempt from the preceding prohibition until he has taken and received the results of an examination required by the Board or until one year from the date of graduation, whichever occurs sooner.

It should also be noted that husband\u2019s argument along these lines is even more tenuous in light of the fact that the mortgage that wife agreed to indemnify and hold husband harmless for no longer exists. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, wife refinanced the debt by taking out a new loan and paying off the original mortgage; effectively removing husband from any liability on the mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b544-8\">HALEY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aik\">with whom Clements, J., joins, concurring, <em>in </em>part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding regarding the third issue raised for determination en banc. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s holding on the first issue because I conclude, based on the statements made by the trial court, that the court applied the wrong legal standard in refusing to impute income to wife and, thus, abused its discretion. Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand for reconsideration of the spousal support award, applying the correct legal standard as to imputation of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u201cA spouse is obligated to earn as much as he or she reasonably can to reduce the amount of the support need.\u201d Peter N. Swisher, Lawrence D. Diehl, <em>&amp; </em>James R. Cottrell, <em>Family Law: Theory, Practice and Forms </em>\u00a7 9:5, at 283-84 (2008). \u201cA court may under appropriate circumstances impute income to a party seeking spousal support. This conclusion logically flows from the principle that one who seeks spousal support is obligated to earn as much as he or she reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>can to reduce the amount of the support need.\u201d <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 734, 396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Here, the trial court stated: \u201cThis is not a case of imputed income so much as it is some sort of challenge that you are voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, and that law imposes a duty upon you to be employed. <em>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the law is.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The problem with the trial court\u2019s statement is that it is simply wrong. As the commentators and case law quoted above demonstrate, the law does impose a duty upon a spouse who seeks spousal support to be reasonably employed to reduce the support need.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">That obligation, or legal duty, is tempered by the consideration that a spouse is entitled to a reasonable time to obtain employment and by a further consideration of the need for care of young children. In this case, the parties had been separated for 20 months. The parties\u2019 three children, ages 11, 13, and 15, were all in school. A court may impute income when \u201cthe evidence reveals that the child or children are in school.\u201d <em>Brody v. Brody, </em>16 Va.App. 647, 650, 432 S.E.2d 20, 22 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The trial court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">Now, it\u2019s probably true ... you probably, <em>with your background, </em>would feel good\u2014and I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t try to work and that that wouldn\u2019t be helpful for your mind and give you some challenges, and that you shouldn\u2019t look forward to that, but I\u2019m not sure that the law says the moment your husband leaves the wife has to go to work____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">(Emphasis added). That background includes the facts that wife has a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology and psychology from the University of Pittsburgh, a master\u2019s degree in public administration from the University of Kentucky, and an associate\u2019s degree in respiratory therapy. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(9) requires a court to consider \u201c[t]he earning capacity, including the skills, education and training of the parties and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>present employment opportunities for persons possessing such earning capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The majority concludes that the trial court \u201cdid not hold that wife <em>never </em>has to return to work\u201d but \u201cmerely held ... that the law does not require wife to return to work <em>immediately </em>in order to avoid the imputation of income.\u201d My contextual reading of the trial court\u2019s statements convinces me otherwise. As previously noted, 20 months had passed since the parties separated, and that period of time cannot reasonably be considered <em>immediately </em>following the separation. Additionally, the trial court stated that wife\u2019s return to work sometime in the future might make her \u201cfeel good\u201d and be \u201chelpful for [her] mind and give [her] some challenges,\u201d which she could \u201clook forward to.\u201d The court never acknowledged wife\u2019s <em>obligation, </em>or <em>legal duty, </em>to return to work within a reasonable time to reduce her support need. In other words, the trial court effectively ruled that wife had no duty to ever return to work; rather, she could return to work at some point in the future, if she chose to, for her personal satisfaction and well-being. That ruling, of course, runs directly counter to the law requiring a spouse seeking spousal support \u201cto earn as much as he or she reasonably can to reduce the amount of the support need.\u201d <em>Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. at 734, 396 S.E.2d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard when it refused to impute income to wife and that that error, <em>ipso facto, </em>constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
