The Technical Review Board held that the Board of Supervisors had no authority to set qualifications standards for third-party inspectors under the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC). Agreeing that the circuit court erred, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for entry of a final order vacating the Technical Review Board\u2019s case decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In 1991, the Culpeper County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution requiring all private inspectors retained by the county (referred to as third-party inspectors) to perform inspections on behalf of the county\u2019s local building official to be qualified engineers or architects licensed by the Commonwealth. William R. Myers became the County Building Official in 1998. Unaware of the county\u2019s resolution, Myers authorized third-party inspectors to perform work for the county without being qualified as licensed engineers or architects. In 2003, Randolph W. Griffith (a former county building official, but not a licensed engineer or architect) requested that Myers certify him as a third-party inspector. Griffith knew of the county\u2019s 1991 resolution but did not advise Myers of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">After he had certified Griffith, Myers learned of the county\u2019s certification requirements. Myers asked the Board of Supervisors to again review its certification policy. In response, the Board of Supervisors reaffirmed its existing policy of requiring all third-party inspectors for the county to be licensed engineers or architects. Myers independently researched the issue and discovered that, of the six Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>localities using third-party inspectors, each locality had a similar policy. Myers adopted the certification policy and decertified Griffith as a third-party inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Griffith appealed his decertification to the local board of building code appeals, which affirmed Myers\u2019s decision to decertify Griffith. Griffith then appealed to the Technical Review Board. Griffith argued that the Board of Supervisors had no authority to set certification policies for third-party inspectors. Only Myers could make that decision, Griffith contended. While it might look like Myers made his own decision in this regard, Griffith added, in fact Myers merely followed the directive of the Board of Supervisors. In its final case decision, the Technical Review Board agreed with Griffith and set aside his decertification.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The Board of Supervisors and Myers appealed the Technical Review Board\u2019s case decision to the circuit court under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq. </em>The circuit court dismissed the petition for appeal and affirmed the Technical Review Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Board of Supervisors and Robert P. Orr, III (Myers\u2019s successor as Building Official) appeal the circuit court\u2019s decision to us on the ground that the circuit court, like the Technical Review Board, erred as a matter of law in concluding the Board of Supervisors had no authority to establish the certification policy for third-party inspectors doing work for the county.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We begin our analysis by examining the structure of the governing law. In 1972, the General Assembly directed the State Board of Housing, now the Board of Housing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Community Development (the Housing Board), to adopt a Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC). <em>Avalon Assisted Living Facilities v. Zager, </em>39 Va.App. 484, 496, 574 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002) (citing Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-98, 36-131 <em>&amp; </em>36-135); <em>see </em>1972 Va. Acts, ch. 829. The legislature intended the Housing Board to give due regard to \u201cgenerally accepted standards\u201d recommended by nationally recognized organizations. Code \u00a7 36-99(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Under its enabling legislation, the Housing Board may modify, amend, or repeal any USBC provision after complying with the notice and hearing requirements of Code \u00a7 36-100. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 36-102. These requirements include notice to every \u201cbuilding official\u201d in the Commonwealth and, \u201cwhere none, the local governing body of every city or county in the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-100. \u201cAt any such hearing all persons desiring to do so shall be afforded an opportunity to present their views.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The General Assembly delegated responsibility for enforcement of the USBC to the \u201clocal building department,\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105(A), defined as \u201cthe agency or agencies of any local governing body charged with the administration, supervision or enforcement\u201d of the USBC.Code \u00a7 36-97. Each local government must establish a local building department along with a \u201clocal board of Building Code Appeals\u201d (the local appeals board) or enter into an agreement with some other locality or state agency to perform these roles. Code \u00a7 36-105(A). A party dissatisfied with a local department\u2019s application of the USBC may appeal to the local appeals board. <em>Id. </em>A further appeal may be taken from the local appeals board to the Technical Review Board. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-105, 36-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In promulgating the USBC, the Housing Board \u201cincorporated by reference the majority of the BOCA National Building Code,\u201d <em>Avalon Assisted Living Facilities, </em>39 Va.App. at 497, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>574 S.E.2d at 804 (citations omitted), and has since incorporated the technical pr\u00f3visions of the International Building Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the USBC\u2019s administrative provisions recognizes that the local building code official may outsource some of his duties to private third parties. \u201cThe building official is permitted to delegate duties and powers subject to any limitations imposed by the locality and shall be responsible for assuring that delegated duties and powers are carried out in accordance with the USBC.\u201d USBC \u00a7 109.3 (2000 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 104.2.2 also recognized the locality\u2019s authority to \u201cestablish additional qualification requirements\u201d for county employees assisting the building official.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In our case, the Technical Review Board considered these provisions but nonetheless held the Board of Supervisors had no authority under USBC \u00a7 109.3 to impose certification qualifications on third-party inspectors. Despite the clause in USBC \u00a7 109.3 subjecting the building official\u2019s delegation of duties to \u201cany limitations imposed by the locality,\u201d the Technical Review Board held that language could not be taken at face value because it would conflict with USBC \u00a7 115.8.1. That regulation authorized the building official to \u201caccept reports of inspections and tests from approved individuals or approved inspection agencies, which satisfy qualifications and reliability requirements.\u201d USBC \u00a7 115.8.1 (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We find the Technical Review Board\u2019s reasoning, as well as the circuit court\u2019s endorsement of it, to be plainly wrong. USBC \u00a7 109.3 authorized the locality to impose \u201cany limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tion\u201d it chose on the delegation by its building official of his duties to third-party inspectors. The Board of Supervisors chose to limit the delegation to certified engineers and architects. USBC \u00a7 115.8.1 merely authorized the county building official to accept inspection reports from \u201capproved\u201d inspectors satisfying the necessary \u201cqualifications and reliability requirements.\u201d Nothing in \u00a7 115.8.1 contradicted \u00a7 109.3. To be sure, the two provisions complemented each other. Section 109.3 gave the locality the ultimate authority to establish criteria for who may act as a delegate of the building official\u2019s authority. Section 115.8.1, on the other hand, merely confirmed that the building official may accept inspection reports from approved inspectors and said nothing about delegating his authority to any third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The circuit court nonetheless deferred to the Technical Review Board\u2019s reasoning, correctly noting that courts give \u201cgreat deference\u201d to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>See Holtzman Oil Corp. v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 532, 539, 529 S.E.2d 333, 337 (2000). This deference stems from Code \u00a7 2.2-4027, which requires that reviewing courts \u201ctake due account\u201d of the \u201cexperience and specialized competence of the agency\u201d promulgating the regulation. <em>Va. Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 160-61, 384 S.E.2d 622, 627 (1989) (interpreting former Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17). Even so, \u201cdeference is not abdication, and it requires us to accept only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 260, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 1236-37, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">No matter how one calibrates judicial deference, the administrative power to interpret a regulation does not include the power to rewrite it. When a regulation is \u201cnot ambiguous,\u201d judicial deference \u201cto the agency\u2019s position would be to permit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create <em>de facto </em>a new regulation.\u201d <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 588, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 1663, 146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2000). Though agencies may be tempted to adjudicate their way around unwanted regulations, such overreaching undermines the notice and public hearing procedures of the rulemaking process\u2014thereby putting in jeopardy the \u201cenhanced political accountability of agency policy decisions adopted through the rulemaking process\u201d and the democratic virtue of allowing \u201call potentially affected members of the public an opportunity to participate in the process of determining the rules that affect them.\u201d 1 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 6.8, at 369, 372 (4th ed.2002); <em>see generally </em>1 Charles H. Koch, Jr., <em>Administrative Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 2.12, at 53 (2d ed.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Here, the Technical Review Board interpreted USBC \u00a7 115.8.1 to wholly preclude the Board of Supervisors from imposing what \u00a7 109.3 plainly permitted\u2014the imposition of \u201cany limitation\u201d the Board of Supervisors chose to impose upon the delegation by its building official of his duties to private third-party inspectors. Nothing in the text or the logical context of either regulation supports this interpretation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In effect, the Technical Review Board excised the phrase \u201cany limitations imposed by the locality\u201d from USBC \u00a7 109.3 without complying with the notice and hearing procedures designed to protect the public\u2019s interest in participating in the lawmaking task of administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In sum, the circuit court erred in deferring to the Technical Review Board\u2019s unreasonable interpretation of USBC \u00a7 109.3. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the VAPA petition for appeal and remand with instructions to vacate the Technical Review Board\u2019s case decision holding that the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Supervisors had no authority to establish qualifications for third-party inspectors under the USBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. Given our holding, we need not decide whether the Technical Review Board improperly entertained the appeal from the local board of building code appeals. <em>Cf. Board of Sup. of Fairfax County v. Miller &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>222 Va. 230, 234-35, 279 S.E.2d 158, 160-61 (1981), <em>with Strawbridge </em>&amp; <em>State Bldg.Code Tech. Rev. Bd. v.
