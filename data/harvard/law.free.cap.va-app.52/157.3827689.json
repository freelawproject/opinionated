Gooch appeals an order of the circuit court approving, over her objection, the adoption of her son by Doris and James Harris. Gooch argues that the court erroneously concluded she withheld consent for the adoption contrary to the best interests of the child under Code \u00a7 63.2-1203(A) without specifically finding that continuing the parent-child relationship would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the child. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1. We hold the circuit court did not err as Gooch claims and thus affirm its final adoption order.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">At the time of the circuit court hearing, Gooch\u2019s son was seven years old. He had lived with Doris and James Harris (Gooch\u2019s great aunt and uncle) since he was two years old. The boy\u2019s father, Joseph Wayne Gray, Sr., has been in the penitentiary for much of his son\u2019s life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Department of Social Services removed the child from Gooch\u2019s custody when he was found asleep in Gooch\u2019s car outside a bar. During the five years the child has been living with Doris and James Harris, Gooch visited him four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Doris and James Harris previously adopted Gooch\u2019s older son and raised him for nearly ten years. Upon learning that Gooch was involved in drug and alcohol abuse, the Harrises filed a petition to adopt Gooch\u2019s younger son pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.2-1203(A), which authorizes adoption of a child over the objection of a biological parent under certain circumstances outlined in Code \u00a7 63.2-1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">At the time of the circuit court hearing, Gooch was incarcerated on a probation violation arising out of an earlier cocaine conviction. She testified she had about five months remaining in the one year and ten month sentence. She admitted she had no home and did not know where she would live. She also conceded that, prior to her incarceration, she regularly used illegal drugs and abused alcohol. She did not have steady employment prior to being arrested. Gooch spoke well of Doris and James Harris and expressed gratitude that they had taken good care of her son. Gooch said she had not previously sought custody of her son because she \u201cwas not stable enough\u201d to be a parent. Even so, Gooch stated, she would not consent to the adoption because, \u201cI want my boys back eventually one day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The circuit court held that \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d demonstrated that the child\u2019s best interests would be furthered by the adoption and that Gooch withheld her consent contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the child\u2019s best interests under Code \u00a7 63.2-1205. Recognizing that the decision severed the parent-child relationship, the court also stated it would \u201cgo beyond\u201d the best-interests test and examine whether \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d demonstrated that Gooch was \u201ceither unwilling or unable to care for the child for whatever reason.\u201d The evidence satisfied that standard, the court held. Gooch\u2019s history of substance abuse, her prior failure to parent the child, her minimal contact with the child, her likely inability to parent the child in the future, her \u201cawful\u201d quality of life\u2014these circumstances, the court found by clear and convincing evidence, justified the adoption over Gooch\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On appeal, Gooch presents only one question: Did the circuit court err by granting the adoption \u201cwithout a finding that a continuance of Ms. Gooch\u2019s and [the child\u2019s] legal parent-child relationship would be <em>detrimental </em>to [the child].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1 (emphasis added). \u201cThe judge\u2019s reasoning, in effect, treated the detriment-to-the-child requirement as merely a restatement of the best-interests-of-the-child test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Contending that the circuit court applied the wrong legal standard, Gooch asks us to \u201cremand this case to the trial court to hear evidence on whether the continuance of Ms. Gooch and [the child\u2019s] legal parent-child relationship would be detrimental to [the child] using correct legal standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We see no need for a remand, however, because we reject the underlying premise of Gooch\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The detriment-to-the-child standard first appeared in Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1, the statutory predecessor to Code \u00a7 63.2-1205.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cCode \u00a7 63.1-225.1, enacted in 1995, codifie[d] the standard promulgated by the Virginia appellate courts in cases decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>under prior law, when the statute contained no explicit standard.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Futty, </em>25 Va.App. 420, 426, 489 S.E.2d 232, 235 (1997) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From 1995 to 2006, the statute provided that, \u201c[i]n determining whether the valid consent of any person whose consent is required is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, or is unobtainable, the circuit court ... shall consider whether the failure to grant the petition pending before it would be <em>detrimental to the child.\u201d </em>Former Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 (applicable prior to July 1, 2006) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">After establishing a joint subcommittee to study Virginia\u2019s adoption laws, <em>see </em>Senate Joint Resolution 331 (2005), the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 to specifically remove all mention of the detriment-to-the-child standard. <em>See </em>2006 Va. Acts, chs. 825, 848 (effective July 1, 2006). The current version of the statute now focuses on the best interests of the child: \u201cIn determining whether the valid consent of any person whose consent is required is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, or is unobtainable, the circuit court ... shall consider whether granting the petition pending before it would be <em>in the best interest of the child.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In short, Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 no longer requires any specific finding that the failure to grant the adoption petition would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>detrimental to the child. Because the 2006 amendments took effect prior to the hearing and decision in this case, they necessarily negate Gooch\u2019s assertion that the circuit court erred by not making a finding under the detriment-to-the-child standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The circuit court did not erroneously fail to make a specific finding that continuing Gooch\u2019s parent-child relationship with her son would be detrimental to him. Code \u00a7 63.2-1205 now requires no such finding. We thus affirm the circuit court\u2019s final adoption order.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">. Gray made an appearance in circuit court to object to the adoption, but did not appeal the adoption order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">. In 2000, the General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 and recodified it as Code \u00a7 63.1-219.13. <em>See </em>2000 Va. Acts, ch. 830. In 2002, the General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7 63.1-219.13 and recodified it as Code \u00a7 63.2-1205. <em>See </em>2002 Va.

The amended statute, like its predecessor, lists various factors for the court to consider.
