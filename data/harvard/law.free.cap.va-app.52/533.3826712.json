First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction for the unlawful wounding of a police officer. Second, he argues the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of transferred intent in finding him guilty of the malicious wounding of his daughter. As discussed below, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On appeal, we \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below, and grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Clifton v. Commonwealth, 22 </em>Va.App. 178, 180, 468 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1996) (citing <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted). We present the facts below with that standard in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On the morning of November 26, 2007, Blow and his wife had an argument in the living room of their home. Eventually, the argument escalated and Blow attacked his wife with a kitchen knife, stabbing her several times. The couple\u2019s daughter was also in the room during the attack. While Blow was \u201cstanding over\u201d his prone wife and stabbing her, his daughter ran up behind Blow and \u201cjumped on his back and ... tried to grab the knife.\u201d As a result, Blow cut his daughter\u2019s hand with the knife. The daughter \u201cyelled out, \u2018Daddy, I cut my hand. Daddy, I cut my hand.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that point, Blow stopped stabbing his wife, took some money out of her pocketbook, and left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>After Blow\u2019s departure, his daughter went to the neighbor\u2019s house and asked them to call the police. As part of their response, the police issued a broadcast for officers to be on the look out for Blow and his green Saturn car. Later that morning, Officer John Dean of the Richmond police observed the green Saturn, activated the siren and lights of his marked police car, and followed Blow as he was pulling onto Interstate 64. However, instead of pulling over, Blow fled from the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Thus began a chase through the City of Richmond and Henrico County that lasted for 28 miles on Interstates 64, 95, and 195, as well as other roads. The chase involved a number of police officers in ten patrol cars from the City of Richmond, Henrico County, and the State Police. During the chase, Blow performed a number of illegal u-turns, changed lanes erratically, and reached speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Near the end of the chase, State Trooper Adam Kulpa led the pursuit. Eventually, he maneuvered his patrol car in front of the Saturn while traveling about 55 or 60 miles per hour. Kulpa testified that at that time he \u201cnoticed the suspect vehicle move at a faster rate than I was going and ran into the back of my vehicle. At this point, I had not decelerated. I was maintaining my speed.\u201d The cars \u201cbroke contact,\u201d and Kulpa took his foot off of the accelerator to help him maintain control of his car. \u201cThen,\u201d Kulpa testified, \u201ca brief moment later, I\u2019ll estimate 5 to 10 seconds, my vehicle was struck a second time by the suspect vehicle.\u201d Blow passed Kulpa\u2019s car on the right-hand side and then suddenly swerved to the left, striking the front passenger side of Kulpa\u2019s cruiser with the rear driver\u2019s side of the Saturn. Blow then lost control of the Saturn, \u201cspun out,\u201d and hit the wall on the left side of the highway. Kulpa sustained injuries to his upper back and neck as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Based upon Trooper Kulpa\u2019s testimony and a review of the video recording from Kulpa\u2019s car, the trial court concluded that two of the three collisions resulted from deliberate acts on Blow\u2019s part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In the video [Trooper Kulpa] ... goes past on the left and gets ahead of [Blow\u2019s Saturn]. He is maintaining his position and he is struck in the rear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">He is struck in the rear again, but the Court would not find that that was intentional. The statement was that he was hit. There is a little blurring on the video, but it is not forceful. It doesn\u2019t look forceful. The police car maintains control, anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">The second hit, the police officer says took 5 to 10 seconds afterwards, but he took his foot off the accelerator and was hit 1 to 2 seconds later. If you\u2019re both maintaining speed and he lets his foot off the accelerator, the likely result of that is that you would, he would hit you again. That may not have been Mr. Blow\u2019s intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">He then pulls to the right and passes the car and hits the car from the right-hand side. From the video, the police car did not move out of the lane in watching that, and so your car intentionally struck him twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">After finding Blow guilty, the court sentenced him to a total of nineteen years incarceration, with fourteen years, six months suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">The appellate standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence issues is well established. \u201c \u2018[T]he judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 107, 113, 406 S.E.2d 39, 42 (1991) (quoting <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 613, 212 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1975)). Thus, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. We are mindful that \u201cgreat deference must be given to the factfinder who, having seen and heard the witnesses, assesses their credibility and weighs their testimony.\u201d <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 422, 426, 497 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998). Therefore, we do not \u201csubstitute our judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ment for that of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002). Instead, \u201cthe relevant question\u201d on appeal \u201cis whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">A. Unlawful Wounding of Trooper Kulpa</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Both on brief and at oral argument, Blow argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the specific intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill Trooper Kulpa. Instead, Blow contends, the evidence failed to exclude his proposed reasonable hypothesis of innocence: that he merely intended to flee from the officers, rather than to injure the trooper. We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Blow had the necessary intent to injure Trooper Kulpa.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Intent may, and usually must, be proved by circumstantial evidence, <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988), such as a person\u2019s conduct and statements, <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 198, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). And Blow is correct that while \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence[,]\u201d it must \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ever, as we explained in <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 9, 602 S.E.2d 402, 406 (2004), whether a defendant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and is \u201csubject to deferential appellate review.\u201d Where, as here, \u201cthe factfinder has rejected the hypothesis <em>as unreasonable, </em>that determination cannot be overturned as arbitrary unless no reasonable factfinder would have come to that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We find these facts similar to those in <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 531 S.E.2d 41 (2000), where we affirmed a conviction for malicious bodily injury of a police officer. There, the trial court found that Luck had led police on a sixteen-mile, high-speed chase during which he drove dangerously, including \u201crepeatedly steer[ing] his car into police vehicles\u201d and accelerating and striking police cruisers from behind when they attempted a \u201crolling roadblock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830, 832-33, 531 S.E.2d at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Here, the evidence established that Blow, while attempting to flee, led the officers on a dangerous, high-speed, twenty-eight-mile-long car chase. During this chase, Blow drove recklessly on busy highways, changed lanes erratically, and made illegal u-turns. Despite the lengthy chase, Blow was unable to escape Trooper Kulpa and was about to be forced to a stop. From these facts the trial court could reasonably infer that Blow intended to prevent this from happening by deliberately crashing into Trooper Kulpa\u2019s car. This act would \u201cobviously cause a serious wreck, maiming, disfiguring, disabling or killing anyone involved in it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833, 531 S.E.2d at 43. Thus, the trial court properly rejected Blow\u2019s hypothesis of innocence as unreasonable in light of its amply supported factual finding that Blow intended to injure Trooper Kulpa.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">B. Transferred Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Blow also argues that his conviction for the malicious wounding of his daughter must be reversed because the trial court erroneously applied the doctrine of transferred intent in order to find the specific \u201cintent to maim, disfigure, disable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>kill\u201d required for a conviction of malicious wounding. Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Blow argues that the doctrine of transferred intent does not apply for two reasons. First, he claims that the doctrine is inapplicable on these facts because, he argues, the stabbing of his wife and the cutting of his daughter were two separate and distinct acts. Second, he contends that his conviction for the malicious wounding of his wife eliminated the justification for the doctrine because he did not escape criminal responsibility for his actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we disagree with Blow and affirm his conviction for the malicious wounding of his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The doctrine of transferred intent permits a fact finder to transpose a defendant\u2019s criminal intent to harm an intended victim to another unintended, but harmed, victim. It originated in the English common law and has been frequently applied in American criminal cases. <em>See generally, </em>William L. Prosser, <em>Transferred Intent, </em>45 Tex. L. Rev. 650 (1966-1967) (hereinafter Prosser); <em>see also Harvey v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 401, 681 A.2d 628, 634-37 (1996) (discussing the history and development of the doctrine of transferred intent); Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 6.4(d) (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The policy behind the doctrine of transferred intent is to impose criminal liability on a defendant whose intentional act causes harm to an unintended victim; in other words, the defendant is not absolved of criminal responsibility merely because he has the misfortune to harm a bystander rather than his intended victim as a result of his wrongful act. <em>See </em>LaFave at \u00a7 6.4(d). Hence, \u201cif an accused attempts to injure one person and an unintended victim is injured because of the act, the accused\u2019s intent to injure the intended victim is transferred to the injury of the unintended victim, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>though this wounding was accidental or unintentional.\u201d <em>Crawley v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 768, 773, 492 S.E.2d 503, 505 (1997) (citations omitted). As we examine the trial court\u2019s application of this legal principle to the case before us, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or without evidentiary support; however, we review the trial court\u2019s application of the law <em>de novo. </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>see also McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Although Blow suggests in his brief that the doctrine of transferred intent is \u201ctolerated without enthusiasm,\u201d it is clear that the doctrine is a viable part of our law. The doctrine has been accepted, discussed, and applied in our Commonwealth in a number of cases. <em>See, e.g., Riddick v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 244, 308 S.E.2d 117 (1983) (affirming murder conviction on theories of transferred intent and concert of action); <em>Crawley, 25 </em>Va.App. at 768, 492 S.E.2d at 503 (declining to apply doctrine of transferred intent to an inchoate crime); <em>Henderson v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 444, 438 S.E.2d 292 (1993) (affirming murder conviction when the defendant shot and killed one man, believing him to be another); <em>Long, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 379 S.E.2d 473 (affirming a malicious wounding conviction when the defendant commanded his dog to \u201ckill\u201d one person, but the dog attacked someone else). Thus, the only question before us is the application of the doctrine to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Initially, Blow argues that the trial court should be reversed because, in his view, his daughter\u2019s voluntary attempt to aid her mother, rather than his criminal assault on his wife, caused his daughter\u2019s injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The evidence shows that Blow created the situation that caused his daughter\u2019s injury through his intentional acts: he attacked his wife and stabbed her numerous times with a kitchen knife, while his daughter was present. In this context, it was certainly reasonably foreseeable that his daughter would come to her mother\u2019s aid. When his daughter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>injured during Blow\u2019s on-going attack, that injury was \u201cwithin the <em>res gestae </em>of\u2019 his original criminal act. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 408, 410-11, 404 S.E.2d 377, 378-79 (1991) (discussing the related concept of the felony murder rule).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because his daughter\u2019s injury was reasonably related to the criminal act Blow directed at his wife, and because Blow had the requisite intent to maim his wife when he cut his daughter, the doctrine of transferred intent applies. \u201cIt is fairly clear that when the defendant intends [a criminal act] his intention will be \u2018transferred\u2019 to make him liable for [the unintended crime], <em>provided that the harm is direct and immediate, i.e. within the scope of the [intended crime].\u2019\u2019 </em>Prosser at 655 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Thus, the daughter\u2019s injury, which occurred as she attempted to prevent Blow from stabbing her mother again, was a natural and probable consequence of his crime. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>233 Ga.App. 696, 505 S.E.2d 239, 240-41 (1998) (affirming conviction and finding the doctrine of transferred intent applicable when the intended victim\u2019s friend intervened in an attack, \u201chitting and pulling on [the defendant] to make him stop ...\u201d and \u201cattempting to grab the knife ... cutting her hand in the process.\u201d The Georgia court concluded that \u201c[i]n legal contemplation, the intent follows the act through to its legitimate [i.e. probable] results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Blow also argues that transferred intent should not be applied to these facts because \u201cthe justifications underlying the doctrine [of transferred intent] are absent.\u201d He posits that the basis for \u201cengaging in the fiction of transferred intent\u201d is to prevent a situation where, because of a \u201clucky accident in killing or injuring the wrong person, a defendant could escape liability for completing an act he intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Internal quotation marks omitted). Blow argues that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>conviction for the malicious wounding of his wife eliminated the justification for transferring the intent directed toward his wife in order to convert the accidental wounding of his daughter into a similar crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We note that the states are split on the application of the doctrine of transferred intent when both the intended victim and the unintended victim are injured. <em>See </em>LaFave at \u00a7 6.4(d) n. 47 (collecting eases). Some states hold that the doctrine of transferred intent would not apply on the facts before us. For instance, the Maryland Supreme Court has held that the doctrine of transferred intent \u201cwas intended to enable conviction of a defendant of the crime he intended to commit <em>only when that crime was not committed upon the intended victim.\u201d Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984, 998 (1993) (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 330 A.2d 176 (1974)). The Maryland court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7J\">[Transferred intent makes a whole crime out of two halves by joining the intent as to one victim with the harm caused to another victim. Transferred intent does <em>not </em>make two crimes out of one. Where the crime intended has actually been committed against the intended victim, transferred intent is unnecessary and should not be applied to acts against unintended victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>but see Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 671 A.2d 501, 504 (1996) (recognizing an exception to the rule in <em>Ford </em>when \u201cthe defendant intends to murder one victim and instead kills an unintended victim\u201d while wounding the intended victim); <em>accord Harvey, </em>681 A.2d at 644 (reviewing Maryland cases, including <em>Ford </em>and <em>Poe, </em>and concluding that \u201cthe fate of the intended victim is immaterial. If the unintended victim is killed, the transferred intent doctrine applies. If the unintended victim is not killed [but is only wounded], the transferred intent doctrine does not apply.\u201d); <em>cf. Bell v. State, </em>768 So.2d 22, 26 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000) (reversing appellant\u2019s conviction for attempted murder based on transferred intent when he only injured the unintended victim); <em>People v. Bland, </em>28 Cal.4th 313, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107, 1110 (2002) (following <em>Ford </em>and <em>Poe </em>and applying transferred intent when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>both victims were killed, but concluding that transferred intent has no application to attempted murder).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">These states, however, remain in the minority. The majority of states apply transferred intent more broadly, allowing the application of the doctrine when any harm comes to an unintended victim as a result of a defendant\u2019s volitional act. <em>See </em>LaFave at \u00a7 6.4(d) n. 47. For example, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed a defendant\u2019s convictions for two counts of aggravated assault when she intentionally shot one victim during a fight and unintentionally shot a bystander who sought to intervene in the fracas. <em>Fussell v. State, </em>187 Ga.App. 134, 369 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1988). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">When an unintended victim is struck down as a result of an unlawful act actually directed against someone else, the law prevents the actor from taking advantage of his own wrong and transfers the original intent from the one against whom it was directed to the one who actually suffered from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApX\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cook v. State, </em>255 Ga. 565, 340 S.E.2d 843 (1986)) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Similarly, the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed a conviction of assault and battery with intent to kill<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that relied on the doctrine of transferred intent when the intended victim was killed and the unintended victim was injured. <em>State v. Fennell, </em>340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000). There, the defendant had an argument with another man, retrieved a gun from his car, and \u201cemptied his gun at\u201d the first victim, killing him. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 531 S.E.2d at 514. One of his shots went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>astray, however, and struck a bystander who survived his injuries. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that intent is not \u201cin limited supply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 531 S.E.2d at 515. The court explained that \u201c[t]he mental state ... is not extinguished at the moment a bullet strikes and kills the intended victim, such that there is no mental state left upon which to convict an unintended victim who is also injured or killed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The South Carolina court decided that the use of transferred intent to convict the appellant of felony assault and battery with intent to kill was appropriate, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO8\">A person who, acting with malice, unleashes a deadly force in an attempt to kill or injure an intended victim should anticipate that the law will require him to answer fully for his deeds when that force Mils or injures an unintended victim. Accordingly, ... the doctrine of transferred intent may be used to convict a defendant ... when [he] Mils the intended victim and also injures an unintended victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 276, 531 S.E.2d at 517.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Finally, while no Virginia appellate decision has specifically addressed this question, our Supreme Court has suggested that a transferred intent instruction could be appropriate when the appellant Mlled one victim and wounded another \u201c[w]ith a single shotgun blast.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Va. 231, 232, 228 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1976). And this Court stated, albeit in dicta, that \u201chad appellant missed [his intended victim] and shot [an unintended victim], <em>or shot both </em>[victims], appellant would have been found guilty of maliciously wounding [his unintended victim], even if he only intended to wound [someone else].\u201d <em>Crawley, </em>25 Va.App. at 773, 492 S.E.2d 503 at (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Based on our review of the law of both this Commonwealth and other jurisdictions, we do not accept Blow\u2019s argument that the \u201cjustifications underlying the doctrine [of transferred intent] are absent\u201d in this case. On the contrary, we agree with the reasoning of the majority of states: this is precisely the kind of situation in which transferred intent should, and does, operate. As another of our sister courts has explained: \u201cHuman beings are not fungible. Therefore, a separate injury to each constitutes a separate crime, and the law does not give the defendant a discount on the second and subsequent victims of his intentional conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 630 A.2d 593, 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Based on this discussion, we hold that the doctrine of transferred intent is applicable when, as here, the defendant completes his intended crime and, in doing so, injures an unintended victim. Thus, the trial court was correct in concluding that Blow\u2019s intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill his wife was transferred and combined with the injury he caused to his daughter to support his conviction of malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Thus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Blow\u2019s convictions, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-16\">. Blow was also convicted of eluding a law enforcement officer in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817(B) and the malicious wounding of his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. He does not challenge these convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">. At trial the daughter testified that when she tried to grab for the knife she \"ended up cutting [her]self.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. Blow relies on our holding in <em>Haywood v. Commonwealth, 20 </em>Va.App. 562, 567, 458 S.E.2d 606, 607 (1995), reversing a conviction for attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer when the \"evidence failed to exclude [a] reasonable hypothesis\u2019\u2019 of innocence. That case, however, is inapposite to the case before us for two reasons. First, the intent involved in <em>Haywood </em>was a very narrow one\u2014the specific intent to kill. Here, the Commonwealth was not limited to proving the intent to kill. Instead, it could meet its burden by proof of any one of several specific intents, i.e., the intent to maim, disable or disfigure. Second, in <em>Haywood </em>we specifically noted that there was no evidence \u201cthat [Haywood] ever swerved or aimed his truck to hit the police cars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court specifically found that Blow did just that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">. In a footnote, Blow also invites us to \"consider whether the doctrine is ever appropriately applied in the case of a stabbing rather than a shooting.\" However, he makes no argument nor does he cite any cases to explain why this is anything other than a distinction without a difference. Accordingly, we decline the invitation. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. <em>See </em>Wilfred J. Ritz, <em>Felony Murder, Transferred Intent, and the Palsgraf Doctrine in the Criminal Law, </em>16 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 169, 169 (1959) (discussing the \"common origin\u201d and relationship between the felony murder rule and the doctrine of transferred intent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. The case before us does not involve an inchoate crime; instead, Blow stands convicted of two counts of the completed crime of malicious wounding. <em>See Crawley, 25 </em>Va.App. at 773, 492 S.E.2d at 505 (declining to apply the doctrine to an inchoate crime). We also note that the California court \"express[ed] no opinion\u201d in <em>Bland </em>\"regarding the application of transferred intent to a crime, such as batteiy, that is not inchoate and does not involve a battery.\u201d 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d at 1119 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">.

Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 630 A.2d 593 (1993) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that under Connecticut\u2019s murder statute, Conn.

Worlock, </em>117 N.J. 596, 569 A.2d 1314 (1990) (affirming murder convictions when defendant killed both intended and unintended victims); <em>State v.
