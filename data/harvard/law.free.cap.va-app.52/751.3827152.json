Smit, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (commissioner), that, during the period October 1997 through March 1998, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen) violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship any newly introduced Passats or New Beetles to Miller Auto Sales, Inc. (Miller). On appeal, Volkswagen contends the circuit court erred in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision because (1) the commissioner failed to perform the requisite analysis under Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), (2) the record contains no evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s decision, (3) the commissioner failed to observe required procedures, (4) the statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause, and (5) the statute is unconstitutionally vague. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Volkswagen, a New Jersey corporation, imports a fixed number of vehicles from its German parent corporation and distributes them to its approximately 600 dealers in the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ed States, including its 17 dealers in Virginia. Miller is a Volkswagen dealer located in Winchester. In January 1998, Miller was the smallest dealer by volume in its assigned sales district.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In late 1997 and early 1998, Volkswagen began importing a number of new models of vehicles, including the 1998 Passat and the New Beetle, both of which were in short supply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Volkswagen used a national allocation methodology to distribute those new models to its dealers. That methodology was based on a \u201cmathematical algorithm\u201d designed to distribute vehicles in short supply where they were most likely to be sold and where they were most needed because of low inventory. Volkswagen then adjusted the algorithm results for each dealer based on the dealer\u2019s customer satisfaction survey scores. Dealers, like Miller, that generally failed to achieve a certain level of customer satisfaction scores had their algorithm results reduced and received fewer vehicles as a result. Volkswagen also permitted its \u201carea executives,\u201d who were responsible for allocating the new vehicles to the individual dealers, to modify the algorithm results in response to local market conditions. Additionally, Volkswagen utilized a \u201cminimum stocking requirement,\u201d which allowed the area executives to override the algorithm results to ensure that each dealer had at least one vehicle of every Volkswagen model in its inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In February 1998, Miller sent a letter to Volkswagen, with a copy to the commissioner, complaining that Volkswagen\u2019s allo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>cation of vehicles to Miller violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Miller asserted that \u201callocating Volkswagens based on Customer Satisfaction Index\u201d was contrary to the statute. Miller also requested that Volkswagen give Miller \u201cthe number of new vehicles of each make, series, and model needed by the dealer to receive a percentage of total new vehicles production or importation currently being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model covered under the warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">After a failed attempt by the parties at mediation, the hearing officer conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Volkswagen failed to provide Miller with \u201can equitable number of vehicles in short supply.\u201d Based on the evidence presented by the parties, the hearing officer found that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology in effect since October 1997 did not conform to the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) because it unfairly penalized small-volume dealers like Miller. In reaching that decision, the hearing officer found that the algorithm Volkswagen used to allocate vehicles in short supply effectively prevented Miller from acquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>such vehicles because it \u201ctruncated fractional allocations\u201d and \u201cdid not accumulate \u2018fractional vehicles.\u2019 \u201d The hearing officer further found that the deficiencies in Volkswagen\u2019s algorithm were compounded by Volkswagen\u2019s use of customer satisfaction scores to adjust the algorithm results. That practice, the hearing officer found, inequitably punished Miller because \u201cthe restriction of allocations itself created a vicious cycle of lower [customer satisfaction] scores.\u201d The hearing officer also found that Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cminimum stocking requirement\u201d failed to overcome the inequities in the allocation methodology in this case, because it was applied only after Miller requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Adopting the hearing officer\u2019s findings, the commissioner concluded that the allocation methodology utilized by Volkswagen since October 1997 violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Volkswagen appealed to the circuit court, arguing that the commissioner erred in basing his determination whether Volkswagen was in compliance with Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) on the allocation methodology used by Volkswagen rather than on the actual number of vehicles Miller received from Volkswagen [Volkswagen allocated to Miller] in relation to the number of vehicles Volkswagen imported nationally. Volkswagen also argued that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is unconstitutionally vague and violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Rejecting Volkswagen\u2019s arguments, the circuit court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">On appeal to this Court, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment, holding that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) was neither unconstitutionally vague nor in violation of the Commerce Clause and that the commissioner\u2019s determination that Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) was consistent with the plain meaning of the statute and supported by the record. <em>See Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Quillian, </em>39 Va.App. 35, 55, 62, 64-65, 69, 569 S.E.2d 744, 754, 757-58, 759, 761 (2002), <em>reversed in part and vacated in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>sub nom. Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Smit, </em>266 Va. 444, 454, 587 S.E.2d 526, 582 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The Supreme Court of Virginia awarded Volkswagen an appeal and, by opinion dated October 31, 2003, reversed this Court\u2019s judgment that the commissioner properly based his determination that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) on Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology rather than the specific number of vehicles Volkswagen allocated to Miller. <em>Volkswagen, </em>266 Va. at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532. The Court held that the \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">required the [cjommissioner to consider the actual monthly shipments that Volkswagen made to Miller in relation to the number of new vehicles imported by Volkswagen on a national level in the particular vehicle categories covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement. The statute further required that the [cjommissioner, in conducting this examination, determine whether Miller obtained the number of such vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u201cequitably related\u201d to the number of these types of vehicles imported by Volkswagen nationally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 452, 587 S.E.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The Supreme Court then concluded that the commissioner failed to undertake the required analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">Instead of addressing the actual number of vehicles Miller received from Volkswagen in relation to national importation numbers, the [cjommissioner merely examined the component parts of Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, and adjustments made to that process, to determine whether they were \u201cfair\u201d in their application to small dealers such as Miller. Thus, in basing his determination on Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, the [cjommissioner wholly failed to consider the national importation numbers for the types of vehicles covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement. This omission was followed by the [cjommissioner\u2019s failure to address whether Miller received the number of vehicles needed to receive a percentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>new vehicle sales \u201cequitably related\u201d to the quantity of these types of vehicles imported on a national level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 453, 587 S.E.2d at 531. Hence, the Court ruled that the commissioner\u2019s \u201cdetermination must be set aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 587 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The Supreme Court further ruled that, because its \u201cconclusion regarding the [c]ommissioner\u2019s erroneous application of the statute decide[d] the merits of [the] appeal,\u201d it was unnecessary to \u201creach the constitutional issues raised by Volkswagen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court vacated \u201cthat portion of [this Court\u2019s] judgment holding that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and is not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Reiterating the need to focus \u201con the actual shipments to Miller, the relevant national importation figures, and whether there was an \u2018equitable\u2019 relationship between those numbers as mandated by the statute,\u201d rather than \u201con the business judgment of Volkswagen,\u201d the Supreme Court remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor ultimate remand to the [c]ommissioner for further proceedings consistent with the principles expressed in [the Supreme Court\u2019s] opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">By order dated April 20, 2004, this Court withdrew its earlier opinion and remanded the case to the circuit court for ultimate remand to the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">On remand to the commissioner, Volkswagen moved to have Miller\u2019s February 1998 complaint dismissed for failure to state a valid claim because it focused solely on Volkswagen\u2019s allocation methodology rather than the actual number of new vehicles Miller had received.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Volkswagen also argued that \u201cMil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ler\u2019s initial protest may be moot\u201d because it was based on an allocation method that was no longer used by Volkswagen. Concluding that the case was in the \u201csame posture\u201d as when Miller was granted the original hearing except they \u201cnow [had] a clear indication from the Supreme Court on what [the commissioner was] required to consider in order to make a determination whether Volkswagen [had] violated ... Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7),\u201d the commissioner denied Volkswagen\u2019s motion to dismiss and directed that an evidentiary hearing be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The commissioner noted that, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion and Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), the issue to be determined was \u201cwhether Miller obtained the number of vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u2018equitably related\u2019 to the quantity of these types of vehicles imported on a national level.\u201d Thus, the commissioner directed Volkswagen</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">to provide the hearing officer and Miller with all relevant information and data which would delineate (i) Volkswagen\u2019s national importation numbers for the types of vehicles covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement for the time period in dispute, and (ii) the actual shipments received by Miller in relation to the national importation numbers achieved by Volkswagen during this same time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">When the hearing officer was appointed, Volkswagen requested that he \u201cimpos[e] some process by which Miller\u2019s claims [could] be identified and articulated prior to the hearing.\u201d Specifically, Volkswagen asked that \u201cMiller be required to provide Volkswagen with either some form of amended complaint or \u2018bill of particulars\u2019 outlining the specifics of its complaint.\u201d After conducting a prehearing conference, the hearing officer noted that the parties agreed that \u201cthe period under consideration in this dispute [was] from 1993 through 1998\u201d and that the issue to be heard was the same issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>articulated by the Supreme Court and the commissioner, namely, \u201cwhether Miller ... received the number of vehicles needed [to] receive[ ] a percentage of new vehicles equitably related to the number of vehicles imported by Volkswagen nationally.\u201d The hearing officer further noted that Volkswagen\u2019s request for more specifics of Miller\u2019s complaint was \u201can ingenuous irrelevancy\u201d since the issue was clear. The hearing officer asked the parties to \u201csuggest corrections to [his] findings as appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">In response, Volkswagen stated that it did not agree that the period under consideration was 1993 through 1998. Instead, Volkswagen \u201ccontinue[d] to take the position that,\u201d because Miller\u2019s complaint focused on a vehicle allocation methodology that Volkswagen did not employ until late 1997 and because the proof at the first hearing and the commissioner\u2019s initial decision related solely to that time period, \u201cthe relevant time period ... [was] the period during which the [customer satisfaction]-based allocation process was in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Volkswagen then filed with the commissioner a \u201cMotion for Due Process Protections.\u201d Asserting its \u201cdue process right to know the charges against which it [was] being called upon to defend itself,\u201d Volkswagen asked the commissioner to dismiss the proceedings and require Miller to assert a new, valid complaint. Volkswagen argued that Miller\u2019s original February 1998 complaint, \u201cby alleging only that [Volkswagen] was allocating vehicles in an improper manner[, was] not enough to indicate a possible violation of [Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7)], given the Supreme Court\u2019s October 31, 2003 ruling.\u201d It did not, Volkswagen further argued, articulate \u201chow many vehicles Miller believe[d] it should have been shipped\u201d or state \u201cwhat models and series of additional vehicles [were] involved, what the relevant time period [was], or why additional vehicles should have been shipped.\u201d Alternatively, Volkswagen asked that, before the commencement of a formal evidentiary hearing, the commissioner conduct an \u201cinvestigation into the bases of Miller\u2019s complaint\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 46.2-1573(C), give Volkswagen any information in the commissioner\u2019s possession that could \u201cbe relied upon in making a decision adverse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Volkswagen,\u201d and provide Volkswagen with \u201cformal notice of the legal and factual bases for the charges against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The case proceeded to an evidentiary hearing without apparent response from the commissioner to Volkswagen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">At the hearing, Miller and Volkswagen stipulated that the transcripts and exhibits from the first evidentiary hearing were to be made a part of the record to avoid duplication. Miller presented additional evidence showing that, despite having ordered and requested delivery of such vehicles from Volkswagen, Miller received no 1998 Passats from Volkswagen during the six-month period from October 1997 through March 1998 and no New Beetles during the two-month period from February 1998 through March 1998. Miller\u2019s evidence further showed that, nationally, Volkswagen imported a total of 18,454 1998 Passats and 5,637 New Beetles during the same respective time periods for distribution to its approximately 600 dealers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In presenting this evidence, Miller took no position on how many 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen would have had to ship to Miller each month in order for those shipments to be deemed \u201cequitably related\u201d to Volkswagen\u2019s national importation figures. Instead, Miller argued that, in light of the significant number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally from October 1997 through March 1998, Volkswagen\u2019s shipment to Miller of no such vehicles during those months was not equitably related to Volkswagen\u2019s national importation figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Volkswagen argued that its allocation of 1998 Passats and New Beetles to Miller was \u201cequitable\u201d because Miller\u2019s average \u201cday supply\u201d of those vehicles from March 1998 to December 1999 exceeded the national average.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Volks<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>wagen\u2019s own evidence showed that it did not allocate any 1998 Passats to Miller from October 1997 through March 1998 or any New Beetles to Miller from February 1998 through March 1998. Thus, Miller\u2019s average \u201cday supply\u201d of 1998 Passats and New Beetles for those specific months was zero, and its percentage of the national \u201cday supply\u201d average was zero percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Volkswagen also presented evidence that it did not allocate any Passats to Miller in late 1997 and early 1998 because Miller had not yet acquired certain front-end alignment equipment necessary to repair the suspension system on the 1998 Passat.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">After hearing the evidence presented, the hearing officer found that Volkswagen\u2019s admitted refusal to ship any 1998 Passats or New Beetles to Miller during the six-month period from October 1997 through March 1998 constituted a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Upon consideration of the record, the commissioner agreed with the hearing officer that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship any 1998 Passats to Miller from October 1997 through March 1998 and any New Beetles to Miller from February 1998 through March 1998. Those failures, the commissioner stated, \u201cresulted in Miller not obtaining the number of [those] vehicles needed by Miller to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales of each make, series, and model equitably related to the total new vehicle importations being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In reaching that decision, the commissioner recognized that Miller did not present evidence regarding the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles it would have needed to receive \u201cin order to achieve a percentage of total new vehicle sales equitably related to the total new vehicle production or importations being achieved by Volkswagen nationally.\u201d Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>less, the commissioner concluded that \u201callocations of zero vehicles of a certain make, series, or model for one or more months would not be equitable.\u201d The commissioner reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\">such an allocation would generally not satisfy the statutory requirement in months where, as in this case, the national importation numbers exceeded] the number of dealers nationally, and particularly where, as in this case, the vehicles are newly introduced makes, series or models. An allocation of zero vehicles, assuming a dealer has no such vehicles in inventory, translates to zero sales and zero sales, expressed as a percentage of new vehicle sales, would be zero percent. It is my opinion that shipping a number of vehicles that will enable a dealer to achieve or receive zero percent of the sales of a vehicle is generally not equitably related to national importation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">... Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) provides that it is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to \u201cfail to ship monthly to any dealer, if ordered by the dealer[,]\u201d the requisite number of vehicles specified by the statute. Based on the testimony in this case, it is undisputed that (i) Miller ordered and Volkswagen was aware of Miller\u2019s order for Passats during the months of October, November and December of 1997 and January, February and March of 1998 ... and that Volkswagen declined to ship any Passats to Miller during those months____ It is also undisputed that Miller ordered and Volkswagen was aware of Miller\u2019s order for Beetles during the months of February and March of 1998 ... and that Volkswagen failed to ship any Beetles to Miller during those months____ Further, during the relevant months, the national importations of the newly introduced Passats and Beetles exceeded the number of U.S. Volkswagen dealers and thus, there were sufficient numbers of these vehicles to send every U.S. dealer more than zero vehicles: however, Miller received zero.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The commissioner also found Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cday supply\u201d analysis unpersuasive with respect to the relevant six-month period from October 1997 through March 1998 because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u201cfailed to show that, for the newly introduced Beetles and Passats, Miller\u2019s day[ ] supply was equal to the national average for these specific vehicles.\u201d Moreover, the commissioner determined that, having been \u201cadmonished by the Supreme Court not to look at allocation formulas or methodologies\u201d and instead \u201cinstructed to focus on the \u2018actual shipments to Miller, the relevant national importation figures, and whether there was an \u201cequitable\u201d relationship between those numbers,\u2019 \u201d he could not properly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">accept the day[ ] analysis presented by [Volkswagen], in this case, since it did not focus on and did not evaluate whether zero shipments of newly introduced Passats and Beetles to Miller in the relevant months provided the dealer with the number of these vehicles needed by Miller to receive a percentage of total new vehicles sales of each make, series, and model equitably related to the total new vehicle importations being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The commissioner further found that Miller\u2019s failure to acquire the new front-end alignment equipment for the 1998 Passat had no bearing on the issue whether Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to allocate any such Passats to Miller during the relevant time period. Noting that \u201cCode \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) provides no exception to the allocation requirements set forth therein,\u201d the commissioner concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">It is clear from the record that the reason that Volkswagen declined to ship Miller Passat\u2019s [sic] for the months of November 1997, December 1997, January 1998 and February 1998 was because Miller had not obtained certain front-end alignment equipment required by Volkswagen. While Volkswagen may have had good reason for requiring a dealer to obtain alignment equipment for these vehicles, nothing in ... Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) would authorize Volkswagen to withhold vehicles from a dealer for this reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, rejecting Volkswagen\u2019s claims that the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>acted in an unlawful manner and that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) violates the United States and Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On appeal to this Court, Volkswagen asserts five arguments to support its contention that the circuit court erred in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship Miller any 1998 Passats or New Beetles from October 1997 through March 1998. First, Volkswagen claims the commissioner failed to perform the analysis mandated by Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), as instructed by the Supreme Court in its October 31, 2003 opinion. Second, Volkswagen asserts the administrative record contains insufficient evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s decision. Additionally, Volkswagen contends the commissioner failed to follow fundamental procedural requirements. Volkswagen further maintains that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Finally, Volkswagen posits that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) violates the Due Process Clauses of the Virginia and United States Constitutions. We disagree with each of Volkswagen\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Judicial review of the commissioner\u2019s decision is governed by the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 to 2.2-4031. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1573(A). Accordingly, Volkswagen, as the party challenging the commissioner\u2019s decision, bears the burden \u201cto demonstrate an error of law\u201d with respect to the issues whether the commissioner accorded constitutional rights, complied with statutory authority, and observed required procedures, and whether substantial evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s decision.

Propriety of the Commissioner\u2019s Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Volkswagen contends the commissioner exceeded his statutory authority in finding that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) because the commissioner failed, in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>that finding, to perform the specific statutory analysis prescribed by the Supreme Court in its October 31, 2003 opinion. Volkswagen asserts the Supreme Court set forth in that opinion three specific determinations the commissioner had to make in order to find the statute had been violated. According to Volkswagen,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">[flirst, the [commissioner must determine, for a given month and for a given dealer, the percentage of total new vehicle sales of a vehicle by the dealer that is equitably related to the total national importation of that vehicle. Second, the [commissioner must determine the number of vehicles that the dealer would need to have for it to receive such percentage of sales. Third, the [c]ommissioner must determine whether the dealer actually obtained from the distributor the number of shipments necessary to allow it to have such a number of vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Thus, Volkswagen argues, the commissioner could not \u201cfind a violation of the statute based solely on evidence comparing shipments to national importations.\u201d Rather, Volkswagen\u2019s argument continues, the commissioner had to expressly determine for a particular month what specific number of vehicles the distributor was required to ship to the dealer to allow the dealer to achieve a percentage of total new vehicle sales that was equitably related to the total new vehicle importation of that vehicle being achieved nationally by the distributor. Hence, Volkswagen further argues, the commissioner was required to expressly \u201cfind that Miller needed to be shipped at least one vehicle before he could find that [Volkswagen] violated the statute by shipping zero vehicles.\u201d Volkswagen concludes that the commissioner\u2019s failure to expressly make that requisite finding constituted a rejection of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) and rendered the commissioner\u2019s analysis unlawful. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In reversing this Court\u2019s prior decision in this case, the Supreme Court held that, in order to determine whether a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) has occurred, the commissioner must focus on the actual number of vehicles the distributor allocated to the dealer, rather than on the distributor\u2019s vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>allocation methodology. <em>Volkswagen, </em>266 Va. at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532. Thus, the Court explained, the commissioner was required in this case \u201cto consider the actual monthly shipments that Volkswagen made to Miller in relation to the number of new vehicles imported by Volkswagen on a national level in the particular vehicle categories covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 587 S.E.2d at 531. The Court further explained that, \u201cin conducting this examination, [the commissioner was required to] determine whether Miller obtained the number of such vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u2018equitably related\u2019 to the number of these types of vehicles imported by Volkswagen nationally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further explicating the commissioner\u2019s need to \u201caddress[] the actual number of vehicles Miller received from Volkswagen in relation to national importation numbers,\u201d the Court indicated that the requisite statutory analysis required the commissioner \u201cto consider the national importation numbers for the types of vehicles covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement\u201d and \u201cto address whether Miller received the number of vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u2018equitably related\u2019 to the quantity of these types of vehicles imported on a national level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 587 S.E.2d at 531. Finally, the Court explained that the focus of the requisite analysis must be \u201con the actual shipments to Miller, the relevant national importation figures, and whether there was an \u2018equitable\u2019 relationship between those numbers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">It is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) that the commissioner\u2019s decision in this case must be supported by three specific findings: (1) the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Miller actually received from Volkswagen during each of the months at issue, (2) the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally during each of the same months, and (3) whether the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Miller actually received from Volkswagen during each of the months at issue permitted Miller to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u201cequitably related\u201d to the number of 1998 Passats and New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally during each of the same months. Our review of the commissioner\u2019s written decision reveals the commissioner made each of these required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">First, the commissioner found that Miller did not receive any 1998 Passats or New Beetles from Volkswagen during the period between from October 1997 through March 1998 following the respective introductions of those vehicles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">Based on the testimony in this ease, it is undisputed that ... Miller ordered and Volkswagen was aware of Miller\u2019s order for Passats during the months of October, November and December of 1997 and January, February and March of 1998 and that Volkswagen declined to ship any Passats to Miller during those months. It is also undisputed that Miller ordered and Volkswagen was aware of Miller\u2019s order for Beetles during the months of February and March of 1998[ ] and that Volkswagen failed to ship any Beetles to Miller during those months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Second, the commissioner found that Volkswagen, which had \u201capproximately 600 Volkswagen dealers in the U.S.\u201d at the time, imported 2,016 Passats in October 1997; 2,996 Passats in November 1997; 4,885 Passats in December 1997; 1,270 Passats in January 1998; 3,655 Passats in February 1998; 3,682 Passats in March 1998; 1,424 New Beetles in February 1998; and 4,213 New Beetles in March 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Third, the commissioner found that Volkswagen\u2019s failure to ship any 1998 Passats to Miller during the months of October 1997 through March 1998 and any New Beetles during the months of February 1998 and March 1998 did not permit Miller to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales equitably related to the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally during those same months:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnB\">I conclude that Volkswagen\u2019s shipment of zero Passats and zero Beetles to Miller in these months, when it is clear that they were ordered by Miller, resulted in Miller not obtaining the number of these vehicles needed by Miller to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales of each make, series, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>and model equitably related to the total new vehicle importations being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The commissioner reasoned that, because Miller had not previously received from Volkswagen any of the newly introduced 1998 Passats or New Beetles, \u201c[a]n allocation of zero vehicles [during the relevant months] translate^] to zero sales and zero sales, expressed as a percentage of new vehicle sales, would be zero percent.\u201d The commissioner further reasoned that \u201cshipping a number of vehicles that will enable a dealer to achieve or receive zero percent of the sales of a vehicle is generally not equitably related to national importation,\u201d particularly where, as here, \u201cthe national importations of the newly introduced Passats and Beetles exceeded the number of U.S. Volkswagen dealers and thus, there were sufficient numbers of these vehicles to send every U.S. dealer more than zero vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Based on these findings, the commissioner concluded that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship any 1998 Passats to Miller from October 1997 through March 1998 and any New Beetles to Miller from February 1998 through March 1998. Because, in reaching that decision, the commissioner focused on the actual number of vehicles the distributor allocated to the dealer, rather than on the distributor\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, and made the three factual determinations required under Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s analysis comported with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis previously set forth in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 452-54, 587 S.E.2d at 531-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Indeed, notwithstanding Volkswagen\u2019s claim to the contrary, we find nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis that required the commissioner to expressly identify a particular number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles that Miller would have needed to receive during the relevant months in order to achieve a percentage of new vehicle sales equitably related to the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally during those months. While such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>intermediate finding may, under some circumstances, assist the commissioner in making the third required finding, it is not, in itself, a required finding under the statute. Here, the evidence showed that Miller did not receive any 1998 Passats or New Beetles from Volkswagen during each of the relevant months. Hence, the sole question before the commissioner was whether Miller\u2019s receipt from Volkswagen of zero 1998 Passats and New Beetles permitted Miller to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales equitably related to the number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen imported nationally during the same months. Effectively finding that the receipt of some number of such vehicles greater than zero was required to permit Miller to achieve the requisite sales percentage, the commissioner found that Miller\u2019s receipt of no such vehicles was not enough to satisfy Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Actual identification of the specific number of vehicles that Miller needed to receive to attain the required sales percentage was unnecessary under the plain terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Having determined that the commissioner performed the appropriate statutory analysis prescribed by the Supreme Court, we hold that the commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority in finding that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">C. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Volkswagen asserts the commissioner\u2019s finding that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Volkswagen presents two related arguments to support its assertion that the record lacks sufficient evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s decision. First and foremost, Volkswagen maintains the record lacks any evidence regarding \u201cthe critical factual finding required by ... Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7),\u201d namely, the specific number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles that Miller would have needed to receive in each of the relevant months in order to achieve a percentage of new vehicle sales equitably related to the number of those vehicles imported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>nationally by Volkswagen during the same months. This argument is inextricably intertwined with Volkswagen\u2019s prior claim that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) required the commissioner, before finding Volkswagen violated the statute, to specifically determine how many 1998 Passats and New Beetles Volkswagen had to ship to Miller to allow Miller to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales that was equitably related to Volkswagen\u2019s national importation of those vehicles. Having previously concluded above that such a determination was not required under Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), we reject Volkswagen\u2019s argument that evidence to support such a determination must appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Second, Volkswagen argues that the evidence in the record does not adequately support the commissioner\u2019s finding that Miller\u2019s sales percentage of zero during the relevant months when it received no 1998 Passats and New Beetles from Volkswagen was not equitably related to Volkswagen\u2019s national importation figures during the same months for those vehicles. According to Volkswagen, Miller failed to show that \u201cit actually was equitably entitled to make some percentage of U.S. sales of those particular vehicles\u201d during those months. Volkswagen argues that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">[gjiven Miller\u2019s historically small percentage of U.S. sales, given the very small number of Passats and Beetles actually being imported nationally by [Volkswagen] during those particular months, and given Miller\u2019s refusal to acquire necessary repair equipment that nearly every other dealer in the U.S. had purchased, ... Miller was not equitably entitled to make any sales of Passats or Beetles during those months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We find no merit in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">For one thing, the record factually refutes Volkswagen\u2019s claim. It is undisputed that, although the smallest dealer by volume in its assigned sales district, Miller was a functioning dealership that continued, throughout the relevant months at issue, to actively sell Volkswagen vehicles. Miller, in fact, sold 47 new Volkswagen vehicles in 1997. In other words, Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>was not a defunct dealership\u2014its overall, ongoing percentage of total new vehicle sales was not zero.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is also undisputed that Volkswagen had approximately 600 dealers in the United States at the time, that Volkswagen imported 2,016 of the popular, newly introduced 1998 Passats in October 1997; 2,996 Passats in November 1997; 4,835 Passats in December 1997; 1,270 Passats in January 1998; 3,655 Passats in February 1998; and 3,682 Passats in March 1998, and that Volkswagen imported 1,424 of the popular, newly introduced New Beetles in February 1998 and 4,213 New Beetles in March 1998. Thus, as the commissioner aptly noted, \u201cthe national importations of the newly introduced Passats and Beetles exceeded the number of U.S. Volkswagen dealers and thus, there were sufficient numbers of these vehicles to send every U.S. dealer more than zero vehicles.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s finding that Miller\u2019s sales percentage of zero for the 1998 Passat and New Beetle was not equitably related to Volkswagen\u2019s national importation figures for those vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Moreover, we agree with the commissioner\u2019s determination that Miller\u2019s failure to purchase certain repair equipment had no bearing on the analysis prescribed by the Supreme Court. As previously mentioned, the Court, in considering the \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), held that the commissioner erred in considering \u201cthe component parts of Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation methodology, and adjustments made to that process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 587 S.E.2d at 531. The Court further held that the statute required the commissioner to focus not \u201con the business judgment of Volkswagen\u201d but \u201con the <em>actual shipments </em>to Miller, the relevant <em>national importation figures, </em>and whether there was an \u2018equitable\u2019 relationship <em>between those numbers.\u201d Id. </em>at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>added). Given the Court\u2019s clear instruction to focus solely on the numbers themselves, rather than on the rationale or \u201cbusiness judgment\u201d behind them, we conclude that Volkswagen\u2019s decision not to send any 1998 Passats or New Beetles to Miller because Miller had not yet obtained certain repair equipment was not a pertinent or even permissible consideration under the statutorily required analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We hold, therefore, that, contrary to Volkswagen\u2019s claim, substantial evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s decision that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Thus, the circuit court did not err in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">D. Procedural Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Volkswagen contends the commissioner committed five \u201cprocedural errors\u201d that required reversal of his decision that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). Volkswagen alleges the commissioner (1) failed to dismiss Miller\u2019s complaint for failure to state a valid claim,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) failed on remand to conduct an investigation into the merits of Miller\u2019s complaint, (3) failed to provide notice of the charges to be tried at the hearing, (4) wrongfully delegated prosecution of the case to Miller, and (5) issued a decision on charges not made prior to the hearing. Therefore, Volkswagen concludes, the circuit court erred in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision. We hold that the circuit court did not so err and briefly address the alleged procedural errors below.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">1. Failure to Dismiss the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Volkswagen contends the commissioner erred in denying its motion to dismiss Miller\u2019s February 1998 complaint for failure to state a valid claim. According to Volkswagen, Miller\u2019s complaint no longer stated a valid claim on remand because, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>failed to indicate a possible violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) and because the lone claim it stated was factually moot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Volkswagen argues that Miller\u2019s complaint failed to indicate a possible violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) on remand because, in remanding the case to the commissioner, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court ruled that the statute regulates vehicle shipments, not vehicle allocation methodologies.\u201d \u201cMiller\u2019s complaint letter,\u201d Volkswagen\u2019s argument continues, \u201ccomplained only about [Volkswagen\u2019s] vehicle allocation system, and, indeed, only about the customer satisfaction component of that system.\u201d Thus, Volkswagen concludes, \u201cin light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Miller\u2019s complaint did not state a valid claim or indicate a possible violation of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Volkswagen also argues that Miller\u2019s complaint was factually moot on remand because Volkswagen \u201chad long since adopted a new allocation methodology, and had ceased including a customer satisfaction component in its allocation algorithm.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, Volkswagen concludes, Miller\u2019s February 1998 complaint, \u201cwhich objected to an abandoned allocation system, and, specifically, to the customer satisfaction component of that system, no longer stated a justiciable controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Both of Volkswagen\u2019s arguments are premised on the assertion that Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint \u201ccomplained <em>only </em>about [Volkswagen\u2019s] vehicle allocation system, and, indeed, <em>only </em>about the customer satisfaction component of that system.\u201d (Emphasis added). That assertion, however, is .contradicted by the terms of the complaint. While it is true that Miller\u2019s complaint ostensibly focused on Volkswagen\u2019s allocation of vehicles \u201cbased on Customer Satisfaction Index,\u201d it is also true that at the heart of the complaint was Miller\u2019s comprehensive allegation that Volkswagen had violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) by failing to ship Miller \u201cthe number of new vehicles of each make, series, and model needed by the dealer to receive a percentage of total new vehicles [sales of each make, series, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>and model equitably related to the total new vehicle] production or importation currently being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model covered under the warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">It was that core allegation that gave rise to the commissioner\u2019s previous examination of Volkswagen\u2019s entire allocation methodology\u2014not just the customer satisfaction aspect of it\u2014 and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that the resolution of the instant complaint under Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) turned not on Volkswagen\u2019s allocation methodology but on the actual number of vehicles Volkswagen shipped to Miller. At no point during the numerous proceedings of this case did the commissioner or the courts find that the scope of Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint was limited solely to Volkswagen\u2019s use of customer satisfaction scores to allocate new vehicles. Rather, the overriding issue throughout was whether, as Miller claimed in its 1998 complaint, Volkswagen\u2019s allocation of new vehicles to Miller failed to comply with the statute. And it was that same issue that remained valid and subject to examination and resolution on remand, in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Indeed, had the continuation of the case under the 1998 complaint been rendered invalid by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision or rendered factually moot by Volkswagen\u2019s revised allocation methodology, the Court could and likely would have ruled so and dismissed the case. <em>See, e.g., Franklin v. Peers, </em>95 Va. 602, 602, 29 S.E. 321, 321 (1898) (\u201cWhenever it appears or is made to appear that there is no actual controversy between the litigants, or that, if it once existed, it has ceased to do so, it is the duty of every judicial tribunal not to proceed to the formal determination of the apparent controversy, but to dismiss the case.\u201d). Instead, however, the Court remanded the case with instruction that the commissioner employ the analysis set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion to resolve Miller\u2019s claim that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Volkswagen, </em>266 Va. at 454, 587 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the valid claim made in Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) by failing to ship Miller the requisite number of vehicles remained unchanged by Volkswagen\u2019s revised allocation methodology and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, the complaint was not invalid or moot upon the continuation of this case on remand, and the commissioner did not err in refusing to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a valid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">2. Failure to Investigate Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Volkswagen contends the commissioner \u201ccompounded his procedural error\u201d by refusing to investigate the merits of Miller\u2019s complaint on remand, as required by Code \u00a7 46.2-1573(C). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1573(C) provides that the commissioner \u201cshall initiate investigations, conduct hearings, and determine the rights of parties under this article [(Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1566 to 46.2-1573.01)] whenever he is provided information by the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board or any other person indicating a possible violation of any provision of this article.\u201d According to Volkswagen, the statute requires the commissioner, upon receipt of an allegation of a statutory violation, \u201cto conduct an independent investigation as to whether or not there is a legitimate basis to believe that an accused party actually has violated the law.\u201d The commissioner argues that the statute requires him, upon receipt of such an allegation, to merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>investigate \u201cwhether there [is] a dispute between the parties.\u201d We need not decide which party is correct because, even if we assume, without deciding, that Volkswagen is correct that the commissioner is required, upon notification of a possible statutory violation, to investigate whether \u201cthere is a legitimate basis to believe that an accused party actually has violated the law,\u201d we nevertheless conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, no such investigation was required on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">As we indicated in the prior section above, this case arose upon Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint alleging that Volkswagen had violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) by failing to ship Miller the requisite number of vehicles. That complaint notified the commissioner of a possible statutory violation and served as the basis for the proceedings in this case. After mediation proved unsuccessful, the commissioner conducted an evidentiary hearing on Miller\u2019s complaint and concluded that Volkswagen\u2019s allocation methodology had prevented Miller from acquiring a sufficient number of 1998 Passats and New Beetles to satisfy Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7). On appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the analysis used by the commissioner and remanded the case so the commissioner could resolve the complaint using the correct legal standard. The case on remand was not a new, separate action. It was not based on a new allegation or any new information from Miller \u201cindicating a possible [statutory] violation.\u201d Instead, it was a continuation of the same matter based on the same complaint. Thus, the commissioner\u2019s receipt of this case on remand did not constitute the receipt, under Code \u00a7 46.2-1573(C), of \u201cinformation ... indicating a possible [statutory] violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Moreover, in light of the prior proceedings in the case, the commissioner was already familiar on remand with the case and the merits of Miller\u2019s complaint. Thus, there was no need for the commissioner to conduct \u201can independent investigation as to whether or not there [was] a legitimate basis to believe that [Volkswagen] actually ha[d] violated the law.\u201d That basis already existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Because the remand of this case did not constitute the provision of new \u201cinformation indicating a possible [statutory] violation\u201d and because the commissioner already had a \u201clegitimate basis to believe\u201d that Volkswagen had violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), the commissioner was under no obligation to investigate the merits of Miller\u2019s complaint on remand. Thus, the commissioner did not err in refusing Volkswagen\u2019s request to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">3. Failure to Provide Notice of the Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Volkswagen also contends the commissioner erred on remand by failing to provide Volkswagen with \u201cany notice of the factual and legal bases for the claims that would be presented at the formal evidentiary hearing.\u201d Volkswagen argues that \u201c[s]uch notice would have had to advise [Volkswagen], prior to the hearing, of the interpretation of the statute that would be applied by the [c]ommissioner.\u201d We find no merit to Volkswagen\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">On remand, both the commissioner and the hearing officer clearly indicated in letters to Miller and Volkswagen that the issue to be heard on remand was the issue set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s October 31, 2003 opinion. Stating that they \u201cnow [had] a clear indication from the Supreme Court on what [the commissioner was] required to consider in order to make a determination whether Volkswagen [had] violated ... Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7),\u201d the commissioner directed that a hearing \u201cbe held consistent with the principles expressed in the [Supreme Court\u2019s] [o]pinion.\u201d The commissioner further stated that \u201cMiller and Volkswagen should be prepared to offer to the hearing officer relevant documentation and evidence to address the issue of whether Miller obtained the number of vehicles needed to receive a percentage of new vehicle sales \u2018equitably related\u2019 to the quantity of these types of vehicles imported on a national level.\u201d The commissioner specifically directed Volkswagen to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">all relevant information and data which would delineate (i) Volkswagen\u2019s national importation numbers for the types of vehicles covered under Miller\u2019s franchise agreement for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>time period in dispute, and (ii) the actual shipments received by Miller in relation to the national importation numbers achieved by Volkswagen during this same time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Following the prehearing conference, the hearing officer identified the time period in dispute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and noted that the issue to be heard was the same issue articulated by the Supreme Court and the commissioner, namely, \u201cwhether Miller ... received the number of vehicles needed [to] receive[ ] a percentage of new vehicles equitably related to the number of vehicles imported by Volkswagen nationally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Given the factual and legal clarity of the issue set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s October 31, 2003 opinion and the commissioner\u2019s and hearing officer\u2019s unmistakable reference to the same issue, we hold that Volkswagen had adequate notice of the claims that would be presented at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">4. Delegation of Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Volkswagen contends the commissioner further erred on remand \u201cby delegating to Miller full authority to prosecute the claim against \u00a1Volkswagen] at the hearing.\u201d Volkswagen argues that the commissioner may only \u201cdelegate his prosecutorial responsibilities to another executive agency, such as the Office of the Attorney General.\u201d We need not consider the merits of this issue, however, because Volkswagen failed to properly preserve the issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Although Volkswagen raised the same argument on appeal to the circuit court, we find nothing in the record of this case that indicates that Volkswagen raised the issue before the commissioner. \u201cAn appellant, under the provisions of the [Administrative Process Act], may not raise issues on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>appeal from an administrative agency to the circuit court that it did not submit to the agency for the agency\u2019s consideration.\u201d <em>Pence Holdings, Inc. v. Auto Center, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 703, 707, 454 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1995), <em>cited with approval in Doe v. Virginia Bd. of Dentistry, </em>52 Va.App. 166, 176, 662 S.E.2d 99, 104 (2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Thus, having failed to raise this issue before the commissioner, Volkswagen is precluded from raising it on appeal. Accordingly, we will not consider the merits of Volkswagen\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">5. Charge against Volkswagen</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Additionally, Volkswagen contends the commissioner erred on remand by finding Volkswagen guilty of a \u201ccharge that was not contained in any charging document.\u201d According to Volkswagen, Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint \u201ccontinued to allege only that [Volkswagen] was operating an unlawful allocation system.\u201d It did not, Volkswagen further asserts, identify \u201cany other charge against\u201d Volkswagen. However, Volkswagen continues, the commissioner found that Volkswagen had violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) \u201cnot because of [Volkswagen\u2019s] allocation system, but because [Volkswagen] had failed to ship ... certain vehicles to Miller during certain months.\u201d Thus, Volkswagen concludes, the commissioner \u201chad no authority to make the specific finding that he did.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">As with its first claim of procedural error, Volkswagen\u2019s instant claim is based on the flawed premise that Miller\u2019s 1998 complaint complained only about Volkswagen\u2019s vehicle allocation system. Having previously concluded that Miller\u2019s complaint alleged that Volkswagen had violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) by failing to ship Miller the number of new vehicles required under the statute, we hold that Miller\u2019s complaint provided Volkswagen with adequate notice of the violation the commissioner found it to have committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Accordingly, the commissioner did not err in making that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>E. Dormant Commerce Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Volkswagen contends Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), as applied and on its face, violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly regulates interstate commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The United States Supreme Court \u201chas adopted a two-tiered approach to analyzing state economic regulation under the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>Healy v. Beer Institute, </em>491 U.S. 324, 337 n. 14, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 2500 n. 14, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">\u201cWhen a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry. When, however, a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly, we have examined whether the State\u2019s interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., </em>476 U.S. 573, 579, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 2084, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">In this case, Volkswagen first argues that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), on its face and as applied, is <em>per se </em>invalid because it directly regulates interstate commerce. Volkswagen maintains that, by requiring distributors to ship motor vehicles to its Virginia dealers in accordance with production or importation levels \u201cbeing achieved nationally,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) \u201cunlawfully controls the number of vehicles that the distributor may import into the U.S. and, as a result, has the practical effect of controlling commerce outside of Virginia.\u201d Moreover, Volkswagen argues, if adopted by other states, the statute \u201cwould create the likelihood of a gridlock of competing state regulations.\u201d These effects, Volkswagen maintains, constitute direct regulation of interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The Supreme Court set forth in <em>Healy </em>the governing principles for determining whether a statute has an impermissible extraterritorial effect, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-4\">First, the \u201cCommerce Clause ... precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State\u2019s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State[.]\u201d <em>Edgar v. MITE Corp., </em>457 U.S. 624, 642-643, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 2640-2641, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982) (plurality opinion); <em>see also Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>476 U.S. at 581-583, 106 S.Ct. at 2085-2087[.] ... Second, a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State\u2019s authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute\u2019s extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature. The critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State. <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>476 U.S. at 579, 106 S.Ct. at 2084. Third, the practical effect of the statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other States and what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation. Generally speaking, the Commerce Clause protects against inconsistent legislation arising from the projection of one state regulatory regime into the jurisdiction of another State. <em>Cf. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, </em>481 U.S. 69, 88-89, 107 S.Ct. 1637, 1649-1650, 95 L.Ed.2d 67 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">491 U.S. at 336-37, 109 S.Ct. at 2499-2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The question before us, then, is whether Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), on its face or as applied, has the practical effect of controlling commercial activity wholly beyond Virginia\u2019s borders. If so, it is <em>per se </em>invalid. <em>See Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, </em>46 F.3d 790, 793 (8th Cir.1995) (holding that a state statute is <em>per se </em>invalid under the Commerce Clause when it has an extraterritorial effect, \u201cthat is, when the statute has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>practical effect of controlling conduct beyond the boundaries of the state\u201d (citing <em>Healy, </em>491 U.S. at 336, 109 S.Ct. at 2499)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">For example, in <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a New York statute requiring liquor distillers to affirm that their posted in-state prices for the coming month were no higher than the prices that would be charged for the same products in other states during the same month was <em>per se </em>invalid under the Commerce Clause. 476 U.S. at 582-84, 106 S.Ct. at 2086-87. The Court found that the statute effectively controlled prices in other states because, once the prices had been posted in New York, a distiller could not lower its prices in any other state. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Similarly, in <em>Healy, </em>the Supreme Court struck down a Connecticut statute that required out-of-state beer shippers to affirm that the prices they charged in Connecticut were no higher than the lowest prices they charged for the same products in bordering states. 491 U.S. at 343, 109 S.Ct. at 2503. The Court held the statute to be unconstitutional because it had the impermissible practical effect of \u201ccontrolling commercial activity wholly outside of\u2019 Connecticut. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 109 S.Ct. at 2500. The Court not only found that the statute controlled prices in neighboring states and interfered with the regulatory schemes in those states, but also observed that the enactment of similar legislation by several or all states would result in a \u201cprice gridlock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 109 S.Ct. at 2501. Such regional or national regulation of commercial activity, the Court noted, is \u201creserved by the Commerce Clause to the Federal Government and may not be accomplished piecemeal through the extraterritorial reach of individual state statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The principles set forth in <em>Healy </em>and <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. </em>are not limited to price-affirmation statutes. For instance, in <em>NCAA v. Miller, </em>10 F.3d 633 (9th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1033, 114 S.Ct. 1543, 128 L.Ed.2d 195 (1994), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a Nevada statute that required the NCAA to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>different \u201cprocedural due process protections\u201d in Nevada enforcement proceedings than it provided in enforcement proceedings in other states violated the Commerce Clause <em>per se </em>because it directly regulated interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 640. Noting that the NCAA required uniform enforcement procedures to operate effectively, the Ninth Circuit held that the practical effect of the Nevada statute was to require the NCAA \u201cto apply Nevada\u2019s procedures to enforcement proceedings throughout the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639. \u201cIn this way,\u201d the court noted, the Nevada statute \u201ccould control the regulation of the integrity of a product in interstate commerce that occurs wholly outside Nevada\u2019s borders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further observed that other states had and could enact legislation establishing rules for NCAA proceedings. <em>Id. </em>This, the court found, put the NCAA \u201cin jeopardy of being subjected to inconsistent legislation arising from the injection of Nevada\u2019s regulatory scheme into the jurisdiction of other states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Here, however, unlike the statutes under consideration in <em>Healy, Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>and <em>NCAA, </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not have an impermissible extraterritorial effect, either on its face or as applied. For one thing, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not have the practical effect of imposing direct controls on out-of-state commercial transactions, as did the price-control statutes in <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. </em>and <em>Healy. </em>Nothing in the statute, as applied or on its face, ties the number of vehicles allocated to dealers in Virginia to the number of vehicles allocated to dealers in other states. Nor does the statute otherwise regulate the number of vehicles a distributor may allocate in any other state. Moreover, the statute contains no directive, or even suggestion, that vehicle allocations in other states are to be conducted in accordance with Virginia\u2019s requirements. Indeed, it references no other states and imposes no mandates or restrictions on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Likewise, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not have the practical effect, on its face or as applied, of directly interfering with regulatory procedures or schemes in other states, as did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>statute in <em>NCAA </em>In essence, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) merely requires that a distributor provide to a dealer in Virginia a number of new vehicles that is \u201cequitably related\u201d to that distributor\u2019s national production or importation of new vehicles. It places no restrictions, either expressly or by its practical effect, on how a distributor may allocate new vehicles in other states. Indeed, aside from requiring an \u201cequitable\u201d relationship between the number of vehicles a distributor ships to a Virginia dealer and the number of vehicles the distributor produces or imports nationally, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) mandates no particular procedures or schemes for allocating new vehicles in Virginia. Thus, it cannot be said that the instant statute would force Volkswagen \u201cto apply [Virginia\u2019s allocation] procedures ... throughout the country.\u201d <em>NCAA </em>10 F.3d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Furthermore, despite Volkswagen\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the effect of similar statutes being enacted in other states would appear to be negligible. Certainly, the passage of statutes that were truly similar to Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), in that they required a distributor\u2019s allocation of vehicles within the state to be \u201cequitably related\u201d to the distributor\u2019s national production or importation, without mandating specific allocation requirements or procedures, would not result in distributors being subjected to inconsistent obligations to states, as in <em>NCAA </em>or \u201cgridlock,\u201d as in <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. </em>and <em>Nealy. </em>We find nothing in the language of the statute or in the record to indicate that the adverse effects on interstate commerce asserted by Volkswagen would occur if similar legislation were passed in other states.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Moreover, we are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of a similar assertion in <em>Exxon Corp. v. Maryland, </em>437 U.S. 117, 128-29, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 2215, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978). In that case, the Court considered the validity of a Maryland statute prohibiting producers of petroleum from operating retail service stations within the state. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 98 S.Ct. at 2211. Exxon and the other oil companies involved in the suit argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the cumulative effect of other states passing legislation similar to Maryland\u2019s law would have serious implications on their national operations. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 98 S.Ct. at 2215. The Court responded to the appellants\u2019 argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">While this concern is a significant one, we do not find that the Commerce Clause, by its own force, pre-empts the field of retail gas marketing. To be sure, \u201cthe Commerce Clause acts as a limitation upon state power even without congressional implementation.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 350, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2445, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). But this Court has only rarely held that the Commerce Clause itself pre-empts an entire field from state regulation, and then only when a lack of national uniformity would impede the flow of interstate goods. <em>See Wabash, St. Louis Pacific Ry. Co. [St. L. &amp; P. R. Co.] v. Illinois, </em>118 U.S. 557, 7 S.Ct. 4, 30 L.Ed. 244 (1886); <em>see also Cooley v. Board of Wardens, </em>53 U.S. 299, 319, 13 L.Ed. 996 (1851). The evil that appellants perceive in this litigation is not that the several States will enact differing regulations, but rather that they will all conclude that divestiture provisions are warranted. The problem thus is not one of national uniformity. In the absence of a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing of a specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce, we cannot conclude that the States are without power to regulate in this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 128-29, 98 S.Ct. at 2215.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Here, we are aware of, and Volkswagen offers, no relevant congressional declaration of policy that persuades us the Commerce Clause pre-empts a state from regulating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>allocation of motor vehicles to the dealers in that state, particularly where, as here, that regulation would have only a negligible effect on interstate commerce if adopted by other states.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor has Volkswagen made a showing of a specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Volkswagen also argues that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), on its face and as applied, fails the second tier of the test used to analyze state regulations under the Commerce Clause because the statute\u2019s \u201cburden on interstate commerce outweighs the local benefits.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Once a court finds that a statute \u201cregulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest\u201d and has only an indirect effect on interstate commerce, the court must examine whether \u201cthe burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u201d <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 847, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). The purpose of Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is to ensure that motor vehicle dealers located in Virginia are able to obtain a fair share of vehicles from their national distributors for the benefit of Virginia\u2019s motor-vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>cle-buying public. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1501 (\u201cThe [cjommissioner shall promote the interest of the retail buyers of motor vehicles and endeavor to prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d). Clearly, protecting Virginia\u2019s dealers against national distributors with more bargaining leverage and ensuring the fair allocation of new vehicles to dealers in Virginia greatly benefits Virginia\u2019s citizens. Thus, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the statute has some incidental impact on interstate commerce, we hold that any such burden is not clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Thus, we hold that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">F. Due Process Clauses</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Volkswagen contends Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) violates the Due Process Clauses of the Virginia and United States Constitutions because it is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\u201cEvery law enacted by the General Assembly carries a strong presumption of validity. Unless a statute clearly violates a provision of the United States or Virginia Constitutions, we will not invalidate it.\u201d <em>City Council v. </em>Newsome, 226 Va. 518, 523, 311 S.E.2d 761, 764 (1984). \u201cThe burden is on the challenger to prove the alleged constitutional defect.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 14, 402 S.E.2d 229, 233 (1991). \u201cBecause the due process protections afforded under the Constitution of Virginia are co-extensive with those of the federal constitution, the same analysis will apply to both.\u201d <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 394, 569 S.E.2d 47, 53 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Volkswagen maintains that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is unconstitutionally vague because it offers no standard of enforcement for the commissioner and fails to provide fair warning of what conduct is prohibited. Specifically, Volkswagen maintains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>statute fails to provide standards or guidance for determining how many new vehicles a distributor must ship to a particular dealer in order to achieve the number of new vehicles that is \u201cequitably related to the total new vehicle production or importation currently being achieved nationally.\u201d Because the term \u201cequitably\u201d is not defined in the statute and provides no guidance as to what conduct is lawful or what is prohibited and effectively delegates sole authority to the commissioner to determine what number of new vehicles shipped to a dealer satisfies the statute, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) is void for vagueness, Volkswagen argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We are guided in our consideration of this issue by <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). In that case, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c \u2018[[v]agueness] challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. at 1191 n. 7. The Court further stated that laws must not only \u201c\u2018give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly,\u2019 \u201d but also \u201c \u2018provide explicit standards for those who apply them\u2019 \u201d in order to prevent \u201c \u2018arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 102 S.Ct. at 1193 (quoting <em>Grayned v.

The Court added, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AObi\">[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates\u2014 as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement\u2014depends in part on the nature of the enactment. Thus, economic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test because its subject matter is often more narrow, and because businesses, which face economic demands to plan behavior carefully, can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action. Indeed, the regulated enterprise may have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by its own inquiry, or by resort to an administrative process. The Court has also expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>nal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">Finally, perhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 102 S.Ct. at 1193-94 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Applying these standards for evaluating whether a statute is impermissibly vague to the present case, we find no merit in Volkswagen\u2019s vagueness argument. <em>See also Fallon Florist v. City of Roanoke, </em>190 Va. 564, <em>590, 58 </em>S.E.2d 316, 329 (1950) (holding that \u201ca statute is not fatally indefinite because questions may arise as to its applicability, or opinions may differ with respect to what falls within its terms, or because it is difficult to enforce\u201d). Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) regulates only economic conduct and does not threaten any constitutionally protected rights. In addition, knowing it was immediately relevant to its allocation of newly manufactured vehicles, Volkswagen had the opportunity to consult the statute and clarify its meaning by inquiry. Moreover, the statute subjected Volkswagen solely to civil penalties in the event of a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Thus, to sustain its void for vagueness challenge, Volkswagen had to show that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) was vague, \u201c \u2018 \u201cnot in the sense that it require[d] a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct [was] specified at all.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 495 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. at 1191 (quoting <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 578, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1249, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974) (quoting <em>Coates v. City of Cincinnati </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971))). Volkswagen, we conclude, failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Volkswagen knew, as a distributor of motor vehicles to dealers in Virginia, it was required under Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>to provide Miller with \u201cthe number of new vehicles ... needed by the dealer to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales ... equitably related to the total new vehicle production or importation currently being achieved nationally.\u201d As previously mentioned, the underlying purpose of the statute is to ensure that dealers located in Virginia get their fair share of new vehicles from their distributors. The language challenged\u2014\u201cequitably\u201d\u2014is in \u201ceveryday usage and is commonly understood.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 114, 117, 135 S.E.2d 160, 164 (1964). The term \u201cequitably\u201d means \u201cin an equitable manner.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>769 (1993). \u201cEquitable\u201d means \u201cfair to all concerned ...: without prejudice, favor, or rigor entailing undue hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clearly, then, read naturally, Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) provided Volkswagen with notice that, in failing to allocate to Miller any of the very popular, newly introduced 1998 Passats and New Beetles from October 1997 through March 1998, despite having nationally imported and distributed to its other 600 or so dealers over 18,000 1998 Passats and over 5,000 New Beetles during that same period, it was engaging in conduct that was not \u201cfair to all concerned\u201d and not \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and, thus, was prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Furthermore, as the Supreme Court said in <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 340, 72 S.Ct. 329, 330-31, 96 L.Ed. 367 (1952),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">few words possess the precision of mathematical symbols, most statutes must deal with untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations, and the practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions. Consequently, no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded. Nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In that same vein, the Supreme Court has distinguished between those statutes that are impermissibly vague and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>those that simply provide a flexible standard by which conduct is to be judged. <em>See, e.g., Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. at 2300 (observing that the words of an anti-noise statute that was not impermissibly vague were marked by \u201cflexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Guided by these principles, we conclude, on the circumstances of this case, that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) specifies a standard of conduct that, while necessarily flexible, was sufficiently definite and clear to provide an adequate standard of enforcement for the commissioner and give Volkswagen fair warning that its conduct was unlawful. Thus, we hold that Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) does not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the commissioner\u2019s decision that Volkswagen violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) when it failed to ship any newly introduced Passats to Miller from October 1997 through March 1998 and failed to ship any New Beetles to Miller from February 1998 through March 1998.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. Miller sold 47 new Volkswagen vehicles in 1997. By comparison, the two largest dealers by volume in the same sales district, located in Springfield and Tysons Corner, respectively, both sold over 1,000 new Volkswagen vehicles in 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. Although designated a 1998 model, the new, redesigned Passat was introduced in the fall of 1997. The New Beetle was introduced in February 1998. Both vehicles proved to be very popular, and Volkswagen's production of those vehicles could not keep up with the public\u2019s demand. Other older models of Volkswagen vehicles, including the earlier version of the Passat, were far less popular and widely available at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it shall be unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or any field representative, officer, agent, or their representatives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">To fail to ship monthly to any dealer, if ordered by the dealer, the number of new vehicles of each make, series, and model needed by the dealer to receive a percentage of total new vehicle sales of each make, series, and model equitably related to the total new vehicle production or importation currently being achieved nationally by each make, series, and model covered under the franchise. Upon the written request of any dealer holding its sales or sales and service franchise, the manufacturer or distributor shall disclose to the dealer in writing the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered to the dealers of the same line-make. In the event that allocation is at issue in a request for a hearing, the dealer may demand the Commissioner to direct that the manufacturer or distributor provide to the dealer, within thirty days of such demand, all records of sales and all records of distribution of all motor vehicles to the same line-make dealers who compete with the dealer requesting the hearing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b810-10\">. In its motion to dismiss, Volkswagen described the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">In its October 31, 2003 decision, the Virginia Supreme Court, among other things, held that [Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7)] does not authorize review of the allocation methodology adopted by a vehicle distributor. According to the Virginia Supreme Court, all that the [s]tatute authorizes the Commissioner to review is the actual vehicle ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ments to <em>a </em>dealer to determine if those actual shipments provide a dealer (here Miller) with a percentage of vehicles \"equitably related\u201d to the number of vehicles imported by the distributor nationally.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. Specifically, Volkswagen imported 2,016 Passats in October 1997; 2,996 Passats in November 1997; 4,835 Passats in December 1997; 1,270 Passats in January 1998; 3,655 Passats in February 1998; 3,682 Passats in March 1998; 1,424 New Beetles in February 1998; and 4,213 New Beetles in March 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. Volkswagen defined \"day supply\u201d as a dealer\u2019s \"available inventory\u201d divided by the dealer\u2019s \"average daily sales rate.\u201d According to Volks<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>wagen, \"[d]uring [a] new model release, day supply [was] determined by applying sales rates based on months with available sales.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\">. Obviously, Miller had no pertinent sales percentage at the time specifically related to the 1998 Passat and New Beetle since those vehicles had just recently been introduced in the United States and Miller had not yet received any from Volkswagen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">. While we disagree with Volkswagen's characterization of this alleged error as \"procedural,\u201d we nevertheless include it in this portion of the opinion for consistency's sake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. The record indicates that Volkswagen abandoned it old allocation methodology in October 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. As Volkswagen points out in its appellate brief, the commissioner, on remand, did allude in his decision to the possibility that Miller\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>may be \"moot,\u201d given that \"the facts [that gave] rise to this issue [were] relatively stale in light of the fact that they occurred approximately seven to eight years ago.\u201d It is clear, however, that the commissioner, in using the term \"moot\u201d in the introductory portion of his decision, was noting his general concern about the age of the case and the parties\u2019 continuing desire \"to pursue [the] matter\u201d despite its age, rather than addressing the question of mootness raised by Volkswagen here. The commissioner\u2019s prior denial of Volkswagen\u2019s motion to dismiss Miller's complaint for failure to state a valid claim and his subsequent analysis and rulings in his final decision clearly manifest the commissioner\u2019s belief that Miller's complaint was not rendered moot by Volkswagen\u2019s revised allocation methodology or otherwise invalidated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\">. To the extent that the hearing officer may have erred in identifying a time period that exceeded the time period addressed in the commissioner\u2019s decision following the first evidentiary hearing and implicitly referenced in the Supreme Court's October 31, 2003 opinion, we conclude that any such error was harmless since the six-month time period that served as the basis of Volkswagen\u2019s violation was well within the referenced time period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b838-5\">. This is not to say, of course, that all statutes regulating the allocation of vehicles would have, if passed in several or all states, as inconsequential an effect on interstate commerce as the instant statute would. Indeed, we can imagine any number of possible allocation statutes whose cumulative effect on interstate commerce would, like the cumulative effects of the statutes in <em>NCAA, Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>and <em>Healy, </em>be problematic under the Commerce Clause. That is not the case before us, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. To the contrary, the congressional declaration of policy that most closely relates to Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7) would seem to suggest otherwise. In enacting the Automobile Dealers\u2019 Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-25, in 1956, Congress clearly recognized the need for government to \"redress the economic imbalance and unequal bargaining power between large automobile manufacturers and local dealerships, protecting dealers from unfair termination and other retaliatory and coercive practices.\u201d <em>Northview Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>227 F.3d 78, 92 (3d Cir.2000). The Act allows motor vehicle dealers to sue manufacturers or distributors with whom it has a franchise agreement for \"failure to act in good faith in performing or complying with the franchise terms or in canceling, not renewing, or terminating the franchise.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1222. \"The Act, however, does not protect dealers against all unfair practices, but only against those breaches of good faith \u2018evidenced by acts of coercion or intimidation.\u2019 \" <em>Northview Motors, Inc., </em>227 F.3d at 93 (quoting <em>Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., </em>517 F.2d 567, 573 (10th Cir.1975)). Indeed, as interpreted by the federal courts, the Act \"plainly requires [a showing of] actual, or threatened, coercion or intimidation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Limited thus, the Act cannot be read as pre-empting the distribution of motor vehicles within a state from state regulation that, like Code \u00a7 46.2-1569(7), requires no such showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">.
