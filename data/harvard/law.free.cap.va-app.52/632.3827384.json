Brandau appeals a final divorce decree arguing that the trial court erroneously calculated a spousal support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>award to his former wife. The calculation was flawed, husband contends, because it failed to impute income to wife and rested on an inflated estimate of his income. Finding neither assertion persuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>43 Va.App. 279, 282, 597 S.E.2d 250, 252 (2004) (quoting <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003) (citations omitted)). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Petry v. Petry, </em>41 Va.App. 782, 786, 589 S.E.2d 458, 460 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">After 22 years of marriage, husband left his wife. Their son, the younger of two children, was in his senior year of high school. An older child was in college.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Husband is a self-employed optometrist with substantial earnings. Wife has not worked outside the home during the marriage, with the sole exception of a brief, part-time effort at assisting husband at his office. Wife has only a high school degree. She is not computer literate and has no specific vocational training. Wife suffers from dilated cardiomyopathy as well as other associated heart conditions (left ventricular dysfunction, chronic diastolic dysfunction, and ventricular tachycardia). Over the years, wife has had four pacemaker-defibrillators implanted in her chest designed to intervene during potentially lethal disruptions of her heart rate. She often becomes highly fatigued and has unexpectedly passed out from her heart condition. Added to these problems, wife suffers from hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">At trial, wife testified that she and husband agreed that she would be a stay-at-home mother to their two children. It was a \u201cfamily decision,\u201d she said, for her \u201cto fulfill the role of homemaker and mother.\u201d \u201cI was going to be at home with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>our children,\u201d she testified, pursuant to their joint decision. She thought it particularly important to be home with her younger son prior to sending him off to college. \u201cThat is my full-time job,\u201d she explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Husband relied at trial on a vocational expert who opined that wife\u2019s present physical and vocational capacities suggest she could get a light or sedentary job earning about $14,500 a year with an average hourly wage between $6.00 to $8.00. An expert for wife agreed that, in principle, she was employable \u201cbut at risk\u201d and could be reasonably expected to find only low-wage, low-stress positions (around the $13,000-a-year range) given her medical condition, lack of vocational training or higher education, inability to use computer technologies, and long absence from the job market.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On the question whether to impute income to wife for spousal support purposes, the trial court ruled it would not do so \u201cat this time.\u201d In addition to noting wife\u2019s health issues, the court took into account \u201cthe understanding that Dr. Brandau would work and be the breadwinner while Mrs. Brandau would stay at home and take care of the family needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Another issue debated at trial was the proper computation of husband\u2019s income from his subchapter S corporation. An accountant for wife examined the corporation\u2019s financial records and concluded that husband made about $190,000 a year. Husband\u2019s accounting expert testified the better figure was $140,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">One of the differences between the two figures involved an adjustment for an item called \u201cWages Paid to Children.\u201d Husband gave monetary gifts to his children. Instead of giving the money outright, however, he listed his two children as \u201cemployees\u201d of the corporation and their gifts as \u201csalary.\u201d By doing so, these salaries served as ostensible business expenses on the corporation\u2019s financial statements and income tax returns. At trial, husband\u2019s accounting expert conceded that such practices \u201cappear to be inappropriate\u201d and should be ignored for purposes of calculating husband\u2019s true income. After considering all the evidence, the trial court accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>$190,000 income calculation offered by wife\u2019s accounting expert and based husband\u2019s spousal support obligation upon that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-91 (A)(6), the trial court awarded wife a final divorce decree based on evidence that husband \u201cwillfully deserted\u201d the marriage. The court found the \u201ccircumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E), warranted a support award to wife. The court calculated that award by reviewing the evidence in light of the statutory factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E). The final decree included the caveat that, at some later date, the \u201csupport award may be modified upon either party\u2019s showing of a material change in circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A. <em>Imputation of Income</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Husband argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to impute income to wife given the \u201cuncontested\u201d evidence of her earning capacity of at least $13,000. Underlying husband\u2019s argument is the presupposition that, absent exceptional circumstances, every stay-at-home spouse seeking spousal support must start work outside the home immediately upon the entry of the divorce decree if he or she has any provable income earning capacity. We find no basis for such an inflexible principle in our statutes or caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">In Virginia, when \u201ca claim for support is made by a party who has been held blameless for the marital breach, the law imposes upon the other party a duty, within the limits of his or her financial ability, to maintain the blameless party according to the station in life to which that party was accustomed during the marriage.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 573-74, 421 S.E.2d 635, 644 (1992); <em>see also Lapidus v. Lapidus, </em>226 Va. 575, 581, 311 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1984); <em>Butler v. Butler, </em>217 Va. 195, 197, 227 S.E.2d 688, 690 (1976); <em>Stubblebine v. Stubblebine, </em>22 Va.App. 703, 710, 473 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1996) <em>(en </em>bane); <em>Furr v. Furr, </em>13 Va.App. 479, 483-84, 413 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1992). This principle recognizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that, assuming Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) does not otherwise bar spousal support,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cdetermining whether to award support and maintenance for a spouse\u201d still requires judicial consideration of the \u201ccircumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage....\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In determining \u201cthe nature, amount and duration of an award,\u201d the court must consider twelve specific statutory-factors as well as any other concern \u201cnecessary to consider the equities between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether to impute income to a spouse seeking support is simply one component of calculating the \u201camount\u201d of support under the statutory factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E). Three of the statutory factors deal directly with this concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">9. The earning capacity, including the skills, education and training of the parties and the present employment opportunities for persons possessing such earning capacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">10. The opportunity for, ability of, and the time and costs involved for a party to acquire the appropriate education, training and employment to obtain the skills needed to enhance his or her earning ability; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">11. The decisions regarding employment, career, economics, education and parenting arrangements made by the parties during the marriage and their effect on present and future earning potential, including the length of time one or both of the parties have been absent from the job market[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E). While directly relevant to the question of imputation, these specific factors do not render the more general factors inconsequential. Whether to impute income also depends, in part, on a conscientious consideration of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>factors, including the \u201cstandard of living established during the marriage,\u201d the \u201cduration of the marriage,\u201d and the positive and negative \u201ccontributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(2), (E)(3) &amp; (E)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Husband argues that, notwithstanding the discretionary factors, our caselaw has tightly synthesized these principles into a statutory preset requiring imputation of income to a spouse seeking support if he or she has provable earning capacity at the time of the divorce. He cites <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 734, 396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990), for the proposition that a spouse has a presumptive duty to go to work following a divorce if he or she had provable earning capacity. This assertion comes from <em>dictum </em>in <em>Srinivasan </em>that \u201cone who seeks spousal support is obligated to earn as much as he or she reasonably can to reduce the amount of the support need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Baytop v. Baytop, </em>199 Va. 388, 395, 100 S.E.2d 14, 19 (1957) (imputing income where wife for \u201cmany years\u201d had \u201cearned a salary that is ample to maintain her in the station in life to which she has been accustomed\u201d)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Our holding in <em>Srinivasan, </em>however, directly refutes husband\u2019s view. In <em>Srinivasan, </em>the trial court imputed income to a wife based upon her Ph.D. and her prior working experience as a college professor. We <em>reversed </em>the trial court because it failed to take into account that the unemployed wife, <em>\u201cat the time of divorce, </em>was leading the life style she was accustomed to during the marriage\u201d and was thereafter \u201centitled to a reasonable time to secure employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679 (emphasis added). \u201cThus, the trial court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>not have decided, under the present circumstances, as a matter of law, that the wife was not entitled to support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Neither <em>Srinivasan </em>nor any other Virginia case has held that, for purposes of calculating spousal support, a stay-at-home spouse capable of working must go to work immediately after the divorce trial or face a judicially imposed imputation of income. To the contrary, Virginia cases imputing income (including <em>Baytop, </em>cited by Srinivasan) all involved spouses who worked during the marriage but, sometime after separation, either accepted a job beneath their earning capacity or stopped working altogether. <em>See, e.g., Baytop, </em>199 Va. at 393, 100 S.E.2d at 18 (imputing income to spouse who worked during marriage and quit her employment \u201c[sjometime prior to the trial\u201d); <em>Butler, </em>217 Va. at 197, 227 S.E.2d at 690 (imputing income to spouse whose earning capacity permitted him to \u201cdouble his income\u201d by taking a different job); <em>O\u2019Hara v. O\u2019Hara, </em>45 Va.App. 788, 798, 613 S.E.2d 859, 864 (2005) (affirming imputation of income based upon \u201cwife\u2019s income over the past several years\u201d that ended after she was \u201cterminated\u201d by her employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In this case, the trial court heard evidence on many of the Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) factors as it applied to this marriage of nearly twenty-five years. Except for a brief period when she helped husband at his office, wife had been a stay-at-home mother of two children based upon an understanding she and husband had during the marriage. At the time of the divorce trial, her youngest boy was finishing up his senior year of high school and she wanted to stay home until the boy left for college. In addition, while not incapable of working outside the home, wife suffers with a congenital heart condition counseling caution and the need to avoid \u201cat risk\u201d employments. Added to these concerns is the fact that her formal education went no further than a high school degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Based upon this evidence, the trial court held: \u201cIt would not be equitable for the court now to ... impute income to her <em>at this time.\u201d </em>In doing so, the court carefully limited its ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to the conditions existing at the time of the final divorce decree, leaving open the possibility of recalibrating the support award at some later date as conditions change. <em>See generally McKee, </em>52 Va.App. at 489-93, 664 S.E.2d at 509-11; <em>Stubblebine, </em>22 Va.App. at 723, 473 S.E.2d at 81 (recognizing that spousal support awards must be made \u201cupon the circumstances disclosed by the evidence at the time of the award\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 573, 471 S.E.2d 809, 817 (affirming a finding that \u201calthough Mrs. Theismann would be able to reenter the work force at a later time, her absence from the workforce and the \u2018emotional drain\u2019 resulting from the breakup of her marriage made it inappropriate to impute income at this time\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>23 Va. App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Spousal support determinations typically involve fact-specific decisions best left in the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the trial court. <em>McKee, </em>52 Va.App. at 489, 664 S.E.2d at 509 (quoting <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 102, 515 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1999)). A trial court\u2019s decision \u201con this subject will not be reversed \u2018unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 262, 578 S.E.2d at 836 (citation omitted). \u201cWhen dealing with discretionary decisions, only \u2018when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robbins v. Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. 466, 482, 632 S.E.2d 615, 623 (2006) (citation omitted). No such showing has been made here. \u201cIn this case, credible reasons supported the trial judge\u2019s decision that imputation of income was not appropriate, and no abuse of discretion occurred.\u201d <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 704, 460 S.E.2d 596, 601 (1995) (affirming trial court\u2019s decision not to impute income to a wife working below her potential as teacher\u2019s aide, the job she held most recently during the marriage). We thus affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to award spousal support without imputing income to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">B. <em>Calculation of Husband\u2019s Income</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Husband also claims the trial court abused its discretion in accepting the wife\u2019s expert testimony of husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>income from his professional corporation. That income calculation, husband argues, includes an \u201cimproper adjustment applied by the wife\u2019s expert\u201d to the corporate \u201cwages\u201d to the two children. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24. As husband\u2019s expert conceded, however, the adjustment was proper because husband\u2019s claimed business expense was improper. From the start, husband intended the alleged wages to be a gift. No evidence suggested the children were <em>bona fide </em>employees or that they earned the \u201cwages\u201d husband deducted as a business expense. Suffice it to say, the trial court had no obligation to base its spousal support calculation in any way upon husband\u2019s unconventional accounting practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">C. <em>Award of Appellate Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Both husband and wife seek an award of attorney fees incurred on appeal. \u201cThe rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.\u201d <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We summarily reject husband\u2019s request, given that he did not prevail on either of his two assertions on appeal and necessarily cannot be a candidate for an award of appellate fees. <em>See Rogers v. Rogers, </em>51 Va.App. 261, 274, 656 S.E.2d 436, 442 (2008) (denying attorney fees to non-prevailing party, citing <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>43 Va.App. 279, 291 n. 6, 597 S.E.2d 250, 256 n. 6 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">We grant in part wife\u2019s request for appellate fees. We view husband\u2019s second argument (challenging the trial court\u2019s calculation of his income) as wholly meritless, an assertion not fairly debatable under any reasonable construction of the record or the governing legal principles. We have no reluctance imposing fees in such circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Klein v. Klein, </em>49 Va.App. 478, 483, 642 S.E.2d 313, 316 (2007); <em>Miller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>v. Cox, </em>44 Va.App. 674, 688-89, 607 S.E.2d 126, 133 (2005). We view husband\u2019s first argument (advocating an imputation of income to wife) as erroneous but nonetheless fairly debatable. We deny wife\u2019s request for fees as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We remand this case to the trial court to award wife all attorney fees associated with her defense of husband\u2019s second argument. We accept that mathematical certitude is an illusory goal when attempting to segregate legal fees between discrete arguments. <em>See generally Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (recognizing that while \u201cno precise rule or formula\u201d exists for such determinations a fee request \u201cshould not result in a second major litigation\u201d). On remand, we direct the trial court to determine a reasonable division of labor between the issues argued on appeal and to make a partial fee award based upon this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In sum, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s spousal support award to wife. Neither the decision to decline an imputation of income to wife nor the calculation of husband\u2019s income can be fairly characterized as an abuse of discretion. We affirm the trial court and remand this case for a partial award of appellate attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">.
