The only question presented in this appeal is whether the statute is facially overbroad because it prohibits free speech in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finding that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) does not prohibit speech protected by the First Amendment, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">A.M. telephoned the police in January of 2005 after receiving electronic mail from Podracky. A.M. had known Podracky for more than five years and had a sexual relationship with him. Podracky\u2019s e-mail to A.M. was introduced into evidence at trial. The message suggested that A.M. have a sexual encounter with a sixteen-year-old girl. Again via e-mail, Podracky also sent A.M. photographs of L.H., a sixteen-year-old girl Podracky met over the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Before 2005, both A.M. and L.H. often communicated with Podracky by computer using a simultaneous text message program provided by America Online (\u201cAOL\u201d). After A.M. called the police, investigating officers identified L.H. from the photographs Podracky had sent A.M. Detective Lisa Krisik of the Virginia Beach Police Department received permission from the parents of L.H. for Detective Krisik to pretend to be L.H. while communicating with Podracky over the internet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Using L.H.\u2019s AOL instant messenger identity, Detective Krisik engaged Podracky in several online conversations over the next few weeks. A.M. participated in these conversations as well. On January 17, Podracky suggested that the three of them meet at his hotel room and that the three of them also have sex with each other at the same time. On January 25, Podracky suggested to Detective Krisik that he would use a sex toy on L.H. and that he would teach her to perform fellatio on him. On January 27, Podracky sent messages to A.M. and Detective Krisik through an internet \u201cchat room\u201d that was only accessible by invitation. A.M. asked Detective Krisik, still pretending to be L.H., if she was really sixteen. Detective Krisik responded that she was. During the conversation, Podracky stated that he would bring a camera to take sexually explicit photographs of L.H. with A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On January 27, and again on February 1, Podracky arranged that L.H. and A.M. meet him at the Crown Plaza Hotel on Monday, February 7, 2005. Again using AOL, Podracky confirmed these arrangements with A.M. and Detective Krisik on February 6 and 7. Detective Krisik, accompanied by other police officers, went to meet Podracky and saw him at the hotel. She recognized him from a photograph that he had sent to L.H. Podracky made statements to the police confirming that he was the person who sent the messages to L.H. Police also served a search warrant on Podracky\u2019s hotel room. They found a laptop computer, a camera, a sex toy, and some condoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">At the time Podracky sent the messages that formed the basis of his conviction in the trial court, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person over the age of eighteen to use a communications system, including but not limited to computers or computer networks or bulletin boards, or any other electronic means, for the purposes of soliciting any person he knows or has reason to believe is a minor for (i) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>any activity in violation of \u00a7 18.2-355 or \u00a7 18.2-361, (ii) any activity in violation of \u00a7 18.2-374.1, (iii) a violation of \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1 or (iv) any activity in violation of subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-370. As used in this subsection \u201cuse a communications system\u201d means making personal contact or direct contact through any agent or agency, any print medium, the United States mail, any common carrier or communication common carrier, any electronic communication system, or any telecommunications, wire, computer or radio communications system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Relying on our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Jaynes v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 341, 657 S.E.2d 478 (2008), the Commonwealth argues that Podracky does not have standing to present a facial challenge to the statute. We do not address this argument. \u201c[A]n appellate court decides cases \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available.\u2019 ... Coupled with these principles of judicial prudence is the proposition that an appellate court may structure a decision on an \u2018assuming but not deciding\u2019 basis.\u201d <em>Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 58, 64, 628 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2006) (quoting <em>Air Courier Conference v. American Postal Workers Union, </em>498 U.S. 517, 531, 111 S.Ct. 913, 921, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1991) (Stevens, J., concurring)). Accordingly, we assume without deciding that Podracky has standing to offer a First Amendment challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>to Code \u00a7 18.2-374.8(B). We, nonetheless, conclude that the statute does not prohibit constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>FIRST AMENDMENT OVERBREADTH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u201cAs a general principle, the First Amendment bars the government from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 245-46, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 1399, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). However, not all words are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, and the weight of authorities in Virginia and elsewhere clearly permit the state to prohibit the solicitation of a crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Although agreements to engage in illegal conduct undoubtedly possess some element of association, the State may ban such illegal agreements without trenching on any right of association protected by the First Amendment. The fact that such an agreement necessarily takes the form of words does not confer upon it, or upon the underlying conduct, the constitutional immunities that the First Amendment extends to speech. Finally, while a solicitation to enter into an agreement arguably crosses the sometimes hazy line distinguishing conduct from pure speech, such a solicitation, even though it may have an impact in the political arena, remains in essence an invitation to engage in an illegal exchange for private profit, and may properly be prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Brown v. Hartlage, </em>456 U.S. 45, 55, 102 S.Ct. 1523, 1529, 71 L.Ed.2d 732 (1982). \u201cThe government, of course, may punish adults who provide unsuitable materials to children, <em>and it may enforce criminal penalties for unlawful solicitation.\u201d Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. at 251-52, 122 S.Ct. at 1402 (citing <em>Ginsberg v. New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)) (emphasis added). \u201cCriminal solicitation involves the attempt of the accused to incite another to commit a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Branche v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 480, 490, 489 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">As the United States Supreme Court recently reaffirmed: \u201cOffers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded from First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>States v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1830, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2008 U.S. Lexis 4314, at *24 (May 19, 2008) (holding that \u201coffers to provide or requests to obtain child pornography are categorically excluded from the First Amendment\u201d); <em>see also Pedersen v. City of Richmond, </em>219 Va. 1061, 1066, 254 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1979). <em>See also Singson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 724, 742-43, 621 S.E.2d 682, 690-91 (2005). \u201cWe know of no authoritative holding which extends First Amendment protection to a solicitation to commit an act lawfully prohibited by statute.\u201d <em>Riley v. United States, </em>298 A.2d 228, 233 (D.C.1972). \u201cReasonable prohibitions against soliciting unlawful acts do not violate free speech rights. Because First Amendment protection does not extend to statements made in the solicitation of criminal acts, [Georgia statute forbidding solicitation of sodomy] does not reach protected speech.\u201d <em>Christensen v. State, </em>266 Ga. 474, 468 S.E.2d 188, 190 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) prohibits constitutionally protected free speech, Podracky relies on <em>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). In <em>Reno, </em>the United States Supreme Court struck down two provisions of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d), provisions that prohibited the knowing transmission of obscene or indecent messages to persons under eighteen. <em>Id. </em>at 859-60, 117 S.Ct. at 2338. The Court struck down the disputed provisions of the CDA because they prohibited constitutionally protected communications between adults over the internet. <em>Id. </em>at 876, 117 S.Ct. at 2346-47.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATl\">In arguing that the CDA does not so diminish adult communication, the Government relies on the incorrect factual premise that prohibiting a transmission whenever it is known that one of its recipients is a minor would not interfere with adult-to-adult communication. The findings of the District Court make clear that this premise is untenable. Given the size of the potential audience for most messages, in the absence of a viable age verification process, the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it. Knowledge that, for instance, one or more members of a 100-person chat group will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>minor\u2014and therefore that it would be a crime to send the group an indecent message\u2014would surely burden communication among adults.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><em>Id. </em>Podracky argues that, in light of the language quoted above, the knowledge element of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) as to the age of the person solicited (\u201cfor the purposes of soliciting any person he knows or has reason to believe is a minor\u201d) does not save the constitutionality of the statute because an internet user cannot know whether the person they are soliciting is a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We disagree. Under the statute in <em>Reno, </em>someone could commit a crime by publishing indecent materials on the internet, materials that adults have a constitutional right to send and to see. Because the number of potential recipients is enormous, given the size of the internet, a person publishing such materials would still be guilty of a crime because he could be charged with constructive knowledge of the near certainty that at least one minor would view the materials. We believe this view of <em>Reno\u2019s </em>assessment of the significance of the CDA\u2019s knowledge element explains <em>Reno\u2019s </em>emphasis on the unavailability of cheap, reliable age-verification technology for the screening of visitors to sexually explicit websites.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">As a practical matter, the Court also found that it would be prohibitively expensive for noncommercial\u2014as well as some commercial\u2014speakers who have Web sites to verify that their users are adults. <em>[ACLU v. Reno, </em>929 F.Supp. 824,] 845-848 [ (E.D.Pa.1996) ] (findings 95-116). These limitations must inevitably curtail a significant amount of adult communication on the Internet. By contrast, the District Court found that \u201cdespite its limitations, currently available <em>user-based </em>software suggests that a reasonably effective method by which <em>parents </em>can prevent their children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which <em>parents </em>may believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 842 (finding 73).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Unlike the statute in <em>Reno, </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) proscribes, not the knowing <em>communication </em>of indecent materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>to minors, but only the knowing use of a communications system to solicit a minor for certain criminal acts. In <em>United States v. Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d 557 (9th Cir.2004), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), which forbids the knowing inducement of a minor to engage in sexual activity that is a criminal offense. <em>Id. </em>at 562. Like Podracky, the defendant relied on <em>Reno, </em>and the Court distinguished the unconstitutional CDA provisions from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). We believe the meaningful difference between the statutes analyzed in <em>Dhingra </em>is also obvious to anyone comparing the terms of the unconstitutional CDA provisions with Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">For example, [\u00a7 2422(b) ] would not criminalize speech that is received by minors but is not spoken with the intent to persuade, induce, entice or coerce a minor into illegal sexual activity. In this delineation between criminal and lawful behavior lies a key distinction between the CDA provision considered in <em>Reno </em>and \u00a7 2422(b). The CDA criminalized speech\u2014even if directed to a general audience\u2014once it became known to the speaker that a minor was accessing the information. Because the speaker\u2019s burden of restricting minors\u2019 access to otherwise legitimate speech would be so great, the statute effectively silenced the speaker altogether, imposing an impermissible content-based blanket restriction that included legitimate adult communication. In comparison, as a functional matter, \u00a7 2422(b) requires that an adult cease inducement for sex once he becomes aware that the object of his inducement is a minor\u2014hardly a burden to legitimate speech, as the statute does not prevent the speaker from communicating with other adults.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we reject Podracky\u2019s argument that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reno </em>controls the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">While there is no Virginia case expressly deciding whether Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) is unconstitutionally overbroad, several other jurisdictions have upheld similar statutes in cases involving the solicitation of minors for sexual offenses using the internet. <em>State v. Colosimo, </em>122 Nev. 950, 142 P.3d 352, 355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>(2006); <em>People v. Cervi, </em>270 Mich.App. 603, 717 N.W.2d 356, 366-68 (2006); <em>State v. Snyder, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 453, 801 N.E.2d 876, 882-83 (2003); <em>State v. Backlund, </em>672 N.W.2d 431, 442 (N.D.2003); <em>Laughner v. State, </em>769 N.E.2d 1147 (Ind.App.2002); <em>State v. Ruppenthal, </em>331 Ill.App.3d 916, 265 Ill.Dec. 43, 771 N.E.2d 1002, 1006 (2002); <em>State v. Robins, </em>253 Wis.2d 298, 646 N.W.2d 287, 319-20 (2002); <em>People v.

Superior Court, </em>79 Cal.App.4th 663, 94 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 475 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Federal decisions addressing the sexual solicitation of minors over the internet also hold that such solicitations are not protected by the First Amendment. \u201c[T]he defendant simply does not have a First Amendment right to persuade minors to engage in illegal sex acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>228 F.3d 637, 639 (6th Cir.2000). <em>See also United States v. Tykarsky, </em>446 F.3d 458, 472-73 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>410 F.3d 1235, 1243-44 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>376 F.3d 689, 694-95 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Dhingra, </em>371 F.3d at 561-63; <em>United States v. Meek, </em>366 F.3d 705, 721-22 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Panfil, </em>338 F.3d 1299, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cSpeech attempting to arrange the sexual abuse of children is no more constitutionally protected than speech attempting to arrange any other type of crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Podracky attempts to distinguish only one of these cases, the decision of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Foley, </em>709 N.Y.S.2d 467, 731 N.E.2d at 128. He argues that the statute affirmed by <em>Foley </em>was constitutional, but that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) is not, because, unlike the New York statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) prohibits the solicitation of a child to commit offenses that can occur between consenting adults, specifically prostitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and crimes against nature. Podracky suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that this means that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) prohibits the constitutionally protected right of adults to send and receive messages regarding prostitution and crimes against nature, and is, therefore, unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Podracky\u2019s argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it ignores the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B). The statute applies only to an adult who uses a communications system \u201cfor the purposes of soliciting any person he knows or has reason to believe is a minor\u201d for certain criminal offenses. By its terms, the statute does not apply to an adult\u2019s solicitation of anyone he does <em>not </em>have reason to believe is a minor for any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Second, \u201csolicitation\u201d is a legal term that has long been understood to exclude the sort of constitutionally protected speech Podracky incorrectly suggests is prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">However there is a significant distinction between advocacy and solicitation of law violation in the context of freedom of expression. Advocacy is the act of \u201cpleading for, supporting, or recommending active espousal\u201d and, as an act of public expression, is not readily disassociated from the arena of ideas and causes, whether political or academic. Solicitation, on the other hand, implies no ideological motivation but rather is the act of enticing or importuning on a personal basis for personal benefit or gain. Thus advocacy of sodomy as socially beneficial and solicitation to commit sodomy present entirely distinguishable threshold questions in terms of the First Amendment freedom of speech. The latter, we hold, is not protected speech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\"><em>District of Columbia v. Garcia, </em>335 A.2d 217, 224 (D.C.1975) (internal citations omitted). The general discussion of crimes against nature or the advocacy of their legalization through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the political process, while protected by the First Amendment, simply is not \u201csolicitation\u201d as that term is understood in our First Amendment jurisprudence. Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B), which prohibits only certain kinds of criminal solicitation using a communications system, cannot plausibly be read to proscribe speech of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Finally, Podracky argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) is unconstitutional because it prohibits an adult from soliciting another adult when, as in this case, he mistakenly believes the person solicited is a minor when, in fact, the person solicited is both an adult and an undercover police officer. We agree that, by its terms, the statute forbids this kind of solicitation. The text of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) does not require the solicitation of an actual minor, only the use of a communications system \u201cfor the purposes of soliciting any person he knows or has reason to believe is a minor\u201d for specified criminal offenses. However, we do not believe Podracky\u2019s solicitations of the undercover police officer were protected speech for the purposes of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Williams, </em>128 S.Ct. 1830, 2008 U.S. Lexis 4314, rejected a similar argument challenging the constitutionality of the federal child pornography statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Offers to deal in illegal products or otherwise engage in illegal activity do not acquire First Amendment protection when the offeror is mistaken about the factual predicate of his offer. The pandering and solicitation made unlawful by the Act are sorts of inchoate crimes\u2014acts looking toward the commission of another crime, the delivery of child pornography. As with other inchoate crimes\u2014attempt and conspiracy, for example\u2014impossibility of completing the crime because the facts were not as the defendant believed is not a defense. \u201cAll courts are in agreement that what is usually referred to as \u2018factual impossibility\u2019 is no defense to a charge of attempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1843, *27 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Podracky\u2019s argument is also similar to the argument rejected by our Supreme Court in <em>Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>335, 619 S.E.2d 80 (2005). In <em>Hix, </em>the defendant had internet conversations with an undercover police officer, and the officer deceived the defendant into believing that \u201cshe\u201d was a thirteen-year-old girl. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 619 S.E.2d at 81. The defendant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3 (the indictment did not specify the subsection); he was also convicted of an attempted violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370 (indecent liberties with a minor). <em>Id. </em>at 337, 619 S.E.2d at 81. The defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction as a matter of law because the person solicited was an adult police officer and not a child. <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 619 S.E.2d at 84. After analyzing the distinction between \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cfactual\u201d impossibility in prior decisions, our Supreme Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">The Court of Appeals correctly determined that a police officer posing as a child in an internet chat room is only an impediment to the commission of a crime, an extraneous fact outside of the knowledge and control of the defendant. The non-existence of the \u201creal child\u201d does not make the crime of attempted indecent liberties inherently or legally impossible, but only factually impossible. Thus, the fact that Hix and the defendant in <em>Bloom [v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 364, 542 S.E.2d 18, <em>aff'd, </em>262 Va. 814, 554 S.E.2d 84 (2001),] were communicating with adult law enforcement officers is not a defense to the attempted crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 345, 619 S.E.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\"><em>Hix </em>does not discuss the First Amendment. Yet the case does establish that Podracky\u2019s messages to Detective Krisik were criminal solicitations, a form of communication not protected by the First Amendment according to our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pedersen. </em>\u201cFirst Amendment protection is not afforded statements made in the solicitation of criminal acts.\u201d <em>Pedersen, </em>219 Va. at 1066, 254 S.E.2d at 98. <em>Hix </em>also establishes that Podracky was guilty of criminal solicitation despite the fact that he mistakenly addressed his solicitations to an adult police officer. <em>See also Huffman v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 823, 827, 284 S.E.2d 837, 840 (1981) (\u201cIt is immaterial whether the solicitation is of any effect and wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>er the crime solicited is in fact committed____The gist of [the] offense is incitement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Podracky\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) is unconstitutional therefore depends on the existence of a <em>constitutional </em>factual impossibility exception to the general rule that criminal solicitation is not constitutionally protected speech. We can find no such exception in the text of the Constitution or the cases interpreting it. \u201c[The defendant] cites no authority for the proposition that the legal or factual impossibility defense is constitutionally protected, and we have found none.\u201d <em>German v. United States, </em>525 A.2d 596, 606 (D.C.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Chief Justice Marshall wrote that \u201c[t]he power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). <em>See also Dowling v. United States, </em>473 U.S. 207, 213-14, 105 S.Ct. 3127, 3131-32, 87 L.Ed.2d 152 (1985). There may be limits to what the legislature may punish as criminal solicitation; for example, \u201cit would be illogical and untenable to make solicitation of a non-criminal act a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Pedersen, </em>219 Va. at 1065, 254 S.E.2d at 98. However, each of the acts mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) is defined by statute as a crime, and Podracky makes no argument that he has a substantive due process right to violate Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-355; 18.2-361; 18.2-374.1; 18.2-374.1:1; or 18.2-370. Indeed, we rejected similar arguments in <em>McDonald v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 325, 630 S.E.2d 754 (2006) (holding that there is no constitutional right to engage in consensual sodomy with a person under eighteen), and <em>Singson, </em>46 Va.App. at 739, 621 S.E.2d at 688 (holding there is no constitutional right to engage in consensual sodomy in public).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Podracky has not shown that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) prohibits speech protected by the First Amendment. We therefore affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. Amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3 became effective on July 1, 2007. Former subsection A was designated subsection B without substantive changes to the text. Former subsection B, the statute we address in this opinion, was divided into new subsections C, D, and E. New subsection C makes it unlawful to solicit with lascivious intent a person the defendant knows or has reason to believe is under the age of 15 for specific sexual acts. New subsection D essentially establishes a less severe penalty for violations of new subsection C when the defendant knows or has reason to believe the persons solicited is under 18. New subsection D prohibits solicitation of any person the defendant knows or has reason to believe is a minor for the offenses listed in former subsection B, the statute in this case, except that new subsection D does not cover solicitations to violate subsection A of Code \u00a7 18.2-370. However, the acts mentioned in new subsection C are the acts that are prohibited by subsection A of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">. Podracky is incorrect that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B), at the time of appellant\u2019s conviction, prohibited the use of a communications system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to solicit a minor for prostitution. The statute does prohibit solicitation of a person the defendant knows or has reason to believe is a minor for any activity in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-355 (taking or detaining a person for the purposes of prostitution). However, the statute that prohibits prostitution, Code \u00a7 18.2-346, is not mentioned in either the former or amended version of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
