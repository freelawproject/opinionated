MILLETTE, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">John William Ludwig (Ludwig) was indicted and tried for murder and use of a firearm during the commission of murder. The jury found Ludwig guilty of the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of murder. On appeal, Ludwig contends the trial court improperly responded to a jury question during deliberations, which misled the jury into rendering an inconsistent verdict. Additionally, Ludwig argues the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>court should have granted his motion to set aside the firearm conviction as his conviction was inconsistent with the law and evidence. We hold the trial court fully and correctly responded to the jury question and Ludwig\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict was properly denied. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">/. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Ludwig was charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Karen Ludwig, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32 and with use of a firearm in the commission of the murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Upon leaving a Fourth of July party, Ludwig and his wife began to argue. Over the course of the evening, the argument escalated, resulting in Ludwig shooting his wife. Karen Ludwig died as a result of five gunshot wounds to her torso, chest, and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">After presentation of the evidence, the parties agreed on jury instructions, specifically Instruction 19, which defined the firearm charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">The defendant is charged with the crime of using a firearm while committing <em>or attempting to commit murder. </em>The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">1) That the defendant used a firearm; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">2) That the use was while committing <em>or attempting to commit murder.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">(Emphasis added). While deliberating, the jury presented the following question to the court: \u201cIf the defendant is not found guilty of first degree or second degree murder, can he be found guilty of \u2018using a firearm while committing or <em>attempting to commit murder.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added). After the trial judge read the question to counsel, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">[JUDGE]: [Technically, the answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think he could, but I think that the indictment and way the Commonwealth is offering the instruction, they have offered it as murder, so as instructed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the answer would be no. I think that was an election by the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">Ht iH sH # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think if the Commonwealth elects to indict somebody and alleges the use of a firearm in commission of murder or attempted murder, and then they submit the jury instruction that says the same thing, then the answer to the question is no because the Commonwealth has elected to pursue it as use of a firearm in the commission of a murder or attempted murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">^ # ifc 5{C # 5\u00a1*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[JUDGE]: <em>I believe the jury, based on this instruction, could say, Well, he used the firearm while attempting to commit murder. Therefore, he would not be guilty of first-degree or second-degree murder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree with the Court in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">[JUDGE]: So the answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>The answer is yes if the jury found that he was using a firearm while attempting to commit murder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">[JUDGE]: That\u2019s right. They could, under this instruction, which was not objected to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree with the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">&amp; \u00a3 H* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>I just think that the answer is yes if you find that he used a firearm while attempting to commit murder or committing murder. </em>It\u2019s not yes under any scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">[JUDGE]: [I] believe, under the law of Virginia, they could find him not guilty of those three offenses, the three primary offenses, and still find him guilty of the firearms offense. I believe there are a couple of court decisions that say you can have an inconsistent verdict like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t disagree with that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>[JUDGE]: So therefore, it could be either one. It could be either while committing murder, which could be an inconsistent verdict, or attempting to commit murder, which means he would not be guilty of either of the murders. So I still think the answer to the question is just a very simple yes. You don\u2019t need to say anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Well, I would ask the Court to say yes with what the Court just explained with regards to that it can be while committing murder or attempting to commit murder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">[JUDGE]: <em>I\u2019m not going to tell them that. It\u2019s right there in the instruction. I think that might confuse them or think I\u2019m trying to tell them to do something. </em>I\u2019m just trying to answer their question. I think the way their question is phrased, given Instruction number 19, the answer is a very simple yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">(Emphasis added). The trial judge advised the jury that \u201c[t]he answer is yes.\u201d The jury found Ludwig guilty of voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of murder. Ludwig was sentenced to three and a half years for the voluntary manslaughter charge and to the mandatory minimum of three years for the use of a firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Ludwig filed a motion to set aside the firearm conviction, asserting again that the trial court\u2019s improper response to the jury question during deliberations led directly to an inconsistent verdict. The trial court, in considering Ludwig\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the use of a firearm charge, discussed the inconsistency between agreed Instruction 18 (instructing the jury as to the elements of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter) and agreed Instruction 19 (instructing the jury as to the elements of use of a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of murder). The trial court also analyzed the jury question in light of tactical decisions implicit in requests for jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>[W]e argue in Virginia after the jury is instructed. So therefore, that implies to me that the attorneys in their final arguments have the opportunity to make their arguments based upon knowing what the judge is going to tell the jury as to what the law is.... In the middle of the jurors\u2019 deliberations, they come back with a question that I will submit to you does not tell you what they\u2019re thinking or what they\u2019re intending to do or in any way tells you that this is why they ultimately did what they did. <em>I think they were just asking a question, which I think because of the instructions that were given in this case, was a logical question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">[T]he way these instructions were given, after the evidence was presented, after counsel had ample opportunity to present the arguments with respect to instructions, this jury could have very easily done what they did. They could have come back, with inconsistent verdicts, and I think the only thing that would prevent that from happening as a matter of law would be if the evidence didn\u2019t support the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">^ ^ ^ $ if;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\"><em>So if you look at it as if Mr. Ludwig had been on trial solely for the firearms charge, the evidence certainly would support that and there would be no way that I would have to set that aside as not being supported by the evidence. </em>I think that [defense counsel] made a timely objection to my answer to the jury\u2019s question. I think that if you construe his objection to be a request for me to have instructed the jury in a manner that would be similar to that, that you find in the <em>Gaines </em>case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> about, If you find the defendant not guilty of murder, then you shall not find him guilty of use of a firearm while committing murder ... <em>when you get to the point when the jurors are starting to deliberate, then it\u2019s too </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>late to say, Wait a minute, I should have asked for this instruction because now I know what the jury is thinking about. Because there are tactical reasons for asking for instructions and there are tactical reasons for not asking for instructions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">s}c 5jS \u2756 # <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">And I think it\u2019s just patently unfair to when you get a question from the jury that might indicate how\u2014that may to somebody indicate what they\u2019re thinking that they might be doing, to then say, But now, Judge, I want you to instruct the jury this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">s{c &gt;\u00a1: <em>% </em>^ <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\"><em>I think once the evidence is finished, counsel knows about the law they\u2019re asking for and that sets the law of the case. That sets the </em>instructions.... <em>I think there were some elections made.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">(Emphasis added). The trial court denied Ludwig\u2019s motion to set aside the firearm conviction and entered final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">THE FIREARM JURY QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">\n<em>Issues Preserved on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">On appeal, Ludwig contends the trial court erred in answering the jury question in the affirmative because this response was contrary to the law and led directly to the inconsistent verdict. Ludwig raises various objections to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Therefore, as a threshold issue, we must determine what issues, if any, were raised and preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">Pursuant to Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5A:18, to preserve an issue for appeal, an objection must be \u201cstated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling.\u201d Additionally, Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court shall be unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary, it shall be sufficient that a party, <em>at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, </em>makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the action of the court and his grounds therefor____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">(Emphasis added). The main purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule \u201cis to alert the trial judge to possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">An objection to a response to a jury question must be made during discussions between the trial court and counsel, prior to the response being submitted to the jury. <em>See McLean v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 322, 328-30, 516 S.E.2d 717, 720-21 (1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(finding objections properly preserved for appeal only when argued by counsel after a jury question was presented to the court and before the court answered the question). Only specific arguments raised in the trial court .at the time of the objection are preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 760, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 411-12, 517 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1999)) (holding that making a specific argument on an issue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>trial court does not preserve a separate argument on the same issue for appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Thus, on appeal we will only consider the two arguments defense counsel raised at trial when the jury question was discussed. Defense counsel argued that in order to avoid inconsistent verdicts, the trial court should respond: 1) no; or 2) yes, if the defendant is found guilty of using a firearm while committing or attempting to commit murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">A judicial response to a jury question is considered a legal instruction. <em>See Kennemore v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 703, 709-13, 653 S.E.2d 606, 609-11 (2007); <em>see also Wren v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 989, 991-96 (1875); <em>McLean, </em>30 Va.App. at 327-33, 516 S.E.2d at 719-22; <em>Johnson v.

Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 60.6 (4th ed. 2008) (\u201cThe trial judge\u2019s answer to jury questions after the jury has retired are new instructions.\u201d). \u201cOur task on appeal is to \u2018ensure that the law has been \u2018clearly stated\u2019 and the \u2018instructions cover all issues\u2019 fairly raised by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kennemore, </em>50 Va.App. at 712, 653 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 581-82, 575 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003) (citation omitted)). Jury instructions should be \u201csimple, impartial, clear, concise statements of the law.\u201d <em>Gottlieb v. Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 807, 813, 101 S.E. 872, 874 (1920); <em>Kennemore, </em>50 Va.App. at 712, 653 S.E.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\n<em>The Jury Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Ludwig argues the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question was legally incorrect and led directly to the inconsistent verdict. Ludwig does not challenge Instruction 19; rather, he acknowledges the firearm instruction \u201cis an accurate statement of the law.\u201d However, Ludwig argues the \u201cattempt\u201d language in the firearm instruction was improper due to the specific facts of the case. Despite this argument, Ludwig failed to object to the firearm instruction before it was tendered to the jury. \u201cIt is well settled that instructions given without objection become the law of the case and thereby bind the parties in the trial court and this Court on review.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois v. Thomas Baker Real Estate, </em>237 Va. 649, 652, 379 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1989). Additionally, at oral argument on both the motion to set aside the verdict and the appeal, Ludwig\u2019s counsel conceded he erred by failing to object to the \u201cattempt\u201d language in the firearm instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under Virginia law, it is permissible for juries to reach inconsistent verdicts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 570, 574 S.E.2d 775, 779 (2003) <em>(en banc). </em>In <em>Gaines, </em>the defendant was charged with manslaughter and use of a firearm while committing murder. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 574 S.E.2d at 776. The firearm instruction stated in order to convict the defendant, the jury had to find he used a firearm \u201cwhile committing or <em>attempting </em>to commit murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 777 (emphasis added). The defendant\u2019s proffered modification to the firearm instruction stated the jury had to find the defendant used a firearm \u201cwhile committing or at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tempting to commit murder <em>not manslaughter.\u201d Id. </em>at 565, 574 S.E.2d at 777 (emphasis added). The defendant contended this proposed modification of the instruction was necessary to avoid an inconsistent jury verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 777. The trial court refused the defendant\u2019s proffered instruction, and the jury convicted the defendant of manslaughter and use of a firearm while committing or attempting to commit murder. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 574 S.E.2d at 776-77. The defendant appealed his firearm conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 574 S.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We held the firearm instruction was a \u201ccorrect statement of the law\u201d and \u201cnot misleading or confusing,\u201d despite the presence of the \u201cattempt\u201d language. <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 574 S.E.2d at 777. \u201cA trial judge does not abuse his discretion by failing to modify a correct statement of the law on the mere chance that a jury may not follow clearly written instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 777. We found the defendant\u2019s proffered instruction would not have prevented an inconsistent verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 574 S.E.2d at 778-79. With regards to inconsistent verdicts generally, we stated, \u201cbecause Virginia is \u2018more careful than most states to protect the inviolability and secrecy of jurors\u2019 deliberations,\u2019 \u2018a court, in a case like this, is unlikely to discover what motivated the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 574 S.E.2d at 779 (quoting <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 594, 598, 391 S.E.2d 75, 77 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 640, 648, 371 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1988), we held an inconsistent jury verdict, which found the accused guilty of both voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm in the commission of murder, was legally permissible. \u201cJuries may reach inconsistent verdicts through mistake, compromise, or lenity, but in such instances it is \u2018unclear whose ox has been gored,\u2019 the government\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 65, 105 S.Ct. 471, 477, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984)). We noted the accused failed to request a cautionary instruction and found \u201c[o]bviously there are sound tactical reasons why an accused would not desire [a cautionary] instruction and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>permit the jury to show leniency in convicting him of a lesser included offense of the primary felony; i.e., in this case voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 645, 371 S.E.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The present case is similar to both <em>Gaines </em>and <em>Wolfe. </em>In all three cases the defendants appealed inconsistent verdicts, convicting them of manslaughter and use of a firearm in the commission of murder or attempted murder. These cases also involve the possible effect of instructions, or lack thereof, on the resulting inconsistent verdicts. However, the present case is distinguishable from <em>Gaines </em>and <em>Wolfe </em>because it involves a jury question raised during deliberations after receiving <em>agreed </em>instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Ludwig argues the trial court should have either answered \u201cno,\u201d or a qualified \u201cyes,\u201d in order to avoid an inconsistent verdict. Ludwig\u2019s first argument, regarding the \u201cno\u201d response, is based upon his contention that the jury\u2019s question clearly showed they were going to find Ludwig not guilty of murder but rather, guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, Ludwig contends, the \u201cyes\u201d response was an incorrect statement of the law and directed the jury towards an inconsistent verdict. Nevertheless, Ludwig failed to raise this specific argument at the time he made his objection and, therefore, it was not preserved for appeal. Even if Ludwig had preserved this specific argument, there is nothing in the jury\u2019s question or in the record, with the exception of the jury\u2019s ultimate verdict, which supports Ludwig\u2019s position. In fact, as the trial judge found during the motion to set aside the verdict, nothing in the jury\u2019s question, \u201ctell[s] you what they\u2019re thinking or what they\u2019re intending to do or in any way tells you that this is why they ultimately did what they did.\u201d It is error to assume that a jury\u2019s decision can be inferred from a single question asked during deliberations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">In Virginia, as elsewhere, the deliberations of jurors \u201cduring retirement, their expressions, arguments, motives, and beliefs, represent that state of mind which must precede every legal act and <em>is in itself of no jural consequence.\u201d </em>A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>question posed to the court during deliberations, after all, could suggest as little as the tentative views of a single juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>Kennemore, </em>50 Va.App. at 709, 653 S.E.2d at 609 (quoting 8 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2348 (McNaughton rev. 1961)). Thus, the trial court was correct to find the jury\u2019s question in no way indicated how they planned to decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">As in <em>Gaines, </em>Instruction 19 was a correct statement of the law, despite the inclusion of the \u201cattempt\u201d language. <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 777. The \u201cyes\u201d response was proper precisely because of the attempted murder language in the firearm instruction. Ludwig\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s response was an incorrect statement of the law is misguided, as it is legally permissible to be convicted of use of a firearm in attempting to commit murder, even if found not guilty of murder. Code \u00a7 18.2-32; <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 644, 371 S.E.2d at 316 (citing <em>Kuckenbecker v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 619, 623, 101 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1958)). Moreover, the trial court expressly determined, \u201cif Mr. Ludwig had been on trial solely for the firearm charge, the evidence certainly would support [a guilty verdict] and there would be no way that I would have to set [the verdict] aside as not being supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Ludwig\u2019s second argument is equally unpersuasive. When it was clear the trial court was not going to answer \u201cno,\u201d Ludwig asked the court to respond, \u201cyes, if you find that [Ludwig] used a firearm while attempting to commit murder or committing murder.\u201d The trial court, in its discretion, refused this instruction, finding the additional information was already \u201cright there in the instruction.\u201d As in <em>Gaines, </em>the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found the additional information in Ludwig\u2019s proffered response was already recited in Instruction 19 and thus, would add \u201cno substance, no refinement, no nuance to the principle of law.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 778. The trial court\u2019s short \u201cyes\u201d response is exactly the sort of \u201csimple, impartial, clear, concise statement of the law\u201d that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>given in response to jury questions. <em>Gottlieb, </em>126 Va. at 813, 101 S.E. at 874. Similar to the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction in <em>Gaines, </em>Ludwig\u2019s qualified \u201cyes\u201d response would not have directed the jury away from reaching an inconsistent verdict. Further, Ludwig failed to request a separate cautionary instruction and the trial court had no duty to provide a cautionary instruction <em>sua </em>sponte.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 568-69, 574 S.E.2d at 778; <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 645, 371 S.E.2d at 316. Ludwig may have had tactical reasons for not requesting specific instructions, and it is unclear from the resulting inconsistent verdict \u201cwhose ox has been gored.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>469 U.S. at 65, 105 S.Ct. at 477.

The trial judge\u2019s response to the jury was direct, understandable, and legally correct and cannot logically be linked to the jury\u2019s subsequent inconsistent verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfP\">\u201cOnce the judge has made an accurate and correct charge, the extent of its amplification must rest largely in his discretion. The trial judge, in light of the whole trial and with the jury before him, may feel that to repeat the same words would make them no more clear, and to indulge in variations of statement might well confuse. How far any charge on technical questions of law is really understood by those of lay background would be difficult to ascertain, but it is certainly more evident in the living scene than in a cold record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Kennemore, </em>50 Va.App. at 712-13, 653 S.E.2d at 610-11 (quoting <em>United States v.

While the inconsistent verdict does show that \u201ceither in acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions,\u201d the verdict does not show that the jury was unconvinced of Ludwig\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 105 S.Ct. at 476. As we found the trial court did not err in refusing Ludwig\u2019s suggested response to the jury question, we will not overturn the firearm verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question and refusal to set aside Ludwig\u2019s firearm conviction, we affirm Ludwig\u2019s conviction for use of a firearm in committing murder or in attempting to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">. <em>Gaines v.

After the verdict was returned, Ludwig made untimely arguments as to why the court misled the jury in answering \"yes\u201d to the jury question. In his written motion to set aside the firearm verdict, Ludwig alleged the jury question showed the jury was inquiring whether they could convict on the firearm count if they found him guilty of voluntaiy manslaughter. In his appellate brief, Ludwig argues the jury question proved the jury was seeking instruction as to whether they could convict Ludwig on the firearm charge if they found him guilty of no offense greater than manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">. Ludwig\u2019s question presented does not claim the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question is invalid due to sufficiency of evidence issues. Therefore, we will not answer this question on appeal. See <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 1, 3-4, 654 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2007) (under Rule 5A: 12(c) \u2018\u2018[o]nly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">. While inconsistent verdicts in jury trials are permissible, such a verdict cannot be the result of trial court error. A trial court must give a direct and correct response to an inquiry by the jury, and its failure to do so is ground for reversal. <em>Shepperson, </em>19 Va.App. at 591, 454 S.E.2d at 8 (\"[T]he trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question was erroneous in two respects. First, it was not responsive to the jury\u2019s question. Second, it failed to give a correct answer to the question.\u201d); <em>McLean, </em>30 Va.App. at 332, 516 S.E.2d at 721 (\"[A] trial court has an obligation to respond fully and completely to a proper inquiry by the jury even if the inquiry is made during deliberations.\u201d (citing <em>Marlowe v.

In responding to the jury\u2019s question, Ludwig never suggested a response or asked for a cautionary instruction that would have clearly addressed the possibility of inconsistent verdicts as this Court suggested in <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 569, 574 S.E.2d at 778 (\"The possibility of inconsistent verdicts would have been avoided with an instruction that linked the two charges: if you find the defendant not guilty of murder, then you shall find him not guilty of use of a firearm while committing murder.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
