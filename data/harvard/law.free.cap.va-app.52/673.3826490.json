Bowden challenges this conviction, arguing that the trial court erred when it held that aggravated sexual battery is a lesser-included offense of forcible sodomy. For the reasons stated below, we agree with Bowden and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Appellant, Paul Talmadge Bowden, was indicted for committing forcible sodomy by cunnilingus on a child less than thirteen years of age in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Bowden moved to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth had not proved the element of penetration. After the trial court ruled there was no such proof, the Commonwealth contended that even if the evidence was insufficient to prove forcible sodomy, \u201csexual battery [was] still a lesser-included offense.\u201d The trial court agreed and ultimately convicted Bowden of aggravated sexual battery. Bowden was sentenced to twenty years incarceration with ten years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Because the Due Process Clauses of both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Virginia require that a criminal defendant be notified of the nature of the charges against him, \u201can accused cannot be convicted of a crime that has not been charged, unless the crime is a lesser-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>included offense of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>259 Va. 249, 253, 524 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2000). It is well settled that \u201c[a] lesser-included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 284 (1989). \u201cStated differently, an offense is not a lesser-included offense if it contains an element that the charged offense does not contain.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>259 Va. at 253, 524 S.E.2d at 862 (citing <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 759, 240 S.E.2d 658, 660 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">When determining \u201cwhether each [offense] requires proof of a fact which the other does not ... [,]\u201d we examine the offenses \u201cin the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review.\u201d <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 726, 284 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1981) (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); citing <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 688, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1435-36, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980)) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because this case involves the trial court\u2019s application of a statute, we review <em>de novo. Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Viewing the elements of forcible sodomy and sexual battery in the abstract, we conclude that sexual battery is not a lesser-included offense of forcible sodomy. As relevant to our analysis, the crime of forcible sodomy is comprised of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">1. An accused shall be guilty of forcible sodomy if he or she engages in cunnilingus with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse, or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in such acts with any other person, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">2. The complaining witness is less than thirteen years of age or otherwise included in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1(A)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\"><em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1; <em>see also Horton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 606, 612, 499 S.E.2d 258, 261 (1998). Further, \u201c[penetration is an essential element of the crime of sodomy.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number><em>Ryan v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 444, 247 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1978). The element of penetration may be proved by circumstantial evidence, and the penetration \u201cneed only be slight.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Horton, 255 </em>Va. at 613, 499 S.E.2d at 261-62 (\u201c[W]e conclude that penetration of any portion of the vulva is sufficient to prove sodomy by cunnilingus.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In contrast, the crime of aggravated sexual battery is composed of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">1. The accused intentionally touched either the complaining witness\u2019s genitalia, anus, groin, breast, or buttocks or material covering those body parts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">2. With the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify either the perpetrator or the victim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">3. The victim was less than thirteen years of age, or otherwise included in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(2), (3) or (4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-9\"><em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.3 (aggravated sexual battery) &amp; 18.2-67.10(2), (6) (general definitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The Attorney General observed on brief that \u201cthe only element common to both crimes is that the victim must be less than 13 years of age.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although this statement is not entirely accurate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it describes the issue before us fairly well. Viewing the elements of the crimes in the abstract, forcible sodomy requires proof of penetration, while an accused may be convicted of sexual battery upon proof that he or she merely touched the clothing covering the victim\u2019s \u201cintimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>parts.\u201d <em>Compare Horton, 255 </em>Va. at 613, 499 S.E.2d at 261-62 (discussing the penetration element), <em>with </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6) (\u201c \u2018Sexual abuse\u2019 means an act committed with the [requisite] intent, where: [t]he accused intentionally touches the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On the other hand, aggravated sexual battery requires proof that the act of touching was done with the specific \u201cintent to sexually molest, arouse or gratify....\u2019\u201d <em>Quinones v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 634, 640, 547 S.E.2d 524, 527 (2001). In contrast, sodomy, like rape, does not require a specific intent. <em>See, e.g., Velasquez v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 326, 329, 661 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2008) (\u201cRape ... is a general-intent crime----\u201d); <em>State v. Plunkett, </em>261 Kan. 1024, 934 P.2d 113, 119 (1997) (\u201c[S]odomy, like rape, is a general intent crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Thus, it is apparent from the plain language of the statutes that forcible sodomy and aggravated sexual battery each require proof of elements not required by the other. Therefore aggravated sexual battery is not a lesser-included offense of forcible sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Based upon the foregoing discussion, we reverse Bowden\u2019s conviction and dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">. The Attorney General concedes that the trial court erred when it determined that sexual battery was a lesser-included offense of forcible sodomy. However, \"[o]ur fidelity to the uniform application of law precludes us from accepting concessions of law made on appeal.\u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Cofield v. Nuckles, </em>239 Va. 186, 194, 387 S.E.2d 493, 498 (1990); <em>Tuggle v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 99, 111 n. 5, 334 S.E.2d 838, 846 n. 5 (1985)). Thus, we review the record presented to us independent of the Attorney General\u2019s concession of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-12\">. The act of sodomy, by necessity, requires a type of touching that could fulfill the touching element required for a conviction of aggravated sexual battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\">. The Attorney General asks us to reverse and dismiss the indictment in this case \"without prejudice to the Commonwealth\u2019s right to charge and try Bowden for aggravated sexual battery in violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-67.3, if the Commonwealth were so disposed.\u201d We decline to give an advisory opinion regarding whether a prosecution for sexual battery would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Pilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 442, 446, 663 S.E.2d 562, 564 (2008) (\" 'Advisory opinions represent an attenuate exercise of judicial power,\u2019 one which we traditionally avoid in all but the most extenuating circumstances. None exist here.\u201d (quoting <em>Va. State Police v. Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. 551, 553, 633 S.E.2d 203, 204 (2006))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
