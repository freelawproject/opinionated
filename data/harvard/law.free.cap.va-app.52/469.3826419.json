Middlebrooks claims his encounter with police was not consensual and the police had no reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify his seizure and subsequent search. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand Middlebrooks\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">At approximately .1:10 a.m. on July 2, 2006, plain-clothed Virginia Beach police officers, from the Special Investigations Unit on vice and narcotics, were conducting a bike patrol of the oceanfront between 19th and 21st Streets. Police refer to this area as \u201ca fishing hole for criminal behavior,\u201d where they make \u201ca lot of arrests ... drug arrests, gun arrests____\u201d Officers observed a man, later identified as Middlebrooks, in the McDonald\u2019s restaurant parking lot urinating next to a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Officer D\u2019Orio, from the Special Investigations Unit, approached Middlebrooks and identified himself as a police officer. Middlebrooks was cooperative and admitted his violation. Middlebrooks consented to a search of his person, and the search yielded nothing. Officer D\u2019Orio asked Middle-brooks if the car he was standing next to was his. Middle-brooks responded, \u201cIt\u2019s my people\u2019s car.\u201d Officer D\u2019Orio wrote Middlebrooks a citation for urinating in public and then left the McDonald\u2019s parking lot to continue his oceanfront patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Officer D\u2019Orio rejoined his fellow Special Investigations Unit officers in a parking lot close to McDonald\u2019s. From their new vantage point, the officers observed Middlebrooks in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot \u201cmilling around\u201d his \u201cpeople\u2019s car,\u201d and about five to ten minutes later, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of the vehicle. Detective Brandt, another member of the Special Investigations Unit, called dispatch to find out who owned the vehicle that Middlebrooks was now sitting in. A search of the tag revealed the vehicle belonged to Middle-brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Officer D\u2019Orio testified that at this point, he suspected Middlebrooks was involved with illegal narcotics because he had lied about ownership of his vehicle, he was located in a high crime area, and the specific McDonald\u2019s parking lot where he was \u201cmilling around\u201d had been the scene of prior drug-related arrests. While Middlebrooks was still seated in the vehicle, Officer D\u2019Orio approached and asked Middle-brooks to exit the vehicle so they could speak. After Middle-brooks denied Officer D\u2019Orio\u2019s request to search the vehicle, Sergeant Dimitry told Middlebrooks, \u201cI just want to let you know I\u2019m going to call the drug dog out. I\u2019m going to have him run your car.\u201d Sergeant Dimitry then asked if there was any \u201cweed\u201d in the vehicle. Middlebrooks responded that there was \u201cweed\u201d in the center console of the vehicle. The officers\u2019 search of the vehicle uncovered approximately one ounce of marijuana and a digital scale. After conducting a search of Middlebrooks incident to arrest, officers found $453 in small bills in his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Middlebrooks made a pretrial motion to suppress his incriminating statements and the evidence recovered from the search of his person and his vehicle. Middlebrooks claimed the search and seizure were conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Officer D\u2019Orio and Sergeant Dimitry were the sole witnesses who testified at the pretrial hearing. The trial court denied Middlebrooks\u2019 motion to suppress,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">The evidence shows, that [the officers] noticed the defendant acting in a strange fashion after the [first] encounter in that he had told them that [a] particular vehicle was not his car. It was his people\u2019s car; and then when they see him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>still in the parking lot, <em>it raised their suspicion </em>because ... [t]he drive-through was open, but the restaurant is closed, and he continues [to stay] in the parking lot. And so they run the license plate, and it turns out that the vehicle is registered to the defendant.... [After Middlebrooks denies consent to search his car] <em>[t]he court at this point finds that this is totally a consensual encounter </em>because the conversation is taking place outside the vehicle in which the police have asked the defendant to step out ... they [then] had this discussion about the drug dog---- And they told him, well, basically, we\u2019re going to have a drug dog come ... and then the defendant doesn\u2019t give permission as such to search; but what he says is ... I\u2019ve got weed in the car.... <em>The court finds that the encounter to begin with was consensual and that the fact that the defendant told them that the drugs were in the vehicle </em>... <em>was not based on coercion </em>.... <em>[T]he court finds that the totality of the evidence is that the Fourth Amendment was not violated. </em>[Defense Counsel] <em>Are you finding that once the drug dog comment was made, it was no longer consensual or was it still consensual at that point?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">[Court] <em>It was still consensual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">(Emphasis added). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">On appeal, \u201c[t]he defendant has the burden to show that, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion was reversible error.\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 552, 659 S.E.2d 512, 515 (2008) (citing <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 465, 470, 561 S.E.2d 701, 704 (2002); <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 490, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001); <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). A claim under the Fourth Amendment \u201cpresents a mixed question of fact and law that an appellate court reviews de novo.\u201d <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003) (citing <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>838 (2002)). However, \u201c \u2018[w]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blevins v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 412, 420, 579 S.E.2d 658, 662 (2003) (quoting <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>A CONSENSUAL ENCOUNTER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Middlebrooks asserts on appeal that he was illegally seized either when Officer D\u2019Orio asked him to step out of his vehicle or when Sergeant Dimitry told him that a drug dog was coming to run his vehicle because he did not feel free to leave and the officers lacked reasonable suspicion. The Commonwealth contends that the encounter was either consensual or supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion. We agree with Middlebrooks that the encounter became non-consensual when Sergeant Dimitry told Middlebrooks that a drug dog was coming to run his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u201c \u2018Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes three categories of police-citizen [contacts]: (1) consensual encounters, (2) brief, minimally intrusive investigatory detentions based upon specific, articulable facts, commonly referred to as <em>Terry </em>stops, and (3) highly intrusive arrests and searches founded on probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blevins, </em>40 Va.App. at 420-21, 579 S.E.2d at 662 (quoting <em>Wechsler v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 162, 169, 455 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The trial court found the entire interaction, even following Sergeant Dimitry\u2019s drug dog comment and Middle-brooks\u2019 incriminating statements, was consensual. A police officer may stop and question a person if the encounter is consensual. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 28, 32, 581 S.E.2d 206, 209 (2003) (citing <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2387-88, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991); <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 501, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1326, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983)). An encounter is consensual unless, \u201ca reasonable person would not feel free to decline an officer\u2019s requests or would not feel free to leave.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 558-59, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1879-80, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980)). There is no bright-line test to determine whether an encounter is consensual, rather a consensual encounter inquiry is based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Various factors have been identified as relevant in determining whether a seizure has occurred, including the threatening presence of a number of police officers, the display of weapons by officers, physical contact between an officer and a citizen, an officer\u2019s language or tone of voice compelling compliance, the retention of documents requested by an officer, and whether a citizen was told that he or she was free to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 36, 117 S.Ct. 417, 419-20, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996); <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 504, 103 S.Ct. at 1328; <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We need not resolve whether Officer D\u2019Orio seized Middle-brooks when he asked Middlebrooks to step out of his vehicle because no evidence was obtained from Middlebrooks at that time. However, it is clear that once Sergeant Dimitry told Middlebrooks, \u201cI just want to let you know I\u2019m going to call the drug dog out. I\u2019m going to have him run your car,\u201d no reasonable person would have felt free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The facts of this case are similar to <em>Deer v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 730, 441 S.E.2d 33 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Deer, </em>appellant was pulled over by a police officer and given a citation for speeding. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 441 S.E.2d at 34-35. Appellant\u2019s nervous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>behavior made the officer suspicious, and he asked permission to search appellant\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>After appellant declined consent to search, \u201c[the officer] said he would detain the vehicle and call for a K-9 drug unit ... [and] that [appellant] might have to wait for up to an hour for the unit to arrive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the officer stated his intention to call in a drug dog, appellant consented to the search. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We held that although the initial seizure was properly based on probable cause that appellant had committed a traffic offense, \u201cthe continued detention of [appellant] and the vehicle [after the officer issued the citation for speeding] required additional justification to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 441 S.E.2d at 37. <em>\u201c[The officer] effected a seizure by stating that he would detain the vehicle for up to an hour to await the arrival of a K-9 unit. </em>If that seizure was not based upon an articulable suspicion that [appellant] was involved in criminal activity, [appellant's further detention was illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We concluded the officer failed to have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was engaged in criminal activity and, therefore, the seizure violated the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Like the officer in <em>Deer, </em>Sergeant Dimitry\u2019s drug dog comment \u201cimplicitly commanded [Middlebrooks] to stay.\u201d <em>Piggott v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 45, 49, 537 S.E.2d 618, 619 (2000) (citing <em>Hodnett v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 684, 691-92, 530 S.E.2d 433, 436 (2000)). Thus, pursuant to the totality of the circumstances, including Sergeant Dimitry\u2019s use of compelling language, the presence of four officers at the scene, and the officers\u2019 failure to tell Middlebrooks he was free to leave, Middlebrooks was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>B. REASONABLE SUSPICION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Middlebrooks contends the officers did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity and, therefore, his seizure was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>To justify a <em>Terry </em>stop, \u201ca police officer ... must have \u2018a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the [person] is involved in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ewell v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 214, 217, 491 S.E.2d 721, 722 (1997) (quoting <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 2641, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979)). \u201c[T]here are no bright line rules to follow when determining whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists to justify an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Hoye v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 132, 134-35, 442 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1994). \u201c \u2018Reasonable suspicion\u2019 is more than a \u2018mere hunch\u2019 but less than \u2018proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em>23 Va.App. 598, 610-11, 478 S.E.2d 715, 721 (1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988)). \u201cTo determine whether a police officer had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting that the person stopped may be involved in criminal activity, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>265 Va. at 361, 576 S.E.2d at 465 (citing <em>Ewell, </em>254 Va. at 217, 491 S.E.2d at 722-23).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">The circumstances to consider in making the [reasonable suspicion] determination include \u201cthe \u2018characteristics of the area\u2019 where the stop occurs, the time of the stop, whether late at night or not, as well as any suspicious conduct of the person accosted such as an obvious attempt to avoid officers or any nervous conduct on the discovery of their presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvX\"><em>Thomas, </em>23 Va.App. at 611, 478 S.E.2d at 721 (quoting <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1100, 1103, 407 S.E.2d 49, 51-52 (1991)). \u201cThe character of the location and the time at which a person is observed are relevant factors, but they do not supply a particularized and objective basis for suspecting criminal activity on the part of the particular person stopped.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 552, 659 S.E.2d at 516 (citing <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 51-52, 99 S.Ct. at 2640-41; <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In this case, the police did not see Middlebrooks holding any drugs and they had not received any information suggesting that he possessed drugs. <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 1104, 407 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>S.E.2d at 52 (ruling no reasonable suspicion existed where the officer did not see appellant in possession of any drugs and \u201cthe officer had received no information about [appellant]\u201d); <em>see Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 494, 495-96, 412 S.E.2d 724, 725 (1992) (we considered the fact that the officer never saw appellant holding any narcotics in finding a lack of reasonable articulable suspicion).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Middlebrooks\u2019 behavior, such as stating his vehicle was \u201chis people\u2019s\u201d and \u201cmilling around\u201d the vehicle in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot, did not indicate he was engaged in criminal activity. <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 553, 659 S.E.2d at 516 (Supreme Court did not find appellant\u2019s actions suspicious when, in the early morning hours, he exited a parked vehicle, walked up to a house known for drug dealing, and returned to the vehicle less than a minute later); <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 1102, 407 S.E.2d at 51 (holding appellant\u2019s behavior did not indicate he was involved in criminal activity when an officer saw him at 10:00 p.m., on a playground with a reputation for drug activity, shove something down the front of his pants upon the officer\u2019s approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Additionally, the evidence disclosed that Middle-brooks was seized in the early morning hours, in a parking lot known for drug-related arrests, and the parking lot was located in a high crime area. While Middlebrooks\u2019 presence in a high crime area was one factor the officers could consider, it \u201c\u2018does not objectively lend any sinister connotation to facts that are innocent on their face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Riley, </em>13 Va.App. at 498, 412 S.E.2d at 727 (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>558 A.2d 312, 316 (D.C.App.1989)). The presence of a person, in the early morning, at a location with a reputation for drugs, \u201ccannot serve to impute criminal activity to [that] person by virtue of that person\u2019s presence in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 412 S.E.2d at 726 (citing <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641; <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 62, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)); <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 553, 659 S.E.2d at 516 (\u201cA person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights are not lessened simply because he or she happens to live or travel in a \u2018high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>crime\u2019 area.\u201d). The fact that Middlebrooks was stopped by-police \u201cin a high crime area, <em>standing alone, </em>does not provide the requisite degree of suspicion to justify an investigatoiy stop.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 232, 235 n. 1, 421 S.E.2d 911, 913 n. 1 (1992) (citing <em>Riley, </em>13 Va.App. at 498, 412 S.E.2d at 726; <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 1104, 407 S.E.2d at 52; <em>Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 367, 398 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1990)) (emphasis added). Therefore, the officers\u2019 seizure and subsequent search of Middlebrooks and his vehicle was conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment due to the lack of a reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Commonwealth argues that even if the police officers\u2019 initial seizure of Middlebrooks was invalid, it was cured prior to the search by Middlebrooks\u2019 voluntary admission that narcotics were in his vehicle. Assuming arguendo that Middlebrooks\u2019 admission was not coerced, the subsequent search was still conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the admission was a fruit of his illegal seizure. <em>See Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 283, 286-89, 269 S.E.2d 806, 808-10 (1980) (Commonwealth failed to carry its burden to show that appellant\u2019s confession was not a fruit of the prior illegal search and seizure); <em>see also Watson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 659, 665-66, 454 S.E.2d 358, 362 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">When Sergeant Dimitry told Middlebrooks his plan to call in a drug dog, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to stay and, thus, Middlebrooks\u2019 further detention was non-consensual. Due to the officers\u2019 lack of a reasonable and articulable suspicion that Middlebrooks was engaged in criminal activity, Middlebrooks\u2019 seizure and the ensuing search were invalid under the Fourth Amendment. Thus, any evidence obtained by the officers should have been suppressed. Accordingly, we reverse Middlebrooks\u2019 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and remand for the purpose of allowing Middlebrooks to withdraw his plea of guilty if he is so inclined and for further proceedings consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tent with this opinion by the Commonwealth if they are so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-16\">.

It is clear that <em>Bosworth </em>is not applicable here because in <em>Bosworth, </em>the issue was whether consent to search was procured through coercion, not whether an illegal search and seizure occurred due to police officers\u2019 lack of reasonable suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at 569-72, 375 S.E.2d at 757-59; <em>Deer, </em>17 Va.App. at 736-37 n. 3, 441 S.E.2d at 37 n. 3 (\u201d[w]e distinguish this case from <em>Bosworth </em>... on the ground that ... [i]n <em>Bosworth, </em>there was no contention that the stop of the defendant's vehicle was an illegal seizure or that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
