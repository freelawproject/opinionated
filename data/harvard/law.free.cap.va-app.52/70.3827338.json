Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to convict her of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>violating Code \u00a7 18.2-94, contending that the purse she possessed at the time she committed larceny was not a burglarious \u201ctool.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we conclude that appellant\u2019s purse was not a \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement,\u201d or \u201coutfit\u201d within Code \u00a7 18.2-94. We reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a burglarious tool and dismiss that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The facts are not in dispute. On June 23, 2006, appellant entered a department store in Chesterfield County with three other women. Each woman carried a purse that \u201cappeared to be concave\u201d and not \u201cfull like a typical woman\u2019s purse looks.\u201d A department store loss prevention officer (security officer), using a closed-circuit television monitoring system, observed the women taking clothing from the children\u2019s and juniors\u2019 sections of the store and carrying those items into an area consisting of separate fitting rooms. The women entered the fitting room area one or two at a time, each using one of two fitting rooms located \u201cat the end\u201d of that area. As the women exited the fitting rooms, their purses appeared \u201clarger in size.\u201d Once the women left, the security officer entered the fitting rooms, found empty hangers on the floor, and discovered that merchandise was missing from the children\u2019s and juniors\u2019 sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Appellant and the other women were detained after they left the store. Appellant had four items of children\u2019s clothing valued at $156 concealed inside her purse. The three other women also had stolen merchandise in their purses. Other than the stolen merchandise, three of the four women\u2019s purses were completely empty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The women admitted they entered the store to steal merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">A Chesterfield County police officer was called to the scene. Appellant admitted that she had stolen the items in her purse from the department store. She was arrested and charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>with grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and possession of burglarious tools in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">At trial, appellant moved to strike the evidence at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. She argued that her purse was not a burglarious tool. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that appellant intentionally entered the department store with an empty purse to conceal the stolen merchandise. During her testimony, appellant admitted to stealing children\u2019s clothing. When asked why she was \u201ccarrying an empty purse around,\u201d she stated, \u201c \u2018cause I wanted to go to the store and steal.\u2019 \u201d She renewed her motion to strike at the conclusion of the evidence, arguing again that her purse was not a burglarious tool. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion, finding that the purse \u201cwas used to steal, and ... it fits within the statutory definition of burglarious] tools.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant was convicted of possession of burglarious tools and grand larceny. At the sentencing hearing on March 27, 2007, the court vacated the grand larceny conviction, and found appellant guilty of petit larceny of the clothing appellant concealed inside her purse. She was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for petit larceny, with six months suspended, and five years imprisonment for possession of burglarious tools, all of which was suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On appeal, appellant concedes she entered the department store intending to use the purse she was carrying to commit larceny, but argues that a purse is not a burglarious tool within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. The Commonwealth contends that, because appellant intended to use an empty purse to conceal merchandise, the purse is an \u201coutfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Our task on appeal is to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>whether the legislature intended to consider an empty purse used to facilitate shoplifting a \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement,\u201d or \u201coutfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. \u201cBecause this is a question of law involving the construction and application of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, we review the trial court\u2019s determination <em>de novo.\u201d Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 337, 340, 649 S.E.2d 717, 718 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u201cViolations of Code \u00a7 18.2-94 are sometimes referred to generally as \u2018possession of burglary tools.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 3 n. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510, 511 n. 1 (1999). However, \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-94 is somewhat broader than its title implies.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 340, 649 S.E.2d at 718. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-94 requires proof that the offending tools, implements or outfit were intrinsically \u2018burglarious\u2019 only when the Commonwealth relies upon the statutory presumption to establish the requisite criminal intent.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>29 Va.App. at 4-5, 509 S.E.2d at 512. The presumption embraced by the statute applies only to \u201csuch offending articles innately <em>burglarious </em>in character, [that is] those commonly used by burglars in house breaking or safe craeking[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4, 509 S.E.2d at 511, \u201c[and] particularly \u2018suitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building ... vault or safe,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790, 75 S.E.2d 482, 486 (1953)) (alteration in original). Here, appellant conceded that she intended to use the empty purse she carried into the department store to steal merchandise and, therefore, the Commonwealth was not required to rely on the statutory presumption that a purse is \u201cinnately burglarious in charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ter.\u201d Consequently, we focus our discussion on whether the General Assembly intended to criminalize the use of a purse as a \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement,\u201d or \u201coutfit\u201d within the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u201cThe terms \u2018tools,\u2019 \u2018implements,\u2019 and \u2018outfit\u2019 are not defined statutorily.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 342, 649 S.E.2d at 719. However, each has been defined in previous decisions of this Court. \u201cThe generally accepted definitions of \u2018tool\u2019 are (1) an instrument ([such] as a hammer or saw) used or worked by hand, and (2) an implement or object used in performing an operation or carrying on work of any kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 649 S.E.2d at 720 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2408 (1993)). \u201c[T]he term \u2018implement\u2019 [ ] refer[s] specifically to items associated with devices, instruments, equipment or machinery as they relate to an occupation or profession, but which are used to facilitate the commission of a burglary, robbery or larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 649 S.E.2d at 721.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">The commonly accepted definitions for the word \u201coutfit\u201d include (1) the act or process of fitting out or equipping, (2) materials, tools, or implements comprising the equipment necessary for carrying out a particular project, and (3) wearing apparel designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"><em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 384, 512 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1999) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1601 (1993)). \u201c \u2018Generally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Because a purse is neither \u201can instrument used or worked by hand,\u201d nor \u201can implement or object used to carry on work,\u201d we cannot conclude that appellant\u2019s use of an empty purse to conceal stolen merchandise meets the generally accepted definition of a \u201ctool.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Williams, </em>where we declined to include an empty bag used to conceal merchandise as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>larcenous \u201cimplement,\u201d we also noted the absurdity of extending the definition of \u201cimplement\u201d to include a purse, as a purse is not an item that specifically relates to an occupation or profession. <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 346, 649 S.E.2d at 721. Finally, although in <em>Mercer, </em>29 Va.App. at 385, 512 S.E.2d at 175, we held that a pair of pants altered to facilitate shoplifting constituted an \u201coutfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, we cannot conclude from the plain language of the statute that the General Assembly intended to include the carrying of an empty purse within the meaning of an \u201coutfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. To extend the holding of <em>Mercer </em>under these facts would require an overly broad interpretation of the term \u201coutfit,\u201d rather than one \u201c \u2018strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 344, 649 S.E.2d at 720 (quoting <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 45, 52, 645 S.E.2d 470, 474 (2007)). Similar to our analysis in <em>Williams, </em>when discussing the need to impose a <em>reasonable </em>interpretation of the term \u201cimplement,\u201d we also conclude that an overly broad interpretation of the term \u201coutfit\u201d would result in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">every concealment of merchandise in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-103, regardless of the item\u2019s value, ... constituting] a Class 5 felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because any and every item used to accomplish the element of concealment from public view [would satisfy the definition of an \u201coutfit\u201d]. Had the General Assembly intended such a result, they would have punished the crime of concealment accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqu\"><em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 649 S.E.2d at 721. <em>See also, Matter of Charlotte </em>K, 102 Misc.2d 848, 427 N.Y.S.2d 370, 371 (N.Y.Fam.Ct.1980) (\u201cThe tools, instruments or other articles envisioned by [the statute] ... are those used in taking an item and not in hiding it thereafter. They are the handy gadgets used to break in and pick up, not the bags for carrying out.\u201d). Although appellant admitted that she carried an empty purse into the department store on June 23, 2006, because she wanted to \u201cgo to the store and steal,\u201d we cannot conclude that her intent to conceal stolen merchandise in her purse transformed that purse into a burglarious \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement,\u201d or \u201coutfit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We conclude that the purse appellant possessed at the time she committed petit larceny was not a burglarious \u201ctool,\u201d \u201cimplement,\u201d or \u201coutfit.\u201d Therefore, the evidence presented at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, vacate appellant\u2019s conviction, and dismiss that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\">.

The fourth woman's purse contained one pair of slippers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">. While the trial court concluded the purse constituted a \"burglarious tool\u201d under the statute, it did not make a specific finding that the purse was a \"tool,\u201d \"implement,\u201d or \"outfit\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-7\">BEALES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">I respectfully dissent. I believe that the evidence in this case supports the trial court\u2019s factual conclusion that appellant\u2019s purse fit within the definition of \u201coutfit\u201d that we articulated in <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 512 S.E.2d 173 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">As a preliminary matter, the majority applies a <em>de novo </em>standard of review to decide this issue, citing <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 337, 340, 649 S.E.2d 717, 718 (2007). In <em>Williams, </em>this Court reviewed <em>de novo </em>the term \u201cimplement,\u201d found in the same statute at issue in this case, Code \u00a7 18.2-94, and defined that term for the first time. Since this Court had not previously defined that term in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, a <em>de novo </em>review on an issue of statutory interpretation was entirely appropriate in that case. However, we have already defined the term at issue here, \u201coutfit,\u201d in our decision in <em>Mercer. </em>Therefore, I believe that we must here actually apply a mixed standard of review. I submit that we must review the trial court\u2019s decision and determine whether the evidence in this record supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s purse fits within our previously articulated definition of the term \u201coutfit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In <em>Mercer, </em>we defined \u201coutfit,\u201d in the context of its use in Code \u00a7 18.2-94, as follows: \u201cThe commonly accepted defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tions for the word \u2018outfit\u2019 include (1) the act or process of fitting out or equipping, (2) materials, tools, or implements comprising the equipment necessary for carrying out a particular project, and (3) wearing apparel designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation.\u201d 29 Va.App. at 384, 512 S.E.2d at 175. Finding that the pair of pants Mercer had altered to commit larceny was a burglarious tool (burglary tool), we held, \u201cAn item of clothing that is altered to facilitate shoplifting can reasonably be considered wearing apparel designed to be worn in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 512 S.E.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In this case, appellant used a purse to facilitate her theft of clothes from the store. The trial court, in my estimation, quite reasonably concluded that a purse may be a part of a woman\u2019s outfit. However, this purse\u2014or part of appellant\u2019s outfit\u2014was not being used as a woman normally uses a purse when appellant carried it -with her into the store. This purse did not contain any of the items normally found in a purse. To the contrary, it was completely empty so as to enable this woman to accomplish her admitted purpose of taking it into the store<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2014i.e., to steal by using it to steal and conceal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>considerable merchandise. Thus, while the inside of the purse had not had additional pockets sewn into it, as had been done to the pants in <em>Mercer, </em>the pocketbook/purse had been changed from the normal state of a purse and was carried with an entirely different purpose than a purse would normally be carried\u2014much as the pants were altered in <em>Mercer </em>so that they could be used to conceal merchandise and allow the defendant in <em>Mercer </em>to steal. In both cases, this was done to conceal the merchandise that was taken. As such, I believe that the trial court correctly found that the purse in this case fits within the definition we used in <em>Mercer. </em>Thus, I find this case more analogous to <em>Mercer </em>than it is to <em>Williams </em>(in which we held that an ordinary plastic bag was not an \u201cimplement\u201d and, therefore, a burglarious tool, for purposes of a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-94).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">That being said, I recognize that the mere possession of \u201cany tools, implements, or outfit\u201d is not prohibited by [Code \u00a7 18.2-94]. Such articles \u201cmay be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes.\u201d The gravamen of the offense arises from the possessor\u2019s \u201cintent to use\u201d these \u201ccommon, ordinary\u201d objects for a criminal purpose specified by statute, burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 3, 509 S.E.2d 510, 511 (1999) (quoting <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790, 75 S.E.2d 482, 486 (1953)). Following that logic, I certainly do not believe or suggest that every purse satisfies the definition of a burglary tool. Here, though, appellant clearly used the purse for a purpose other than its ordinary, lawful one, thereby causing it to become something other than an ordinary purse. Like the three other women who went into the store with her and also had empty purses (or in one case, an almost empty purse), appellant completely emptied the purse <em>before </em>she went into the store in order to carry out her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>admitted intent to steal. The purse did not have any money or a wallet in it so as to enable her to purchase an item, did not contain any identification, or contain anything else. This to me differentiates what this appellant did with this purse from a shoplifter who places an item in a purse that is otherwise being used normally (or perhaps empties an item out of a purse while in the store so as to conceal an item that the individual decides to steal). While still a crime of larceny, the pocketbook used in such a situation would probably not be a burglarious tool because it was being used primarily as a pocketbook. Here, appellant went to some trouble and planning to use part of her outfit in a way that it would normally never be used. She essentially had no purpose for that part of her outfit when she entered that store, but to use it to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The General Assembly could have limited burglarious tools to \u201ctools\u201d and \u201cimplements,\u201d but chose to include the word \u201coutfit\u201d in the statute. By choosing to include the word \u201coutfit\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the General Assembly clearly intended to include items plainly defined as such in the definition of burglary tools. Otherwise, I believe the legislature would have simply included only the words \u201ctools\u201d and \u201cimplements.\u201d Moreover, since the statute also does not provide any special definition for the term \u201coutfit,\u201d we are bound to apply that term according to its plain and ordinary meaning, as we did in <em>Mercer, </em>29 Va.App. at 384, 512 S.E.2d at 175. <em>See also Lee County v. Town of St. Charles, </em>264 Va. 344, 348, 568 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002) (\u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that statutory language.\u201d). I believe that, by reversing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s purse fits within the plain and ordinary meaning of an \u201coutfit\u201d under this statute, this Court essentially holds that a purse or pocketbook may never be considered a burglary tool pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-94. That is a conclusion I cannot reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the trial court and appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a burglary tool, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. I believe that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>purse, which she emptied before entering the store with the express intent to use it to steal, was changed from an ordinary item customarily associated with a woman\u2019s outfit into a means to facilitate theft. It, therefore, fits within the definition of \u201coutfit\u201d that we set forth in <em>Mercer. </em>It is for those reasons that I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">. Even though the trial court did not specifically find which category of burglarious tool appellant\u2019s purse fit within, our standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>directs us to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision if the empty purse fits within any one of the three categories of burglarious tools. <em>See generally Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 508, 513-14, 642 S.E.2d 774, 778 (2007) (affirming a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, where \"[t]he trial court made no specific findings ... [and] never enunciated which description [of a concealed weapon] provided the basis for its finding of guilt.\u201d Nevertheless, \"on appeal, if there are facts to support the trial court's conclusion that the knife is either one of the enumerated items within the statute, or a \u2018weapon of like kind,\u2019 [this Court is] bound by that conclusion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">That being said, I am confident\u2014given the arguments of the parties at trial (specifically, the analogies made to a hat and a pair of pants) and the reference by the trial court to pockets in a pair of pants\u2014that the issue at trial and on appeal has been sufficiently focused on whether or not appellant\u2019s empty purse was an \"outfit\u201d for purposes of the burglarious tool statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">.
