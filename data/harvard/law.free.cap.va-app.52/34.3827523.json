BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Shippers\u2019 Choice of Virginia, Inc. (Shippers\u2019 Choice) appeals from the trial court\u2019s affirmation of the decision of a hearing officer for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Shippers\u2019 Choice claims the hearing officer ignored the clear language of the Code and the DMV regulations when he found the company had violated 24 VAC 20-120-180(A)(10).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we agree and reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Shippers\u2019 Choice operates a commercial driving school in Northern Virginia, the licensing of which is overseen by DMV. On December 21, 2005, two agents of DMV visited Shippers\u2019 Choice and observed a class in progress. Bobby Garrison (Garrison), who \u201cwas employed and compensated as a mechanic\u201d for Shippers\u2019 Choice, was instructing a class of five students. No other person was in the room. The agents were impressed with Garrison\u2019s instruction. When they expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>their opinion to Charles Longo, president of Shippers\u2019 Choice, he informed them that Garrison was \u201cparticipating in the school\u2019s instructor training program, [and] was not covering new material.\u201d Longo also acknowledged that Garrison was not yet licensed as a commercial driving instructor pursuant to DMV regulations. No evidence suggested Garrison had taught more than this one class.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">DMV suspended Shippers\u2019 Choice\u2019s license to run the school for six months and fined the company $500 for violating 24 VAC 20-120-180(A)(10), the DMV regulation in effect at the time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1701. After an administrative hearing and issuance of a final Hearing Decision letter by DMV, the suspension was reduced to thirty days. The hearing officer did not explicitly find that Garrison was an \u201cinstructor,\u201d but instead found that he \u201cwas engaged in providing classroom instruction to students at Shipper\u2019s Choice on December 21, 2005.\u201d The hearing officer also found that Garrison was paid as a mechanic by Shippers\u2019 Choice and not for his instruction of any classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Shippers\u2019 Choice appealed DMV\u2019s decision to the Richmond Circuit Court. That court found the DMV hearing officer\u2019s conclusions were \u201csupported by substantial evidence and [were] not arbitrary and capricious.\u201d The court affirmed DMV\u2019s decision. Shippers\u2019 Choice then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">This Court defers to an agency\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). However, where the issue involves a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>determination or statutory interpretation, this Court does a <em>de novo </em>review, especially if the statutory language is clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">We are required to construe the law as it is written. \u201cAn erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u201d <em>Hurt v. Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, 142 (1981). When an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation conflicts with the language of the statute or when the interpretation has not been consistently and regularly applied, the usual deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation should be withheld. <em>University of Richmond v. Bell, </em>543 F.Supp. 321, 327 (E.D.Va.1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">DMV found Shippers\u2019 Choice failed to comply with former regulation 24 VAC 20-120-180(A)(10), by \u201c[ejmploying or otherwise engaging an instructor not properly licensed\u201d by DMV.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This regulation paralleled Code \u00a7 46.2-1701, which states, \u201cNo instructor shall perform the actions enumerated in the definition of \u2018instructor\u2019 in \u00a7 46.2-1700 unless he obtains from the (DMV] Commissioner a license authorizing him to act as driving instructor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1700 defines \u201cinstructor\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">any person, whether acting for himself as operator of a driver training school or for such school <em>for compensation, </em>who teaches, conducts classes, gives demonstrations, or supervises persons learning to operate or drive a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">(Emphasis added.) The DMV regulations repeated this definition exactly, with the exception that the regulations included the word \u201ccommercial\u201d before \u201cdriver training school,\u201d a dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ference that is not relevant here. 24 VAC 20-120-10 (repealed as of January 1, 2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">DMV claims that \u201cinstructor\u201d includes a person, paid by a school for non-teaching services, who also instructs a class without any additional compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> DMV, however, cites no authority for this interpretation, and we disagree with DMV\u2019s suggestion that the definition applies to the situation presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We find the language in Code \u00a7 46.2-1700 and in the DMV regulations clearly defines an \u201cinstructor\u201d as someone who receives compensation <em>for teaching </em>at a driving school. As the statute states, a person must be \u201cacting\u201d for compensation to be an \u201cinstructor.\u201d The actions that the statute then lists all relate to instruction\u2014teaching a class, giving demonstrations, or supervising students who are learning to drive. In this context, \u201cacting ... for such school for compensation\u201d can only mean <em>instructing </em>for compensation, not receiving compensation for an unrelated activity and also instructing students <em>gratis. See Com., Marine Resources Comm\u2019n v. Forbes, </em>214 Va. 109, 113, 197 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1973) (\u201c[W]e must give words and phrases not specifically defined in the statute their commonly accepted meaning in the context in which they are used.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We find as a matter of law that Garrison was not an \u201cinstructor\u201d as defined by the relevant statutes and regulations because he was not compensated for his instruction of the class. Therefore, Shippers\u2019 Choice did not violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>DMV regulations or relevant statutes when it allowed him to teach one class as part of its training program for driving school instructors. The trial court erred when it affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the trial court and remand this case for that court to set aside the decision of DMV and \u201cremand the matter to the agency\u201d with directions to dismiss the violation. Code \u00a7 2.2-4029.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\">. Shippers' Choice listed three questions presented in its appellate brief. However, all three questions actually address the same issue. Therefore, we consider these questions collectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">. The regulations on driving schools and instructor licenses were amended, effective January 1, 2008. <em>See </em>24 Va. Reg. Regs. 516 (repealing 24 VAC 20-120-10 through 24 VAC 20-120-180 and enacting 24 VAC 20-121-10 through 24 VAC 20-121-220). The new regulations include tougher standards for the licensing of instructors, such as requiring that all instructors receive training on the appropriate curriculum materials before they begin teaching students. <em>See </em>24 VAC 20-121-100. However, the definition of \"instructor\u201d was not changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\">. This exact language no longer exists in the Virginia Administrative Code. The new regulation on sanctions, 24 VAC 20-121-160, contains more general language, allowing sanction on \"any licensee who violates any provisions of such statutes or these regulations.\u201d 24 VAC 20-121-160(A). However, Code \u00a7 46.2-1701, which is referenced in this regulation, has not been amended at all since 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. When the new DMV regulations on driving schools were substantially rewritten and went into effect on January 1, 2008, the explicit wording of the definition of \"instructor\" was removed and replaced with a reference to Code \u00a7 46.2-1700 for the definition of \"instructor.\u201d <em>See </em>24 VAC 20-121-10; 24 Va. Reg. Regs. 516. The definition of \"instructor\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-1700 has remained exactly the same since 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. DMV does not claim, nor do we find any evidence in the record, that Garrison received any compensation for instructing the class on December 21, 2005. This case does not involve any allegation that Shippers' Choice was attempting to circumvent the licensing regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
