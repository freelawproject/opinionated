On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made during an interview with police. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">The facts underlying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress are not in dispute. On April 24, 2006, appellant was arrested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Virginia Beach police officers pursuant to a warrant charging him with conspiracy to commit robbery. Later that day, Detectives Seabold and Pickell, both of the Virginia Beach police department, interviewed appellant about his involvement in the crimes to which he later entered conditional guilty pleas. The interview was videotaped, and a summary of the interview was introduced as an exhibit at the hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Prior to questioning, Detective Seabold advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Appellant acknowledged that he understood the rights Seabold read to him. After \u201cSeabold advised Knox that he was going to ask him questions about that day and the people who were involved,\u201d appellant said, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk right now. Not right now.\u201d Seabold immediately stopped his interrogation of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Detective Pickell, who had remained silent until that point, asked appellant if he would like something to drink. Appellant responded, \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d but then appellant asked Pickell, \u201cCan we just talk later?\u201d Pickell explained to appellant that \u201cthere might not be a later,\u201d as two of appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirators had been arrested and had given statements to the police. Pickell continued by saying he had the feeling that appellant was not part of that group and that he should give the police his side of the story. Thereafter, appellant made incriminating statements that admitted his involvement in a felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that \u201cwithout reaching whether or not the defendant initially invoked his right to remain silent\u2014because I don\u2019t have to reach that particular issue\u2014it is clear to me that once the defendant reinitiated the conversation, that he waived that right.\u201d The court opined, \u201cThe incriminating statements flowed from a conversation initiated by the defendant. He asked the detective if they could talk later. The detective answered the question, and then the incriminating statements flowed from that conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The trial court accepted appellant\u2019s conditional guilty pleas on the charges of first-degree murder, attempted robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The court sentenced appellant to eighty-three years in jail, with thirty-three years suspended (for a total active sentence of fifty years). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u201cOn appeal from a denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is upon the defendant to show the trial judge\u2019s ruling, when the evidence is viewed most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 646, 652, 500 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1998). \u201c[I]n conducting its independent review, an appellate court must review the circuit court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for clear error, and the appellate court must give due weight to inferences drawn from those factual findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 327, 568 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2002). However, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case.\u201d <em>Cary v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 480, 486, 579 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u201cFor a confession given during custodial interrogation to be admissible, the Commonwealth must show that the accused was apprised of his right to remain silent and that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived that right.\u201d <em>Green, </em>27 Va.App. at 652, 500 S.E.2d at 838.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">[T]he Court [in <em>Miranda </em>] held that an express statement can constitute a waiver, and that silence alone after such warnings cannot do so. But the Court did not hold that such an express statement is indispensable to a finding of waiver. An express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but rather whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case. As was unequivocally said in <em>Miranda, </em>mere silence is not enough. That does not mean that the defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1757, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201c[T]he inquiry [of] whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was made knowingly and intelligently is a question of fact, and the trial court\u2019s resolution of that question is entitled on appeal to a presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 576, 581, 423 S.E.2d 160, 163 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApE\">[The trial court] evaluates the credibility of the witnesses, resolves any conflicts in the testimony, and weighs the evidence as a whole. The court must decide whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished and abandoned his rights. The court\u2019s determination is a question of fact based upon the totality of the circumstances. This factual finding will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 477, 331 S.E.2d 422, 429-30 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">A. Invocation of the right to remain silent</p>\n<p id=\"A4F\"><em>\u201cMiranda [v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966),] recognized that if a suspect \u2018indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u2019 \u201d <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 267, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1995) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627-28). However, \u201ca clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to remain silent or to counsel is necessary before authorities are required to discontinue an interrogation.\u201d <em>Green, </em>27 Va.App. at 653, 500 S.E.2d at 838. \u201cBut if a suspect requests counsel at any time during the interview, he is not subject to further questioning until a lawyer has been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>available <em>or the suspect himself reinitiates conversation.\u201d Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 458, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2354-55, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (emphasis added). <em>See also Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1043, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 2833-34, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983) (forbidding further interrogation \u201c \u2018unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 485, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981))); <em>Green, </em>27 Va.App. at 653-54, 500 S.E.2d at 838-39 (finding appellant, after \u201cinitially invoking] his right to silence,\u201d \u201cvoluntarily expressed his desire to make further statements\u201d) (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 462, 114 S.Ct. at 2356).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, in response to Detective Seabold\u2019s expressed desire to talk with appellant \u201cabout that day and the people who were involved,\u201d appellant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk right now. Not right now.\u201d The trial court assumed without deciding that appellant\u2019s statement was sufficient to assert his right to remain silent. We likewise assume without deciding that appellant invoked his right to remain silent and turn, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the trial court did, to the question of whether or not appellant waived his right to remain silent by reinitiating a conversation with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Before turning to that question, however, we note that Detective Seabold honored appellant\u2019s right to remain silent by stopping the interrogation. <em>See Medley v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 19, 37, 602 S.E.2d 411, 419 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201c \u2018the admissibility of statements obtained after [a] person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S.Ct. 321, 325-26, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975))). As the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Mosley,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">Through the exercise of his option to terminate questioning [a suspect] can control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person\u2019s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">423 U.S. at 104-05, 96 S.Ct. at 326-27. Here, Seabold <em>immediately </em>terminated questioning after appellant informed him that he did not want to talk \u201cright now.\u201d In so doing, Detective Seabold respected appellant\u2019s \u201cexercise of that option\u201d and, therefore, \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d appellant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">B. Reinitiation of the conversation with police</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u201cIf \u2018the accused, not the police, [reopens] the dialogue with the authorities,\u2019 a court, upon consideration of that fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and \u2018the totality of the circumstances,\u2019 may reasonably find that the accused has made a \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 waiver of his rights.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>244 Va. at 583, 423 S.E.2d at 164 (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 486 n. 9, 101 S.Ct. at 1885). The dialogue initiated by the accused must demonstrate \u201ca willingness and a desire for a generalized discussion about the investigation.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1045, 103 S.Ct. at 2834. If it is found that the accused reinitiated a conversation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKO\">the next inquiry [is] \u201cwhether a valid waiver of the right to counsel and the right to silence had occurred, that is, whether the purported waiver was knowing and intelligent and found to be so under the totality of the circumstances, including the necessary fact that the accused, not the police, reopened the dialogue with the authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1046, 103 S.Ct. at 2835 (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 486 n. 9, 101 S.Ct. at 1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>Bradshaw, </em>after invoking his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the defendant asked police, \u201cWell, what is going to happen to me now?\u201d The plurality opinion of the United States Supreme Court held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Although ambiguous, the respondent\u2019s question in this case as to what was going to happen to him evinced a willingness and a desire for a generalized discussion about the investigation; it was not merely a necessary inquiry arising out of the incidents of the custodial relationship. It could reasonably have been interpreted by the officer as relating generally to the investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">462 U.S. at 1046, 103 S.Ct. at 2835.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, according to the Court\u2019s plurality opinion, some routine questions, asked either by police or by the accused while in custody, do not reinitiate a conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>There are some inquiries, <em>such as a request for a drink of water </em>or a request to use a telephone, that are so routine that they cannot be fairly said to represent a desire on the part of an accused to open up a more generalized discussion relating directly or indirectly to the investigation. Such inquiries or statements, <em>by either an accused or a police officer, </em>relating to routine incidents of the custodial relationship, will not generally \u201cinitiate\u201d a conversation in the sense in which that word was used in <em>Edwards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">462 U.S. at 1045,103 S.Ct. at 2835 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Here, after Seabold stopped interrogating appellant, Detective Pickell, who had not previously asked appellant any questions, asked appellant whether he would like something to drink. That was the only thing the police asked appellant after he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk right now. Not right now.\u201d As <em>Bradshaw </em>makes clear, and as the trial court correctly found, the question Pickell asked appellant\u2014 \u201cwould you like something to drink?\u201d\u2014did not reinitiate an interrogation of appellant. However, appellant, after declining Pickell\u2019s offer of something to drink, asked Detective Pickell a specific question\u2014\u201cCan we just talk later?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pickell answered appellant\u2019s question by explaining that \u201cthere might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>not be a later\u201d since two of appellant\u2019s co-conspirators had given statements to the police and that now was the opportunity for appellant to tell his side of the story.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant then chose to continue his conversation with the police, and in the course of that conversation, appellant admitted his involvement in a robbery and a murder. The trial court, therefore, found that the incriminating statements appellant made \u201cflowed from a conversation [appellant] initiated.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Like Bradshaw\u2019s question to police (\u201cWell, what is going to happen to me now?\u201d), appellant\u2019s question to Pickell\u2014\u201cCan we just talk later?\u201d\u2014related generally to the pending investigation and not to \u201cthe incidents of the custodial relationship,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>might \u201ca request for a drink of water or a request to use a telephone.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1046, 103 S.Ct. at 2835. <em>See Harrison, </em>244 Va. at 582-83, 423 S.E.2d at 164 (Assuming Harrison\u2019s \u201csilence following his acknowledgement that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights was an implicit invocation of those rights,\u201d \u201cHarrison reopened the dialogue by inquiring \u2018what was going to happen to him.\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also United States v. Velasquez, </em>885 F.2d 1076, 1085 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cBy asking the question [\u2018What is going to happen?\u2019], Velasquez initiated the conversation. While the question itself may not be free of all ambiguity, its context supports the conclusion that it was directed toward the investigation.\u201d). We hold, therefore, that, since appellant\u2019s question to Detective Pickell related generally to the investigation and was not merely incidental to the custodial relationship, the trial court correctly decided that appellant reinitiated the conversation with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Because appellant reinitiated the conversation with police and appellant\u2019s incriminating statements flowed from the conversation that followed from the question appellant posed to Detective Pickell, the trial court properly found that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. As the trial court astutely noted, while appellant may not have liked the answer Detective Pickell gave him to the question appellant asked, he nevertheless chose at that point to continue the conversation he had initiated with Detective Pickell and, in the process, made statements admitting his involvement in the crimes to which he ultimately pled guilty. Therefore, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the trial court was not plainly wrong in determining that appellant waived his right to remain silent. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. We likewise affirm those convictions to which appellant entered conditional guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">. The analysis performed in cases involving the right to remain silent and the right to counsel differs when the police reinitiate a conversation with a suspect who has invoked either right, but remains the same if the suspect reinitiates. If a suspect reinitiates the conversation, <em>Bradshaw </em>governs that point irrespective of whether the suspect initially invoked the right to counsel or the right to remain silent. <em>See Christopher v. Florida, </em>824 F.2d 836, 844-45 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cWhile we recognize that <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Bradshaw </em>are right to counsel cases, and that <em>[Michigan v.] Mosley </em>[, 423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975),] governs the admissibility of statements made following the suspect\u2019s invocation of his right to cut off questioning, <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 326, we accept the State\u2019s implicit claim that there are situations where the 'initiation' test of <em>Edwards/Bradshaw </em>governs the admissibility of statements made after a suspect has invoked his right to terminate questioning,\u201d and, thus, \"the <em>Edwards/Bradshaw </em>rule merges with the test of <em>Mosley </em>to render inadmissible statements obtained during a 'significant period\u2019 after a request to cut off questioning, <em>unless the statements were the product of a conversation initiated by the suspect under the test of Edwards/Bradshaw.\" </em>(emphasis added)). <em>See also United States v. Thongsophaporn, </em>503 F.3d 51, 56-57 (1st Cir.2007) (applying <em>Bradshaw </em>reinitiation test following an invocation of the right to remain silent under Mosley).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">. The fact that Seabold honored appellant\u2019s assumed invocation of his right to remain silent distinguishes this case from our recent opinion in <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 324, 663 S.E.2d 505 (July 22, 2008) <em>(en </em>banc). There, we held that a police investigator, by continuing to interrogate Ferguson after he asserted his right to counsel, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not honor Ferguson\u2019s request. Thus, the failure to honor Ferguson\u2019s request \"tainted any subsequent confession made by [Ferguson] while he remained in the continuous custody of police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 663 S.E.2d at 516.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. The four members of the Court who dissented in <em>Bradshaw </em>agreed with the plurality opinion that, \"in order to constitute \u2018initiation\u2019 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Edwards, </em>an accused\u2019s inquiry must demonstrate a desire to discuss the subject matter of the criminal investigation.\u201d 462 U.S. at 1055, 103 S.Ct. at 2840. The dissenting judges, however, differed with the plurality\u2019s application of that principle to the facts of that case. Justice Powell, who concurred in the judgment \"that Bradshaw knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel,\u201d did not agree, however, with the two-step analysis that the other justices in the plurality opinion employed to decide the case. Instead, Justice Powell believed \"the question of whether a suspect has waived this important right to counsel is uniquely one of fact, and usually must and should be left to the judgment of the trial court that has had the benefit of hearing the evidence and assessing the weight and credibility of testimony.\u201d 462 U.S. at 1051, 103 S.Ct. at 2838.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. Appellant argues that to decide this issue, we must consider the question he posed to Detective Pickell in the context of the statement he previously made to Detective Seabold.

Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984), suggested otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">Where nothing about the request [to remain silent] or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.
