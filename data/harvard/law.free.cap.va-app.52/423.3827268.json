On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a recording of a 911 call and in finding the evidence sufficient to support his conviction. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">\u201cOn appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Zoretic v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 241, 242, 409 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1991) (citing <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). Viewed by that standard, the evidence demonstrates that around 2:00 a.m. on May 24, 2006, appellant met Katie McLachlan in front of her home at 1103 Clarke Street in Herndon, Virginia. In his pocket, appellant carried an unopened 40-ounce beer bottle. As appellant and McLachlan walked toward her house, they encountered McLachlan\u2019s roommate, Maria Gann, and her boyfriend, William Green. After McLachlan introduced appellant to Green, Green punched appellant in the nose. Appellant then fled, and Green pursued him. McLachlan and Gann followed the two men. During the chase, appellant dropped the 40-ounce beer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>bottle on the street. Moments later, Green caught up to appellant and a struggle ensued between the men. At some point during the affray, appellant stabbed Green with a knife. Appellant immediately fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">After appellant fled, McLachlan and Gann carried Green, who appeared unconscious, back to the front yard of their residence. Within minutes, McLachlan called 911 and spoke to an operator employed by the Fairfax County Police. The dialogue between McLachlan and the 911 operator, in relevant part, transpired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">911 OPERATOR: What\u2019s the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">CALLER: I don\u2019t know.

Subsequently, a jury convicted appellant of manslaughter and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">II. 911 CALL</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the 911 recording into evidence under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, hearsay evidence is incompetent and inadmissible,\u201d and \u201cthe party seeking to rely upon an exception to the hearsay rule has the burden of establishing admissibility.\u201d <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 420-21, 425 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u201cThere is no fixed rule by which the question whether the statement is admissible as an excited utterance can be decided.\u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 287, 292, 367 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1988). \u201cResolution of the issue depends [upon] the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201cA statement comes within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible to prove the truth of the matter stated, when the statement is spontaneous and impulsive, thus guaranteeing its reliability____ The statement must be prompted by a startling event and be made at such time and under such circumstances as to preclude the presumption that it was made as the result of deliberation. In addition, the declarant must have firsthand knowledge of the startling event. The decision whether the statement qualifies as an excited utterance lies within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-12\"><em>Esser v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 520, 525, 566 S.E.2d 876, 879 (2002) (quoting <em>Braxton v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 176, 184, 493 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Here, during rebuttal, the Commonwealth moved .to admit into evidence the recording of McLachlan\u2019s dialogue with the 911 operator. Out of the jury\u2019s presence, the trial court heard the 911 recording. In resolving that the recording qualified as an excited utterance, the trial court found McLachlan, a witness to the event, made \u201cspontaneous\u201d statements, under the influence of and contemporaneous with the \u201cvery startling event,\u201d and without \u201cany time for reflection\u201d or \u201cpremeditation.\u201d Appellant claims, nonetheless, that the call does not qualify as an excited utterance because McLachlan\u2019s statements were made \u201cin response to questions from the 911 operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We addressed the same argument in <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 166, 403 S.E.2d 375 (1991). In that case, the victim, who was mortally wounded from gunshot wounds to the stomach, called 911 about ten minutes after the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 403 S.E.2d at 381. During the exchange with the 911 operator, the victim disclosed that he was shot \u201cwith a .25 or .32\u201d by \u201cone black male\u201d who \u201cwas running\u201d and \u201cheaded to the Fort Cinema.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 403 S.E.2d at 380. Bowling argued, like appellant, that because the victim\u2019s statements were made \u201cin response to questions\u201d by the 911 operator, they were not sufficiently spontaneous to be admitted under the excited utterance exception. <em>Id. </em>We rejected Bowling\u2019s argument, noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201cTo pivot the admissibility of a subsequent statement, however spontaneous, on the question[ ] of whether it was prompted by an equally spontaneous inquiry would serve no useful purpose. If the question or questioner suggested or influenced the response, then the declaration may lack the necessary reliability to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 176, 403 S.E.2d at 380 (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 442, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). Concluding that the victim\u2019s statements to the 911 operator \u201cwere not the result of premeditation, reflection or design, but a reaction to the startling events\u201d which resulted in the victim\u2019s death several hours later, we held the trial court properly admitted the 911 recording pursuant to the excited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>utterance exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 403 S.E.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The same rationale applies here. McLachlan, who had just witnessed a violent confrontation, aided the victim who lay mortally wounded from the stabbings. McLachlan also faced the threat that the assailant would return to the scene to perpetrate further harm. McLachlan spoke to the 911 operator and described the incident and the assailant within minutes of the event. The operator responded to McLachlan\u2019s initial report of the confrontation to quickly ascertain the gravity of peril McLachlan faced and by directing McLachlan to render aid to a dying man. Considering the reliability of the statements in accord with <em>Bowling, </em>we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that McLachlan\u2019s responses to the 911 operator\u2019s questions were not suggested or influenced by the questions posed by the 911 operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Thus, the fact that McLachlan was answering questions, rather than relaying a spontaneous narrative, does not indicate her statements were not excited utterances. <em>See United States v. Joy, </em>192 F.3d 761, 766-67 (7th Cir.1999) (holding that the fact that the witness\u2019 statements to a 911 operator were responses to questions did not mean they were not \u201cspontaneous, exited, and impulsive\u201d). <em>Compare Clark, </em>235 Va. at 293, 367 S.E.2d at 486 (holding that statements made by a gunshot victim as to his assailant\u2019s identity, while the victim was mortally wounded and suffering from the trauma of the shooting, were admissible as excited utterances even though the statement was prompted by a question some five to ten minutes after the shooting), <em>and Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 424, 430, 382 S.E.2d 292, 295-96 (1989) (holding that statements made by gunshot victim within ten minutes of the shooting while victim lay fatally wounded are admissible as excited utterances even though the victim made the statements in response to questions), <em>and Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 442, 358 S.E.2d at 418 (holding that statements made by child rape victim are admissible as excited utterances even though the victim made the statements in response to questions), <em>with Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 288, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>237 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1977) (holding that a victim\u2019s statement identifying assailant, made ten to fifteen minutes after police had interviewed the victim, when police led the victim to the police vehicle for the purpose of observing assailant, did not qualify as an excited utterance), <em>and Nicholaou v. Harrington, </em>217 Va. 618, 622, 231 S.E.2d 318, 322 (1977) (holding that a statement made by a witness at least six or seven minutes after an automobile-motorcycle collision, when the investigating officer was questioning one of the parties to the accident, lacked the characteristics of a spontaneous utterance). Indeed, \u201cit is possible for someone to be too excited to volunteer pertinent information ..., and thus the inherent \u2018guarantee of truthfulness\u2019 supporting the admission of excited utterances applies equally to declarations made in response to an inquiry.\u201d <em>Joy, </em>192 F.3d at 767. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the 911 recording into evidence under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Appellant next contends the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment precluded admission of the 911 recording. Relying on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and its progeny, <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), appellant claims that McLachlan\u2019s statements were testimonial in nature and, therefore, inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Although we will not disturb on appeal decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion, <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 169, 184, 596 S.E.2d 563, 570 (2004), we review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular category of proffered evidence is \u201ctestimonial hearsay,\u201d <em>Jasper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 749, 755, 644 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a \u201cprocedural guarantee\u201d that also \u201capplies to state prosecutions,\u201d <em>Michels v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 466, 624 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2006), provides that, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 753, 644 S.E.2d at 409. Recently, the United States Supreme Court considered the right of confrontation in <em>Crawford, </em>clarifying that \u201c[wjhere testimonial evidence is at issue, ... the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. \u201cNow, under <em>Crawford, </em>the question whether admission of a hearsay statement against a criminal defendant violates the Confrontation Clause turns on whether the statement is \u2018testimonial\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>Magruder v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 283, 294-95, 657 S.E.2d 113, 118 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Davis, </em>the United States Supreme Court expounded on what <em>Crawford </em>characterized as \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements in the context of an interrogation during a 911 call. In doing so, the Court announced the primary purpose doctrine, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74. Examining the call in question under this framework, the Court noted, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(1) the caller was describing the events as they were happening; (2) the caller was facing an ongoing emergency; (3) the nature of what was asked and answered was necessary to resolve the present emergency rather than learn what happened in the past; and (4) the caller\u2019s answers were frantic[, provided over the phone, in an environment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>United States v. Proctor, </em>505 F.3d 366, 371 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2277); <em>see also United States v. Cadieux, </em>500 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir.2007). Because the caller was not testifying as a witness, but rather, was \u201cenabl[ing] police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d the Court concluded the 911 call did not produce testimonial statements. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 828, 126 S.Ct. at 2277.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Applying the primary purpose doctrine to the facts of this case, we conclude that McLachlan\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were not testimonial in nature. Viewing the circumstances objectively, it is clear that McLachlan faced an ongoing emergency manifested by two sources of distress: Green\u2019s life-threatening condition and the present and proximate danger that appellant, a potentially armed assailant who had stabbed Green and fled into the neighborhood, would return to the scene to injure Green, McLachlan, or Gann.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">McLachlan described the events as they were happening. She spoke of whether Green was conscious, bleeding, and breathing as the deteriorating condition was actually occurring. The operator responded to the trauma by directing McLachlan to apply pressure to the wounds -with a clean towel to slow the bleeding and kept her on the phone \u201cto make sure [Green\u2019s] condition [did not] get worse.\u201d Asked by the operator how Green was injured, who committed the stabbing, whether the perpetrator was armed, and where the perpetrator fled, McLachlan replied that appellant hit Green in the stomach with a beer bottle, she did not know if he was armed, and he fled \u201ctowards Herndon Parkway.\u201d In addition, the emergency was ongoing throughout the interrogation. The nature of what was asked and answered was necessary to enable the police to arrange for the arrival of the appropriate medical services to treat Green\u2019s injuries and to warn police that appellant, a dangerous and potentially armed man, ran at-large in the neighborhood. Because McLachlan rendered aid to a dying man while facing the threat of appellant\u2019s return to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the scene, she was \u201cin an environment that was neither tranquil nor safe.\u201d <em>Cadieux, </em>500 F.3d at 41 (citing <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 826-27, 126 S.Ct. at 2276-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellant claims, however, that McLachlan\u2019s statements were testimonial because the original emergency ended when the altercation between appellant and Green ceased. Thus, he argues, the call focused on a criminal investigation of a completed event evident from the operator\u2019s questions as to \u201cwho was the cause of the wounds, where that person went and what he was wearing.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In <em>Proctor, </em>a witness called 911 immediately following the crime, recounting that the defendant stole a gun, fired it twice, and fled into a nightclub with the loaded weapon. <em>Proctor, </em>505 F.3d at 371-72. The caller described the defendant and his criminal history as a convicted felon, reported that he was on drugs, and described his location. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued \u201cthe emergency had already passed, because he had run away with the weapon at the time of the 911 call and, therefore, the 911 conversation was testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, the court reasoned that his retreat into a nightclub \u201cprovided no assurances that he would not momentarily return\u201d to confront the caller and other witness. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as the court noted, the caller \u201ccould have reasonably feared that the people inside the nightclub were in danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that a \u201creasonable viewing\u201d of the 911 call was that the caller and operator \u201cwere dealing with an ongoing emergency involving a dangerous felon, and that the 911 operator\u2019s questions were related to the resolution of that emergency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The same conclusion is equally applicable in this case. The emergency had not ended and was not limited to rendering aid to Green. Rather, the emergency also involved a dangerous assailant who had just stabbed Green, was potentially armed, and fled into the surrounding neighborhood with no guarantee that he would not return and cause further harm to Green, McLachlan, Gann, or other residents of the neighborhood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>McLachlan could have \u201creasonably feared\u201d that she, Green, and Gann were in danger. In fact, the operator\u2019s questions showed that she was trying to resolve the emergency by attempting to compose McLachlan, asking her to \u201csettle down,\u201d and then by seeking to understand the seriousness of the peril McLachlan faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Here, as in <em>Proctor, </em>the operator\u2019s effort to resolve the ongoing emergency by establishing the identity of the assailant, including his location and physical description, so that the officers might know whether they would be encountering a violent felon, did not render McLachlan\u2019s responses testimonial. <em>See also Cadieux, </em>500 F.3d at 41 (concluding that the caller responded to the dispatcher\u2019s questions tailored to identify the location of the emergency, its nature, and the perpetrator, and the emergency did not end until the perpetrator was apprehended); <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>486 F.3d 177, 189 (6th Cir.2007) (concluding that the \u201cexigency of the moment\u201d had not ended even though the victim left the house where assailant remained, went around the corner, and called 911); <em>United States v. Clemmons, </em>461 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (8th Cir.2006) (concluding that the gunshot victim\u2019s statements made just after the shooting in response to the police officer\u2019s questions as to who shot him were nontestimonial); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>453 F.3d 838, 844 (7th Cir.2006) (concluding that the caller\u2019s answers were nontestimonial even though made in response to the 911 operator\u2019s questions as to \u201cwho had the gun\u201d and where the victim lay injured).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Appellant further contends that the \u201cprejudice of the 911 call\u201d to appellant \u201cfar outweighed any probative value.\u201d Specifically, he claims that \u201cthe crying of Ms. Gann and Ms. McLachlan\u201d and the \u201cmoaning noises being made by Mr. Green in the background\u201d had a prejudicial effect. We disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cIn determining whether evidence should be admitted, the trial court must apply a balancing test in assessing the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Dandridge v. Marshall, </em>267 Va. 591, 596, 594 S.E.2d 578, 581 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>(2004). \u201cThis determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be reversed on appeal only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lombard v. Rohrbaugh, </em>262 Va. 484, 492, 551 S.E.2d 349, 353 (2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">In a sense, all \u201cevidence tending to prove guilt is prejudicial\u201d\u2014at least from the point of view of the person standing trial. Virginia law, however, intervenes only when the alleged prejudice tends to inflame irrational emotions or leads to illegitimate inferences. And even then, it becomes a matter of degree____ We generally defer to trial judges on this subject because they, unlike us, participate first person in the evidentiary process and acquire competencies on the subject that we can rarely duplicate merely by reading briefs and transcripts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 757-58, 607 S.E.2d 738, 746 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 107, 141, 590 S.E.2d 537, 558 (2004)), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In this case, the trial court judge implicitly found no prejudice when he made a finding of fact that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear Mr. Green say anything\u201d on the 911 recording. \u201cPrinciples of appellate review require that we affirm determinations of fact made by the trial court unless there is no support for such determinations in the record.\u201d <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Hunt &amp; Calderone, P.C., </em>261 Va. 38, 44, 540 S.E.2d 491, 494 (2001). Based on our review, we cannot conclude that this factual finding of the trial court is without support in the record. In addition, we cannot say that the crying of Ms. Gann and Ms. McLachlan, clearly a natural reaction to the violent stabbing of their friend, rendered the recording prejudicial. <em>See Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 85-86, 452 S.E.2d 862, 867 (1995) (concluding that a videotape was not inadmissible on its second playing merely because \u201cthe jury could hear the gunshot and the victim\u2019s short scream\u201d). Under the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Appellant asserts the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for voluntary manslaughter because he claims he acted in self-defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, \u201c\u2018we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (quoting <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988)). \u201cIn a jury trial, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded to their testimony are matters solely within the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Lynn v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 336, 351, 499 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1998). \u201cWe will not disturb the conviction unless it is plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 545-46, 586 S.E.2d 876, 879 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A defendant claiming self-defense \u201cimplicitly admits the killing was intentional.\u201d <em>McGhee v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 560, 562, 248 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1978). \u201cTo justify the use of deadly force, the defendant must have reasonably feared death or serious bodily injury from his victim, and there must have been an overt threat.\u201d <em>Peeples v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 626, 634, 519 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1999) (en banc). \u201c[T]he amount of force used must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened.\u201d <em>Diffendal v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 417, 421, 382 S.E.2d 24, 26 (1989). Furthermore, an individual\u2019s right to self-defend \u201cbegins where the necessity begins and ends where it ends.\u201d <em>Thomason v. Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 489, 498, 17 S.E.2d 374, 378 (1941). \u201cAlthough undisputed facts may establish self-defense as a matter of law, whether the accused establishes that he or she acted in [self-defense] is generally a question of fact.\u201d <em>Lynn, </em>27 Va.App. at 353, 499 S.E.2d at 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">At trial, appellant testified that Green introduced the knife into the altercation and wielded it in appellant\u2019s direction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Appellant further claimed that he believed Green was going to stab him and stated that he pried the knife from Green\u2019s hand. Appellant also admitted that he swung the knife at Green as Green continued to punch him. Gann testified that during the altercation, she saw nothing in Green\u2019s hand. A forensic pathology expert testified that Green sustained three stab wounds to the chest and one stab wound to the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Considering the evidence adduced at trial, the jury could have concluded that appellant lied during his testimony and could have found that he, in fact, introduced the knife into the affray and stabbed Green. Indeed, the jury was entitled to credit the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that Gann did not see Green with a knife. In the alternative, the jury could have found that Green originally had the knife but that appellant wrestled it from him and then stabbed Green. Upon either plausible explanation, the jury, acting within its fact finding discretion, could have found that the amount of force appellant used, as evidenced by the four stab wounds to Green, was not reasonable against Green, who either never possessed the knife, or no longer had the knife. Thus, the jury \u201cresolv[ed] the conflicts and inconsistencies [therein] against [appellant] and [found] ultimately that the evidence constituted proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 329, 343, 542 S.E.2d 1, 7 (2001). We hold, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
