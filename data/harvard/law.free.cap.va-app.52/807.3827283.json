ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc. (CBF), appeals from a decision upholding the extension of a Virginia Water Protection Permit (VWP permit) previously issued to the City of Newport News for the construction and operation of a reservoir in King William County. On appeal, CBF contends the circuit court erred in granting the demurrers of Newport News and the Commonwealth agencies and official involved in the proceedings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending the court erroneously found that CBF lacked standing to pursue the appeal because it did not sufficiently allege that extension of the VWP permit at issue caused it to \u201csuffer[ ] an actual or imminent injury.\u201d We hold the facts alleged in CBF\u2019s petition for appeal, along with the reasonable inferences therefrom, accepted as true, were sufficient to survive appellees\u2019 demurrers on the issue of standing. Thus, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On February 15, 2007, appellant filed a petition for appeal of the State Water Control Board\u2019s decision to grant an extension and modification of a VWP permit issued to the City of Newport News in 1997. \u201cBecause the circuit court decided the matters upon demurrer, we shall recite the facts alleged, and all reasonable inferences flowing from those facts, as though they are true, in accordance with settled principles of appellate review.\u201d <em>Citizens for Stumpy Lake v. State Water Control Bd., </em>46 Va.App. 104, 107, 616 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2005) [hereinafter <em>Stumpy Lake]; see infra </em>Part II (discussing in greater detail the standard of review applicable on appeal of the granting of a demurrer). So, viewed, the facts as pleaded in that petition for appeal, and supplemented by the attached exhibits and other information in the record, indicated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">On December 22, 1997, upon the recommendation of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the State Water Control Board (the Board) issued a VWP permit to the City of Newport News. The activity authorized by the permit was the City\u2019s construction and operation of a reservoir on Cohoke Creek in King William County and the transfer of water from that reservoir to other locations [hereinafter \u201cthe King William Reservoir\u201d or \u201cthe reservoir\u201d]. The permit was set to expire on December 22, 2007. The permit constituted certification by the Commonwealth\u2014as required by Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251 to 1376, and the State Water Control Law and related regulations\u2014that \u201cthere is a reasonable assurance that the activity authorized by this permit, if conducted in accordance with the conditions set forth herein, will protect instream beneficial uses and will not violate applicable water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The VWP permit authorized the destruction of 437 acres of wetlands, established compensatory wetlands mitigation terms requiring the establishment of twice as many acres of new wetlands to compensate for the wetlands to be destroyed by the project. It also required actions designed to ensure protection of minimum instream flows in the Mattaponi River, the primary source of water for the King William Reservoir. The VWP permit required the completion of certain studies and the preparation of certain plans before construction of the reservoir could begin. Those studies and plans as listed in the permit included a habitat evaluation procedure study; a detailed final wetland mitigation plan for the required mitigation; an ecomonitoring plan to include fish spawning and nursery grounds and vegetative composition and distribution; and a salinity monitoring plan. It also required that the permittee \u201ccomply with all applicable Federal and State statutes [and] regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The VWP permit was only one of three permits the City was required to obtain before beginning construction on the reservoir. In September 2004, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission granted Newport News a permit (1) allowing it to \u201c[e]ncroach in, on or over State owned subaqueous bottom [land]s\u201d for the purpose of constructing the reservoir and (2) imposing numerous restrictions on the reservoir\u2019s operation. In November 2005, the United States Army Corps of Engineers granted the City\u2019s request for a permit for the project under Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 [hereinafter \u201cthe Section 404 permit\u201d]. CBF and others challenged the Section 404 permit, and their suit was pending in federal court when CBF filed the petition for appeal in these proceedings. CBF and others also challenged issuance of the VWP permit in state court. <em>See Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality ex rel. State Water Control Bd., </em>43 Va.App. 690, 601 S.E.2d 667 (2004), <em>aff'd sub. nom. Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 423, 443, 621 S.E.2d 78, 89 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1192, 126 S.Ct. 2862, 165 L.Ed.2d 895 (2006). That challenge was ultimately resolved in the City\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>When it became apparent to the City of Newport News that, due to the delays caused by litigation involving the various permits, it would not be able to complete the studies required by the VWP permit and begin construction of the reservoir prior to expiration of the VWP permit in December 2007, it requested a five-year extension of the VWP permit. The Board published notice of the City\u2019s request and received public comment thereon. CBF actively participated in the public comment process by presenting written comments and oral testimony to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">DEQ, which advises the Board on environmental matters, recommended to the Board that it grant the requested five-year extension subject to the \u201cadditional condition that the permittee submit an application for permit reissuance concurrent with the submittal of the final mitigation plan.\u201d The Board, however, decided not to approve DEQ\u2019s recommendation and so notified the City. The City then filed a timely petition for a formal administrative hearing before the Board, to which it was entitled as a matter of right pursuant to applicable regulations. However, while the City\u2019s petition for a formal hearing was pending, the city manager wrote DEQ Director David Paylor and asked that the Board \u201creconsider\u201d its decision denying the requested five-year extension, stating that a reconsideration based on certain issues would likely avoid the need for a formal hearing. The city manager wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">The City applied for the extension so that we would be able to complete a detailed wetland mitigation plan and provide other valuable information that would be needed by the Board before it considered a renewal of the permit. While we understand that an extension of the permit would not create any greater expectation or certainty that the Board would approve our application for re-issuance of the permit, this extension assists us in securing the monies required to complete the studies and to fulfill the conditions of the original State permit. Favorable action on the extension will provide assurance that we are taking the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ate and necessary steps to put us in the position to obtain a renewal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">If the Board is willing to reconsider their September 6, 2006 decision [denying the permit extension request] and grant an adequate extension of time without having to conduct a formal hearing, we would be amenable to a condition, as part of the extension that prohibits the construction of project facilities under the current permit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The Board accepted the request to reconsider and then granted the request for issuance of a \u201cModification\u201d of the permit with an extended expiration date. Although the permit continued to state that it \u201cauthorize^] the construction and operation of the [listed] water resources infrastructure\u201d comprising the King William Reservoir, it also included a contradictory new provision stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">During the term of this permit, there shall be no construction of project facilities or other site preparation or construction activity, <em>except as necessary to complete the evaluations, studies, plans and reports required by this permit or the permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section U0k of the federal Clean Water Act for the construction of this project.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">(Emphasis added.) It also provided that, \u201cAny interest in land acquired after December 14, 2006 and before this permit expires or is reissued shall not be construed as increasing any investment backed expectation that a permit to authorize construction and operation of the reservoir and appurtenant structures will be issued or re-issued in the future.\u201d Finally, it recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">[d]uring the term of this permit, prior to the use of eminent domain by the permittee, property owners shall be offered an opportunity to enter into an option agreement providing the necessary property rights to carry out the plans, studies, and other activities required under permits for the project and containing an acceptable purchase price should the property ultimately be acquired to complete the project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The permittee shall use its best efforts to ensure that King William County provides the same opportunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The new permit was scheduled to expire \u201con December 21, 2010, unless a complete application is submitted by that date. If a complete application for reissuance of the permit is submitted by December 21, 2010, then the permit will expire on December 21, 2012. Such application shall include a final mitigation plan prepared in accordance with ... this permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">CBF filed a request for a formal hearing before the Board. It also filed notice of appeal and then a petition for appeal of the Board\u2019s issuance of the modified permit. In that petition CBF challenged the procedure by which the Board extended the expiration date for the VWP permit as a result of its regularly scheduled meeting of December 14, 2006. CBF sought the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">entry of \u201ca final decree finding that the challenged agency action was not in accordance with the law\u201d; the setting \u201caside [of] the [permit] extension\u201d; and remand to the Board \u201cwith instructions (1) to reinstate its final decision of September 6, 2006 denying the extension to the Permit, (2) to conduct a formal hearing regarding extension of the Permit as requested by both CBF and Newport News; and (3) to comply fully with the mandates of the [APA], the State Water Control Law, and all applicable regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The Commonwealth and the City of Newport News both demurred to CBF\u2019s petition for appeal, contending <em>inter alia </em>that CBF lacked standing to appeal because neither it nor any of its members suffered any harm as a result of the VWP permit extension. They also contended that if any harm did occur, it was not causally related to the restricted permit and was unlikely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Finally, they averred the Board had authority to reconsider its decision and acted consistently with the applicable law and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">CBF, in its memoranda in opposition to the demurrers of the Commonwealth and the City, argued it pleaded sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>facts to establish Article III standing both in a representational capacity and individually for the organization itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">At the motion hearing, the trial judge asked the City why, if the permit did not allow it to build anything, it needed to have the permit period extended. The City responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">That\u2019s a good question, Your Honor.... The permit issued in 1997 had a number of conditions that the City had to satisfy in order to begin construction. Among those are requirements that it do several studies. The studies take a long time, they\u2019re very expensive, but they are an expression from the State Water Control Board of the information it needs to authorize this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">H* H* H* H* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">And this process is continuing with [DEQ] working with the City in performing these studies and determining how they should be done and getting them done. So continuing the permit continues the process.... If the permit expired and there were no more permit, there would be no official statement of what it is the City had to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">Now whether or not the [DEQ] would continue to work with the City, I don\u2019t know. I would hope they would, but certainly while this process is ongoing, there\u2019s a team in place, and if the permit were to expire, there would be no further directive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">... If construction is ever allowed, it will be because some new permit will be granted by the board. We have not even applied for that permit. When we do, [CBF] will participate____ [T]here would be an imminent injury then if we had a permit allowing construction. We don\u2019t now, so there is no imminent injury, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">CBF, in its response, focused on the procedural harm it alleged it had suffered based on the Board\u2019s reconsideration of the permit extension request. The Court recognized that, pursuant to the modified permit, \u201cyou can go out and do borings or studies that we might need in the future,\u201d but said \u201cthat\u2019s all it does, isn\u2019t it?\u201d CBF responded, \u201cThere are a lot of other things____ Part of that permit requires them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>mitigate the harm ... of destroying 400 and some odd acres of wetlands. And so they have to do that by buying county property in other counties and turning that property into wetlands.\u201d The trial judge observed \u201cthey can [acquire property] anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The City then sought to clarify, averring</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">the City could acquire land without any permit from the [Board]. The [Board\u2019s] jurisdiction is over waters of the State, including wetlands. The condition that the board added requires that the City not do any land-disturbing activities in the permit area [and] ... we wouldn\u2019t need the board\u2019s permission to do that except in the creeks that are in there, but because we were agreeing to that, we asked the board to modify that and say except as are necessary to do studies that are required. So we are not going to do things we could not do otherwise. Principally they are archeological studies for Indian artifacts, but they\u2019re not in the creeks. The Indians don\u2019t camp in creeks, they camped next to creeks, but because the board\u2019s condition was so broad, that was added. But your point essentially ... is correct, the things we are going to do, we could have done anyways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The circuit court granted the demurrer, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">Although <em>Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, </em>[278 Va. 564, 576-77,] 643 S.E.2d 219, [225-26] (2007)[,] provides for representational as well as individual standing for environmental groups in similar cases; here, the Appellant can not show that it has suffered an actual or imminent injury by the extension of the King William Reservoir permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">The extension of the permit prohibits the construction or operation of any part of the reservoir and specifically limits the city\u2019s actions to environmental quality and impact studies. As the Appellant\u2019s argument for injury is based on the alteration of the current water flow and environmental impact of building and operating the King William Reser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>voir, the Appellant cannot have suffered injury from the extension of the permit prohibiting these actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>Finding that the Appellant lacks standing, the court need not rule on other aspects of the demurrer.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">It is, therefore, ORDERED that the demurrer is sustained. This matter is dismissed. Appellant\u2019s objections are noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">\u201cA demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded [for the purpose of ruling on the demurrer] .... [T]he facts admitted are those <em>expressly alleged, </em>those which fairly can be viewed as <em>impliedly alleged, </em>and those which may be <em>fairly and justly inferred </em>from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Rosillo v. Winters, </em>235 Va. 268, 270, 367 S.E.2d 717, 717 (1988) (emphases added). A demurrer does not \u201cadmit \u2018inferences or conclusions from facts not stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arlington Yellow Cab v. Transp., Inc., </em>207 Va. 313, 319, 149 S.E.2d 877, 881 (1966) (quoting 71 C.J.S. <em>Pleading </em>\u00a7 261, at 528, 529). A demurrer also \u201cdoes not admit the correctness of the pleader\u2019s conclusions of law. [Its] function ... is to test the legal sufficiency of the facts. Because our review of a circuit court\u2019s decision sustaining a demurrer addresses that same legal question, we review the circuit court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Stumpy Lake, </em>46 Va.App. at 110-11, 616 S.E.2d at 42 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Our resolution of this appeal turns on whether CBF pleaded sufficient facts to demonstrate it had standing\u2014in either an individual capacity, a representational capacity, or both capacities\u2014to challenge the Board\u2019s issuance of the VWP permit extension to the City of Newport News.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">\u201cA plaintiff has standing to institute a ... proceeding if it has a \u2018justiciable interest\u2019 in the subject matter of the proceeding, <em>either in its own right or in a representative </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>capacity. </em>In order to have a \u2018justiciable interest\u2019 in a proceeding, the plaintiff must demonstrate an actual controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, such that his rights will be affected by the outcome of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 616 S.E.2d at 47 (quoting <em>W.S.

A person shall be deemed to meet such standard if (i) such person has suffered an actual or imminent injury which is an invasion of a legally protected interest and which is concrete and particularized; (ii) such injury is fairly traceable to the decision of the Board and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court; and (iii) such injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">In order for CBF to plead sufficient facts to establish standing to sue in its own right, it must meet this three-part test. \u201cWhile each of the three prongs of standing should be analyzed distinctly, their proof often overlaps.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. [(FOE)] v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.2000) (reversing dismissal, following six-day bench trial, for lack of standing based on a \u201cholding that none of plaintiffs\u2019 members had shown injury in fact\u201d). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>trial court ruled that CBF failed to allege sufficient facts to establish prong (i)\u2014an imminent injury from the issuance of the modified permit\u2014and, thus, that it lacked standing to pursue this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\n<em>1. Injury in Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The injury alleged to support a claim of standing must be both (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, thereby \u201cprecluding] those with merely generalized grievances from bringing suit to vindicate an interest common to the entire public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156. Such an injury may be to the plaintiffs economic interests, but it may also be to the plaintiffs \u201caesthetic or recreational interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. \u201cAesthetic and environmental well-being, like economic well-being, are important ingredients of the quality of life in our society, and the fact that particular environmental interests are shared by the many rather than the few does not make them less deserving of legal protection through the judicial process\u201d as long as \u201cthe party seeking review [is] himself among the injured.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v.

Thus, \u201cenvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons \u2018for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened\u2019 by the challenged activity.\u201d <em>FOE v.

Further, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has consistently recognized that threatened rather than actual injury can satisfy Article III standing requirements. \u2018One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.

Although CBF alleged <em>in part </em>that it would be injured by what the trial court summarized as the \u201calteration of the current water flow\u201d and \u201cenvironmental impact of [actually] building and operating\u201d the reservoir because the project would, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cdestr[oy] ... natural resources in and along the affected rivers\u201d or \u201cimpair[ ] the aesthetic value of the rivers as an educational resource,\u201d it also alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-4\">16.

The modified permit also provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">there shall be no construction of project facilities or other site preparation or construction activity, except as necessary to complete the evaluations, studies, plans and reports required by this permit or the permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act for the construction of this project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Thus, the permit expressly allows \u201csite preparation or construction activity ... as necessary to complete the [various] evaluations, studies, plans and reports <em>required by [the VWP permit],\u201d </em>and the petition sufficiently alleges CBF will suffer an imminent injury because these activities will \u201cdestr[oy] ... natural resources in and along the affected rivers\u201d or \u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>pair[] the aesthetic value of the rivers as an educational resource.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">In addition, documents filed by the City in conjunction with a statement that the documents were key to an understanding of CBF\u2019s petition indicate that the Army Corps of Engineers had rendered a decision that the project would \u201ccause flooding or excavation of 115 [archeological] sites, 79 of which were recommended ... for further study.\u201d The City conceded in argument that it was required to conduct such archeological studies and that the studies would be conducted adjacent to the existing creeks involved in the reservoir project because \u201c[t]he Indians ... camped next to creeks.\u201d Thus, the petition and related exhibits also permit the inference of an allegation that the archeological excavating required by the federal \u00a7 404 permit and allowed by the VWP permit also would \u201cdestr[oy] ... natural resources in and along the affected rivers\u201d or \u201cimpair[] the aesthetic value of the rivers as an educational resource.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\n<em>2.

As the Supreme Court explained in earlier proceedings involving this same permit, the fact that the Army Corps of Engineers may be the ultimate \u201cpermitting authority\u201d for the reservoir project does not sever the causal connection between the issuance of the state permit and the activities permitted or required under the federal permit. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 541 S.E.2d at 925.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The federal [Clean Water] Act requires the state \u00a7 401 certification to ensure that the proposed activity will meet state water quality standards and applicable effluent limitations. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1).

As discussed <em>swpra </em>in Part II.A.1, although the City may have been <em>authorized </em>to excavate even if the specific state and federal reservoir permits were not extended or renewed, the nonrenewal of the VWP permit would decrease the likelihood that the City would conduct such excavations, and therefore, nonrenewal would provide some measure of protection for CBF from the \u201cdestruction of natural resources in and along the affected rivers\u201d or \u201cimpair[ment of] the aesthetic value of the rivers as an educational resource.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">\n<em>3.

This benefit need not be monetary to be sufficiently tangible. <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 185-87, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>S.Ct. at 706-07, 145 L.Ed.2d at 629-31. Also, the benefit need not remedy the entire harm; \u201cas long as the relief CBF seeks would redress the part of the harm caused by the [defendant], that harm is, in fact, redressable to the extent required to demonstrate standing.\u201d <em>CBF, </em>48 Va.App. at 52, 628 S.E.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Here, CBF asks us to set aside the modified permit and remand to the Board for a formal hearing on the City\u2019s request for issuance of a modified permit. A ruling that the modified VWP permit should not have been issued without sufficient process would redress CBF\u2019s claim that issuance of the permit allowing site preparation and construction as necessary to perform the enumerated studies exposes it to a risk of harm from the \u201cdestruction of natural resources in and along the affected rivers\u201d or \u201cimpairfment of] the aesthetic value of the rivers as an educational resource.\u201d As discussed above, although the Board\u2019s act of revoking the \u00a7 401 permit, like the preparation of the environmental impact statement in <em>Lemon, </em>would not \u201c \u2018force\u2019 \u201d revocation of the federal \u00a7 404 permit, it would be a factor for consideration by the federal permitting authority, the Army Corps of Engineers, in determining whether it, too, should revoke or modify the related federal permit. <em>See Lemon, </em>514 F.3d at 1315. Further, although the City was free to purchase land without the VWP permit extension, may have been able to exercise its condemnation powers, and may have been authorized by separate federal and state permits to conduct the archaeological excavations at issue, appellees conceded the City would have been much less likely to engage in those activities if the VWP permit extension had not been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Thus, CBF has alleged sufficient facts to satisfy all three prongs of the test for individual standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">REPRESENTATIONAL STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">\u201c[A]n association has Article III standing to sue on behalf of its members when \u2018(a) its members would otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stumpy Lake, </em>46 Va.App. at 114, 616 S.E.2d at 44 (quoting <em>Hunt v.

Further, \u201cthreatened rather than actual injury can satisfy Article III standing requirements. \u2018One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160 (quoting <em>Babbitt, </em>442 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>U.S. at 298, 99 S.Ct. at 2308, 60 L.Ed.2d at 906 (internal quotation marks omitted)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Here, CBF\u2019s petition alleged that some of its members are \u201caffected individually by the <em>extension </em>of this permit\u201d because they \u201cboat, bird watch, fish, and otherwise recreate in the rivers and surrounding areas that would be harmed by the activities authorized by the Permit\u201d and, thus, that these members\u2019 \u201crecreational and aesthetic interests ... will be harmed ... by the <em>modified </em>Permit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As discussed above, the petition alleges that \u201c[t]he modified permit does not avoid the potential for harm to CBF or its members because it allows Newport News to undertake activities during the extended permit period that will further construction of the reservoir.\u201d The modified permit, like the original permit, expressly requires the completion of several studies and plans, including a habitat evaluation procedure study, a detailed final wetland mitigation plan, an ecomonitoring plan to include fish spawning and nursery grounds and vegetative composition and distribution, and a salinity monitoring plan. The modified permit, unlike the original permit, expressly recognizes the City may need either to acquire a right of access to property necessary \u201cto carry out the plans, studies, and other activities required under permits for the project\u201d or to purchase or condemn that property. The modified permit also provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE6\">there shall be no construction of project facilities or other site preparation or construction activity, <em>except as necessary to complete the evaluations, studies, plans and reports required by this permit or the permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section of the federal Clean Water Act for the construction of this project.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Thus, the permit expressly allows \u201csite preparation or construction activity ... as necessary to complete the [various] evaluations, studies, plans and reports <em>required by [the VWP permit]\u201d </em>and the petition, viewed in the light most favorable to CBF, supports an inference that the permit\u2019s existence, although not necessary for the exercise of eminent domain, makes the City\u2019s use of eminent domain more likely. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>language in the petition and the reasonable inferences from that language sufficiently allege the activities allowed by the modified permit will harm the recreational and aesthetic interests of some of CBF\u2019s members, who boat, bird watch, fish, and otherwise recreate in the rivers and surrounding areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In addition, the documents filed by the City to supplement the petition indicate that the Army Corps of Engineers had rendered a decision that the project would \u201ccause flooding or excavation of 115 [archeological] sites, 79 of which were recommended ... for further study.\u201d The City conceded in argument that it was required to conduct such archeological studies and that the studies would be conducted adjacent to the existing creeks involved in the reservoir project because \u201c[t]he Indians ... camped next to creeks.\u201d It argued, however, that the excavation was separately authorized by a different type of federal permit. As discussed <em>supra </em>in Part II.A.2 and 3, although the City may have been <em>authorized </em>to excavate even if the specific state and federal reservoir permits were not extended or renewed, the nonrenewal of the VWP permit would decrease the likelihood that the City would conduct such excavations, and therefore, nonrenewal would provide some measure of protection for the recreational and aesthetic interests of CBF\u2019s members who boat, bird watch, fish, and otherwise recreate in the rivers and surrounding areas to be affected by activity authorized by the modified permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Thus, the petition and related exhibits also permit the inference of an allegation that the studies required by the VWP permit and the archeological excavating required by the federal permit and allowed by the VWP permit pose a concrete, imminent harm that is both causally related to issuance of the VWP permit and likely to be redressed by the nonrenewal of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\n<em>(2) and (3) Nature of Interests and Requested Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Appellees do not expressly challenge parts (b) and (c) of the representational standing test, which require that \u201c(b) the interests [the organization] seeks to protect are germane to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>[its] purpose[ ] and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Stumpy Lake, </em>46 Va.App. at 114, 616 S.E.2d at 44 (quoting <em>Hunt, </em>432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d at 394).
