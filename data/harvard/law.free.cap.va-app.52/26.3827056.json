At his sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth presented written statements from victims stating their opinion on the value of the property stolen by Smith. On appeal, Smith argues that the sentencing court erred by relying on these statements in setting the amount of restitution. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">During a three-month crime spree, Smith burglarized multiple homes and stole various items of personal property from homeowners. He pled guilty to twenty-one burglary and larceny offenses in exchange for the <em>nolle prosequi </em>dismissal of nine additional charges. Prior to the sentencing hearing, the Assistant Commonwealth Attorney asked the victims to estimate the value of their stolen property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Many of the victims provided this information. Victim loss statements were prepared for each of the participating victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The probation officer also prepared a presentence report identifying the victims, their addresses, and the specific items stolen from each. The presentence report recommended a restitution plan requiring monthly payments. Attached to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>presentence report was a single loss statement seeking $7,794.30 in restitution for one of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">At the start of the sentencing hearing, the court noted that it had been provided a presentence report and an \u201cattached victim witness impact statement and restitution amount\u201d seeking $7,794.30. The Assistant Commonwealth Attorney advised the court that she had submitted a \u201cpacket\u201d of additional victim loss statements and requested $27,256.57 in total restitution. The court found the \u201cpacket\u201d in the court\u2019s file. The \u201cpacket\u201d contained a cover letter, a loss itemization for the victims seeking restitution, and fourteen victim loss statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Smith\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the presentence report, its attached victim loss statement, and the \u201cpacket\u201d of additional statements had been provided to him \u201cwell in advance\u201d of the sentencing hearing. \u201cMy only concern,\u201d Smith\u2019s counsel stated, was the amount and method of calculating the restitution. Counsel noted that the restitution value placed on some of the items could be new-for-old replacement value. \u201cI just don\u2019t know simply by looking at the list if that\u2019s an actual amount of restitution,\u201d counsel argued, \u201cand that\u2019s my only point on that, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The Assistant Commonwealth Attorney proffered to the court that her office prepared the victim loss statements based upon information provided directly from the victims. \u201c[T]he victims in each individual case were asked the amount, the value of the items at the time that they were stolen. And that\u2019s the information that was provided before the court and we would ask the court to accept the restitution amounts.\u201d The Assistant Commonwealth Attorney added that she provided the victim loss statements to Smith\u2019s counsel prior to the sentencing hearing, thus giving him an opportunity to present evidence or witnesses to contest the restitution values claimed by the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Relying on the presentence report and the victim loss statements, the sentencing court found the amounts reasonable and ordered Smith to cooperate with a restitution plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>coordinated by the probation officer. The court then reduced the term of Smith\u2019s active incarceration to give him an opportunity to get a quick start on reimbursing the victims for their losses. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why I\u2019m going with the lower end of the guidelines,\u201d the judge explained, \u201cbecause I do want him to get out to start repaying these individuals because that would help with their peace of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">After the court ruled, Smith\u2019s counsel again objected to the restitution amount because the victims did not specify their method of valuation. Before imposing the restitution itemized in the victim loss statements, counsel argued, the court should conduct a \u201cformal hearing\u201d in which the victims can testify and be subject to cross-examination. The sentencing court rejected Smith\u2019s argument, stating: \u201cWe had that hearing today____I accept this list. This is the amount. This is the evidence that I\u2019m basing it on.... \u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">On appeal, Smith argues the sentencing court erred by ordering restitution based on the victim loss statements. These statements, Smith contends, should have been disregarded as hearsay proffers of out-of-court declarants who could not be cross-examined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">A sentencing hearing before a judge is not a criminal trial. When exercising the wide discretion inherent in sentencing, a judge should \u201cnot be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.\u201d <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). For this reason, the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>against hearsay does not apply to sentencing hearings. <em>See Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 136, 142, 554 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2001); <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 258, 450 S.E.2d 765, 768 (1994); <em>see also </em>6 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 26.5(a), at 802 (3d ed.2007) (observing that \u201cthe sentencing court can consider other types of hearsay, whether contained in the presentence report or offered by the prosecution or defense\u201d). A sentencing court, therefore, may consider hearsay \u201cto establish an appropriate amount of restitution.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 811, 816, 568 S.E.2d 449, 451 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Given the narrow focus of a sentencing hearing, the defendant\u2019s inability to cross-examine a hearsay declarant does not undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">[Ojnce the guilt of the accused has been properly established, the sentencing judge, in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed, <em>is not restricted to evidence derived from the examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court </em>but may, consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, consider <em>responsible unsworn or \u201cout-of-court\u201d information relative to the circumstances of the crime </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\"><em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S.Ct. 421, 426, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959) (emphasis added) (quoted in <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 794, 807, 497 S.E.2d 165, 171 (1998)). This principle has deep historical roots:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">Tribunals passing on the guilt of a defendant always have been hedged in by strict evidentiary procedural limitations. But both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\"><em>McClain v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 847, 859-60, 55 S.E.2d 49, 55 (1949) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>337 U.S. at 246, 69 S.Ct. at 1082). \u201cThis broad rule of inclusion is tempered by the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that the information bear some indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 302, 498 S.E.2d 451, 456 (1998) (citing <em>Alger, </em>19 Va.App. at 258, 450 S.E.2d at 768).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The question we must answer, then, is whether the victim loss statements could be considered \u201cresponsible unsworn or \u2018out-of-court\u2019 information relative to the circumstances of the crime,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>358 U.S. at 584, 79 S.Ct. at 426, bearing sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d <em>Alger, </em>19 Va.App. at 258, 450 S.E.2d at 768 (citation omitted), to be considered by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We think the answer can be found in <em>Harris, </em>26 Va.App. at 794, 497 S.E.2d at 165. In that case, a prosecutor proffered to a sentencing court evidence presented by several witnesses against the defendant in another case involving an unrelated, pending charge. The defendant objected to the proffer because it was not \u201cadmissible testimony\u201d at the sentencing hearing and because permitting the proffer effectively deprived him of any \u201copportunity to confront and cross-examine those witnesses during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809, 497 S.E.2d at 172. We disagreed and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Consistent with due process, a sentencing court \u201cis not restricted to evidence derived from the examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court\u201d and is permitted to consider <em>\u201cresponsible unsworn </em>or \u2018out-of-court\u2019 <em>information </em>relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d <em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. at 584, 79 S.Ct. at 426 (emphasis added)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\"><em>tfc </em>\u00edfc <em>% </em>ifc ^ \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">Although appellant argued that the witnesses at this trial were not credible, he did not disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations regarding the substance of their testimony and the other evidence at the trial. As such, we cannot say the trial court violated the Due Process Clause when it chose to rely upon the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>attorney\u2019s \u201cresponsible unsworn\u201d proffer regarding this evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 588-84, 79 S.Ct. at 426 (holding that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s statement of the details of the crime and of the defendant\u2019s criminal record at a sentencing hearing following a guilty plea did not \u201cdeprive [the defendant] of fundamental fairness <em>or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 809-10, 497 S.E.2d at 172-73 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">For the same reasons, we hold the sentencing court did not err by relying on the victim loss statements and fashioning a restitution award based upon them. The Assistant Commonwealth Attorney advised the court that \u201cthe victims in each individual case were asked the amount, the value of the items at the time that they were stolen.\u201d The victim loss statements reported their answers. Smith did not challenge the factual accuracy of the proffer. Nor did he present any evidence contradicting the valuations or, for that matter, make any effort to compel the victims to take the stand and submit to cross-examination as adverse witnesses. Smith had an adequate opportunity to do so, having received the statements well in advance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In short, a sentencing court, \u201cin determining the appropriate amount of restitution, may consider hearsay evidence that bears \u2018minimal indicia of reliability* so long as the defendant is given an opportunity to refute that evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bourne, </em>130 F.3d 1444, 1447 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smith had that opportunity and did not take advantage of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Because the sentencing court did not err by relying on the victim loss statements to determine a reasonable amount of restitution, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-11\">.
