Jenkins (Jenkins or employer) appeals a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarding benefits to Timothy Sterling Webb (claimant). Jenkins contends the commission erred in (1) finding claimant proved he sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment on November 25, 2003; and (2) rejecting the deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility determinations. For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">At the October 2, 2006 hearing before the deputy commissioner, the parties stipulated that, on November 25, 2003, claimant fell from a tree while in the course of his employment with Jenkins, whose business involves trimming and felling trees. Claimant sustained fractures to his back, ribs, and sternum.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Jenkins defended the claim on the basis that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because he regularly employed fewer than three employees at the time of claimant\u2019s injury. Employer further averred that claimant was an independent contractor, not an employee, at the time of his injury and that his average weekly wages were $500. The Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund adopted the same defenses and \u201cfurther aver[red] that the claimant carri[ed] the burden of proving all the essential elements of his claim.\u201d <em>See </em>Deputy Commissioner\u2019s November 1, 2006 Opinion, p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">At the hearing, claimant described the accident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3_\">Me and [Jenkins] was on a job site and around in the back of a house, and [sic] told me to take the hickory tree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>down, so I got up in the there and was taking it down. It had one limb left. Took part of that off. Come back to the back of the tree, rested. And the next thing I know, my rope snapped and that was it. I don\u2019t remember---- I remember hitting the ground and looking up at [Jenkins] and Ernesto and telling them that my ribs were broke, but I never knew that I had fractured my back----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Jenkins described claimant\u2019s accident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">I was right at the base of the tree. [Claimant] was up in the tree, took the limb off of the tree, come back to the base of the tree____ He said, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m having f-g problems at home, I\u2019m coming down. I said, come on down. He come down out the tree, got high as the deck. He took a chainsaw and wiped his rope in two and dropped himself to the ground. Then he said, now, call my wife\u2014I mean my girlfriend. He said, me and my girlfriend is having trouble today. She\u2019s going to leave and I want to call her. I said okay. That\u2019s what we done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">In explaining further how the accident occurred, Jenkins stated that claimant came halfway down the tree, cut the rope that was securing him to the tree with the chainsaw, and dropped to the ground from a distance of about thirty feet in the air. Jenkins contended claimant told the rescue squad personnel that he had cut his rope with the chainsaw. Jenkins testified that claimant told him he cut the rope because his girlfriend was going to leave him. Jenkins\u2019 business was not insured for workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Claimant\u2019s physicians, Drs. Bothwell G. Lee and Benjamin F. Allen, both noted a history of claimant falling. Dr. Lee noted claimant fell onto the ground from a distance of twenty feet. Dr. Allen noted claimant fell from a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">In denying the claim, the deputy commissioner noted that the claimant did not attempt to rebut Jenkins\u2019 testimony. The deputy commissioner also recognized that employer\u2019s evidence constituted an affirmative defense based on self-inflicted injury under Code \u00a7 65.2-306. However, while acknowledging that the statute precludes the defense in the absence of pleading it and prior notice of the intent to mount it, the deputy commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>sioner admitted and considered the self-inflicted injury evidence and denied the claim based on his reading of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Anderson v. East Coast Fish &amp; Scallop Co., Inc., </em>10 Va.App. 215, 391 S.E.2d 347 (1990). In reaching his decision, the deputy commissioner noted having \u201csignificant reservations about the credibility of both the claimant and Jenkins.\u201d Notwithstanding any reservations regarding both parties\u2019 credibility and, ostensibly crediting both, the deputy commissioner found the evidence established two possible causes of claimant\u2019s injury; one, as claimant testified, was the result of the accidental snapping of the safety rope which secured him while descending from the tree, the other, as employer testified, was the result of claimant\u2019s deliberate severing of the rope. On that ground, the deputy commissioner found that claimant failed to carry his burden of proof, citing <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 505, 339 S.E.2d 916, 917 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On review, the commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">By statute [Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B) ], employer bore the burden of proof of the affirmative defense of self-inflicted injury and by Commission rule [Rule 1.10] also had the duty to inform the claimant and the Commission of this defense at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Although this claim had been pending for more than two years, the employer failed to file notice of the employer\u2019s affirmative defense of self-inflicted injury. Because the employer did not comply with the requirement to provide notice of a willful misconduct defense, the only description of the accident before the Deputy Commissioner was that of the claimant. To find otherwise is to obviate the employer\u2019s burden to prove misconduct. The only evidence properly before the Deputy Commissioner is that the rope broke and the claimant fell from a height of twenty to thirty feet. The claimant has therefore established the compensability of his accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>On appeal to this Court, Jenkins asserts that, notwithstanding his failure to comply with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B) and Rule 1.10, the deputy commissioner had the authority, as well as the duty, to weigh all the admitted evidence, including Jenkins\u2019 testimony establishing that claimant\u2019s injury was self-inflicted and not an accident, because claimant did not object to Jenkins\u2019 testimony at the hearing or offer evidence in rebuttal. Jenkins cites <em>Anderson </em>for the proposition that the testimony is admissible when no notice is given. Jenkins further argues that, while the commission\u2019s factual findings are ordinarily binding on this Court, that rule does not apply in this case because, in finding that Jenkins\u2019 testimony was barred from the deputy commissioner\u2019s consideration under Rule 1.10, the commission, in effect, arbitrarily and improperly rejected the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination that Jenkins\u2019 testimony was credible. We find no merit in either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Employer does not dispute that it failed to give the required notice under Rule 1.10. Under Rules 2.2 and 3.1, we hold that claimant\u2019s failure to object to Jenkins\u2019 testimony at the hearing did not prevent the commission from applying Rule 1.10 in its review of this case. We, therefore, conclude that the commission\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>exercise of its authority to correct any error or decision on review deemed necessary for a just determination of the issues was not an abuse of discretion under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u201cThe commission\u2019s authority to make rules [not inconsistent with the Act] for carrying out the provisions of the Act is statutory and long standing.\u201d <em>Lowes of Short Pump, Va. v. Campbell, </em>38 Va.App. 55, 59, 561 S.E.2d 757, 759 (2002); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-201. \u201cWhen a challenge is made to the commission\u2019s construction of its rules, \u2018our review is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>a determination whether the commission\u2019s interpretation of its own rule was reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Specialty Auto Body v. Cook, </em>14 Va.App. 327, 330, 416 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1992) (quoting <em>Classic Floors, Inc. v. Guy, </em>9 Va.App. 90, 93, 383 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1989)). \u201cThe commission\u2019s interpretation will be accorded great deference and will not be set aside unless arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129 n. 2, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 n. 2 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Pursuant to the statutory authority granted it, the commission promulgated Rule 2.2, which provides that \u201c[e]xcept for rules which the Commission promulgates, it is not bound by statutory or common law rules of pleading or evidence nor by technical rules of practice.\u201d Ya. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Rule 2.2. Rule 3.1 promulgated by the commission allows that \u201c[t]he commission may ... on its own motion, address any error and correct any decision on review if such action is considered to be necessary for a just determination of the issues.\u201d Rule 1.12 sets forth methods by which the commission may enforce the Act and its rules, expressly allowing the Commission in the exercise of its discretion to act <em>sua sponte </em>to exclude evidence from the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission also promulgated Rule 1.10, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">If the employer intends to rely upon a defense under \u00a7 65.2-306 of the Act, it shall give to the employee and file with the Commission no less than 15 days prior to the hearing, a notice of its intent to make such defense together with a statement of the particular act relied upon as showing willful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In addition, Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B), which provides that no compensation shall be allowed for injury or death caused by an employee\u2019s willful misconduct or intentional self-inflicted injury, places the burden of proof upon the person or entity asserting an affirmative defense under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Employer offered no excuse or explanation for its failure to comply \"with the notice requirements of Rule 1.10. The record shows that claimant first filed his claim on January 13, 2004, which was dismissed without prejudice. He filed another claim on September 22, 2004, and amended that claim on April 12, 2005. In all three claims, claimant alleged he fell about thirty-five feet from a tree. The sole purpose of Jenkins\u2019 testimony at the October 2, 2006 hearing, without respect to the jurisdictional issue, was to refute claimant\u2019s testimony and show the injury was self-inflicted. Jenkins\u2019 testimony constituted the sole contradiction to claimant\u2019s version of the accident and the employer\u2019s sole challenge to the compensability of the claim. Yet, employer never asserted a self-inflicted injury defense under Code \u00a7 65.2-306. The failure to give proper notice deprived the claimant of the opportunity to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence in response to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Employer\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Anderson </em>to support his argument that evidence establishing a self-inflicted injury was properly admitted and considered by the deputy commissioner in this case is misplaced. In <em>Anderson, </em>the claimant\u2019s own evidence failed to establish any basis for finding merit in his claim that he had sustained a compensable injury by accident. Anderson gave two accounts of how he had sustained a wound to his face from a twelve-gauge shotgun found at the scene. <em>Anderson, </em>10 Va.App. at 216, 391 S.E.2d at 348. Anderson initially told police he had been attacked and shot by two intruders. <em>Id. </em>Later, he recanted, and stated that he had propped the gun in a corner of the room, stood on a table to fix a flickering light bulb, and accidentally fell on the shotgun, discharging it. <em>Id. </em>The commission in <em>Anderson </em>affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the record contained \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>persuasive evidence which can form the basis for an award of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 391 S.E.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">On appeal, this Court affirmed the commission in <em>Anderson, </em>finding that the commission did not err in considering the employer\u2019s evidence of self-inflicted injury, even though the employer had failed to give the required notice pursuant to Rule 4 (now Rule 1.10). <em>Id. </em>at 217, 391 S.E.2d at 349. Focusing first on claimant\u2019s prima facie case and citing to <em>Massie v. Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922), we held that Anderson had failed to establish a meritorious claim in that he had \u201crepudiated his initial account of assault.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>10 Va.App. at 217, 391 S.E.2d at 349. We then addressed whether the commission erred in considering evidence of self-inflicted injury, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s failure to give notice pursuant to Rule 4 (now Rule 1.10). Finding that notice pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-38 and Rule 4 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-306 and Rule 1.10) is required only \u201cif the employer intends to interpose an affirmative defense to bar an otherwise meritorious claim,\u201d we held that the commission did not err in considering the defense, because, as claimant\u2019s evidence showed, he had failed to establish a meritorious claim. <em>Anderson, </em>10 Va.App. at 217, 391 S.E.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Applying the <em>Anderson </em>analysis to the facts of this case and focusing only on claimant\u2019s prima facie evidence to determine whether he established a meritorious claim, the commission properly found that claimant\u2019s evidence established an injury by accident. There were no inconsistencies in claimant\u2019s testimony and the deputy commissioner did not reject it as lacking credibility, his expressed reservations notwithstanding. Indeed, the deputy commissioner\u2019s subsequent invocation of the rule involving a situation where the injury could have resulted from one or more causes supports the conclusion that claimant\u2019s testimony was not rejected. A credible claim having been established, under the holding in <em>Anderson, </em>evidence of self-inflicted injury could only be admitted to contradict the claim upon notice that the defense would be raised. That notice was not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Under these circumstances, we hold that the commission did not abuse its discretion in applying its rules to exclude consideration of Jenkins\u2019 testimony, leaving only claimant\u2019s explanation of how the injury occurred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claimant\u2019s testimony, being the sole evidence remaining in the case, supports the commission\u2019s finding that he sustained his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. The commission also ruled that Jenkins\u2019 tree cutting business employed three or more persons at the time of claimant\u2019s accident, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>invoking the commission\u2019s jurisdiction, and that claimant was an employee not an independent contractor. The parties have not appealed those findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. Rule 1.12 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In addition to the statutory authority of the Commission to levy fines, to assess attorney fees and punish contempt, the commission may enforce its rules and the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act upon motion of a party, or upon its own motion, after giving a party or other interested person the opportunity to be heard, by imposition of the following sanctions:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">A. Rejection of a pleading including, but not limited to, all or part of a claim and grounds of defense;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">B. Exclusion of evidence from the record;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">C. Dismissal of a claim or application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-15\">. Because we conclude that Jenkins\u2019 testimony was, as a matter of law, precluded from the deputy commissioner\u2019s consideration, its credibility was not at issue. Therefore, Jenkins' contention that the commission arbitrarily and erroneously rejected the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination that Jenkins\u2019 testimony was credible is moot, as Jenkins\u2019 testimony was properly excluded from the consideration. Moreover, a close review of the record shows that, contrary to employer\u2019s assertion during oral argument that the deputy commissioner adopted Jenkins\u2019 testimony, the deputy commissioner, in fact, never expressly accepted Jenkins\u2019 testimony over claimant\u2019s testimony, but rather, the deputy commissioner expressed his reservations about both witnesses' credibility and then applied the rule enunciated in <em>Crisp, </em>1 Va.App. at 505-06, 339 S.E.2d at 917 (citing <em>King\u2019s Market v. Porter, </em>227 Va. 478, 484, 317 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
