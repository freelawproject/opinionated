Boone appeal a circuit court order vacating a VMRC pier permit under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq. </em>Agreeing with the VMRC and Boone that the court exceeded its authority in doing so, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">In 2008, Hurricane Isabel destroyed the Harrison Fishing Pier. Boone rebuilt the pier pursuant to special permits authorized by executive order expediting the return of impacted areas and structures to pre-Hurricane Isabel condition. About a third of the way down the 1,490-foot pier, Boone added a restaurant, gameroom, bar, and an upper deck area on the roof of the restaurant with a railing and gazebo. These structures were authorized by VMRC permits. While building the approved structures, Boone also constructed an unapproved 10-by-27% foot structure on the upper deck to serve as an outdoor bar and catering station as well as a place where he could do office work. Seven swivel chairs were installed in front of the bar counter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>When VMRC officers pointed out to Boone that his prior permits did not include this particular upper deck bar structure, Boone filed a request for an after-the-fact permit with the VMRC. At the VMRC hearing, Boone presented his plans for the pier and the upper deck, noted his considerable ($2.5 million) investment in the rebuilding effort, and apologized for not securing an amendment to his earlier permits prior to constructing the upper deck bar structure. Boone also presented other witnesses vouching for the public benefits of the pier generally and for Boone personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The Mayor of the City of Norfolk, Paul Fraim, appeared at the VMRC hearing but had to leave prior to being able to speak. Boone\u2019s counsel advised the VMRC that Mayor Fraim authorized him to proffer the mayor\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Mayor Fraim indicated that he wished to tell this commission that the City Council held extensive public hearings before enacting the ordinances that authorized the conditional use permits that would allow them to have these facilities on the pier\u2014the restaurant, etc.; that they also consider this an important part of the revitalization of the Willoughby section of Ocean View in the City of Norfolk; that at no time during their consideration did they believe that this structure that\u2019s in question that\u2019s on top was anything other than an entertainment structure. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve always known it would be and always believed it would be a catering and entertainment facility. They, the City Council unanimously approved the project by passing the ordinances allowing the conditional use permits and the Mayor believes that this facility would greatly enhance the ability of the citizens of Norfolk and the rest of the state to enjoy the Chesapeake Bay by being able to have a place where they can sit on this pier, where they can\u2014it\u2019s open to the public\u2014anybody that wants to come in\u2014it\u2019s a restaurant, it\u2019s licensed by the ABC Board, it\u2019s also available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>renting out for private functions to anybody that wants to do that, for weddings, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Two citizens appeared at the VMRC hearing objecting to Boone\u2019s pier rebuilding effort. Sarah Harrison, the appellee in these consolidated cases, said she lived about ten houses down the shoreline west of the pier. Though difficult to follow, her presentation included complaints about the decisions of the Norfolk Planning Commission, the Norfolk City Council, and the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board\u2014 all of which approved various permits requested by Boone. Harrison also claimed the VMRC \u201cmay have been deceived\u201d by Boone during the permitting process as to his ultimate intentions for the rebuilt pier. She similarly questioned Boone\u2019s plans to develop other parcels along the Ocean View shoreline.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Harrison also noted that Boone intended to use the pier for \u201cdining, dancing, live bands and an arcade.\u201d The old pier, she said, housed only a bait and snack shop. Harrison also objected to the noise that she anticipated from Boone\u2019s intended uses for the upper deck. She presented to the commission a \u201cDVD of the sound testing\u201d Boone performed prior to his son\u2019s wedding reception on the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Early in her remarks, Harrison said she \u201cwould like to submit evidence for the record\u201d and then, throughout her testimony, referred to various documents. Among these were photographs of the former Harrison Fishing Pier, materials copied from the VMRC file, advertisements by the City of Norfolk, materials submitted to the Norfolk Planning Commission and Norfolk City Council, transcript pages from the hearing before the ABC Board, and the like. After she finished speaking, the VMRC chairman advised Harrison to provide these documents to the VMRC staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In reply to Harrison\u2019s testimony, Boone explained the differences between the earlier construction plans and the structures ultimately constructed on the pier. He acknowledged having an ownership interest in nearby properties and insisted that he had \u201cnever given any kind of false information\u201d at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>time during the permitting process for the rebuilt pier. As for the sound recording, Boone said it merely recorded a \u201csound test\u201d he performed with \u201clarger speakers\u201d in order to \u201cmake sure that it was not loud out there.\u201d In non-test conditions, Boone suggested, he would be using smaller speakers. The VMRC chairman interrupted Boone at that point stating, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The other objector, Benny LeBon, added a complaint not mentioned by Harrison. Living \u201cjust down the street from the pier,\u201d LeBon said that when he gets up at the crack of dawn he could not see the sunrise \u201cuntil the sun gets over top of the building\u2014it\u2019s right directly in my path when the sun comes up.\u201d He thought other waterfront residents would have the same problem. Like Harrison, LeBon objected to the \u201crestaurant, dancing, dining, and so forth\u201d on the pier. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a place for people to go fish,\u201d LeBon concluded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure fine dining and dancing is what we\u2019re thinking about for the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The VMRC commissioners then proceeded to discuss the issue before it: whether to grant the after-the-fact permit for, <em>inter alia, </em>the outdoor bar added by Boone to the already approved upper deck. The commissioners talked about various aspects of the issue. Several voiced concerns about the use of the upper deck structure as a bar instead of a catering operation. Another stated he thought some of the citizen complaints, including concerns over \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cnature of the activities,\u201d were beyond the VMRC\u2019s jurisdiction but were at any rate addressed by restrictive conditions adopted by the City of Norfolk in its special-use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">One commissioner noted that the upper deck bar would enhance Boone\u2019s ability to recoup the $2.5 million capital outlay for the pier rebuilding effort. Another commented on the \u201chuge decrease in public access to the water\u201d and the inability of pier owners to rebuild because of the costs. Boone\u2019s upgraded pier, this commissioner noted, was an \u201cenormous project\u201d that gave the \u201cpublic access to the water which is so sorely needed.\u201d Another commissioner agreed: \u201cAccess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>to the use of the water and enjoyment of the scenery of the water is overwhelming to me in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The VMRC chairman put the matter to a vote. The commissioners unanimously voted to issue the after-the-fact permit. They imposed on Boone, however, a $10,000 fine for not obtaining the permit prior to constructing the upper deck bar. Dissatisfied with this decision, Harrison filed a petition for appeal to the circuit court under VAPA. The circuit court vacated the VMRC\u2019s grant of Boone\u2019s permit, ordered Boone to dismantle the upper deck bar, and awarded Harrison $9,413 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The circuit court rested its ruling on three alternative grounds. It first held that the VMRC violated Harrison\u2019s due process rights by failing to consider her written exhibits. The court next ruled the VMRC failed to consider the statutory factors outlined in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A). Finally, the court conducted its own review of the \u201cpublic trust doctrine\u201d and concluded the evidence before the VMRC did not support its decision to authorize Boone\u2019s upper deck, outdoor bar. Boone and the VMRC filed unsuccessful motions to reconsider. The circuit court entered a final order declaring the permit \u201cnull and void\u201d and ordering the removal of the upper deck bar structure within 90 days. Boone and the VMRC obtained a stay of the judgment and appealed to us contending the circuit court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">A. <em>VAPA &amp; The Limited Nature of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Under VAPA, the circuit court reviews the agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201cequivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality ex rel. State Water Control Bd., </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 676 (2004) (citations omitted), af<em>f'd sub nom., Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality ex rel. State Water Control Bd., </em>270 Va. 423, 621 S.E.2d 78 (2005). The circuit court has no authority under VAPA to reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>evidentiary record. VAPA authorizes the court to \u201creject the agency\u2019s findings of fact \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Nor can the court substitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s discretion. Instead, \u201cwhen the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which \u2018the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly,\u2019 we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 and thus a \u2018clear abuse of delegated discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). This standard recognizes the larger premise that, before any legal question can be answered, an <em>a priori </em>question must first be asked\u2014who has the authority to decide. It is the one question that precedes all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In Virginia, the legislature has invested the VMRC with wide discretion in determining whether to issue permits for projects over state-owned subaqueous lands. Relying on the \u201cspecialized competency of the VMRC\u201d on such matters, <em>Palmer v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>48 Va.App. 78, 86, 628 S.E.2d 84, 88 (2006), the legislature did not restrict the VMRC\u2019s judgment to any decisionmaking formula intended to dictate the outcome of each permitting decision. Instead, Code \u00a7 28.2-1204 instructs the VMRC to permit \u201creasonable uses\u201d of state-owned bottomland. The VMRC \u201cshall be guided in its deliberations,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A), by the Virginia Constitution\u2019s emphasis on the preservation of the environment, the public\u2019s access to public lands for recreation, and maintenance of all public resources \u201cfor the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth,\u201d Va. Const. Art. IX, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) also directs the VMRC to exercise its authority consistent with the \u201cpublic trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the Commonwealth\u201d and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>consider an additional list of specific factors, including the effect of the project on \u201c[ajdjacent or nearby properties.\u201d <em>See Palmer, </em>48 Va.App. at 87-88, 628 S.E.2d at 89. \u201cThe presence or absence of any given factor is not dispositive of whether a permit should be granted; further, not every factor is applicable in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 628 S.E.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">B. <em>The Circuit Court\u2019s Three Alternative Holdings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The circuit court rested its ruling on three alternative grounds. On appeal, the VMRC and Boone argue the circuit court erred on each one. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">(i) <em>Due Process Claim Regarding Harrison\u2019s Exhibits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The circuit court held the VMRC violated Harrison\u2019s due process rights by allegedly refusing to consider her written exhibits. As Boone points out, however, Harrison\u2019s VAPA petition for appeal in the circuit court raised no due process claim and mentioned nothing about the VMRC disregarding her exhibits. None of her briefs in the circuit court argued that the VMRC violated her due process rights by failing to consider her exhibits. Nor did Harrison\u2019s counsel ever assert this claim at any hearing in the circuit court. The litigants learned of this issue for the first time while reading the circuit court\u2019s letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u2018When the VAPA authorizes judicial review, it must be conducted \u2018in the manner provided by the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christian v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>45 Va.App. 310, 314, 610 S.E.2d 870, 872 (2005) (quoting Code \u00a7 2.2-4026). Rule 2A:4(b) requires all VAPA petitions for appeal filed in the circuit court to \u201cspecify the errors assigned\u201d as well as the \u201cspecific\u201d relief requested. Harrison\u2019s petition for appeal in the circuit court never alleged any due process claim. Nor did she later seek to amend her petition to include such a claim. Instead, the circuit court raised the due process claim <em>sua sponte </em>as a basis for reversing the VMRC decision. The court erred by doing so. <em>See generally Clifford v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 23, 25, 645 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>S.E.2d 295, 297 (2007) (holding \u201can appellate court may not \u2018recast\u2019 an argument\u201d into \u201ca different argument upon which to base its decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">(ii) <em>The VMRC\u2019s Consideration of Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The circuit court also held that the VMRC failed to consider the impact of the upper deck bar on \u201c[ajdjacent and nearby properties\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A)(4). The court\u2019s opinion identified only two possible impacts on nearby properties: noise and sunrise views. We find no merit in either assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">With respect to the noise complaint, the circuit court held the VMRC \u201cdelegated\u201d its decisionmaking responsibility to the Norfolk City Council by relying on the noise restrictions imposed on Boone\u2019s special use zoning permit. This constituted an unlawful \u201cabdication\u201d of the VMRC\u2019s statutory duties, the court concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The litigants debate on appeal whether noise constitutes a sufficient impact on \u201c[a]djacent or nearby properties,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A)(4), to be a required statutory consideration in every case. The Attorney General opines that the VMRC should consider only direct \u201cphysical\u201d impacts. <em>See </em>1972-73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 188, 1973 Va. AG Lexis 108 (1973). Harrison contends that excessive noise should always be considered if it affects nearby properties and complains that the VMRC\u2019s position differs from its actions in other cases in which nonphysical impacts were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">We find this debate largely academic because the administrative record demonstrates, as Boone argues on appeal, that the VMRC did consider Harrison\u2019s noise complaint. At the VMRC hearing, Harrison and LeBon testified on this subject. Afterwards, the commission invited Boone to offer a response. He explained that the sound recording offered by Harrison merely recorded his use of \u201clarge speakers\u201d to perform a \u201csound test.\u201d Apparently based upon this explanation, the commissioners chose not to listen to the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>During deliberations, the VMRC chairman noted that the proffer of the mayor\u2019s statement established that the City of Norfolk \u201capproved everything\u201d and did not \u201chave a problem with it so I don\u2019t see why we should.\u201d While questioning whether \u201cnoise\u201d and the \u201cnature of the activities\u201d were within the VMRC\u2019s jurisdiction, an associate commissioner pointed out that, in any event, the City of Norfolk resolved these concerns with \u201csome restrictive conditions on the use of the property, hours of operation, etc.\u201d These conditions prohibited \u201centertainment for the outdoor portion of the restaurant\u201d after 10:00 p.m. and subjected all activities on the pier to the noise regulations found in Norfolk City Code \u00a7\u00a7 26-1 to 26-13. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s already been addressed by the City,\u201d the associate commissioner reasoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Under Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(B), the VMRC <em>\u201cshall </em>consult with other state agencies ... whenever the Commission\u2019s decision on a permit application relates to or affects the particular concerns or activities of those agencies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It follows that the VMRC <em>may </em>consult with municipal authorities and consider their actions to the extent relevant to the permit application. While an administrative agency cannot \u201cshirk its own statutory mandate\u201d to take into account all relevant considerations, neither must it \u201cpretend that it is the only agency addressing the issue when it is not; that would only lead it to conduct a wasteful, duplicative proceeding.\u201d <em>Holyoke Gas &amp; Electric Dep\u2019t v. SEC, </em>972 F.2d 358, 363 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Given the VMRC\u2019s willingness to take evidence on the noise issue, both from Harrison and Boone, and to consider the City of Norfolk\u2019s role in restricting the special use permit, we reject the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the VMRC abdicated any statutory duty to consider the noise issue as a relevant impact on \u201c[a]djacent or nearby properties.\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A)(4). While it appears the subject was not given dispositive weight, nothing in the statute requires that any specific factor be given any measurable weight, only that it be <em>considered </em>by the VMRC during the decisionmaking process. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>weight that should be properly given to any specific factor\u2014 including any claimed impact on \u201c[ajdjacent or nearby properties,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A)(4)\u2014is a decision for the VMRC not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We acknowledge, but find unpersuasive, the circuit court\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cwe\u2019re not interested in that\u201d remark by the VMRC chairman during Boone\u2019s rebuttal testimony. Under VAPA, \u201cwe cannot seize upon questions, comments or incidences of an orderly administrative process to discredit agency action that is supported by the record, viewed in context and as a whole.\u201d <em>The Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 706, 601 S.E.2d at 675 (citation omitted). \u2018We focus instead on the decision itself and the entire factual record considered by the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cBy design, this standard gives \u2018great stability and finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), and also ensures that we remain faithful to our statutory duty to \u201ctake due account of the presumption of official regularity\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s \u201cexperience and specialized competence,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 2.2-4027).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">With respect to the sunrise view issue, we find even less merit in this assertion. Harrison never testified before the VMRC that the upper deck bar interfered with her view of the sunrise. Perhaps that could be inferred from LeBon\u2019s testimony. But, if so, the inference is far too slender to support the weight of Harrison\u2019s argument. LeBon\u2019s next-door neighbor, Harrison said she lived about ten houses down the shoreline west of the pier. Harrison did not present any evidence on how often the sun and the upper deck bar share the same azimuth from the vantage point of her home. Nor did she account for the effect of solar declination tracking the change of seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The specific obstruction in question, after all, is not the 1,490-foot pier with shelters and fish cleaning station, or its 116-by-42 foot building housing a restaurant, bait shop, rest rooms, snack bar, and recreational gameroom. Nor is it the uncontested structures on the roof of the building: the upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>deck with its railing and 16/6-by-ll foot gazebo. The obstruction at issue here is the 10-by-27 foot upper deck bar\u2014which, at best, would have a purely incremental and momentary impact on Harrison\u2019s sunrise views. We hold the VMRC did not fail to give sufficient consideration to this particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">(iii) <em>The VMRC\u2019s Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) directs the VMRC to exercise its authority consistent with the public trust doctrine adopted by the common law and the provisions of Article XI, Section 1 of the Virginia Constitution. As we recognized in <em>Palmer, </em>the public trust doctrine provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">The state holds the land lying beneath public waters as trustee for the benefit of all citizens. As trustee, the state is responsible for proper management of the resource to ensure the preservation and protection of all appropriate current and potential future uses, including potentially conflicting uses, by the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">48 Va.App. at 88, 628 S.E.2d at 89 (quoting VMRC, Subaqueous Guidelines \u00a7 1(B)); <em>see </em>Sharon M. Kelly, <em>The Public Trust and the Constitution: Routes to Judicial Overview of Resource Management Decisions in Virginia, </em>75 Va. L.Rev. 895, 896 (1989); <em>see also Ill. Cent. R.R. v. Illinois, </em>146 U.S. 387, 436, 13 S.Ct. 110, 111-12, 36 L.Ed. 1018 (1892) (described by <em>Commonwealth v. Newport News, </em>158 Va. 521, 536, 164 S.E. 689, 693 (1932), as \u201c[plrobably the clearest enunciation of this trust doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In this case, the circuit court held the upper deck bar violated the public trust doctrine as a matter of law and, thus, that the VMRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in granting the permit. The court explained its reasoning this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">With respect to non-water dependent structures, the public trust doctrine must mean something. Yet, VMRC renders it meaningless by granting Boone\u2019s permit for the second-story bar structure when its functions merely duplicate already-permitted uses on the Ocean View Fishing Pier. At a minimum, proper application of the public trust doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>requires avoidance of redundant non-water dependent uses at close proximity on the same pier. The Court rules that, under the circumstances of this case, VMRC misapplied the public trust doctrine. It thereby breached its duties to the public by permitting the second-story bar structure, when its intended non-water dependent use serves only to duplicate facilities available within or from the pier\u2019s main building. The record establishes that the structure is not reasonable or even valuable to the greater public interest as a non-water dependent use, and, clearly, alternatives exist \u201cfor reducing any anticipated adverse impacts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The circuit court framed its reasoning to track the Subaqueous Guidelines adopted by the VMRC. <em>See generally Palmer, </em>48 Va.App. at 88-89, 628 S.E.2d at 89-90. Under those guidelines, the VMRC considers whether the anticipated use would be water dependent\u2014like boating, fishing, marine commerce, and the like. Code \u00a7 28.2-1205, however, contains no mandatory water-dependency criterion. The VMRC guidelines also make clear that water dependency is not a mandatory factor: \u201cUse of the definition of water dependency does not necessarily preclude issuance of a permit for non-water dependent structures over State-owned submerged lands. At public hearing, the Commission may determine that, while a structure is not water dependent, it is a reasonable use of State-owned submerged lands.\u201d VMRC Subaqueous Guidelines \u00a7 1(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The circuit court held the VMRC\u2019s decision to grant a permit for the upper deck bar violated the public trust doctrine as a matter of law because the outdoor bar on the upper deck was not water-dependent under the VMRC guidelines and \u201cmerely duplicate[d]\u201d the indoor bar on the lower deck. We need not stake out definitive boundaries for the public trust doctrine in order to conclude the court erred. Code \u00a7 28.2-1205 contains no water-dependency criterion, and the VMRC\u2019s guidelines include water dependency only as a factor for consideration. <em>See Palmer, </em>48 Va.App. at 90, 628 S.E.2d at 90 (recognizing that, as related to private piers, \u201cthe VMRC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>may properly consider the cumulative effect of issuing multiple permits for structures over the water of the Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(A) directs the VMRC\u2014not the courts\u2014to decide whether, in its expert discretion, granting the permit would be consistent with the public trust doctrine. Under VAPA, the courts have no authority to make a <em>de novo </em>judgment on the subject. Absent a statutory or constitutional violation, a VMRC decision to grant a permit can be judicially upended under VAPA only if the decision can be fairly condemned as arbitrary and capricious, wholly lacking in reasoned judgment or supporting facts. No such conclusion can be reached under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The circuit court erred in vacating the VMRC\u2019s grant of an after-the-fact permit for the upper deck bar built on the roof of Boone\u2019s pier restaurant. It necessarily follows that the court had no authority to order the dismantling of the bar structure or to award Harrison attorney fees as the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-13\">. Boone also increased the size of another upper deck structure, a gazebo, previously approved by the VMRC, and added two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>structures, a temporary construction trestle and a fish cleaning station, not previously approved by the VMRC. Harrison has abandoned any contest over these structures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"><em>. </em>Given our ruling, we need not address the appellants\u2019 additional arguments that (i) VMRC decisions \u201cconsistent with the public trust doctrine ... shall not be deemed to have been made pursuant to the police power\u201d per Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F); (ii) the circuit court\u2019s ruling, in effect, judicially reviewed earlier, unappealed permit decisions over which it had no jurisdiction; (iii) none of Harrison\u2019s complaints involve claims of direct, physical impacts on her property; (iv) Harrison was not an aggrieved party for purposes of a VAPA appeal; and (v) the circuit court\u2019s remedial order violated Code \u00a7 2.2-4029</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
