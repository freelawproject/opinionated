ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">A jury convicted Russell Hopson of voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, Hopson argues that his conviction should be overturned because the trial court erroneously failed to strike several jurors for cause during voir dire. We disagree and affirm Hopson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">At the start of Hopson\u2019s trial, the trial court questioned the jury venire on various subjects to ensure the prospective jurors would approach the case from an impartial point of view. Among other questions, the trial court asked: \u201cDo each of you understand that the defendant is presumed to be innocent?\u201d \u201cDo you understand that the Commonwealth must prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d \u201cDo you understand that the defendant is not required to produce evidence?\u201d To each of these questions, the venire panel responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">When given his opportunity to question the venire, Hopson\u2019s counsel posed a series of subtle questions related to the presumption of innocence. He began in this manner: \u201cThe first question I\u2019d like to ask is right to the point, I think. Does everybody agree that we haven\u2019t heard any evidence? Can you raise your hand if you agree to that.\u201d The jury responded in agreement. From there, counsel stated: \u201cHa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ven\u2019t heard no evidence. Do you think Mr. Hopson is guilty or not guilty? There\u2019s three answers that you can have. I think he\u2019s guilty or he\u2019s charged, so he\u2019s guilty. I think he\u2019s not guilty. I don\u2019t know. Can you raise your hand if your answer is I don\u2019t know.\u201d The venire panel responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Hopson\u2019s counsel then told the prospective jurors, \u201cit can\u2019t be I don\u2019t know. The answer to the Judge\u2019s question, truthfully, it\u2019s got to be presumed not guilty. Not I don\u2019t know.\u201d Continuing, counsel said, \u201chaving put it that way, in more plain language instead of presumed innocent, does everybody agree that we need to come down here (indicating), that he is not guilty and presumed innocent? Does everybody agree with that?\u201d The panel answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">A moment later, juror Carol King volunteered a clarification: \u201cThe question was presumed innocent. Yes, and I agree with that. But presumed innocent and not guilty\u2014not guilty is a verdict. I don\u2019t know the answer to the verdict, so I\u2019m in the don\u2019t know category.\u201d In response, Hopson\u2019s counsel gave a lengthy hypothetical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Let\u2019s say that you read in the paper that somebody has robbed the Starbucks. You go to work and you\u2019re talking to everybody in the office, somebody robbed the Starbucks. Did you hear about that. They went in and they pulled out a gun. They held a gun out and they said, I want 42 skinny lattes, no foam, and I wanted them right now. The lady makes up all the skinny lattes and gives them to her. The lady runs out. People can\u2019t believe it. The Starbucks got robbed of skinny lattes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">A couple of weeks later you\u2019re not going to the coffee shop anymore; you\u2019re drinking your coffee at home, and you read on the internet that they\u2019ve arrested someone for robbing the Starbucks and the lady\u2019s name is Cathy Caffeine. That\u2019s just one crazy coincident, isn\u2019t it. You rush to the office, having read it on the internet and there you are in your office. Everybody comes in. You know you\u2019re the first to know because you read it on the internet. Do you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>say to your office workers, they caught the person that robbed the Starbucks and her name is Cathy Caffeine? Is that what everybody says? Or do you say, they arrested somebody for robbing the Starbucks and I don\u2019t know if she is guilty or not, but they did arrested [sic] somebody. Really odd her name is Cathy Caffeine. <em>Don\u2019t we all say, they caught the person who robbed the Starbucks?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">(Emphasis added.) In response to this oration, the panel responded affirmatively. Juror Carol King, however, again interjected a point of clarification: \u201cI would say that depends upon whether I\u2019m sworn to do a jury determination.\u201d Hop-son\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cI\u2019m just talking about in your every day life. When you came to work or when your family came home, would you say, they caught the person who robbed the Starbucks?\u201d King replied: \u201cI probably would say they caught someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Hopson\u2019s counsel then commented on King\u2019s answer: \u201cNow, I think we all agree that pretty much, on a regular basis, that\u2019s what we say. Now, that\u2019s your every day life. Having agreed to that, does everybody agree that we can, as jurors, say waited [sic] a minute, this isn\u2019t about they caught somebody; this is about a person who is presumed to be innocent. Can we all say that?\u201d The venire panel responded affirmatively. At that point, juror Vernie Hudson added, \u201cwhen they say they caught someone, that doesn\u2019t mean they caught the exact person that did it. You\u2019ve got to wait and see the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Hopson\u2019s counsel continued with this line of questioning. \u201cSo let me ask you this question. Does everybody in here have children, nephews?\u201d The venire panel responded affirmatively. Counsel then gave another hypothetical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Your son comes home with a note and he gives it to you from the principal. And the note says, Johnny broke the window in the car at the school. Now, you go to Johnny and say, come up to your room, we have to talk about this. Johnny says, wait a minute, I don\u2019t have to say nothing. I don\u2019t have to prove nothing. They have to come tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>everything. <em>Raise your hand if you\u2019re not putting up with that at home.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">(Emphasis added.) The venire panel again responded in the affirmative. At this, Hopson\u2019s counsel argued, \u201cIf you\u2019re not putting up with that at home, how could you possibly put up with that in a trial.\u201d He immediately followed up with, \u201cNow, can you, and do you honestly believe that the defendant shouldn\u2019t have to say anything or prove anything, that [the prosecutors] have to proof [sic] this whole trial? Can you raise your hand if you honestly believe that.\u201d After the venire panel responded affirmatively, juror Carol King asked, \u201cRepeat the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In response to King\u2019s request, Hopson\u2019s counsel rephrased the point without using hypothetical situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Okay. If you honestly believe that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys have to prove everything beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant doesn\u2019t have to say a word or prove one shred of evidence in this case, if you believe that that\u2019s their burden, the defendant doesn\u2019t have to testify, say anything or present any evidence, if you believe that is true, could you please raise your hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The venire panel responded affirmatively. Juror Hudson interjected: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s your job____What I mean by that is, because of client/lawyer confidentiality, you should know all the information in order to defend him properly.\u201d Hopson\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cBut do you understand that it\u2019s not my job to put on any evidence; that\u2019s the Commonwealth\u2019s job?\u201d Hudson responded with his own question, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come up with anything to defend him when they make their allegations?\u201d Hopson\u2019s counsel answered, \u2018We can just sit there silent. That\u2019s what the law requires. Probably isn\u2019t likely I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">No doubt confused by this exchange, juror Edwin Maier said: \u201c7 would want to present something in that case to say if 7 was innocent. 7 would stand up for <em>my </em>rights, for <em>my </em>moment to speak. If it\u2019s their right to prove everything, that\u2019s fine. 7 still wouldn\u2019t sit by and say nothing, <em>me, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>personally.\u201d </em>Hopson\u2019s counsel changed the focus of Maier\u2019s remark, \u201cI understand. I perfectly understand. Then you think that somebody charged with murder, they should get up there and tell their side of the story?\u201d Maier answered: \u201cI feel like they should. I mean, I don\u2019t think they should sit there and be quiet, let someone else say something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Addressing the entire venire, Hopson\u2019s counsel commented favorably on Maier\u2019s remark. \u201cThis gentleman,\u201d referring to Maier, \u201chas brought up a good point. This man is charged with murder. He says, in his opinion, he\u2019s not trying to buck the law or cause any ripple effect here, but he says he should get up on this witness stand and tell you what happened. He\u2019s charged with murder. Can you raise your hand if you agree with that?\u201d The transcript does not record any group affirmative response by the venire. Instead, juror Hudson said: <em>\u201cI </em>know <em>I </em>would if <em>I </em>was in that place.\u201d Several other prospective jurors\u2014Steven Featherlin, James King, JoAnn Swoveland, Vonda Carter, Edwin Maier, Robert Jackson, and Temika Kidd\u2014similarly agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">When given his opportunity to question the venire, the prosecutor sought to clarify the earlier series of questions and answers by Hopson\u2019s counsel: \u201cSome of you raised your hands in reference to the fact that if the defendant does not take the stand, that you will wonder because you would want to defend yourself and take the stand; is that correct? Some of you did do that?\u201d The venire panel responded affirmatively. The prosecutor then refocused the question: \u201cIf the Judge were to instruct you that the law is that <em>this man, </em>the <em>defendant, </em>does not have to take the stand to defend <em>himself, </em>could you follow the law?\u201d The panel responded affirmatively. To further clarify, the prosecutor again asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">Could each and every one of you, especially those who raised your hands and said you would want to take the stand and defend yourself, I understand your personal belief, but could you follow the law that this Judge is going to instruct you that says the defendant does not have to take the stand in this case to defend himself?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The venire panel responded affirmatively. The prosecutor confirmed, \u201cNo one says no to that?\u201d The panel agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Hopson\u2019s counsel moved to strike for cause eight jurors: Maier, Hudson, James King, Featherlin, Jackson, Swoveland, Kidd, and Winnegan. The trial court struck Maier and Hudson for cause because \u201cthey were very vocal in their opinions\u201d during voir dire. The other jurors, the court held, gave no indication they would have any difficulty following the instructions of law recognizing the defendant\u2019s right not to take the stand or to put on any evidence in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Hopson and the Commonwealth exercised their peremptory strikes, and the court seated a petit jury to try the case. The jury found Hopson guilty of voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm during the commission of that felony. The trial court dismissed the firearm charge and entered final judgment convicting Hopson of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On appeal, Hopson argues that the trial court abused its discretion in striking only two of the eight jurors Hopson sought to discharge for cause. The remaining six jurors, Hopson claims, likewise should have been stricken because they could not be trusted to recognize his constitutional right not to testify or to present evidence in his defense. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Virginia \u201cjurisprudence according deference to the trial court\u2019s discretion in consideration of juror voir dire matters is long-standing.\u201d <em>Juniper v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 362, 397, 626 S.E.2d 383, 406 (2006); <em>Townsend v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 325, 329, 619 S.E.2d 71, 73 (2005). This deference stems from our recognition that \u201ca trial judge who personally observes a juror, including the juror\u2019s tenor, tone, and general demeanor, is in a better position than an appellate court to determine whether a particular juror should be stricken.\u201d <em>Teleguz v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 458, 475, 643 S.E.2d 708, 719 (2007). In this respect, the question \u201c[whether a juror is impartial is a pure question of historical fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>David v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 77, 81, 493 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1997) (citing <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 428, 105 S.Ct. 844, 854, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)). Absent a showing of \u201cmanifest error,\u201d we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion during voir dire. <em>Juniper, </em>271 Va. at 401, 626 S.E.2d at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Venire panel members who express preconceived opinions do not become <em>per se </em>disqualified to sit on the petit jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKb\">It is not uncommon to discover during voir dire that prospective jurors have preconceived notions, opinions, or misconceptions about the criminal justice system, criminal trials and procedure, or about the particular case. Even though a prospective juror may hold preconceived views, opinions, or misconceptions, the test of impartiality is whether the venireperson can lay aside the preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"><em>Cressell v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 744, 761, 531 S.E.2d 1, 9 (2000) (quoting <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 619, 621, 454 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1995) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Faced with this problem, trial courts must examine the \u201cthe nature and strength of the opinion formed.\u201d <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 180, 185, 279 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1981) (citation omitted). \u201cThe spectrum of opinion can range, by infinite shades and degrees, from a casual impression to a fixed and abiding conviction. The point at which an impression too weak to warp the judgment ends and one too strong to suppress begins is difficult to discern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe opinion entertained by a juror, which disqualifies him, is an opinion of that <em>fixed character </em>which repels the presumption of innocence in a criminal case, and in whose mind the accused stands condemned already.\u201d <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1980) (citation omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">That line is not irrevocably breached merely by juror comments about the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand in his own defense. \u201cIt would be unrealistic to think that jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>do not notice when defendants fail to testify.\u201d <em>Townes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 329, 362 S.E.2d 650, 662 (1987) (citing <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 301 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 1120 n. 18, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981)). To be sure, \u201cit is not surprising that jurors would want or expect a defendant to testify; any conscientious juror naturally would want all the help he or she could get in deciding a case. It should not be grounds for a <em>per se </em>exclusion, therefore, when prospective jurors on voir dire indicate their wants or expectations in this respect.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In our case, the trial court determined that the prospective jurors challenged by Hopson did not hold impermissible opinions of a \u201cfixed character,\u201d <em>Justus, </em>220 Va. at 976, 266 S.E.2d at 91, in opposition to the defendant\u2019s presumed innocence or his right to present no defense. In reviewing this exercise of discretion, we examine the \u201centire voir dire, not just isolated portions.\u201d <em>Juniper, </em>271 Va. at 401, 626 S.E.2d at 408 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 178, 191, 590 S.E.2d 520, 527 (2004)); <em>see also Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 193, 212, 576 S.E.2d 471, 482 (2003). From that vantage point, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The voir dire questions by Hopson\u2019s counsel did more to confuse the issue than to clarify it. His first series of questions required the venire members to choose between saying (i) Hopson is guilty, (ii) Hopson is not guilty, and (iii) they do not know if he is guilty or not guilty. When the venire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>members said they did not know, counsel chastised them for misunderstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and Hopson\u2019s imputed innocence. As juror Carol King correctly pointed out, however, she understood Hopson was \u201cpresumed innocent\u201d but that is entirely different from declaring him \u201cnot guilty\u2014not guilty is a verdict.\u201d No prospective juror, she rightly insisted, could predict the verdict in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Equally misleading were the lengthy hypotheticals concerning conversations at work about \u201cCathy Caffeine\u201d being caught for stealing from Starbucks or a parent\u2019s reaction to a son who refused to explain a note home from the school principal. Idle conversation around the water cooler is hardly a reliable test case for probing one\u2019s understanding of the burdens of proof in criminal law or one\u2019s ability to faithfully conform to the sworn duties of a juror. As for the parent-child hypothetical\u2014\u201cRaise your hand if you\u2019re not putting up with that at home.\u201d\u2014few parents would recognize (and even fewer children would expect to successfully invoke) a Fifth Amendment privilege in the face of a disciplinary note from the principal. \u201cIf you\u2019re not putting up with that at home, how could you possibly put up with that in a trial,\u201d counsel asked rhetorically. The answer was too plain to say: Because the defendant is not my schoolboy son, and the courtroom is not my home.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">That brings us to the last series of questions, those ostensibly directed at the defendant\u2019s right not to testify or to present any evidence. Here again, the questions posed by Hopson\u2019s counsel appeared designed more to create a false issue than to discern a true misunderstanding on the part of the venire. Juror Hudson (whom the trial court later struck for cause) said he understood Hopson\u2019s right not to testify but expected Hopson\u2019s counsel to \u201ccome up\u201d with something \u201cto defend him when they make their allegations.\u201d Juror Maier (whom the trial court later struck for cause) also confirmed he understood Hopson\u2019s right <em>not </em>to testify, but Maier said he personally would exercise <em>his </em>right <em>to </em>testify: <em>\u201cI </em>would want to present something in that case to say if <em>I </em>was innocent. <em>I </em>would stand up for <em>my </em>rights, for <em>my </em>moment to speak.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Hopson\u2019s counsel then recast Maier\u2019s remark: \u201cThen you think that somebody charged with murder, they should get up there and tell their side of the story?\u201d Maier\u2019s response seemed to concede the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Hopson\u2019s counsel then sought to project Maier\u2019s responses to the entire venire panel. Counsel told the panel that Maier \u201chas brought up a good point. This man is charged with murder. He says, in his opinion, he\u2019s not trying to buck the law or cause any ripple effect here, but he says <em>he </em>should get up on this -witness stand and tell you what happened. <em>He\u2019s </em>charged with murder. Can you raise your hand if you agree with that?\u201d It was in response to that question that juror Hudson said: \u201cI know <em>I </em>would if <em>I </em>was in that place.\u201d The other venire members (Featherlin, James King, Swoveland, Carter, Maier, Jackson, and Kidd) appeared to adopt Hudson\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">This entire discussion, however, subtly confused the issue. Hopson had a constitutional right not to testify. He had an equally fundamental constitutional right to testify. The only issue the venire jurors should have been questioned on was whether they would hold it against Hopson if he chose to exercise the former, not the latter, constitutional right. Whether the <em>jurors themselves </em>would make a similar choice, if they were charged with a crime, is entirely beside the point. <em>See Isom v. State, </em>284 Ark. 426, 682 S.W.2d 755, 757 (1985) (finding no bias on part of juror who said he would want to testify if he were on trial but understood that a defendant is not required to testify and that the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify cannot be held against him).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The prosecutor untangled this knot with his follow-up questions: \u201cSome of you raised your hands in reference to the fact that if the defendant does not take the stand, that you will wonder because <em>you would want to defend yourself and take the stand; </em>is that correct?\u201d The venire panel responded affirmatively. The prosecutor then correctly reframed the relevant question: \u201cIf the Judge were to instruct you that the law is that <em>this man, </em>the <em>defendant, </em>does not have to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>stand to defend <em>himself, </em>could you follow the law?\u201d The jury venire again responded affirmatively. To further clarify, the prosecutor again asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Could each and every one of you, especially those who raised your hands and said you would want to take the stand and defend yourself, I understand your personal belief, but could you follow the law that this Judge is going to instruct you that says the defendant does not have to take the stand in this case to defend himself?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The panel responded affirmatively. The prosecutor confirmed, \u201cNo one says no to that?\u201d The panel again agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">This exchange was not a last-minute rehabilitation of venire members who had expressed a fixed predisposition hostile to the defendant\u2019s rights. Prior to the first question being asked by Hopson\u2019s counsel, the prospective jurors affirmed during the court\u2019s opening colloquy that they understood \u201cthe defendant is presumed to be innocent,\u201d that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant is not required to produce evidence.\u201d And even in the midst of the confusion caused by Hopson\u2019s counsel, the prospective jurors again confirmed on three separate occasions their agreement with the proposition that the defendant was presumed innocent and had a right not to testify or produce evidence. Thereafter, the prosecutor\u2019s closing series of questions merely reconfirmed the venire\u2019s understanding and agreement with these principles. <em>See, e.g., Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 247, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391-92 (1990); <em>Townes, </em>234 Va. at 328, 362 S.E.2d at 662; <em>Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 123, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987); <em>McGill, </em>10 Va.App. at 243, 391 S.E.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In sum, the six prospective jurors that the trial court declined to strike did not offer any opinion of a <em>\u201cfixed character </em>which repels the presumption of innocence in a criminal case\u201d or reveal a predisposed belief that \u201cthe accused stands condemned already.\u201d <em>Justus, </em>220 Va. at 976, 266 S.E.2d at 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(citation omitted and emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At most, these venire members stated only that they would choose to testify if <em>they </em>were accused of a crime. This understandable personal opinion, which they affirmed would not prejudice Hopson\u2019s corresponding right not to testify, did not disqualify them from sitting on the petit jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting only two of the eight for-cause strikes requested by Hopson, we affirm his conviction for voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. <em>See also Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 247, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391-92 (1990) (finding no error in seating a juror who \"initially voiced concern\u201d about the defendant not taking the stand but later confirmed his willingness to abide by the court\u2019s instructions clarifying the defendant\u2019s rights); <em>Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 123, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987) (approving seating of juror who initially \"indicated by his answers that he believed that the defendant was required to prove his innocence\u201d but later affirmed his duty to presume the defendant\u2019s innocence); <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 237, 242-43, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600-01 (1990) (holding no error in refusing to strike a juror for cause despite the necessity to correct a preconceived notion that the defendant was required to prove his innocence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-16\">. This distinguishes our case from <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, 217 </em>Va. 297, 299 n. *, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736 n. * (1976), where a juror believed \u201cthe fact that [the defendant] is here is strong indication that he is guilty.\u201d It was in the face of this obviously impermissible statement of bias that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201clong, complex, leading questions\u201d failed to rehabilitate the juror. Similarly, in <em>Bradbury v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 176, 178, 578 S.E.2d 93, 94 (2003), the juror voiced an opinion that, in a rape case, \"the man bears the burden of proving that the woman consented to sex.\u201d In response, the trial judge used \"leading, long, and complex\u201d questions in an ineffectual effort at rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 182, 578 S.E.2d at 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
