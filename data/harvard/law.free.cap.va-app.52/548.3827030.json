Jones entered his plea pursuant to an agreement allowing him to appeal the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress evidence of cocaine that police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>officers found inside of a bag in Jones\u2019 vehicle. Jones maintains that: 1) the police seized him in violation of the Fourth Amendment because they did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity at the time of the seizure and 2) the subsequent search of a bag he dropped in the course of the seizure was likewise constitutionally infirm. For the following reasons, we disagree with Jones\u2019 arguments and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>STATEMENT OF FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A lengthy statement of relevant facts is necessary for resolution of this Fourth Amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Sergeant Mauricio Tovar was a detective for three years and a supervisor for a year and one-half in the Narcotics Division of the Richmond Police Department. He and his partner, Detective Fred E. Bates, a five-year veteran of that Division, were on patrol in their vehicle at the Red Roof Inn during the night of March 3, 2006. They were in plain clothes, though each officer had a yellow emblem on his jacket identifying him as \u201cRichmond Police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Tovar described the Red Roof Inn as \u201cknown for the trafficking of drugs.\u201d Within the preceding two weeks, he had executed a search warrant there and recovered \u201cseveral kilos of cocaine.\u201d Bates explained: \u201cThe Red Roof Inn has a known history for large narcotics transactions. It\u2019s right on the exit of 95. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve done numerous buys, take-downs, and also seizures of large narcotics at that hotel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">At 11:45 p.m., the officers noticed a white BMW backed into a parking space at the hotel. During a fifteen-minute period of observation, Jones did not leave the vehicle and no one approached it. But, as Bates testified, Jones was \u201clooking down in [his] lap the entire time. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s counting money or not....\u201d Bates was asked what else made him suspicious that Jones may be involved in a narcotics transaction: \u201cI have been doing it for 5 years. Narcotics deals never go down on time. If you set up a narcotics deal using an informant or undercover officer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>meet someone, or someone to meet a dealer or a buyer, it never goes down on time. Someone is always late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">After the period of observation, the officers decided to walk over to the car and make inquiries. Bates approached the passenger\u2019s side and Tovar the driver\u2019s side. No lights were activated on the police vehicle, which was not blocking the BMW, nor did the officers draw their weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Tovar: \u201cI asked him like a couple of times, what are you doing ... he\u2019s using a Jamaican accent.... [A]nd then ... he starts to reach on the floorboard where I can\u2019t see.... I asked him to put his hands on the steering wheel.\u201d On cross-examination, Tovar specifically testified he said to Jones: \u201cCan you put your hands on the steering wheel.\u201d Initially, Jones complied: \u201cHands are up. I can see them. That\u2019s fine. Does it a second time____[S]tart reaching for the floorboard ... [with] ... the right hand.\u201d Because Tovar was on Jones\u2019 left side, Tovar \u201ccould not tell what\u2019s on the floorboard.\u201d At that point, Bates yelled: \u201cGet him out of the car, Tovar. Get him out of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Tovar continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">I told him: Don\u2019t reach for the floorboard. If you reach for the floorboard, I\u2019m going to assume you have a gun. And then prior to me opening the door, he starts reaching for the floorboard again ... [this was] the third time he went to the floorboard____[A]t that point I started backing away as fast as I could from the car. And I did draw my gun at that point. And as his hands were coming up, in his right hand, he had a black bag.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked: \u201cWhat was your concern as he\u2019s reaching for the floorboard that third time?\u201d Tovar answered: \u201cMy concern was that I was going to get shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">Bates had approached the passenger side with his flashlight. Bates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">I started looking in the backseat, and then I quickly noticed ... right behind the passenger seat was a large bowie knife ... the butt of the knife, the handle of it was resting up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>against the middle part of the seat ... the middle part of the console.... It was right next to [Jones] ... you can easily turn or barely even turn. You can use your right arm and grab the butt of the knife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Bates responded affirmatively as to whether the knife was within arm\u2019s reach. \u201cQ. What did you do once you saw the knife? A. I told Detective Sergeant Tovar that it was a knife right there, and get him out of the car.\u201d Bates continued: \u201c[Tovar] is telling him to get out of the car, and no one is getting out of the car----[Jones] was still talking to Sergeant Tovar---- And then with his right hand, I saw him going down underneath the seat ... near the middle hump of the vehicle.\u201d At that point, Bates continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">I drew my gun ... and I started yelling: No, no, no. And he kept on. He kept on going for whatever was underneath the seat, and his hands were completely out of my view____ I was really scared---- Sergeant Tovar ... has his gun drawn ... and I saw [Jones] coming back up with a black object in his hand that was long____I\u2019m yelling: Stop it. Drop. Drop. Drop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Jones stepped out of the car holding a black object, which he then tossed on the front driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">That object was a zippered bag, which Bates recovered. As Bates testified: \u201cAs soon as I grabbed it, I could feel ... something hard inside ... I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d On cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: \u201cQ. Did it feel like a gun? A. I don\u2019t know.... It felt hard and that\u2019s\u2014 Q. So you didn\u2019t know it was a gun? A. [A] gun could be anything. It could have been a Derringer.... It was a hard object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">The bag contained a black metal electronic digital scale (with cocaine residue), 45 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 27 grams of cocaine base and a small amount of marijuana. A photograph of the black bag taken on the car seat, and one taken with the scales, cocaine, and bills next to it for comparison as to size show that a reasonable fact finder could con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>elude that it could accommodate a small gun, a knife, or other weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Under our standard of review of the denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on the appellant to demonstrate reversible error. <em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 272, 597 S.E.2d 242, 246 (2004). We review the evidence, both adduced at the hearing on the motion and at trial. <em>Blevins v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 412, 420, 579 S.E.2d 658, 662 (2003), <em>aff'd, on other grounds, </em>267 Va. 291, 590 S.E.2d 365 (2004). We consider that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and grant to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences that may be fairly deducible from that evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). And \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or \u2018without evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc). However, despite the appellant\u2019s burden, and our deference to the Commonwealth and the trial court as to the evidence, it is our responsibility to review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the \u201ctrial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case.\u201d <em>Watts v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 206, 213, 562 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\u201cPolice officers are free to engage in consensual encounters with citizens, indeed, it is difficult to envision their ability to carry out their duties if that were not the case.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2008). \u201cLaw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen.\u201d <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 200, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Thus, in <em>Londono v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 377, 399, 579 S.E.2d 641, 651 (2003), we quoted with approval the following from <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 487 S.E.2d 259: \u201cAn encounter between a law enforcement officer and a citizen in which the officer merely identifies himself and states that he is conducting an ... investigation, without more, is not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, but is, instead, a consensual encounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 487 S.E.2d at 262. <em>See also, Barkley v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 682, 691, 576 S.E.2d 234, 238 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Likewise, \u201cinterrogation relating to one\u2019s identity or a request for identification by the police does not, by itself, constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.\u201d <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1763, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984). The police approached the defendant with \u201cno show of force or authority that would cause a reasonable person to believe that he or she was compelled to remain at the scene of the encounter or otherwise cooperate with the police.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 479, 490, 559 S.E.2d 401, 407 (2002). \u201cThus, we conclude, Andrews was not \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when [the police officer] first approached him and started asking him questions.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 490-91, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545-46 (2001); <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 5, 10-11, 509 S.E.2d 512, 514 (1999); <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 86, 88, 414 S.E.2d 869, 870 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">On this authority, we, accordingly, conclude that the encounter between Jones and the Richmond police officers was initially consensual. However, there is no question but that, here, the initially consensual encounter resulted in a seizure. When did that seizure occur?</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\u201cThe consensual encounter becomes a seizure \u2018[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or show of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malbrough, </em>275 Va. at 169, 655 S.E.2d at 4 (quoting <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2386, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991)). \u201cA person is \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment if, under the circumstances presented, a reasonable person would believe he was not free to leave the scene of an encounter with the police.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>261 Va. at 490, 545 S.E.2d at 545 (quoting <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">But there is a <em>condition precedent </em>to a seizure: The individual must <em>submit </em>to the officer\u2019s force or authority. \u201c[The <em>Mendenhall </em>] test is not applicable until the person submits to the officer\u2019s show of authority.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 604, 608, 521 S.E.2d 287, 289 (1999). \u201cA seizure does not occur in the absence of ... a defendant\u2019s submission to an officer\u2019s assertion of authority.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>261 Va. at 491, 545 S.E.2d at 546. <em>See also, Brown v. City of Danville, </em>44 Va.App. 586, 604, 606 S.E.2d 523, 532 (2004); <em>McLellan v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 144, 154, 554 S.E.2d 699, 704 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">As noted, after the officers approached Jones and Tovar initiated conversation, Jones reached down to the floorboard and Tovar asked him to put his hands on the wheel of the vehicle. Then, on three occasions, Jones refused to comply with that command and reached for the floorboard. Thus, he did <em>not </em>submit to Tovar\u2019s assertion of authority. And it was only during this third occasion of reaching down, and simultaneously with Bates advising Tovar of the existence of the bowie knife and telling Tovar to get Jones out of the car, that Tovar drew his weapon and ordered Jones out of the car. Jones exited the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We conclude it was at that point, when Jones exited the car, and <em>not before, </em>that Jones was seized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>For example, on facts quite similar to the instant case, in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>212 F.3d 1313 (D.C.Cir.2000), two police officers saw a woman leaning into the passenger window of a car in a parking lot and handing the defendant an object. The parking lot was in a high-crime area. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>made a shoving down motion. At that point, the officers approached the car with guns drawn. One officer \u201cshouted \u2018Let me see your hands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">If the seizure had taken place at that point, we doubt very much whether it would have been valid____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">We need not focus on those questions, however, because we do not think the seizure took place immediately after Johnson\u2019s first \u201cshoving down\u201d motion, when [the police officer] drew his gun and ordered Johnson to raise his hands. Under <em>California v. Hodari D, </em>499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991), a seizure requires the application of physical force or submission to an assertion of authority. Before Johnson raised his hands, [the police officer] had made a show of authority but Johnson had not submitted to it. On the contrary, he continued to make \u201cshoving down\u201d motions, gestures that were the very opposite of complying with [the police officer\u2019s] order, and which a reasonable officer could have thought were actually suggestive of hiding (or retrieving) a gun. In sum, by the time the stop actually took place, it was supported by Johnson\u2019s continued furtive gestures in response to being confronted by a police officer, and that was suspicious enough to support a reasonable belief that Johnson may have been engaged in criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Having determined when the seizure of Jones occurred, the next inquiry is, did the police officers have a reasonably articulable suspicion, at the time of that seizure, that Jones may be involved in criminal activity and was aimed and dangerous?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">A police officer may elevate a consensual encounter with a citizen into an investigatory detention only if the officer has a \u201creasonable suspicion supported by articulate facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot,\u2019 even if the officer lacks probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). Reasonable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>is a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). That being said, as we noted in <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 445, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201c[tjhere is no \u2018litmus test\u2019 for reasonable suspicion. Each instance of police conduct must be judged for reasonableness in light of the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Castaneda v.

In addition, \u201c[RJeasonableness is judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene allowing for the need of split-second decisions and without regard to the officer\u2019s intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Scott v.

The potential concealed weapon to which we here refer is not the bowie knife (though the same was concealed from Tovar\u2019s, but not Bates\u2019, observation); rather, we refer to that which was the \u201cblack object,\u201d ultimately the black bag, which Jones retrieved from \u201cunderneath\u201d the car seat, despite being thrice told not to reach under that seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In <em>Andrews, </em>37 Va.App. 479, 559 S.E.2d 401, the defendant walked away when police stopped to talk to him and his companions, did not provide his address, and had what appeared to be a heavy object in his center jacket pocket. After noting the original encounter was consensual, this Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Based on the totality of the circumstances and in light of [the police officer\u2019s] observations and his training and experience as a police officer, we find that [the police officer] had reasonable cause to believe that Andrews might be carrying a concealed weapon and that the investigatory stop and limited pat-down search for weapons were warranted to protect himself and others who might be in danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 559 S.E.2d at 408.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The consensus of other courts also supports our conclusion. Each case that follows, as in <em>Andrews, </em>began as a consensual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>encounter, which, as here, resulted in a seizure justified by the defendant\u2019s acts subsequent to that encounter. Moreover, each seizure was based upon a reasonably articulable suspicion that the defendant possessed a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>State v. Holland, </em>356 Ill.App.3d 150, 292 Ill.Dec. 481, 826 N.E.2d 622, <em>pet. for leave to appeal denied, </em>214 Ill.2d 542, 294 Ill.Dec. 6, 830 N.E.2d 6 (2005), the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">Defendant does not contend that the questioning amounted to a seizure. Just before [the police officer] was posing these questions to defendant, defendant put his hand behind his back in such a way [the police officer] reasonably suspected that defendant was concealing something. After the officers asked to see defendant\u2019s hands, defendant quickly reached to the front of his waistband, stepped towards the railing, and turned as if trying to proceed up the stairs____ Given [the police officer\u2019s] law enforcement experience, his observations, and the reasonable inferences he drew from those observations, we hold that [the police officer] had reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was concealing a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 627-28.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">The danger to officer safety that justifies a protective search may arise after a consensual encounter ... has commenced.... Thus, the Fourth Amendment inquiry as to whether a protective search was reasonable must focus on the circumstances confronting an officer when he made the decision to frisk. And while subsequently gathered facts cannot \u201ccure\u201d an otherwise unreasonable <em>Terry </em>stop, an individual\u2019s actions during a consensual encounter may both crystallize previously unconfirmed suspicions of criminal activity and give rise to legitimate concerns for officer safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\"><em>United States v.

Black, </em>525 F.3d 359 (4th Cir.2008), addressed the question raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">That court began its opinion: \u201cDuring the course of a voluntary citizen-police encounter, City of Richmond (Virginia) police seized Sean Black, in a constitutional sense, patted him down, and, after discovering an illegal firearm, arrested him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The police approached Black, and others, in a \u201chigh-crime\u201d area. <em>Id. </em>'When the police spoke to Black, he had his hand in his right-hand pocket, as if grasping an object. Told to remove his hand from his pocket, Black hesitated, but complied. <em>Id. </em>The officer noticed a bulge in the pocket, which he suspected might be a gun. Black told the officer his pocket contained either his money or his \u201cID.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. Black then put his hand back in his pocket. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Only at this point in the encounter did [the police officer] put his hand on his own gun and tell Black, \u201c[T]ake your hand out of your pocket. I don\u2019t want to have to shoot you.\u201d [The police officer] then ordered Black to move to the police car and thus had effectively seized him for Fourth Amendment purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">In the totality of these circumstances, we conclude [the police officer] had a reasonable suspicion that Black had a firearm concealed in his pocket, in violation of Virginia law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>and therefore was justified in conducting a <em>Terry </em>stop and patting Black down.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdW\"><em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The foregoing analysis has considered whether a defendant\u2019s actions generated a reasonable articulable suspicion <em>during a consensual encounter </em>that the defendant possessed a concealed weapon and was, accordingly, armed and dangerous, thus justifying the seizure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We note, but do not hold, that we cannot perceive any legal or logical reason for the application of a different reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>articulable standard, permitting a search for weapons, during a consensual encounter, or one following a stop. The question in the latter is, was the stop justified, permitting the officer to be in the presence of the defendant; in the former, there is no question but that the officer was legally in the presence of the defendant. But in both instances, the police officer was legally justified in his presence with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With the foregoing notation, we shall cite cases, where, given the justification on other grounds for a stop, the defendant\u2019s subsequent actions permitted a search, and one specifically for weapons. These cases are persuasive, we believe, in an evaluation of the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 actions in the instant case. <em>State v. Parizek, </em>678 N.W.2d 154, 160 (N.D.2004) (\u201cReaching into one\u2019s pockets after being told not to do so gives an officer an articulable suspicion that the subject might be armed and dangerous.\u201d); <em>State v. Mann, </em>271 Conn. 300, 857 A.2d 329, 346 (2004) (\u201ca suspect\u2019s attempt to reach into his pocket or some other place where a weapon may be concealed is a fact that supports a reasonable suspicion that the subject is armed and dangerous\u201d); <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>385 F.3d 786, 789-90 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\u201cDuring the traffic stop, [the police officer] observed Holmes reaching under his seat as if to hide or retrieve a weapon.... Once out of the car, Holmes kept reaching for his back pocket despite continued warnings from the officers. These circumstances certainly gave [the police officer] ample reason to be ... \u2018concerned that [defendant] could be ... armed.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Soares, </em>521 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cOnce the car was stopped Soares refused repeated orders to remain still and keep his hands in [the police officer\u2019s] view____ [The police officer] ... could reasonably have thought that Soares was reaching for a weapon.\u201d); <em>United States v.

Although [the police officer] testified he was not sure Moore-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>field was attempting to hide narcotics or a firearm ... Moore-field\u2019s behavior embodied the kind of specific, articulable fact that <em>Terry </em>contemplates and, therefore, warranted a pat-down search for weapons.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cornelius, </em>391 F.3d 965, 968 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cAt the time that [the police officer] seized Cornelius, i.e. at the time he grabbed Cornelius\u2019s right arm and placed him against the patrol car, [the police officer] had observed two specific actions that he believed endangered his safety: (1) Cornelius had placed his hand in his jacket pocket; and (2) Cornelius had failed to follow [the police officer\u2019s] directive to remove his hand from his pocket. The totality of these circumstances gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that Cornelius was armed and dangerous and thus justified [the police officer] in taking the action that he did.\u201d); <em>State v. Kyles, </em>269 Wis.2d 1, 675 N.W.2d 449, 452 (2004) (\u201cWe conclude ... that an individual\u2019s failure to keep his hands in the officer\u2019s sight is a significant factor in determining the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s suspicion that the individual being frisked might be armed and dangerous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, we note the bedrock principle underlying the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">The <em>crux </em>of this case ... is not the propriety of Officer McFadden\u2019s taking steps to investigate petitioner\u2019s suspicious behavior, but rather, whether there was justification for McFadden\u2019s invasion of Terry\u2019s personal security by searching him for weapons in the course of that investigation. We are now concerned with more than the government interest in investigating crime; in addition, there is the more immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him. Certainly it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties. American criminals have a long tradition of armed violence, and every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>year in this country many law enforcement officers are killed in the line of duty, and thousands more are wounded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atm\"><em>Id. </em>at 23, 88 S.Ct. at 1881 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In this case, Sergeant Tovar testified: \u201cMy concern was that I was going to get shot.\u201d That concern was based upon his reasonable articulable suspicion that Jones was reaching for a concealed weapon. \u201cThe law does not expect a police officer must gamble on turning away from a possible danger and chance taking a bullet in the back----\u201d <em>Lansdown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 212, 308 S.E.2d 106, 111 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1104, 104 S.Ct. 1604, 80 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\n<em>SEARCH OF THE BAG</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Jones also argues that it was unreasonable for the police to open the black bag. After the police realized that the bag was not a gun, the argument continues, they should have returned the bag to Jones without opening it. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_g\">[T]he search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u201d the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-10\"><em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). \u201cContrary to Long\u2019s view, <em>Terry </em>need not be read as restricting the preventative search to the person of the detained suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1047, 103 S.Ct. at 3480. \u201c[P]olice officers may, whenever they possess an articulable and objectively reasonable belief that a suspect is presently or potentially dangerous, conduct a protective search of the area within the suspect\u2019s immediate control.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 519, 371 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1988). \u201cSecond, it does not matter that the search was of a closed container; a valid <em>Long </em>search extends to closed con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>tainers, such as the pouch, that are found within the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment.\u201d <em>United States v.

But whether it always allows search of a container large enough to contain a weapon is unclear. For one thing, the Court in <em>Long </em>had no occasion to consider whether, if the container is soft, a \u201cpat-down\u201d of it and discovery of a hard object within are prerequisites to search into the container, just as is true of search of the suspect\u2019s person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.6(e), at 685 (4th ed.2004). In <em>Shranklen, </em>the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the police were not required to pat down a soft container and detect a hard object before opening the container. <em>Shranklen, </em>315 F.3d at 963. We need not address that question here because the record before us proves that the bag was within Jones\u2019 immediate control, that the bag was big enough to contain a weapon, <em>and </em>that Detective Bates did feel a hard object inside the bag <em>before </em>he opened it. Given our earlier holding that the police had a reasonable suspicion that Jones was armed and dangerous, it follows that Detective Bates\u2019 subsequent search of the black bag was a reasonable search pursuant to <em>Long. See also, Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 27, 434 S.E.2d 918 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">It would defeat the purpose of a protective pat-down search to require a police officer, who seizes a closed container during a pat-down search on the reasonable suspicion that it contained a weapon, to return the container unexamined simply because it is neither a weapon nor evidence of a crime. \u201cPolice officers need not risk a shot in the back by returning containers which they reasonably suspect contain a dangerous weapon but may lack probable cause to seize.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_f\"><em>Id. </em>at 31, 434 S.E.2d at 921 (quoting <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>67 Haw. 181, 683 P.2d 822, 827 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>On brief, Jones argues that our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 570 S.E.2d 836 (2002), compels a different result. We disagree. In <em>Murphy, </em>a police officer was inside a house executing a search warrant, frisked the defendant for weapons, and felt a bulge in the defendant\u2019s left pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 570 S.E.2d at 838. The officer \u201cfelt a bulge of plastic\u201d and removed a plastic bag from the defendant\u2019s pocket because he knew from his experience that marijuana is often packaged in similar bags. <em>Id. </em>Our Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">[The police officerj\u2019s conclusion that the bag contained marijuana was not based on his tactile perception of the bag\u2019s contents. Rather, his sense of touch revealed only that there was a plastic bag in Murphy\u2019s pocket. Thus, Officer Harvey lacked probable cause to seize the item from Murphy\u2019s pocket because the character of the bag\u2019s contents as contraband was not immediately apparent from the frisk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 570 S.E.2d at 839. \u201cThe purpose of this \u2018pat down\u2019 is not to uncover evidence of criminal activity, but to permit the officer to conduct his investigation without encountering a violent response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 570 S.E.2d at 839. In <em>Murphy, </em>the search of the defendant exceeded the scope of a frisk for weapons. The trial court, therefore, erred in not suppressing the drugs because the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine of <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993), did not apply when the character of the bag\u2019s contents was not apparent from the frisk. <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 574-75, 570 S.E.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Murphy </em>does not control the outcome of this case because nothing in the record suggests that the trial court incorrectly applied the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine in denying Jones\u2019 motion to suppress. Unlike the officer in <em>Murphy, </em>Detective Bates felt a hard object inside Jones\u2019 bag before he opened it. Pursuant to <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Long, </em>it was reasonable for Bates to open the bag to determine whether or not it contained a weapon before returning the bag to Jones. The trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>not err in denying Jones\u2019 motion to suppress, and we affirm Jones\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. A search of the BMW revealed a second large Bowie knife, $1,475 in cash, cell phones, and more marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. On brief, Jones argues that he was seized at the time Sergeant Tovar first said: \u201cCan you put your hands on the steering wheel.\u201d He relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>upon. <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 232, 532 S.E.2d 25 (2000), in support of his argument that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Above and beyond the observation that Jones <em>did not comply </em>with this request, we find the reliance on <em>Reittinger </em>misplaced. The trial court had found that Reittinger, as a reasonable person, would <em>not </em>have felt free to leave, despite being told he was \"free to leave\u201d by the police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 532 S.E.2d at 27. Nonetheless, the trial court admitted the challenged evidence on the grounds the officer articulated a reasonable suspicion Reittinger was armed during a continued seizure, justifying a protective frisk. Despite finding, in contrast to the trial court, that Reittinger was not seized, a panel of this Court reversed the conviction on the grounds that the protective frisk of Reittinger was not constitutionally justified. <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 80, 502 S.E.2d 151 (1998). The case continued en banc. There, this Court, though agreeing with the panel that defendant had not been seized after being told he was \"free to leave,\u201d reversed the panel, finding a subsequent frisk during the ensuing consensual encounter was proper. <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, 29 </em>Va.App. 724, 514 S.E.2d 775 (1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia reversed on the grounds that Reittinger, as a reasonable person, would not have felt free to leave and was, accordingly, seized. That Court said: \"Therefore, we conclude ... that the trial court, though correct about the seizure, erred in refusing to suppress the product of the unlawful seizure and search....\u201d <em>Reittinger, 260 </em>Va. at 237, 532 S.E.2d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In <em>Malbrough, </em>275 Va. 163, 655 S.E.2d 1, our Supreme Court distinguished <em>Reittinger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">The most significant distinction between <em>Reittinger </em>and the present case is that in <em>Reittinger, </em>the trial judge, who alone had the opportunity to look the witnesses in the eye and weigh their credibility, expressly found that the deputy effectively seized Reittinger without probable cause because a reasonable person in the circumstances would conclude that his detention continued and that he was not free to leave. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 532 S.E.2d at 27. Here, the trial court, after analyzing all the attendant circumstances, made the opposite finding and concluded that a reasonable person would have felt free to ignore the request and leave the scene when Fortier asked Malbrough to consent to a search of his person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 171, 655 S.E.2d at 5. In Jones' case, the trial court did <em>not </em>find that the police seized Jones without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Thus, the deference to the trial court mentioned in <em>Malbrough </em>is equally appropriate here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">.
