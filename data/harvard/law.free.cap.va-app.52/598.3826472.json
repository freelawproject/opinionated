Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 717, 636 S.E.2d 395 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d, Virginia v. Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008), held that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See Cross v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 484, 642 S.E.2d 763 (2007). We therefore reversed appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. <em>Id. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court awarded an appeal from this decision, and, by order entered June 6, 2008, remanded the case to this Court for reconsideration in light of the holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the United States Supreme Court in <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Upon reconsideration, we vacate our prior holding on this issue. For the reasons stated in <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1608, we now hold that the trial court did not err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Therefore, we affirm his conviction for possession of cocaine. Accordingly, that part of the Court\u2019s opinion with regard to that conviction is withdrawn and that part of the mandate with regard thereto is vacated. We reaffirm our prior decision regarding the charge of obstruction of justice in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-460. <em>Cross, </em>49 Va.App. at 491, 642 S.E.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">This order shall be published and certified to the clerk of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
