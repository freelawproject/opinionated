Defendant received a mandatory 100-month prison sentence for his crime. ORS 137.700(2)(a)(J) (setting a mandatory minimum sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment for first-degree rape under ORS 163.375(l)(a)). On appeal, defendant urges us to remand for resentencing because the trial court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Rodriguez/Buck, </em>347 Or 46, 217 P3d 659 (2009), which clarified the test for assessing the proportionality of a sentence for purposes of Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution. We agree with defendant that the trial court should be allowed to reconsider its decision \u2014 including making any necessary factual findings \u2014 with regard to the proportionality of defendant\u2019s sentence. We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In early 2007, the victim, defendant\u2019s wife, called the police to report that defendant had raped her. The police investigated the report, including interviewing defendant. According to the interviewing detectives, defendant essentially admitted that he had physically forced the victim to have sexual intercourse with him and believed that it was his \u201cright\u201d to have sex with her. Defendant was subsequently charged with first-degree rape under ORS 163.375(l)(a), which makes it a crime to have sexual intercourse with a person by \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At trial, the victim testified that she and defendant were in bed together when defendant climbed on top of her. She told defendant that she did not want to have sex, and defendant then accused her of having an affair with someone else and threatened to kill her if that were the case. Defendant grabbed the victim\u2019s arms and forced them above her head; she struggled to fight defendant off but was unable to do so. She testified that defendant \u201c[w]as using force when he inserted his penis,\u201d that she was crying, and that it hurt \u201c[a] little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Defendant also testified at trial. He denied that he had ever forced the victim to have sexual intercourse with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>him, and further denied telling the investigating officers that it was his right to have intercourse with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree rape, and the case proceeded to sentencing. Under Ballot Measure 11 (1994), codified at ORS 137.700 to ORS 137.707, the offense of first-degree rape carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 100 months in prison. ORS 137.700(2)(a)(J). At the sentencing hearing, which occurred in 2007, defendant\u2019s counsel argued against the imposition of that Measure 11 sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201cYour Honor, objecting to a mandatory Measure 11 sentence is pretty much just for purposes of hearing my own voice, I think, but I will make the objection. I think as it is imposed in this case, it is cruel and unusual. It does not fit the facts as proposed. For instance, in a similar \u2014 the charge could have been the same if this were stranger to stranger, if he had simply accosted somebody in the park that he had never known, and those people would be similarly situated according to the implementation of Measure 11 under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cI object to Measure 11 generally simply because it removes all discretion from the Court in consideration of the specific circumstances of each individual as situated before the Court and destroys that discretion. But, as I indicated, there\u2019s really nothing much else we can say about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The trial court next gave defendant himself an opportunity to speak, and defendant again professed his innocence. At that point, the trial court indicated that it was sympathetic to defendant\u2019s argument but was legally bound to impose a Measure 11 sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201cThe problem is the way the statute\u2019s written, based on something that was passed by the people of the State of Oregon, there\u2019s a mandatory 100-month sentence that you have to serve when you\u2019re convicted of this crime. And the jury convicted you of the crime, so that\u2019s the sentence. I will say that I find that this is a \u2014 under Article I, section 16,1 think that this is disproportionate based on what you did versus all the other crimes that are covered in this category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cI don\u2019t have any discretion, but I would never have given you this 100-month sentence absent Measure 11. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>I don\u2019t have a choice right now. I\u2019ve made a record. If the Court of Appeals wants to look at it in this case, feel free. And the Appellate Courts have never overturned any. The Federal Court hasn\u2019t either. But I do think it\u2019s a disproportionate sentence under the Federal and State Constitution. But we\u2019ll see what the Courts say about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">\u201cSo at this point I\u2019m not in a position to overturn it, so I will impose the mandatory sentence. And you\u2019ll have those issues to raise on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The court then entered a judgment sentencing defendant to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2009 opinion in <em>Rodriguez/Buck </em>\u2014 which was decided well after the 2007 sentencing in this case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014 it is apparent that defendant\u2019s trial counsel and the trial court felt unduly constrained by Measure 11. According to defendant, <em>Rodriguez /Buck </em>held that \u201cthe imposition of a sub-Measure 11 sentence may be appropriate in certain cases to avoid results that would \u2018shock the moral sense\u2019 of reasonable people and thus violate the Oregon Constitution\u2019s ban on disproportionate sentences.\u201d Here, defendant contends, \u201cthe trial court found that the imposition of a Measure 11 sentence was indeed unconstitutionally disproportionate, but because the trial court believed it lacked the discretion to impose any lesser sentence it imposed the Measure 11 sentence anyway. This erroneous decision entitles defendant to resentencing.\u201d Defendant further argues that he is entitled to supplement the record with additional facts consistent with his challenge to the proportionality of the Measure 11 sentence in light of the <em>Rodriguez/Buck </em>decision and to present new arguments to the sentencing court based on a full record. Defendant relies on <em>State v. Wilson, </em>243 Or App 464, 259 P3d 1004 (2011), in which we remanded for the trial court to reconsider the proportionality of a Measure 11 sentence under the principles articulated in <em>Rodriguez \u00a1Buck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The state opposes a remand. In its view, the proportionality of defendant\u2019s sentence poses a pure question of law. The state argues that there are no remaining factual questions for the sentencing court (as there were in <em>Wilson) </em>and urges us to consider \u2014 and reject \u2014 defendant\u2019s proportionality argument based on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Under Article I, section 16, \u201call penalties shall be proportioned to the offense.\u201d The proportionality of a penalty is evaluated by whether the imposition of the sentence \u201cwould shock the moral sense of reasonable people.\u201d <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>343 Or 652, 670-71, 175 P3d 438 (2007) (synthesizing the court\u2019s earlier case law concerning the proportionality provision of Article I, section 16). In <em>Rodriguez/Buck, </em>the court \u201cclarified\u201d the application of that proportionality test by identifying \u201c\u2018at least three factors\u2019\u201d that \u201cbear upon the \u2018ultimate conclusion\u2019 whether a sentence would shock the moral sense of reasonable people.\u201d <em>State v. Alwinger, </em>236 Or App 240, 243, 236 P3d 755 (2010) <em>(quoting Rodriguez/Buck, </em>347 Or at 57-58). Those three factors are \u201c(1) a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime; (2) a comparison of the penalties imposed for other, related crimes; and (3) the criminal history of the defendant.\u201d <em>Rodriguez/Buck, </em>347 Or at 58. The Supreme Court, after considering the factors, affirmed the trial courts\u2019 departure sentences from the Measure 11 mandatory minimum sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The parties focus on <em>Wilson, </em>a <em>post-Rodriguez/Buck </em>case, in which we elected to remand for the trial court to assess proportionality in the first instance. In <em>Wilson, </em>the defendant had been convicted, after a bench trial, of first-degree sexual abuse. The defense theory had been that the defendant was not competent to stand trial and was unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. At sentencing, the defendant had argued that, under <em>Rodriguez/Buck, </em>his Measure 11 sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate because of his diminished mental capacity; the state had responded that the court was not permitted to consider that characteristic of the defendant. The court imposed the Measure 11 sentence over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>On appeal, the state conceded that its position at trial regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity had been incorrect, and we accepted that concession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201cWe agree with the parties that the trial court can take into account a defendant\u2019s mental capacity when determining whether a Measure 11 sentence violates Article I, section 16. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u00abHi * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cRegarding the first factor [a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime], the court [in <em>Rodriguez I Buck] </em>explained,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201c \u2018In considering a defendant\u2019s claim that a penalty is constitutionally disproportionate as applied to that defendant *** a court may consider, among other things, the specific circumstances and facts of the defendant\u2019s conduct that come within the statutory definition of the offense, as well as other <em>case-specific factors, </em>such as <em>characteristics of the defendant </em>and the victim, the harm to the victim, and the relationship between the defendant and the victim.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\"><em>\u201cId. </em>at 62 (emphasis added). The trial court, however, believed that the italicized language above refers to \u2018the kind of situation where there\u2019s some kind of relationship between [the offender and the victim] where it may be inappropriate.\u2019 That consideration, however, is captured in the subsequent phrase, \u2018the relationship between the defendant and the victim.\u2019 Characteristics of either the defendant or the victim, or both, may be considered, and if the trial court believed otherwise, that was legal error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\"><em>Wilson, </em>243 Or App at 468-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Although some of the trial court\u2019s remarks at sentencing suggested that it had adopted the state\u2019s overly narrow view of <em>Rodriguez /Buck, </em>the state did not concede as much. The state instead contended that, notwithstanding its arguments, the trial court had applied the law correctly and considered defendant\u2019s mental capacity as a factor in the proportionality analysis. We declined to resolve that question on appeal, choosing to remand. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">\u201cWe could parse the court\u2019s statement in an attempt to discern whether defendant or the state correctly characterizes it, but we decline to do so for two reasons. First, to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>so would be to presume that the court\u2019s oral colloquy with defendant was intended to be a definitive and carefully reasoned explanation for its decision. In fact, it more closely resembles the thinking out loud of a judge struggling with a troubling and difficult decision that is not susceptible to (nor intended to be subjected to) the kind of analysis that we apply to statutes or written judicial opinions. Second, there is no need for us to engage in an exercise that, in the final analysis, would result only in an interpretation of ambiguous language, when we can remand the case for a more authoritative disambiguation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><em>Wilson, </em>243 Or App at 469-70. We added, by way of a footnote, this caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThis opinion should not be taken to imply that the proper consideration of defendant\u2019s mental capacity would necessarily lead to a different sentence, nor to imply that such a sentence would or would not be a violation of Article I, section 16. That is a decision, in the first instance, for the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 470 n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">This case presents the same prudential concerns as <em>Wilson. </em>Here, the trial court concluded that it was bound to impose a Measure 11 sentence even though it believed that \u201cit\u2019s a disproportionate sentence under the Federal and State Constitution.\u201d Without the benefit of <em>Rodriguez/Buck, </em>the trial court identified certain factors that, in its view, rendered the sentence unconstitutional, including that \u201cthis is disproportionate based on what you did versus all the other crimes that are covered in this category\u201d; that there was no physical injury; and that the parties had an existing relationship. But, just as in <em>Wilson, </em>it is not clear whether the court\u2019s \u201coral colloquy with defendant was intended to be a definitive and carefully reasoned explanation for its decision,\u201d or whether it was instead \u201cthe thinking out loud of a judge struggling with a troubling and difficult decision that is not susceptible to (nor intended to be subjected to) the kind of analysis that we apply to statutes or written judicial opinions.\u201d 243 Or App at 469. For purposes of reviewing the court\u2019s ruling, we could speculate as to whether the court properly considered the relevant case-specific factors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>made any necessary factual findings, but, as in <em>Wilson, </em>\u201cthere is no need for us to engage in an exercise that, in the final analysis, would result only in an interpretation of ambiguous language, when we can remand the case for a more authoritative disambiguation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469-70. Accordingly, we remand for the trial court to resentence defendant with the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rodriguez! Buck</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The state acknowledges that, on remand, defendant will have the opportunity to submit additional evidence, and defendant argues that the parties would develop the record differently in two areas, because, had defendant\u2019s counsel believed that a realistic argument could be made, he could and would have focused on details of the crime and investigated and developed defendant-specific facts as permitted in <em>Rodriguez /Buck.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Sentence vacated and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> Defendant was convicted and sentenced in 2007, and he timely appealed. Despite the trial court\u2019s effort to frame the issue for appeal, defendant\u2019s original appellate counsel did not challenge the constitutionality of his sentence. In 2010, a post-conviction court concluded that defendant\u2019s appellate counsel had been constitutionally inadequate in failing to raise that issue, thereby giving defendant this subsequent opportunity to raise the constitutionality of his sentence on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> Since <em>Rodriguez/Buck, </em>we have addressed the merits of some proportionality challenges based on the record before us, rather than remanding for the trial court to consider the relevant factors in the first instance. <em>E.g., State v. Johnson, </em>244 Or App 574, 583-85, 260 P3d 782 (2011) (applying, in the first instance, the factors identified in <em>Rodriguez/Buck </em>to determine whether the defendant\u2019s sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate); <em>State v. Baker, </em>233 Or App 536, 226 P3d 125, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 414 (2010) (same); <em>State v. Shaw, </em>233 Or App 427, 225 P3d 855, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 415 (2010) <em>(same);Alwinger, </em>236 Or App 240 (same). In none of those cases, however, did the defendant timely argue that we should remand based on the sentencing court\u2019s misapprehension of its authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> As we similarly noted in <em>Wilson, </em>243 Or App at 469 n 2, this opinion should not be read to imply that a Measure 11 sentence would or would not be a violation of Article I, section 16, or be read as an endorsement of the factors that the court identified in 2007. Rather, our remand simply allows the trial court in the first instance to address the question of proportionality in light of <em>Rodriguez /Buck.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
