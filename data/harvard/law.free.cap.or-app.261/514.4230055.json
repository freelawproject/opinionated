J.</author>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Following a guilty plea, defendant was convicted of attempted murder, ORS 163.115, ORS 161.405; two counts of first-degree robbery, ORS 164.415; two counts of second-degree assault, ORS 163.175; two counts of unlawful use of a firearm, ORS 166.220, ORS 161.610; and two counts of menacing, ORS 163.190. The court sentenced defendant to 90 months of imprisonment followed by 36 months of post-prison supervision on the attempted murder and robbery convictions. The court ordered that two of the 90-month sentences along with 60 months of the third 90-month sentence run consecutively. It also imposed 70 months of imprisonment with 36 months of post-prison supervision on the assault convictions, 60-month \u201cgun-minimum\u201d sentences on the unlawful-use-of-a-weapon convictions, and 180 days of jail on the menacing convictions. Those sentences were imposed concurrently with each other and with the sentences on the attempted murder and robbery convictions. In addition, in an amended judgment, the court imposed restitution in the amount of $10,966.27. Defendant raises two assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In his first assignment of error, defendant asserts that the court erred in entering a judgment imposing restitution more than 90 days after sentencing and without giving him an opportunity to be heard. <em>See </em>ORS 137.106(l)(b) (2011)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the court must determine restitution within 90 days of original judgment and enter a supplemental judgment establishing a \u201cspecific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages,\u201d but the court may \u201cextend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause\u201d); ORS 137.106(5) (\u201cIf a defendant objects to the imposition, amount or distribution of the restitution, the court shall allow the defendant to be heard on such issue * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the state concedes that \u201cthe trial court erred by imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>restitution without holding a hearing or making a record that established \u2018good cause\u2019 to extend the restitution determination beyond 90 days of entry of the original judgment.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Beckham, </em>253 Or App 609, 612-13, 292 P3d 611 (2012) (trial court erred in imposing restitution, without a hearing or evidence as to the amount of damages, more than 90 days after entry of the original judgment). The state asserts that the case must be remanded for resentencing pursuant to ORS 138.222(5), which provides that, if \u201cthe appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.\u201d According to the state, at the hearing on remand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201cthe state will have an opportunity to make a record to establish that \u2018good cause\u2019 existed at the time of the amended judgment to impose restitution outside the 90-day window. For example, the state could make a record of any correspondence between the parties that exists that would demonstrate whether defendant was responsible for, agreed to, or acquiesced in, the delay, the proposed amount of restitution, or the entry of the amended judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Furthermore, according to the state, the court could alter the \u201csentencing package\u201d on remand by, for example, imposing a compensatory fine or other sanction. We agree with the state that a remand for resentencing is appropriate under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Beckham, </em>253 Or App at 619 (remanding in a misdemeanor case for the trial court to determine whether restitution could permissibly be awarded); <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>247 Or App 334, 337-38, 269 P3d 104 (2011), <em>rev dismissed, </em>354 Or 491 (2013) (error in imposing restitution required resentencing where the trial court could impose a compensatory fine); <em>State v. Tippetts, </em>239 Or App 429, 432, 244 P3d 891 (2010) (where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>an error in imposing restitution, ORS 138.222(5) requires remand for resentencing \u201cso long as there remain options that the trial court could permissibly adopt on resentencing\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing multiple gun-minimum sentences with respect to the unlawful-use-of-a-weapon convictions. Although defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve that issue before the trial court, he asserts that we should review it as error apparent on the record. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (court has discretion to review unpreserved error apparent on the face of the record); <em>State v. Saechao, </em>256 Or App 369, 371, 300 P3d 287 (2013) (imposition of multiple gun minimum sentences is plain error). As discussed, this case must be remanded for resentencing. Accordingly, defendant will have the opportunity to raise this issue before the trial court on remand; therefore, we need not exercise our discretion to review the plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Judgment awarding restitution vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\"> ORS 137.106 was amended in 2013.

DeCamp, </em>158 Or App 238, 241, 973 P2d 922 (1999) (a party is not required to raise a contemporaneous objection \u201cwhen the party was not on notice of the trial court\u2019s intended action and had no opportunity to be present when the trial court acted\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
