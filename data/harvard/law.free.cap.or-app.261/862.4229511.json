ORS 426.005(l)(e) (2011), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 360, \u00a7 15. He contends, in an unpreserved assignment of error, that the trial court erred in failing to inform him of the possible results of the proceedings and of his right to subpoena witnesses, as required by ORS 426.100(l)(c) and (d) (2011), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 360, \u00a7 24. In his second assignment of error, he contends that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that he had a mental disorder that caused him to be a danger to others. The state concedes that it was plain error for the trial court not to advise appellant of his right to subpoena witnesses and that the error requires reversal. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and exercise our discretion to correct the error Accordingly, we reverse. <em>See, e. g., State v. M. L. R., </em>256 Or App 566, 303 P3d 954 (2013) (reversing as plain error trial court\u2019s failure to advise alleged mentally ill person of the right to subpoena witnesses). That disposition obviates the need to address appellant\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
