Defendant argues that the state failed to establish the foundation needed to admit scientific evidence and that the deputy did not have the expertise to offer that evidence.

We reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We review rulings as to whether evidence is scientific and whether it is admissible as such for errors of law. <em>State v. Helgeson, </em>220 Or App 285, 290, 185 P3d 545 (2008) (citing <em>State v. Owens, </em>207 Or App 31, 37, 139 P3d 984 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 503 (2007)). We also review the admissibility of expert testimony for legal error. <em>State v. Dunning, </em>245 Or App 582, 589, 263 P3d 372 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">At 2:23 p.m. on a Friday afternoon, a United States Forest Service deputy noticed defendant and defendant\u2019s friend, Bandy, cutting firewood next to a Jeep in a public campground. Upon investigation, the deputy observed that defendant was visibly intoxicated. Defendant told the deputy that defendant had driven to the campground and had been there for only 15 minutes. The deputy noticed one beer can on the ground but did not see any others. At the scene and at trial, defendant claimed that he did not drink alcohol before driving to the campground, but, at the scene, he allowed that he had consumed four or five beers earlier in the day. Bandy told the deputy that defendant had consumed only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>one beer since arriving at the campground. He estimated that defendant had been there for only 15 minutes. After partially completing field sobriety tests, the deputy arrested defendant for DUII and transported him to the Josephine County Jail for a breath test. That test recorded that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was .17 percent at 4:03 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">At trial, defendant recounted that he had been at the campground for 45 minutes or an hour and that he had consumed \u201cfour or five beers\u201d and a couple of shots of whiskey while there. The state recalled the deputy on rebuttal to testify to the absorption and elimination of alcohol in an individual\u2019s blood and to the corresponding BAC. Defendant unsuccessfully objected to the deputy\u2019s testimony. The deputy testified to the rate of absorption for alcohol in the blood per standard alcoholic beverage ingested; the rate of elimination of alcohol in the blood over time; and the amount of alcohol defendant would have had to consume to reach a .17 percent BAC as compared to an adult of another size or sex.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The deputy concluded that, in order to reach defendant\u2019s breath test results, defendant \u201cwould have had to have consumed a significant amount of alcohol, certainly more than what he\u2019s indicated * * * \u201d The jury found defendant guilty, and the court entered a judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The state argues that defendant did not properly preserve for appeal his contentions concerning whether the deputy\u2019s testimony was admissible as scientific evidence and whether the deputy was qualified to testify as an expert. \u201cOrdinarily, this court will not consider an issue on appeal unless it was first presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, 665, 307 P3d 552 (2013); see <em>also Kaptur and Kaptur, </em>256 Or App 591, 594, 302 P3d 819 (2013); ORAP 5.45(1). At trial, a party must raise an issue with \u201cenough particularity to assure that the trial court was able to identify its alleged error so as to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Kaptur, </em>256 Or App at 594 (internal quotation marks omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>When the deputy began to address the BAC topic, defendant objected, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">\u201cThis is scientific evidence that Officer Thomas does not have the \u2014 the\u2014there is no foundation laid for him to be able to get this testimony. As to the correlation of alcohol consumption and the actual blood alcohol number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The trial court responded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cthis is * * * in the in-between-land between scientific evidence and * * * lay opinion evidence. And it\u2019s come up before, and I think that an officer with this officer\u2019s background probably is entitled to testify about the amount of alcohol that it would take to get to a .17, so long as there\u2019s adequate foundation laid. * * * I think there\u2019s been enough foundation as to his experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The state indicated that the deputy would testify as to both absorption and elimination rates of alcohol in the blood. The court determined that the state was also permitted to pose questions regarding \u201cdissipation rates\u201d of alcohol. Defendant\u2019s objection to \u201cfoundation\u201d and to \u201ccorrelation\u201d addresses the scientific nature of the evidence \u2014 a calculation used to determine defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption based on his BAC at a particular point in time. That objection is the same argument that defendant advances on appeal. Defendant presented that argument to the court with enough particularity to satisfy preservation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the deputy was not qualified to testify as an expert is a closer question of preservation. Defendant\u2019s objection was incomplete: \u201cThis is scientific evidence that Officer Thomas does not have the\u2014 the \u2014 * * * \u201d After the court\u2019s rulings, defendant asked, \u201cIs he qualified to \u2014 ,\u201d before being cut short by the court as the jury returned. Preservation requirements serve a practical purpose, that is, \u201cto advance goals such as ensuring that the positions of the parties are presented clearly to the initial tribunal and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u201d <em>Whitmore, </em>257 Or App at 666 (quoting <em>Taylor v. Ramsay-Gerding Construction Co., </em>233 Or App 272, 283, 226 P3d 45, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>235 Or App 524, 234 P3d 129 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We are also mindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that \u201c[particularly in criminal cases, in which there is a premium on considerations of cost and speed, the realities of trial practice may be such that fairly abbreviated shorthand references suffice to put all on notice about the nature of a party\u2019s arguments.\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 550, 258 P3d 1228 (2011). The trial court addressed both foundational requirements as to the evidence as scientific, as well as the deputy\u2019s qualification to testify as to that evidence based on his experience. It is evident from the court\u2019s response that the court understood defendant\u2019s objection to include the deputy\u2019s qualifications as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We proceed to the merits of defendant\u2019s argument that the deputy\u2019s testimony was scientific in nature and lacked a proper foundation. \u201c[T]he key question in determining whether proffered testimony is \u2018scientific,\u2019 and thus requires a special foundation, is whether the expert\u2019s assertions possess significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions.\u201d <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 193, 279 P3d 361 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 562, 73 P3d 911 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[A]dmissibility of scientific evidence requires a showing that it is based on scientifically valid principles.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 301-02, 899 P2d 663 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This court addressed a similar problem in <em>Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, a case in which the defendant was convicted of driving under the influence. The state had presented a forensic scientist\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cstudies concerning the rates at which the blood absorbs and eliminates alcohol * * <em>Id. </em>at 666. The expert offered testimony regarding use of the Widmark formula, which is used to \u201ccalculate the number of alcoholic beverages consumed by an individual based on * * * BAC, a process known as \u2018retrograde extrapolation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The expert determined that a 185-pound man who consumed alcohol within a specific time span would have had to have consumed between 7 and 10.5 drinks for a BAC of .08 percent at the time of the defendant\u2019s breath test. <em>Id. </em>This court concluded that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in not requiring the state to show that [the expert\u2019s] methods were scientifically valid\u201d pursuant to foundational requirements for scientific evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>In this case, the deputy\u2019s testimony about the amount of alcohol that defendant would have had to have consumed for a breath test to register a .17 percent BAC closely mirrored the Widmark formula and retrograde extrapolation applied by the forensic scientist in <em>Whitmore. </em>The deputy testified that his knowledge stemmed from the NHTSA manual. On cross-examination, the deputy conceded that calculating specific hypothetical absorption rates of alcohol involves \u201cscientific stuff that [he] certainly [doesn\u2019t] understand.\u201d Here, too, \u201c[t]he trial court * * * had a duty to ensure that [the witness\u2019s] methods possessed the requisite indices of scientific validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672. As in <em>Whitmore, </em>the deputy\u2019s testimony was scientific evidence and required the state to establish a proper foundation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the deputy\u2019s testimony possessed \u201csignificantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions.\u201d <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 292; <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">We also conclude that the deputy was not qualified to testify as an expert in alcohol absorption and elimination rates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Oregon\u2019s evidence code requires that scientific evidence must be proffered by \u201ca witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education * * OEC 702. \u201cProper application of OEC 702 requires assessment of the particular qualifications of each witness.\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 316, 4 P3d 1261 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The trial court determined that \u201cthis is * * * in the in-between-land between scientific evidence and *** lay opinion evidence\u201d and that the deputy\u2019s training and expertise was sufficient to testify to rates of alcohol absorption and elimination. The court reasoned that \u201can officer with this officer\u2019s background probably is entitled to testify about the amount of alcohol that it would take to get to a .17 [percent BAC]\u201d and determined that \u201cthere\u2019s been enough foundation as to his experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cBased on * * * training and experience, police officers can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 testify as to their opinions of whether an individual was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 194. However, the dispute in this case is not whether defendant was intoxicated or whether his BAC exceeded a legal limit, but rather whether he could have reached a .17 percent BAC at 4:03 p.m. if he had only consumed \u201cfour to five drinks\u201d and a \u201ccouple shots of whiskey.\u201d That evidence required a complex understanding of how defendant\u2019s BAC would have changed over time. The deputy\u2019s testimony is qualitatively different from lay observations as to a person\u2019s relative state of intoxication, because the deputy\u2019s testimony expressed scientific opinion that required a proper foundation. The testimony in question was not, as the state argues, limited to the deputy\u2019s training and prior experience as a police officer. It required a formulaic calculation derived from scientific understandings of physiological processes that cannot be achieved through reading a training manual, conducting routine DUII investigations in the course of law enforcement, and attending an NHTSA course.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To offer such scientific evidence a witness must qualify as an expert. <em>Dunning, </em>245 Or App at 589-90. Here, the record does not suggest that the deputy had \u201cthe stuff of expertise * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591. The court erred in admitting the deputy\u2019s testimony because the state failed to establish a sufficient foundation for expertise in the field through an assessment of the deputy\u2019s particular qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The state contends that any error was harmless. An evidentiary error does not require reversal unless the error is prejudicial. OEC 103(1). An error is harmless if there is little likelihood it affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). In making that determination, we consider the possible influence of the error on the verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>To prove the offense, the state needed to establish that defendant drove while he was intoxicated. Both defendant and Bandy gave testimony that was inconsistent with statements that they made to the deputy during the investigation at the campground. They sought to raise doubt that defendant drove while intoxicated. The state sought to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s account at trial was false or, at least, to challenge defendant\u2019s altered recollection of events. To contradict defendant, the deputy estimated the number of drinks defendant would have had to have consumed at the campground to reach a .17 percent BAC at the time of the breath test. The impeachment was scientific evidence intended to show that defendant could not be telling the truth at trial. On this record, we cannot conclude that there was little likelihood that the deputy\u2019s testimony affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> ORS 813.010(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201cA person commits the offense of [DUII] if the person drives a vehicle while the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201c(a) Has 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood of the person as shown by chemical analysis of the breath * * *; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201c(b) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor ***[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\"> Defendant also assigns error to the court\u2019s ruling on his objection to the state\u2019s closing argument as a personal attack against defense counsel. Given that we reverse, the issue becomes moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\"> The deputy\u2019s testimony relied heavily on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> For the purposes of this case, we need not repeat the factors aiding in a court\u2019s determination of scientific evidence\u2019s reliability and validity, set forth by the Supreme Court. <em>See State v.
