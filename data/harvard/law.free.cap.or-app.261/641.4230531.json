J.</author>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division of the Oregon Department of Transportation (DMV) suspended petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license after he refused to submit to a breath test when he was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). <em>See </em>ORS 813.410(1) (requiring DMV to suspend a person\u2019s driving privileges if notified by police report under ORS 813.120 of the person\u2019s refusal to take breath test unless, after hearing, DMV determines the suspension to be invalid). The circuit court affirmed the final order of suspension issued by an administrative law judge (ALJ), and petitioner appeals that judgment. We conclude that DMV erred in determining that the arresting officer\u2019s jury duty was an \u201cofficial duty conflict\u201d justifying postponement of the suspension hearing under ORS 813.440(l)(d). Accordingly, we reverse petitioner\u2019s license suspension. ORS 813.450(4)(a)(A); <em>Hays v. DMV, </em>230 Or App 559, 563, 216 P3d 902 (2009) (reversing suspension of driving privileges, citing principle that, when an administratively imposed penalty is based on a legally unauthorized procedure, the penalty is invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Petitioner refused to submit to a breath test after being arrested for DUII; consequently, DMV proposed to suspend his driving privileges. ORS 813.410(1). Petitioner requested an administrative hearing to contest the validity of the proposed suspension, ORS 813.410(3), and the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) scheduled a hearing before an ALJ for July 5, 2011. OAH also issued a subpoena to the arresting officer to appear at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">On June 28, 2011, OAH was notified \u2014 via preprinted form \u2014 that the officer was unavailable to appear on July 5 due to jury duty in Benton County on that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An ALJ from OAH subsequently issued an order concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that the officer\u2019s inability to attend the hearing was \u201cdue to court [,] which constitutes grounds to reschedule under ORS 813.440(l)(d) and OAR 735-090-0120(4)\u201d (footnotes omitted), and ordering that a hearing to determine the validity of the suspension be scheduled \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d The suspension of petitioner\u2019s license was rescinded pending the outcome of the rescheduled hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The rescheduled hearing took place on July 14, 2011, before another ALJ. After the hearing, the ALJ issued a final order affirming the suspension of petitioner\u2019s license for three years. ORS 813.420(2); ORS 813.430(2). The final order concluded, among other things, that the hearing had been properly reset due to the officer\u2019s scheduling conflict. Petitioner sought judicial review in circuit court, ORS 813.410(8), and the court affirmed the suspension. Petitioner appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We directly review the underlying order to determine whether DMV erroneously interpreted a provision of law and whether the order is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 813.450(4); <em>Bianco v. DMV, </em>257 Or App 446, 448, 307 P3d 470 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">A hearing to determine the validity of a suspension of an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license must be held according to the time limits in ORS 813.410 unless one of the exceptions in ORS 813.440 applies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Walker v. DMV, </em>254 Or App 543, 545, 295 P3d 167 (2013); ORS 813.440(1), (2); ORS 813.410(4)(e). The exception at issue in this case appears in ORS 813.440(l)(d), which provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding ORS 813.410, the Department of Transportation may provide a hearing to determine the validity of a suspension under ORS 813.410 only if the time requirements under ORS 813.410 could not be met because of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">* \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201c(d) The inability of a subpoenaed police officer to appear due to the officer\u2019s illness, vacation or <em>official duty conflicts. </em>The department shall set forth by rule the conditions that constitute official duty conflicts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(Emphasis added.) In accordance with the directive to the department to specify, by rule, the conditions that constitute \u201cofficial duty conflicts,\u201d the department promulgated OAR 735-090-0120(4). That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201cAn official duty conflict exists if the subpoenaed police officer is unable to attend the hearing due to any of the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201c(a) Community caretaking pursuant to ORS 133.033;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201c(b) Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201c(c) Hazardous or impeding travel conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201c(d) Participating in employer approved training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u201c(e) Physical incapacity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">\u201c(f) Service in the U.S. Armed Forces, military reserves, National Guard or the organized militia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">As discussed, here, DMV determined that, because the subpoenaed officer was scheduled for jury duty on the same day as the suspension hearing, the hearing was properly rescheduled due to an \u201cofficial duty conflict,\u201d <em>viz., </em>\u201ccourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">As both parties recognized at oral argument, the issue on appeal reduces to whether the rule as applied in these circumstances is inconsistent with the statutory meaning of \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d as used in ORS 813.440(l)(d). In other words, we must decide whether DMV erroneously construed \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d to encompass jury duty. <em>See Coast Security Mortgage Corp. v. Real Estate Agency, </em>331 Or 348, 354, 15 P3d 29 (2000) (\u201cThis court reviews the agency decision concerning a \u2018delegative term\u2019 to determine whether it is within the range of discretion allowed by the more general policy of the statute.\u201d); <em>Marolla v. DPSST, </em>245 Or App 226, 230, 263 P3d 1034 (2011) (\u201cAn administrative rule * * * must be consistent with the legislative directive; it exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority if it \u2018depart [s] from a legal standard expressed or implied in the particular law being administered, or [if it] contravene [s] some other applicable statute.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 565, 687 P2d 785 (1984); brackets in <em>Marolla.)). </em>We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s argument reduces to the proposition that the legislature intended \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d under ORS 813.440(l)(d) to be limited to circumstances in which the officer is \u201cconducting business as a police officer.\u201d We examine the applicable statutory wording in context to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Bergerson v. Salem-Keizer School District, </em>341 Or 401, 413, 144 P3d 918 (2006) (\u201cDetermining the general policy of a statute is a matter of statutory construction * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The plain meaning of the text of subsection (l)(d) tends to support petitioner\u2019s proposed construction. \u201cOfficial duty\u201d is an adjective phrase modifying the noun \u201cconflicts.\u201d The adjective \u201cofficial\u201d means \u201cbelonging or relating to an office, position, or trust : connected with holding an office &lt;~duties&gt;.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1567 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cDuty\u201d refers to \u201cobligatory tasks, conduct, service, or functions enjoined by order or usage according to rank, occupation, or profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705. Finally, \u201cconflict\u201d means \u201cclash, competition, or mutual interference of opposing or incompatible forces or qualities (as ideas, interests, wills).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476-77. Thus, \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d are clashes resulting from obligatory tasks connected with holding the position of a police officer. It follows that an official duty conflict as used in ORS 813.440(l)(d) is an obligatory task connected with the position of police officer that prevents the officer from appearing at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">DMV argues, however, that \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d may also be understood to mean \u201ca condition that creates a legitimate conflict with the officer\u2019s \u2018official duty\u2019 to attend the hearing\u201d and, because that is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, including jury duty in the meaning of \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d does not exceed the legislative directive expressed in ORS 813.440(l)(d). In other words, in DMV\u2019s view, \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d can be understood to include any conflict \u2014 whether or not related to the officer\u2019s employment or duties as a police officer \u2014 that, by rule, DMV decides reasonably conflicts with the officer\u2019s \u201cofficial duty\u201d to attend a license-suspension hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We disagree. As discussed, ORS 813.440(1) sets forth valid reasons for DMV to postpone a license-suspension hearing (\u201cNotwithstanding ORS 813.410, [DMV] may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>provide a hearing to determine the validity of a suspension under ORS 813.410 only if the time requirements under ORS 813.410 could not be met because of any of the following:\u201d). Paragraph (d) then lists one of those reasons as \u201c [t]he <em>inability of a subpoenaed police officer to appear </em>[at the suspension hearing] due to the officer\u2019s illness, vacation or official duty conflicts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If, as DMV contends, \u201cofficial duty\u201d refers to the duty to appear at the hearing, then the statute becomes circular, <em>viz., </em>the hearing may be postponed if the officer is unable to appear at the hearing due to a conflict that prevents him from appearing at the hearing. As explained above, the grammatical structure of the sentence demonstrates that the phrase \u201cofficial duty\u201d modifies the noun \u201cconflicts\u201d; DMV\u2019s reading rejects that view and proposes, instead, that \u201cofficial duty\u201d simply reiterates the subject of the exception \u2014 that is, the officer\u2019s inability to appear at the hearing. That reading however, renders the words \u201cofficial duty\u201d redundant. As a matter of statutory construction, we assume that the legislature does not intend any portion of an enactment to be \u201cmeaningless surplusage.\u201d <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Furthermore, under DMV\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cofficial duty conflicts,\u201d the words \u201cillness\u201d and \u201cvacation\u201d are also superfluous. The statute is written in the dis<em>junctive </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cillness, vacation or official duty conflicts\u201d\u2014 demonstrating that the legislature intended that any of the three categories would constitute a valid reason to reschedule a hearing. If, instead, the legislature intended \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d to encompass any circumstance that, in DMV\u2019s view, reasonably interferes with an officer\u2019s ability to attend the hearing, then the first two listed categories would be subsumed within the third and, therefore, unnecessary verbiage. Again, we are obliged, if possible, to construe a statute so as to give effect to all relevant provisions. ORS 174.010; <em>State v. Mayes, </em>220 Or App 385, 389, 186 P3d 392 (2008). In short, DMV\u2019s interpretation of \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d is not a plausible reading of the text of the statute in context.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>We also note that we have previously rejected DMV\u2019s proposed reading of \u201cofficial duty conflicts.\u201d In <em>Blaisdell v. MVD, </em>145 Or App 468, 472, 929 P2d 1073 (1996), the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) urged us to construe \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d \u201cto mean that the hearing is the official duty, and the conflict is anything that reasonably prevents the officer from complying with that duty.\u201d In that case, the officer did not appear at the suspension hearing because \u201chis [private] vehicle had seized up and would not run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 (internal quotations marks and brackets omitted). MVD determined that that circumstance constituted an official duty conflict under its rule, OAR 735-90-120(4) (Nov 4, 1993), which justified postponement of the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 470-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Because MVD\u2019s rule at that time simply provided a nonexclusive list of examples of official duty conflicts, it was necessary for us to resolve the case by determining the common characteristics of those examples, which then became the characteristics \u201cconstituting] official duty conflicts\u201d under the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 472. Although one of those examples \u2014 \u201c[i]nclement travel conditions\u201d \u2014 supported MVD\u2019s construction of official duty conflicts, the others, for example, \u201cphysical incapacity resulting from the performance of duties as a police officer,\u201d were explicitly inconsistent with that understanding. <em>Id. </em>at 472-73. As we explained regarding that particular example, \u201cIf the rule were intended to work the way MVD claims that it does\u201d \u2014 that is, to \u201ccover <em>any </em>incapacitating ailment suffered by the officer,\u201d then the limitation contained in the rule \u2014 \u201cresulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>performance of duties as a police officer,\u201d would be superfluous. <em>Id. </em>at 473. (Emphasis in original.) We thus rejected MVD\u2019s interpretation of its rule to include the officer\u2019s car problems, concluding that \u201cthe examples [in the rule] cannot be reconciled with MVD\u2019s understanding except by stripping them of any meaningful content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. Although the usefulness of the <em>Blaisdell </em>analysis to this case is limited \u2014 among other things, as DMV points out, the rule has since been amended so that it now contains an exclusive list of specific conditions that constitute official duty conflicts, <em>see </em>261 Or App at 644 \u2014 the ultimate flaw in DMV\u2019s analysis is similar: If \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d has the meaning that DMV ascribes to it, then the other categories listed in the statute \u2014 illness and vacation \u2014 become devoid of any meaningful content.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">DMV also argues, alternatively, that jury duty qualifies as an \u201cofficial duty\u201d of the officer and, thus, DMV acted consistently with ORS 813.440(l)(d) in concluding that \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d includes jury duty. In support of that argument, DMV argues only that jury duty \u201cis a public obligation of every citizen,\u201d compliance of which is \u201ceven more important\u201d given a police officer\u2019s status as a law enforcement officer. DMV does not argue, nor is there any evidence in the record indicating, that jury service was an obligation of petitioner\u2019s <em>position as a police officer. </em>Although we can envision that there may be circumstances in which jury service is an obligation of a person\u2019s employment, in the absence of any evidence in the record to that effect in this case, we reject DMV\u2019s argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In summary, we conclude that DMV erred in concluding that, because the arresting officer was called for jury duty on the day of the originally scheduled suspension hearing, the hearing was properly postponed due to an \u201cofficial duty conflict\u201d under ORS 813.440(l)(d). Accordingly, we set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>aside petitioner\u2019s license suspension. ORS 813.450(4)(a)(A); <em>Hays, </em>230 Or App at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> The preprinted form provides spaces for the reporting agency to indicate the reason for the officer\u2019s unavailability; in this case, the space next to the word \u201cCOURT\u201d (listed under the category \u201cOFFICIAL DUTY CONFLICT CHECKED BELOW (OAR 735-090-0120)\u201d) was checked and, in the place provided for explanation, a handwritten notation provided, \u201cscheduled for jury duty.\u201d The form also indicated that the place and time of \u201cCOURT\u201d was Benton County Circuit Court on July 5, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"> For a thorough discussion of the statutory scheme governing implied-consent hearings, see <em>Bianco, </em>257 Or App at 452-56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\"> The parties do not provide any legislative history regarding the original enactment of the \u201cofficial duty conflicts\u201d exception in ORS 813.440 (l)(d).

That omission is ultimately of no import in this case because our analysis of the text and context of the provision is dispositive. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 173, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (\u201cWhen the text of a statute is truly capable of having only one meaning, no weight can be given to legislative history that suggests \u2014 or even confirms \u2014 that legislators intended something different.\u201d); <em>State v. Kelly, </em>229 Or App 461, 466, 211 P3d 932, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009) (\u201cIn some cases, the legislative history \u2014 however clearly it may express the legislature\u2019s intentions \u2014 is worth precisely nothing, because the text of the statute is capable of one, and only one, reasonable construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The parties do provide some very brief excerpts of the legislative history surrounding the 1999 amendment to ORS 813.440(l)(d). That amendment added the words \u201cillness\u201d and \u201cvacation\u201d to the first sentence of the subsection to read (as in its current form): \u201cThe inability of a subpoenaed police officer to appear due to the officer\u2019s illness, vacation or official duty conflicts.\u201d Or Laws 1999, ch 831, \u00a7 1. We note that that change, and the accompanying legislative history proffered by the parties, appear to support our construction of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"> DMV argues that its subsequent amendment of the rule \u201cdemonstrates its intent to define official duty conflict more expansively than the <em>Blaisdell </em>court did.\u201d That may well be, but it is beside the point. The question is whether DMV\u2019s \u201cexpansive\u201d definition of official duty conflict as applied here exceeds the scope of the legislative directive. We conclude that it does.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
