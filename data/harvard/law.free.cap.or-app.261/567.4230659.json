In the review, defendant characterized the venue as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and Neumann as \u201ctwo faced, crooked, and *** rude to multiple guest[s].\u201d He stated further that Neumann and her husband \u201cchanged the rules as they saw fit\u201d by informing guests that they needed to leave the premises earlier than they had originally been told, and that Neumann would find a way to retain any security deposit and charge even more money for use of the facility. Neumann and Dancing Deer Mountain sued defendant, with Neumann asserting claims for defamation and invasion of privacy by false light, and Dancing Deer Mountain asserting claims for intentional interference with economic relations and invasion of privacy by false light. On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed the case under ORS 31.150,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Oregon\u2019s anti-Strategic Lawsuits against Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, concluding both that plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell within the scope of ORS 31.150(2), making them subject to the anti-SLAPP procedures, and that plaintiffs failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case in support of any of their claims, as required by ORS 31.150(3). We reverse, concluding that the trial court erred when it determined that Neumann had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case in support of her defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Defendant attended a wedding at Dancing Deer Mountain. During the event, tensions arose between Dancing Deer Mountain staff, including Neumann, and the wedding party and guests, after staff observed attendees consuming alcohol in a manner that violated Dancing Deer Mountain\u2019s alcohol policy. Those tensions were exacerbated when, at approximately 8:30 p.m. on the night of the wedding, Neumann and her staff began asking guests to leave, in accordance with Dancing Deer Mountain\u2019s requirement, contained in its rental agreement, that the wedding party and guests vacate the premises by 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Two days after the wedding, defendant posted a review of Dancing Deer Mountain on google.com. The review, which was entitled \u201cDisaster!!!!! Find a different wedding venue,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201cThere are many other great places to get married, this is not that place! The worst wedding experience of my life! The location is beautiful the problem is the owners. Carol (female owner) is two faced, crooked, and was rude to multiple guests. I was only happy with one thing: it was a beautiful wedding, when it wasn\u2019t raining and Carol and Tim stayed away. The owners did not make the rules clear to the people helping with set up even when they saw something they didn\u2019t like they waited until the day of the wedding to bring it up. They also changed the rules as they saw fit. We were told we had to leave at 9pm, but at 8:15 they started telling the guests that they had to leave immediately. The \u2018bridal suite\u2019 was a tool shed that was painted pretty, but a shed all the same. In my opinion She will find a why [sic] to keep your $500 deposit, and will try to make you pay even more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Plaintiffs sued defendant, alleging that by publishing the review, defendant committed the torts of defamation and invasion of privacy by false light against Neumann, and the torts of intentional interference with economic relations and invasion of privacy by false light against Dancing Deer Mountain. Defendant filed a special motion to strike all claims under ORS 31.150. Defendant\u2019s theory was that his online review qualified as either a \u201cwritten statement * * * presented * * * in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,\u201d ORS 31.150(2)(c), or, alternatively, \u201cother conduct in furtherance of the exercise of * * * the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,\u201d ORS 31.150(2)(d), thereby making the anti-SLAPP procedures applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, which arose out of defendant\u2019s online review. In response, plaintiffs submitted evidence to support a <em>prima facie </em>case on their claims, in accordance with ORS 31.150(3). Plaintiffs also argued that the anti-SLAPP procedures should not apply to their claims because their claims did not target speech in connection with government: \u201cAnti-SLAPP statutes were created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>to allow for unfettered speech in matters of governmental gatherings. They were not intended to apply to cases such as this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Following a hearing, the trial court granted the special motion to strike in full. The court entered a general judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice, and awarding $8,000 in attorney fees, $337 in costs, and a $500 prevailing party fee to defendant. Plaintiffs timely appealed, and defendant timely cross-appealed. On appeal, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in two respects: by concluding that their action was subject to the anti-SLAPP procedures, and by concluding that Neumann had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation. On cross-appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by awarding him less than the full amount of attorney fees that he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">A \u201ctwo-step burden-shifting process\u201d governs the resolution of a special motion to strike under Oregon\u2019s antiSLAPP statute, ORS 31.150. <em>Young v. Davis, </em>259 Or App 497, 501, 314 P3d 350 (2013). In accordance with ORS 31.150(3), a court must first determine \u201cwhether the defendant has met its initial burden to show that the claim against which the motion is made \u2018arises out of one or more protected activities described in [ORS 31.150(2)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, if the defendant meets that burden, the court must determine whether the plaintiff has \u201cestablish [ed] that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Each step of that process presents a question of law. <em>See Young, </em>259 Or App at 507-10 (whether the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing presents a legal question); <em>Blackburn v. Brady, </em>116 Cal App 4th 670, 676 (2004) (whether anti-SLAPP statute \u201capplies to a particular complaint [] presents a legal question\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review for legal error a trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ruling on an ORS 31.150 special motion to strike. <em>See Young, </em>259 Or App at 510 (reviewing for legal error trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs evidence did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case); <em>see also Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc., </em>122 Cal App 4th 1049, 1056 (2004) (\u201cWe independently determine whether a cause of action is based upon activity protected under the statute, and if so, whether the plaintiff has established a reasonable probability of prevailing.\u201d); <em>Blackburn, </em>116 Cal App 4th at 676 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">As noted, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred at both steps of the process governing the resolution of a special motion to strike. They argue that \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is not a SLAPP suit,\u201d and that the trial court therefore erred by concluding that their complaint was subject to dismissal under ORS 31.150. Plaintiffs argue further that, even if their complaint falls within the scope of Oregon\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, the trial court erred when it concluded that Neumann had not presented substantial evidence establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation. For the reasons explained below, we do not resolve the first alleged error identified by plaintiffs, but agree that the trial court erred when it concluded that Neumann had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation sufficient to withstand dismissal under ORS 31.150. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">With respect to the first alleged error identified by plaintiffs \u2014 the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were subject to the anti-SLAPP procedures\u2014 plaintiffs do not offer a focused argument on appeal as to why defendant\u2019s online review does not fall into one of the four categories of protected activities delineated in ORS 31.150(2). In particular, plaintiffs do not address defendant\u2019s theory that his review was a statement \u201cin connection with an issue of public interest\u201d published in \u201ca place open to the public or a public forum\u201d under ORS 31.150(2)(c). In fact, plaintiffs do not address the terms of the statute at all, or argue that the text, context, and legislative history demonstrate that the legislature did not intend for online reviews such as the one at issue here to fall within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ORS 31.150(2)(c) or, alternatively, ORS 31.150(2)(d). Instead, relying primarily on law review articles and Illinois cases interpreting the Illinois anti-SLAPP statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 a statute that is worded differently from, and more narrowly than, ORS 31.150 \u2014 plaintiffs assert that we \u201cshould rule in accordance with [those] authorities *** and reverse the trial court\u201d and that \u201c[t]he same reasoning should apply to the interpretation of every anti-SLAPP statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We recently declined to address a similar argument in <em>Young </em>under similar circumstances, where, as here, the plaintiff did not develop a sufficiently focused argument on appeal as to why the allegedly defamatory statements at issue did not fall within the scope of ORS 31.150(2). 259 Or App at 505 (observing that it is not \u201cour proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself\u2019 (citations and internal quotations marks omitted)). We take the same approach here, both to be consistent with <em>Young </em>and because the trial court\u2019s determination that the online business review at issue qualifies as a protected activity under ORS 31.150(2) is not clearly erroneous. Indeed, we note that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 31.150(2) to encompass online business reviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>appears to be consistent with the plain text of the statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> although we do not assess the ultimate correctness of that interpretation at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">We nevertheless conclude that the trial court erred by dismissing Neumann\u2019s defamation claim. Contrary to the court\u2019s conclusion, the evidence supporting the defamation claim was sufficient to meet the \u201clow bar\u201d established by ORS 31.150 \u201cto weed out meritless claims meant to harass or intimidate\u201d a defendant. <em>Young, </em>259 Or App at 508; <em>see also Staten v. Steel, </em>222 Or App 17, 32, 191 P3d 778 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009) (\u201cThe purpose of the special motion to strike procedure, as amplified in the pertinent legislative history, is to expeditiously terminate <em>unfounded </em>claims that threaten constitutional free speech rights, not to deprive litigants of the benefit of a jury determination that a claim is meritorious.\u201d (Emphases in original.)). That is, the evidence submitted by plaintiffs, if credited, would permit a reasonable factfinder to rule in Neumann\u2019s favor on the defamation claim, and the evidence submitted by defendant does not defeat Neumann\u2019s claim as a matter of law. <em>Young, </em>259 Or App at 508-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Under Oregon law, a claim for defamation has three elements: \u201c(1) the making of a defamatory statement; (2) publication of the defamatory material; and (3) a resulting special harm, unless the statement is defamatory <em>per se </em>and therefore gives rise to presumptive special harm.\u201d <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Starplex Corp., </em>220 Or App 560, 584, 188 P3d 332, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 317 (2008). \u201cIn the professional context, a statement is defamatory if it is false and ascribes to another conduct, characteristics or a condition incompatible with the proper conduct of his lawful business, trade, [or] profession.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Brown v. Gatti, </em>341 Or 452, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>458,145 P3d 130 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Statements falsely alleging facts that are \u201clikely to lead people to question [a] plaintiffs fitness to perform his job\u201d are defamatory <em>per se. L &amp; D of Oregon, Inc. v. American States Ins. Co., </em>171 Or App 17, 25, 14 P3d 617 (2000) (discussing the holding in <em>Slover v. State Board of Clinical Social Workers, </em>144 Or App 565, 568-69, 927 P2d 1098 (1996)); <em>see also National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Or App at 584-85 (statements that would tend to harm a plaintiff in his or her business or profession are actionable <em>per se </em>without proof of special harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Here, the evidence submitted by plaintiffs, if true, would permit a reasonable factfinder to find in Neumann\u2019s favor on a claim of defamation concerning her profession. Specifically, if true, plaintiffs\u2019 evidence could permit a reasonable factfinder to find that defendant published false statements attributing to Neumann conduct and characteristics \u201cincompatible with the proper conduct of [her] lawful business\u201d of operating a wedding venue, as well as a false statement alleging that Neumann is dishonest.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In particular, that evidence demonstrates that defendant published in an online forum<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> statements alleging that Neumann was \u201crude to multiple guest [s],\u201d that she \u201cchanged the rules\u201d by directing guests to leave at 8:15 p.m. after originally telling guests that they could stay until 9:00 p.m., that Neumann \u201cwill find a [way] to keep your $500 deposit, and will try to make you pay even more,\u201d and that Neumann is \u201ccrooked.\u201d Neumann\u2019s evidence also provides a basis from which a factfinder could find that defendant\u2019s statements were false. Neumann and two others who were present at the wedding that defendant attended submitted affidavits in which they declared that defendant\u2019s statements were not true. And a factfinder could find that defendant\u2019s online statements impute to Neumann conduct that is incompatible with the proper conduct of the operation of a wedding venue. Couples often intend weddings to be significant, once-in-a-lifetime events that (they hope) will be unblemished by breaches in etiquette and unexpected hitches. As Dancing Deer Mountain\u2019s co-owner Benton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>observed in his affidavit, \u201cno one in their own best interest would call a venue who[se] owners\u201d were alleged to have engaged in the conduct that defendant ascribed to Neumann; that conduct is inconsistent with a positive wedding experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In addition, a factfinder could find that defendant\u2019s statement that Neumann is \u201ccrooked,\u201d apart from implying that she is not a wedding vendor who can be trusted, alleges that she is dishonest, and would be defamatory for that reason. <em>See Mannex Corp. v. Bruns, </em>250 Or App 50, 52, 57-61, 279 P3d 278 (2012) (recognizing that statements that the plaintiff \u201cwas a \u2018crook[],\u2019 that [a third party] should \u2018never want to do business with [the plaintiff],\u2019 and that [the third party] should \u2018remember that name\u2019\u201d were defamatory, although concluding that the plaintiffs claim for defamation failed because the statements were protected by qualified privilege); <em>Durr v. Kelleher, </em>54 Or App 965, 967-68, 636 P2d 1015 (1981) (affirming trial court verdict awarding damages on defamation claim where \u201c[t]he court found that [the] defendant had maliciously slandered [the] plaintiff by calling him a \u2018crook\u2019 and a \u2018dishonest\u2019 police officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, because a factfinder could find that defendant\u2019s statements attacked Neumann\u2019s professional or business reputation, and, for that reason, would be defamatory <em>per se, </em>plaintiffs were not required to present evidence of special harm to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation. <em>See National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Or App at 584-85 (statements are <em>per se </em>defamatory if they \u201ctend[] to injure the plaintiff in his or her profession or business\u201d; only when a statement is not slander <em>per se </em>must a plaintiff allege special harm). Plaintiffs nevertheless did present evidence that would permit a factfinder to find that Neumann was harmed by defendant\u2019s statements. Neumann and her co-owner attested to a fairly significant drop in bookings of the venue for weddings almost immediately after the challenged post was made, as well as to expenditures made to mitigate the harm to Neumann\u2019s reputation as a wedding-venue operator. A reasonable factfinder could find based on that evidence that Neumann suffered special harm resulting from defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Defendant makes several arguments as to why plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is insufficient to establish the <em>prima facie </em>case required by ORS 31.150. For the reasons set forth below, we are not persuaded by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">First, defendant asserts that his statements were nonactionable opinion. \u201cOpinions, as \u2018statements that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts,\u2019 are constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Hickey v. Settlemier, </em>141 Or App 103, 110, 917 P2d 44, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 690 (1996) (quoting <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., </em>497 US 1, 20, 110 S Ct 2695, 111 L Ed 2d 1 (1990)). \u201cNevertheless, when an \u2018opinion\u2019 implies the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts, it is actionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cin my opinion\u201d at one point in the review, defendant\u2019s statements reasonably could be understood to state facts or imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts. By stating that Neumann was rude to multiple guests, defendant, at a minimum, implied that Neumann engaged in conduct that breached the rules of decorum expected at a wedding. By stating that, in his opinion, Neumann will find a way to keep a wedding party\u2019s deposit and then charge more, defendant implied that that is, in fact, what happened at the wedding he attended. The statement that Neumann forced guests to leave earlier than agreed upon is an assertion of fact, as is the statement that Neumann is crooked, in the context of the review.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Second, relying on federal cases, defendant asserts that his statements are not defamatory because, in his view, the context of the statements demonstrates that they are figurative, rhetorical, or hyperbolic. <em>See Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox, </em>812 F Supp 2d 1220, 1222-25 (D Or 2011), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>740 F3d 1284 (9th Cir 2014) (describing test used by the Ninth Circuit to determine whether a statement is opinion or fact for defamation purposes under its First Amendment jurisprudence, and noting several examples of nonactionable hyperbole, figurative language, and rhetoric). To the extent that extra-jurisdictional authority informs our analysis, we disagree that defendant\u2019s statements, as a whole, are hyperbolic. True, some of what defendant says in the challenged post is opinion and is hyperbolic <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cworst wedding experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of my life!\u201d). However, the bulk of the post is nonrhetorical and factual <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c [t]he owners did not make the rules clear\u201d; \u201cwhen they saw something they didn\u2019t like they waited until the day of the wedding to bring it up\u201d; \u201c [w] e were told we had to leave at 9pm, but at 8:15 they started telling the guests that they had to leave immediately\u201d; \u201c[t]he \u2018bridal suite\u2019 was a tool shed that was painted pretty, but a shed all the same\u201d). Those factual details demonstrate that defendant\u2019s statements are not mere hyperbole and, more to the point, would not be brushed off as mere hyperbole by a reasonable reader of those statements. <em>See Wheeler v. Green, </em>286 Or 99, 104-06, 593 P2d 777 (1979) (analyzing whether recipient of statements would have understood statements to defame the plaintiff in order to determine whether statements were defamatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Third, defendant claims that plaintiffs qualify as limited public figures who were required to present evidence that defendant acted with malice in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation. However, the evidence at this stage of the proceedings does not show that plaintiffs are public figures or limited public figures, as that phrase has been interpreted by Oregon courts, and defendant is not a \u201cmedia defendant.\u201d <em>See Bank of Oregon v. Independent News, </em>298 Or 434, 441, 693 P2d 35 (1985), <em>cert den, </em>474 US 826 (1985) (\u201cTwo recent cases have held that liability applies where the plaintiff is not a \u2018public figure\u2019 and the defendant is not a part of the media.\u201d (Citing <em>Wheeler, </em>286 Or 99; <em>Harley-Davidson v. Markley, </em>279 Or 361, 568 P2d 1359 (1977).)); <em>id. </em>at 443 (\u201cMerely opening one\u2019s doors to the public, offering stock for public sale, advertising, etc., even if considered a thrusting of one\u2019s self into matters of public interest, is not sufficient to establish that a corporation is a public figure.\u201d). As a result, Neumann was not required to present evidence of malice in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation under ORS 31.150.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Finally, defendant argues that, to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of defamation, Neumann was required to present evidence rebutting his affirmative defense that he had a qualified privilege to make the statements that he did, or showing that he abused that qualified privilege. But a claim of privilege is an affirmative defense to a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>defamation on which a defendant bears the burden of proof. <em>Walsh v. Consolidated Freightways, </em>278 Or 347, 355, 563 P2d 1205 (1977). On this record, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that defendant was privileged to make the allegedly defamatory statements regarding Neumann.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Young, </em>259 Or App at 507-10 (in resolving a special motion to strike, a court assesses a defendant\u2019s evidence only to evaluate whether the defendant\u2019s evidence defeats the plaintiffs claim as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred when it struck Neumann\u2019s defamation claim, and we reverse the judgment of dismissal for that reason. Because plaintiffs have not separately addressed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the other claims in their briefing on appeal, we do not reverse the court\u2019s decision to strike those claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We note, however, that those claims were dismissed without prejudice \u2014 as was required by ORS 31.150(1) \u2014 and that the trial court retains its authority on remand under ORCP 23 to entertain proposed amendments to the pleadings, as appropriate. ORCP <em>23; Allen v. Premo, </em>251 Or App 682, 685-87, 284 P3d 1199 (2012). Finally, because we have reversed the judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, we also vacate the attorney fee award because it was predicated on the trial court\u2019s determination that the special motion to strike should be granted as to all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. ORS 20.220(3). Thus, defendant\u2019s cross-appeal, challenging the fee award, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court erred by granting the special motion to strike Neumann\u2019s defamation claim. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s decision as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the defamation claim, vacate the attorney fee award, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">On appeal, reversed and remanded as to defamation claim, attorney fee award vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed. Cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-5\"> ORS 31.150 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201c(1) A defendant may make a special motion to strike against a claim in a civil action described in subsection (2) of this section. The court shall grant the motion unless the plaintiff establishes in the manner provided by subsection (3) of this section that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim. The special motion to strike shall be treated as a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A but shall not be subject to ORCP 21 F. Upon granting the special motion to strike, the court shall enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice. If the court denies a special motion to strike, the court shall enter a limited judgment denying the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201c(2) A special motion to strike may be made under this section against any claim in a civil action that arises out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c(a) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in a legislative, executive or judicial proceeding or other proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u201c(b) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive or judicial body or other proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">\u201c(c) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document presented, in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">\u201c(d) Any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c(3) A defendant making a special motion to strike under the provisions of this section has the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that the claim against which the motion is made arises out of a statement, document or conduct described in subsection (2) of this section. If the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff in the action to establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a prima facie case. If the plaintiff meets this burden, the court shall deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c(4) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall consider pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201c(5) If the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201c(a) The fact that the determination has been made and the substance of the determination may not be admitted in evidence at any later stage of the case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201c(b) The determination does not affect the burden of proof or standard of proof that is applied in the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-11\"> In accordance with the legal standards governing special motions to strike under ORS 31.150, discussed further below, we state the facts underlying plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. As we have recently explained, a court may not weigh the evidence in evaluating a special motion to strike under ORS 31.150. <em>Young v. Davis, </em>259 Or App 497, 506-10, 314 P3d 350 (2013). Therefore, to the extent that the record reflects factual disputes, we resolve them in favor of plaintiffs at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> We look to California case law because Oregon\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute was \u201cmodeled on California statutes\u201d and \u201c [i] t was intended that California case law would inform Oregon courts regarding the application of ORS 31.150 to ORS 31.155.\u201d <em>Page v. Parsons, </em>249 Or App 445, 461, 277 P3d 609 (2012); <em>see Young, </em>259 Or App at 507 (quoting <em>Page).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\"> The Illinois anti-SLAPP act, known as the \u201cCitizen Participation Act,\u201d 735 ILCS 110/1, focuses narrowly on speech connected with citizen participation in government. Regarding the scope of its application, the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cThis Act applies to any motion to dispose of a claim in a judicial proceeding on the grounds that the claim is based on, relates to, or is in response to any act or acts of the moving party in furtherance of the moving party\u2019s rights of petition, speech, association, or to otherwise participate in government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cActs in furtherance of the constitutional rights to petition, speech, association, and participation in government are immune from liability, regardless of intent or purpose, except when not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">735 ILCS 110/15. By contrast, ORS 31.150 and the California statute on which it is modeled, California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16, do not limit their focus to speech connected to participation in government. Instead, by their terms, those statutes also apply more broadly to public speech on matters of public importance, regardless of whether that speech occurs in the context of government participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Because of those salient differences between the Illinois Citizen Participation Act and the Oregon anti-SLAPP statute, the Illinois case law cited by plaintiffs provides no basis for concluding that the trial court erred in interpreting ORS 31.150(2), absent a developed and focused argument as to why that case law is probative of the Oregon Legislative Assembly\u2019s intent, notwithstanding the differences between the Oregon and Illinois statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\"> For that matter, the trial court\u2019s determination also appears to be consistent with the California courts\u2019 interpretation of the anti-SLAPP statute on which ORS 31.150(2) is modeled. <em>See, e.g., Gilbert v. Sykes, </em>147 Cal App 4th 13, 22-24 (2007); <em>Wilbanks v. Wolk, </em>121 Cal App 4th 883, 895-97 (2004); <em>ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>93 Cal App 4th 993, 1006-08 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> Outside the professional context, a statement is defamatory if it subjects the statement\u2019s object \u201cto hatred, contempt or ridicule, [or] tend[s] to diminish the esteem, respect, goodwill or confidence in which [the person] is held or [excites] adverse, derogatory or unpleasant feelings or opinions against [him].\u201d <em>Andreason v. Guard Publishing Co., </em>260 Or 308, 311, 489 P2d 944 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\"> Defendant does not dispute that the statements were published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> We save for another day the question of whether and to what extent ORS 31.150 authorizes parties to litigate affirmative defenses in the context of a special motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> In their opening brief, plaintiffs did not discuss the elements of their other claims, or present any argument that the trial court erred by concluding that they failed to present <em>prima facie </em>evidence of those elements. In his answering brief, defendant argued in section E that plaintiffs\u2019 evidence did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on Neumann\u2019s claim for invasion of privacy by false light, or on either of Dancing Deer Mountain\u2019s claims. In their reply brief, plaintiffs did not respond to section E of defendant\u2019s answering brief regarding the other three claims, even though plaintiffs otherwise responded to defendant\u2019s brief section by section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
