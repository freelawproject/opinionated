His convictions arose out of an incident that happened on his family\u2019s property after his mother called for emergency assistance, the responding deputy sheriffs overstayed their welcome, and he and other family members were arrested. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, motions for judgment of acquittal, and motion to merge the guilty verdicts for interfering with a peace officer. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his proposed jury instruction on the dissipation of an emergency under the emergency-aid doctrine and to the delivery of the state\u2019s proffered jury instruction on community caretaking. We hold that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, as well as defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the interfering and disorderly conduct charges. However, we hold that the trial court did commit instructional error, and we reverse and remand the three counts of interfering with a peace officer; otherwise we affirm. We thus do not reach the alleged error regarding defendant\u2019s motion to merge the verdicts on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We state the pertinent facts for each assignment of error separately, beginning with the motion to suppress. We take the facts from the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, <em>State v. Mazzola (A139257), </em>238 Or App 201, 203, 242 P3d 674 (2010), recognizing that we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is evidence in the record to support them, <em>State v. Vasquez-Villagomez, </em>346 Or 12, 23, 203 P3d 193 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">At about 2:00 a.m. on a summer night, defendant\u2019s mother placed an emergency call to request help in rescuing defendant, whom she thought had fallen into a pond on the family\u2019s property. That property is located at the end of a long driveway in a rural, mixed farm and residential area outside of Salem. Although the fire department normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>responds to water rescue calls, Deputy Sheriff Lane was the closest to the address and was the first to arrive at the scene. When Lane arrived, he met several members of defendant\u2019s family, including defendant\u2019s mother, who, at that point, was hysterical about her son\u2019s welfare. She walked to the pond with Lane, and together they looked for defendant. Lane questioned defendant\u2019s mother, trying to ascertain defendant\u2019s location. After some questioning, defendant\u2019s mother admitted that she had not seen defendant fall into the pond. At about that time, Deputy Sheriff Lucca and Battalion Chief Wineman of the Marion County Fire Department both arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Shortly thereafter, defendant arrived at the pond, dry and unharmed. He informed the deputies that he was the person they were looking for, that he had not fallen into the pond, and that they should \u201cget the fuck off [his] property.\u201d Although Lane initially testified that, at that time, he was unsure whether defendant was the one who purportedly had fallen into the pond or if anyone else was injured, on cross-examination, Lane admitted that once defendant showed up, the deputies \u201cdid not need to look for him anymore [,]\u201d nor did they have information leading them to believe that anyone else was in the pond, that defendant was suicidal, or that a crime was in progress on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">After arriving at the scene, defendant continued to use abrasive language to inform the deputies that he was fine and that they were not welcome on his property. Lucca turned to defendant\u2019s mother \u2014 who was still highly emotional \u2014 to ask questions about why she had called for a water rescue and what defendant had told her. When Lucca attempted to speak with defendant\u2019s mother, defendant\u2019s sister arrived, tried to pull her mother away from the deputy, and told her not to speak with the deputies. Defendant\u2019s sister also told the deputies to \u201cget the fuck off [the] property.\u201d As Lucca attempted to arrest her for interfering with a peace officer, defendant\u2019s sister pulled her hands free and retreated toward her family. At that point, Lane requested additional patrol units to come to the scene to assist because defendant\u2019s sister was resisting arrest, and five to six family members, including defendant, were yelling aggressively at the two deputies, whose efforts to calm the situation were unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>When a third deputy sheriff, Hunter, arrived at the scene, Lane and Lucca informed him that defendant\u2019s sister was under arrest. Defendant and his family became upset when Hunter began to take physical custody of defendant\u2019s sister; they did not follow orders from Lane to stay back and kept trying to push past Hunter to reach her. Lane testified that defendant\u2019s actions, along with those of his family, raised officer safety concerns. Defendant protested the loudest of all the family members, often using profanity to make his points, and was the most aggressive in trying to get past Hunter to reach his sister. As a result, Hunter eventually told defendant that he was under arrest. Defendant and Hunter then struggled, at one point falling down to the ground, as Hunter effected the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Defendant was charged with three counts of interfering with a peace officer, ORS 162.247; three counts of resisting arrest, ORS 162.315;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of disorderly conduct in the second degree, ORS 166.025. His sister, his mother, and his father were also charged with the commission of various crimes arising out of the events of that night.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Before their consolidated trial, defendant and his codefendant family members moved to suppress all evidence collected after defendant was found dry and unharmed. The trial court granted the motion to suppress as to defendant\u2019s parents, but not as to defendant and his sister. The trial court determined that, although the deputies had been lawfully present on defendants\u2019 property pursuant to the emergency-aid exception to the warrant requirement, once defendant appeared dry and unharmed, the emergency had dissipated, as had the basis for the deputies to remain pursuant to that exception. The trial court nonetheless refused to suppress the evidence, citing <em>State v. </em>Janicke, 103 Or App 227, 796 P2d 392 (1990), in which we held that the exclusionary rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>does not apply to evidence of new crimes against police officers during unlawful stops or entries. We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress for legal error. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">At a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state bears the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the challenged evidence was lawfully obtained. ORS 133.693(4); <em>State v. Tucker, </em>330 Or 85, 89, 997 P2d 182 (2000) (\u201c[Consistent with ORS 133.693(4), the burden is on the state to prove that the warrantless search did <em>not </em>violate a protected interest of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). We agree with the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Janicke </em>to deny the suppression motion based on defendant\u2019s actions when Lucca, and later Hunter, attempted to arrest his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">First, contrary to the state\u2019s argument, the trial court properly concluded that the emergency that brought the deputies to the family property had dissipated when defendant was found safe and dry. Lane admitted that he had no reason to believe there was any criminal activity afoot, that defendant was suicidal, or that anyone else had fallen into the pond and needed rescuing after defendant came forward. At that point, there ceased to be sufficient facts to support an objectively reasonable belief \u201cthat a warrantless entry [was] necessary to either render immediate aid to persons, or to assist persons who have suffered or who are imminently threatened with suffering, serious physical injury or harm.\u201d <em>State v. Baker, </em>350 Or 641, 649, 260 P3d 476 (2011) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Second, assuming a violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress despite the dissipation of the emergency on account of a line of cases, including <em>Janicke, </em>that began with <em>State v. Gaffney, </em>36 Or App 105, 583 P2d 582 (1978), <em>rev den, </em>285 Or 195 (1979). In <em>Janicke, </em>police officers entered the defendant\u2019s house to question him, which resulted in an altercation and a struggle between the officers and the defendant. 103 Or App at 230. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>related to the assault, harassment, and resisting arrest charges against him, because they were precipitated by the officers\u2019 unlawful entry. <em>Id. </em>We reversed, noting that \u201cwe have declined to extend the exclusionary rule to evidence of crimes committed against police officers during what turns out to be an illegal stop or entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Burger, </em>55 Or App 712, 716, 639 P2d 706 (1982), and <em>State v. Weiland, </em>72 Or App 25, 695 P2d 85, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 32 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">More recently, in <em>State v. Neill, </em>we applied the <em>Gaffney </em>line of cases to a defendant who did not act out \u201cagainst\u201d a police officer but, rather, acted in a way that \u201cthreatened the officer\u2019s safety * * 216 Or App 499, 507, 173 P3d 1262 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant in <em>Neill </em>disobeyed police officers\u2019 orders to sit down and not to move \u2014 orders given when they entered her apartment to locate her boyfriend after her son had reported a potential domestic abuse situation and the officers observed blood on her clothing. Despite those orders, as police were escorting her boyfriend away, the defendant began yelling at the officers, jumped up, and ran down the hallway toward the back bedroom. Although an officer attempted to hold her back, the defendant dove under the bed. She grabbed a pair of shoes from under the bed, but one officer testified that she suspected that the defendant was reaching for a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 507-08. We held that, \u201ceven assuming that the officers entered defendant\u2019s home unlawfully, the trial court correctly admitted evidence of her refusal to obey the officers\u2019 orders\u201d because her refusal \u201creasonably led the officers to be concerned that defendant posed a legitimate threat to their safety and to their ability to maintain control of a potentially dangerous situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In this case, the trial court determined that defendant\u2019s actions \u201cwere clearly a direct threat to the officers at the scene and hostile from the start.\u201d The court also explained that under <em>Janiche, </em>\u201ccourts will not apply the exclusionary rule to evidence of a new crime after an unlawful stop, arrest, or search if there is a threat to the officer\u2019s safety.\u201d The hearing record supports the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>determination that defendant\u2019s actions posed a \u201cthreat to officer safety\u201d for purposes of admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s subsequent crimes against the officers, namely, his acts of interference (ORS 162.247) and disorderly conduct (ORS 166.025). Defendant was shouting aggressively at the deputies, and was part of a group that significantly outnumbered the two deputies and that was sheltering defendant\u2019s sister, who had pulled away from one of the deputies. That conduct prompted Lane to request back-up to help reassert control over a rapidly devolving situation. When Hunter took defendant\u2019s sister into custody, defendant and the rest of his family crowded around the deputies. Defendant had to be pushed back. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL ON INTERFERENCE COUNTS</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We turn now to defendant\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error, which, collectively, challenge the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on his three convictions under ORS 162.247(l)(b) for interfering with a peace officer. We state the facts presented at trial in the light most favorable to the state and review them to determine whether a rational factfinder could have found defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As stated earlier, as Lucca attempted to talk with defendant\u2019s mother about her emergency call, defendant\u2019s sister approached and tried to pull her mother away from the deputy. After repeated and unheeded warnings that her actions were interfering with the deputies\u2019 investigation, Lucca attempted to arrest defendant\u2019s sister. Defendant\u2019s sister retreated from Lucca and moved toward her family, at which point Lane and Lucca decided to wait until more officers arrived before attempting again to take defendant\u2019s sister into custody. Lucca then ordered defendant and the other family members to sit down on the ground so that the deputies could continue their investigation; defendant refused to obey.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>When Hunter arrived and attempted to take defendant\u2019s sister into custody, Lane ordered defendant and his family members to stay back. Defendant did not obey and attempted to push past Lane and Hunter to reach his sister. Hunter also ordered defendant to stay back and had to push defendant back twice. After securing defendant\u2019s sister with handcuffs and telling her to stay put, Hunter returned to defendant and ordered him to calm down and to stop yelling. Defendant moved toward Hunter with his right hand raised, at which point Hunter told defendant that he was under arrest. Defendant and Hunter struggled as Hunter tried to take defendant into custody, and, eventually, Lucca helped Hunter subdue defendant and place him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Defendant was charged with three counts of interfering with a peace officer, with each count addressing a different order by a different deputy. Under ORS 162.247(l)(b), a person commits the crime of interfering with a peace officer \u201cif the person, knowing that another person is a peace officer,\u201d \u201c[r]efuses to obey a lawful order by the peace officer ***.\u201d The parties primarily dispute whether the deputies\u2019 orders were \u201clawful.\u201d If they were, then defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In support of his MJOA, defendant has asserted arguments at trial and on appeal that are similar to those that we addressed in the context of the motion to suppress. He argues that once the emergency dissipated, the deputies were on his family\u2019s property unlawfully and, therefore, all of their subsequent orders were <em>per se </em>unlawful. However, defendant\u2019s argument is foreclosed <em>by Neill. </em>As we explained in <em>Neill, </em>once defendant began acting in a way that threatened officer safety, evidence of those actions became admissible to prosecute defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201c [T]here is no principled distinction to be drawn between allowing the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to obey an order of the police under the circumstances described above and prosecuting the offense based on that evidence. If, as we have just held, evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal to obey the order is not subject to suppression on the ground that the entry was unlawful, then, under the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>principle, the order itself cannot be said to be unlawful for the purpose of precluding prosecution for failure to obey it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">216 Or App at 508. In addition, defendant overlooks that the \u201clawfulness of the order disobeyed is to be judged independently of the validity of the initial police-citizen confrontation.\u201d <em>State v. Rodinsky, </em>60 Or App 193, 196, 653 P2d 551 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In this case, as in <em>Neill, </em>the orders that the deputies gave to defendant to sit down, to stay back, to stop yelling, and to calm down were a reaction to his threatening conduct. The record reveals that a rational factfinder could have found that, after exhibiting verbal hostility toward the deputies, defendant refused orders to sit down on the ground, was pushing against the deputies, and trying to rush past them to get to his sister once she was being taken into custody. As in <em>Neill, </em>the deputies\u2019 orders were \u201creasonable in light of that threat, and defendant\u2019s refusal to obey the orders added to the threat.\u201d 216 Or App at 508. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that defendant refused to obey lawful orders by the three deputies, and the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s MJOA on the three counts of interference under ORS 162.247.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL ON DISORDERLY CONDUCT COUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We next address defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his MJOA on the charge of second-degree disorderly conduct under ORS 166.025. Again, we view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the state\u201d and determine whether \u201ca rational trier of fact * * * could have found the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>320 Or at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In relevant part, ORS 166.025 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">\u201c(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Based on the facts discussed above, we readily conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant\u2019s behavior before his arrest was, at least, \u201cthreatening.\u201d Defendant argues that he was nevertheless entitled to prevail on his MJOA because the state proffered insufficient evidence to show that his conduct recklessly created a risk of <em>public </em>inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">At trial, various witnesses testified to the \u201crural\u201d setting of defendant\u2019s property. Defendant\u2019s driveway ran about two hundred yards before sloping downhill and reaching the pond. There were no street lights around the driveway. The only people on the property that night were the emergency responders and defendant and his family. One of the firefighters who responded to the emergency call stood about one hundred feet from where defendant and the deputies were located and could not hear what was said between them. One witness estimated the distance to the closest residence to be \u201cfive or six times\u201d the length of the courtroom. Defendant concludes from that evidence that the incident was in no way public.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We agree with the state that other evidence created at least a question for the jury as to whether there was \u201ca risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.\u201d Wineman testified that \u201cthe screaming and yelling was\u2014 was certainly loud, absolutely [,]\u201d and, when counsel for the state asked him if it was \u201c[sjomething that could be heard around the neighborhood?,\u201d he replied, \u201cI would \u2014 I would think so.\u201d Lane testified that the area surrounding the property is not exclusively rural, but is, rather, a mixed farm and residential area. Lane also offered testimony in regard to the noise level at the scene that evening:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201c[STATE]: What was the level of noise that was going on with all of this happening?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">\u201c[LANE]: There was a lot of yelling and screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">\u201c[STATE]: Would you characterize it as loud?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\u201c[LANE]: Yes, it was loud.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">\u201c [STATE]: And is it something that, on a warm day, in kind of a loosely residential area, on a hot day, people have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>their windows open? This is the kind of thing that they would hear, and would disturb them?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">\u00abH\u00ab * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\u201c[LANE]: Yeah, it could have \u2014 noise carries louder at \u2014 at nighttime. There\u2019s not as many cars on the road that would \u2014 going to deafen the noise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Because a rational factfinder could have inferred that other individuals resided close enough to the property to have been \u2014 possibly or in fact \u2014 inconvenienced, annoyed, or alarmed by defendant\u2019s conduct, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s MJOA with respect to second-degree disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">INSTRUCTIONAL ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s sixth and seventh assignments of error, regarding the trial court\u2019s instructional rulings. Defendant contends that the trial court erred by declining to give his requested special jury instruction that, once defendant was found unharmed, the deputies were no longer lawfully on the property pursuant to the emergency-aid doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In defendant\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s pretrial conclusion to that effect was law of the case and should have been submitted to the jury as such in the form of defendant\u2019s requested instruction. Defendant also argues that the trial court erred when, over his objection, it delivered the state\u2019s requested instruction stating that police officers are authorized to perform community caretaking functions and listing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>several examples of permissible functions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to defendant, that instruction was incomplete, inaccurate, and prejudicial because it \u201cencouraged the jury to find that the deputies were lawfully on the property after they found out that appellant was unharmed and the emergency dissipated \u2014 vesting additional weight in the \u2018lawfulness\u2019 of the deputies\u2019 actions [.]\u201d Defendant asserts that those instructional errors require reversal of his convictions on all counts because \u201cthe deputies\u2019 unlawfulness, and the Bistrikas\u2019 lawful demand that the deputies leave once the mistake was uncovered, inherently is relevant not [only] on * * * failing to obey a lawful order,\u201d but also \u201cresisting arrest, and disorderly conduct \u2014 public order offenses.\u201d The state does not address the substance of defendant\u2019s arguments except to state summarily that the trial court\u2019s decisions were correct on the merits, and otherwise relies entirely on the argument that defendant failed to properly preserve the purported instructional errors as required by ORCP 59 H<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that we, thus, cannot review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">We begin by clarifying that, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s undeveloped argument to the contrary, the alleged instructional errors bear only on defendant\u2019s convictions for interfering with a peace officer and not on his convictions for resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. As clarified below, the two disputed instructions both pertain to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>lawfulness of the deputies\u2019 presence on the Bistrika property and, according to defendant, therefore, the lawfulness of their orders. Those factors are only potentially relevant with regard to ORS 162.247, which required the state to prove, as the jury was instructed, that defendant refused \u201cto obey a lawful order\u201d of a peace officer. By contrast, neither resisting arrest nor disorderly conduct requires proof of such an element. <em>See </em>ORS 162.315(3) (\u201cIt is no defense to a prosecution [for resisting arrest] that the peace officer * * * lacked legal authority to make the arrest or book the person, provided the officer was acting under color of official authority.\u201d); ORS 166.025 (stating elements of second-degree disorderly conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">With that in mind, we turn to the relevant facts, which are procedural and undisputed. Defendant first objected to the state\u2019s proffered community-caretaking instruction following the close of the state\u2019s case. The state defended its proposed instruction as \u201cthe only guidepost\u201d for \u201cthe jury * * * to know what a lawful order is[.]\u201d Before closing arguments, the court and counsel for all parties discussed the proposed jury instructions. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then, we also would like the Court to give our special instruction on the emergency aid doctrine. And the language that we\u2019ve used in that instruction is taken specifically from the Court\u2019s order on June 24th, at page 2, in which the Court found that, once the emergency had dissipated, the deputies were no longer lawfully on the property. And that, it seems to me, is the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Fm going to let the jurors make a determination with regard to the facts on that. Okay?</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Finally, Your Honor, we object to the instruction concerning community caretaking. That\u2019s an inaccurate and incomplete statement of the law, we believe, because there is no basis for the community caretaking statute to come into play, unless the emergency aid doctrine is a valid exception to the warrant requirement before that.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u201cAnd the State\u2019s conceded that in page 3 of its response to our motion to suppress, in which the State says, \u2018This community caretaking statute does not create an independent exception to the warrant requirement of Article I, Section 9. Instead, an established exception to the warrant requirement must apply before the police activity under ORS 133.033 is lawful.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">\u201cSo the statement of the statute is incomplete, and we would first ask that it not be given. But if it is given, then it should be clarified to require, first of all, that an exception to the warrant requirement be found prior to invoking the community caretaking exception, in other words, the community caretaking statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The court and defendant continued to discuss the propriety of the state\u2019s proposed community-caretaking instruction at some length. Following that discussion, the state again advocated for its instruction on the basis that no statute defines what constitutes a \u201clawful\u201d order and \u201cthe community caretaking statute *** [is one of] the clearest definitions of what a lawful order could be in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In closing argument, the state argued that the deputies arrived at the property in response to an emergency call and remained on the premises after defendant appeared unharmed and requested that they leave, because they needed to perform a community-caretaking investigation\u2014 \u201cto find out, is somebody seriously injured? Is there property damage? Is there somebody missing?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Defendant argued to the jury that the communitycaretaking statute did not give the deputies authority to give orders in this case, that \u201cthere were no reasons for the officers to remain on the property\u201d once defendant appeared unharmed, and that the deputies\u2019 subjective belief to the contrary was irrelevant. Defendant also asserted that it was up to the jurors to decide whether the deputies \u201cwere giving lawful orders that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In rebuttal, the state argued that the deputies were conducting community-caretaking functions when they entered the property and throughout their interactions with defendant and his family, including when giving orders to defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201cDefense counsel says, it\u2019s all over. They get there, they find defendant * * *. Their community caretaking responsibilities are over. But that is not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\u201cAfter a minute to a minute and a half, they still have this hysterical woman, who, by the way, has called them to the location * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\u201cAnd then, they made a big deal about your constitutional rights to tell them to leave. This isn\u2019t a criminal case. They don\u2019t need a warrant to go there. They\u2019re not investigating a drug case. They don\u2019t need a search warrant. This is community caretaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\u201cThey have, not a right, but they have a community obligation to go to that residence under the community caretaking statute. They have not only a right, they have a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201cThey are required to go there. They are required on that call to find out, is there an injury to persons? Is there injury to property? Is there somebody missing? The defendant wants you to believe, after a minute or a minute and a half, they should just leave * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">\u201cThey have an obligation and a duty to give orders, and tell people what to do, if they\u2019re interfering, so that they can conduct the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\u00ab* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">\u201cThe police have an obligation, a legal duty, to go out there and give orders, and make requests, and tell people what to do, and take statements to find out what is going on when they are in this kind of a situation (unintelligible).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">\u201cDefendants immediately interfered with what the police were doing. They have a call. Somebody who\u2019s drunk was in the water. An hysterical caller. And they have a legal obligation to go find out what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">\u201cAnd within a minute and a half, people are yelling all over them, yelling at them, screaming at them, preventing them from doing that * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">\u201cAnd eventually, they had to take action. They had to take action, because these people were interfering with what they were doing, and they were creating a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Following the parties\u2019 closing arguments, the court instructed the jury. After delivering general instructions, the judge provided instructions for the charges against each of the defendants in turn, listing the elements for each offense. Regarding defendant, the court delivered Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1240, regarding ORS 162.247(l)(b), tailored to the facts on each count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">\u201cInterfering with a peace officer, a person commits that crime of interfering with a peace officer, if the person, knowing that another person is a peace officer, intentionally refuses to obey a lawful order by the peace officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cTo establish the offense of interfering with a peace officer, the State must prove the following four elements. One, that the act occurred in Marion County, Oregon. Two, that the act occurred on or about July 25, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201cAnd three, that [defendant] intentionally refused to obey a lawful order by the peace officer. And four, that [defendant] knew that [deputy\u2019s name] was a peace officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">That instruction did not elaborate on the meaning of \u201clawful order,\u201d nor did any other. Defendant had requested a special instruction on interfering with a peace officer that focused on the \u201clawful order\u201d element, which the court declined to give, and he does not assign error to that ruling. By contrast, the court did provide an instruction defining \u201cpeace officer,\u201d as well as additional instructions elaborating on elements of the crimes of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. The court also delivered the state\u2019s requested communitycaretaking instruction verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The court then excused the jury to deliberate and the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel for defendant\u2019s sister, Svetlana], on behalf of Defendant Svetlana Bistrika, aside from what was done before closing argument, do you take any further exceptions to the instructions?</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\u201c [COUNSEL FOR SVETLANA]: No, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Same to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>We consider the preservation issue first. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>State v. Vanornum, </em>354 Or 614, 631, 317 P3d 889 (2013) (holding that \u201cORCP 59 H does not set the standard by which the appellate courts will determine if a claim of instructional error is preserved\u201d), we reject the state\u2019s argument that defendant failed to comply with Rule 59 H without further discussion. <em>See State v. Gray, </em>261 Or App 121, 125-30, 322 P3d 1094 (2014) (discussing <em>Vanornum). </em>Instead, we look to this court\u2019s normal preservation jurisprudence to determine whether defendant sufficiently preserved his claims of instructional error. <em>Vanornum, </em>354 Or at 631. The determination whether a particular issue was preserved for appeal is a practical one and depends on whether the policies behind the preservation requirement are met in an individual case. <em>State v. Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, 666, 307 P3d 552 (2013). \u201cThose policies ensure that trial courts have an opportunity to understand and correct their own possible errors and that the parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u201d <em>Vanornum, </em>354 Or at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will thus review an issue advanced by a party on appeal as long as that party \u201cprovide [d] the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that defendant did so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">With regard to the state\u2019s requested community-care-taking instruction, the trial court delivered that instruction following defendant\u2019s express objection and after a lengthy conversation in which defendant asserted that it was \u201can inaccurate and incomplete statement of the law,\u201d because it failed to clarify that there was \u201cno basis for the community caretaking statute to come into play,\u201d unless \u201can exception to the warrant requirement [was] found * * * \u201d And, as noted above, defendant argued in the same colloquy that, without an exception to the warrant requirement, the deputies\u2019 presence and \u201cactivity\u201d after the emergency dissipated was not lawful. That was sufficient to preserve defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that delivery of the state\u2019s instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>impermissibly encouraged the jury to vest additional weight in the lawfulness of the deputies\u2019 actions. Because defendant\u2019s argument regarding the community-caretaking instruction rests primarily on his view of the interaction between the community-caretaking statute and application of the emergency-aid doctrine, we conclude that defendant\u2019s argument regarding the former sufficiently articulated his argument regarding the latter. Given the additional fact that the parties and the court also thoroughly discussed the applicability of the emergency-aid doctrine before the same judge in the context of the pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we have no doubt that defendant sufficiently preserved his argument regarding his requested instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">We turn now to the merits of defendant\u2019s claims. On appeal, defendant renews his argument that the court erred in refusing to give his requested emergency-aid instruction because it was a correct statement of law and \u201ccorrect under the law of the case,\u201d and because it placed the \u201clawfulness of the deputies\u2019 ongoing presence on the property where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the court.\u201d Defendant also renews the argument that the trial court erred further by providing the state\u2019s requested instruction because the communitycaretaking statute did not authorize the deputies to remain on the Bistrika property after the objective factual basis for the emergency-aid exception dissipated. According to defendant, because the community-caretaking instruction did not include the constitutional standard, it was erroneous as a matter of law and misleading by omission. As a result, defendant argues, the erroneous instruction encouraged the jury to find that the deputies were lawfully on the property at all times and, thus, that the orders that defendant refused to obey were \u201clawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We review for legal error. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>329 Or 327, 333, 986 P2d 1160 (1999). A trial court commits reversible error when it incorrectly instructs the jury on a material element of a claim or defense and that instructional error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>in light of the other instructions given, permits the jury to reach a legally erroneous result. <em>Wallach v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>344 Or 314, 326, 329, 180 P3d 19 (2008). Instructional error exists where the instructions give the jury \u201can incomplete and thus inaccurate legal rule\u201d to apply to the facts, <em>id. </em>at 325, or where the instructions insert an irrelevant issue into the jury\u2019s deliberations concerning a material issue, <em>see State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 194, 218 P3d 1281 (2009) (trial court erred by introducing the question of an arresting <em>officer\u2019s </em>state of mind where the defendant in a prosecution for, <em>inter alia, </em>resisting arrest, claimed self-defense, which turns on the <em>arrestee\u2019s </em>state of mind). In assessing instructional error, we look not only to the other instructions given, but to the contentions of the parties at trial as well. <em>Vandeveere-Pratt v. Portland Habilitation Center, </em>242 Or App 554, 565, 259 P3d 9 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Based on the record and rules cited above, we hold that the trial court committed reversible error when it delivered the state\u2019s requested community-caretaking instruction, because that instruction inserted an irrelevant issue into the jury\u2019s deliberations that permitted the jury to reach a legally erroneous result. That instruction \u2014 in light of the other instructions given and, especially, in light of the state\u2019s arguments to the jury \u2014 represented the only compass that the jury, which had been expressly charged with determining the lawfulness of the deputies\u2019 orders, was given to help it navigate that inquiry. However, as discussed above in our analysis of defendant\u2019s other assignments of error, 261 Or App at 714-18, the lawfulness of the deputies\u2019 orders in this case turned <em>not </em>on the lawfulness (or lack thereof) of the deputies\u2019 presence, but rather on whether defendant\u2019s conduct reasonably led the deputies to feel threatened and thereby prompted the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Nevertheless, and as our excerpt of the state\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments demonstrates, the state asserted to the jury that the community-caretaking statute authorized not only the deputies\u2019 initial arrival at the Bistrika property, but also their continued presence after defendant asked them to leave. More to the point, the state invoked the community-caretaking statute as the source of the deputies\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>authority to give the orders underlying defendant\u2019s convictions for interfering with a peace officer and thereby suggested to the jury that the orders to defendant were lawful. In rebuttal to defendant\u2019s contention that the communitycaretaking statute did not give the deputies authority to give those orders and that it was up to the jurors to decide whether the deputies \u201cwere giving lawful orders that day[,]\u201d the state told the jury to disregard the defense argument that, once defendant arrived, the \u201ccommunity caretaking responsibilities are over\u201d and flatly stated that the defense argument \u201cis not true.\u201d The prosecutor gave the jury the impression that all of the conduct by the deputies that night involved community caretaking, stating that \u201c [t]his is community caretaking\u201d and that the deputies</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201care required to go there. They are required on that call to find out, is there an injury to persons? Is there injury to property? Is there somebody missing? The defendant wants you to believe, after a minute or a minute and a half, they should just leave * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\"><em>* </em>* \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cIt\u2019s their obligation. They have an obligation and a duty to give orders, and tell people what to do, if they\u2019re interfering, so that they can conduct the investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Immediately following the state\u2019s rebuttal, the court instructed the jury that, to find defendant guilty of interfering with a peace officer, it had to find that, among other things, defendant refused to obey \u201clawful\u201d orders. However, it provided no instruction regarding how to determine whether or not the relevant orders were lawful. Given that instructional \u201cvacuum,\u201d as defendant argues on appeal, the state was able to use the community-caretaking instruction to imbue all of the deputies\u2019 conduct, including their orders, with the lawfulness of their entry and their apparent continuing authority to remain on the property to conduct community caretaking. Indeed, the state itself twice asserted to the court that the community-caretaking statute was necessary for the jury to understand what constituted a lawful order in this case. The instruction permitted the jury to reach the legally erroneous conclusion that, as the state argued, the orders that defendant refused to obey were lawful because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>they were given in the course of an investigation authorized, even mandated, by the community-caretaking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Lastly, although it is not necessary to reach defendant\u2019s additional claim of instructional error to resolve his appeal, we address that contention briefly because it may arise again on remand. We conclude that the court did not err when it refused to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction. Defendant argues that the rejection of his instruction functioned in tandem with the delivery of the state\u2019s instruction to impermissibly misdirect the jury\u2019s attention away from the dispositive fact that the deputies were unlawfully present on the property at the time they delivered the relevant orders and that, therefore, those orders were unlawful. In other words, according to defendant, his instruction would have cured the defect of the state\u2019s instruction by completing it. However, as earlier explained, the state\u2019s instruction was not defective because it was incomplete; it was defective because it was inapposite and misleading. Defendant\u2019s requested instruction was similarly irrelevant and potentially confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, as well as defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the interfering-with-a-peace-officer and disorderly conduct charges. We also hold that the court properly refused defendant\u2019s requested instruction concerning the emergency-aid doctrine. However, we hold that the trial court did commit instructional error when it delivered the state\u2019s proffered instruction on community caretaking and that the error was prejudicial. We therefore reverse and remand on the convictions for interference with a peace officer and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Convictions for interfering with a peace officer reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\"> The trial court later granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on one cout of resisting arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> In a separate appeal, defendant\u2019s sister challenges the denial of her motion to suppress as well as her convictions for disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer. Defendant\u2019s mother and father, charged with disorderly conduct, interfering with a peace officer, and resisting arrest (mother only), prevailed in the state\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the suppression ruling in their favor. <em>State v.
