J.</author>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In this consolidated appeal, petitioner appeals judgments dismissing his petitions for permanent stalking protective orders (SPOs) against two of his neighbors, Bosket and Carter, under ORS 30.866.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that the trial court erred in determining that it was not objectively reasonable for a person in his situation to have been alarmed and that he failed to establish two qualifying contacts for each respondent. As for Bosket, we agree with the trial court that petitioner failed to establish two qualifying contacts. However, as for Carter, we conclude that there were sufficient contacts to support the issuance of an SPO. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment dismissing the SPO petition against Bosket, and we reverse the judgment dismissing the SPO petition against Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On appeal, petitioner seeks <em>de novo </em>review because, he asserts, the trial court improperly created a \u201ccategorical exemption for disputes between neighbors\u201d and relied on that exemption when evaluating the facts in the record. However, because petitioner\u2019s argument raises an issue of law and this is not otherwise an \u201cexceptional case\u201d justifying <em>de novo </em>review, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for \u201cany evidence\u201d and its legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c); <em>Brown v. Roach, </em>249 Or App 579, 580, 277 P3d 628 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As in other equitable proceedings, \u201cwe view the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013) (stating our standard of review in juvenile dependency cases). We state the facts consistently with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In the spring of 2010, petitioner moved into a condominium with his domestic partner, Kirk. Their condominium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>is located next to, and shares a wall with, Bosket\u2019s unit. Carter\u2019s condominium is located on the other side of Bosket\u2019s unit. In the summer of 2011, petitioner became involved with the homeowner\u2019s association (HOA) and was appointed to serve as facilities chairman. In that capacity, he oversaw a number of maintenance projects in the complex. Prior to taking that position, his relationship with both neighbors was cordial; however, after he became facilities chairman, the relationships became strained and disagreements about various maintenance projects led to several of the contacts at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">I. INCIDENTS WITH RESPONDENT BOCKET</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The first incident occurred on July 28, 2011. Bosket erected a large garage sale sign in his front yard and petitioner asked him if he had sought the necessary HOA consent to display the sign. Bosket became \u201cvery agitated and very angry, got red in the face and started yelling\u201d at petitioner about the \u201cdamned [HOA] board.\u201d Trying to avoid a confrontation, petitioner returned to his residence, but Bosket followed him and continued to yell and angrily shake his clenched fists at petitioner. As petitioner stood at the top of his front stairs about to enter his unit, Bosket yelled, \u201cCome down here, motherfucker, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Later that afternoon, Bosket apologized to petitioner, and a few days later both petitioner and Bosket participated in a previously arranged HOA work party without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A second incident occurred on August 16, a few days after an HOA-approved tree trimming had occurred at the condominium complex. That night, Bosket knocked on petitioner\u2019s door and, as soon as petitioner opened the door, forcibly entered, punched petitioner in the chest, pushed him backwards onto the stairs, and wrapped his hands around his neck. As he choked petitioner, Bosket yelled at him for cutting his trees and addressed him using homophobic slurs. Carter, who was standing outside, told Bosket, \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay for what they\u2019ve done, they get it, come down from there.\u201d Eventually, Bosket\u2019s girlfriend and Carter convinced Bosket to leave. After he left, petitioner called the police, who then arrested Bosket.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>II. INCIDENTS WITH RESPONDENT CARTER</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Several incidents involving Carter occurred in between the two incidents involving Bosket. On July 31, Carter accused petitioner and Kirk of getting paint on his truck while they were working on an HOA fence painting project. Carter \u201ccame out of his garage at a very rapid rate, very aggressively, stormed up to Kirk and started yelling at him\u201d about the paint. Carter clenched his fists violently, leading petitioner to believe that Carter would hit Kirk. Petitioner tried to diffuse the situation, but Carter verbally attacked the couple, calling them \u201cfucking faggots and homos\u201d and stating that he \u201cdidn\u2019t like having queers living next door to him.\u201d When petitioner started to walk away, Carter accused him of \u201cwalking away like a little girl fag.\u201d The parties\u2019 relationship continued to be confrontational, and several days later Carter again swore at petitioner using homophobic slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On August 10, Carter, who was standing outside his unit, told petitioner that \u201che was tired of [] fucking queers fucking up his homeowners association.\u201d Later that evening, Carter was biking on the sidewalk; when he saw petitioner walking there, he \u201cstood up on his pedals and started accelerating toward [petitioner].\u201d In order to avoid being hit, petitioner had to \u201cjump off the sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On August 12, HOA-contracted tree trimmers arrived outside of Carter\u2019s unit. Because Carter believed that he was not given proper notice of the project, he yelled at the workers and petitioner. Later that morning, Carter approached petitioner, who was standing in his carport, and started complaining about the HOA and the tree trimming. He was \u201cvery angry and very agitated.\u201d In a \u201cmenacing [] tone[,]\u201d he told petitioner, \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, you [and Kirk] will be off the [HOA] board * * * by Sunday or you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d After this encounter, petitioner told the chairman of the HOA board of Carter\u2019s threat and, based on the chairman\u2019s advice, filed a report with the police, who later interviewed Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">On August 14, as petitioner walked past Carter\u2019s unit on his way to the HOA board meeting, Carter said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for this meeting because when I\u2019m done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>with you, you\u2019re going to be off the fucking board. I want you \u2014 you queers are going to be out of my neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Two days after Bosket\u2019s attack on petitioner, on August 18, petitioner and Kirk went to a victim\u2019s assistance center to obtain an SPO against Bosket and Carter. As they were returning to the complex in their car, they encountered Carter standing outside his condominium. When Carter saw them, he shook his fist at them and started yelling. As petitioner and Kirk got out of their car in their carport, Carter walked over to the edge of their carport and yelled at them, with clenched fists, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you \u2014 that you called the police, you fucking pansy queer. You better watch your back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">At trial, petitioner expressed alarm that Carter had \u201cthis habit of just suddenly appearing\u201d when petitioner was out in front of his house \u201cor doing something, like going to check the mail.\u201d Petitioner explained that \u201cit\u2019s happened so often that it\u2019s * * * like he\u2019s laying [sic] in wait * * * frankly, it scares the crap out of me sometimes because [Carter] just appears out of nowhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">After a consolidated hearing, the trial court credited petitioner\u2019s and Kirk\u2019s testimony, and determined that petitioner had met the subjective requirement of ORS 30.866(1). However, the court denied the petitions because it concluded that petitioner had failed to show, for either petition, that there were two \u201ccontacts\u201d that would satisfy the element of objectively reasonable alarm in ORS 30.866(1). Regarding Bosket, the court determined that there was only one qualifying contact \u2014 the strangling incident. The court explained that the initial contact \u2014 the July 28 confrontation about the garage sale sign \u2014 was \u201cpurely communicative\u201d and was not \u201ca threat of imminent serious personal violence\u201d to petitioner as required by <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999). As for Carter, the court determined that most of the contacts were expressive and that, although what Carter expressed was offensive, there was no objectively reasonable basis for petitioner to believe that he would <em>actually </em>be harmed. As a result, the trial court dismissed the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">On appeal, petitioner assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his petitions. He challenges several aspects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>court\u2019s ruling, arguing that the trial court erred by creating a \u201ccategorical exemption for disputes between neighbors\u201d which led to its conclusion that neither Carter\u2019s repeated contacts and threats, nor Bosket\u2019s direct threat and physical attack, caused objectively reasonable alarm. Petitioner also contends that the trial court erred in deciding that there was insufficient evidence of two qualifying contacts for each respondent and that the court disregarded the homophobic nature of the unwanted contacts when deciding that petitioner\u2019s alarm was not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">ORS 30.866(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cA person may bring a civil action in a circuit court for a court\u2019s stalking protective order or for damages, or both, against a person if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">That statute requires that a petitioner demonstrate that there were two or more unwanted contacts with either the petitioner or a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family within the previous two years. <em>Swarringim v. Olson, </em>234 Or App 309, 312, 277 P3d 818 (2010) (citing ORS 30.866(6); ORS 163.730(7) (providing definition of \u201crepeated\u201d for ORS 30.866)). \u201c[E]ach contact must give rise to subjective alarm and that alarm must be objectively reasonable * * * \u201d <em>Blastic v. Holm, </em>248 Or App 414, 418, 273 P3d 304 (2012). \u201cAlarm,\u201d for purposes of the issuance of an SPO, means \u201cto cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d ORS 163.730(1). \u201c[T]he contacts, cumulatively, [also] must give rise to subjective apprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety or the personal safety of a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family or household, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that apprehension must be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Blastic, </em>248 Or App at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A \u201ccontact\u201d includes almost any interaction with the petitioner and can be divided between nonexpressive contacts and expressive, also known as communicative, contacts. <em>See </em>ORS 163.730(3) (defining \u201ccontact\u201d). Nonexpressive contacts are physical, such as \u201ccoming into the visual or physical presence of the other person\u201d or \u201ccommitting a crime against the other person.\u201d <em>Goodness v. Beckham, </em>224 Or App 565, 574, 198 P3d 980 (2008) (quoting ORS 163.730(3)). Expressive contacts are those that involve speech, either oral or written. Constitutional problems may arise when the petitioner relies on contacts that involve expression. Under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, in order to avoid constitutional overbreadth problems, expressive conduct is only punishable if it is a threat. Under <em>Rangel, </em>a \u201cthreat\u201d is \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d 328 Or at 303. Qualifying threats do not include \u201c\u2018the kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 (quoting <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 705, 705 P2d 740 (1985)). \u201cHowever, the fact that speech cannot serve as a \u2018contact\u2019 in itself does not prohibit a court from considering it. Speech that does not meet the <em>Rangel </em>standard can provide \u2018relevant context for *** nonexpressive contacts.\u2019\u201d <em>Blastic, </em>248 Or App at 419 (citing <em>Habrat v. Milligan, </em>208 Or App 229, 237, 145 P3d 180 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">When the petitioner relies on a contact that includes <em>both </em>expressive and nonexpressive conduct, the analysis of whether a contact qualifies under ORS 30.866 depends on which act causes the alarm or coercion against which the statute offers protection. If the act causing the alarm or coercion is the expressive conduct, then that expression must meet the standard of a qualifying threat under <em>Rangel. </em>However, where the act that causes alarm or coercion is based on the nonexpressive conduct, the less stringent statutory standard applies. <em>See, e.g., Brown, </em>249 Or App at 584 n 3 (concluding that the \u201cnonspeech conduct\u201d that was separable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>from the respondent\u2019s speech did not give rise to objectively reasonable \u201calarm\u201d); <em>Castro v. Heinzman, </em>194 Or App 7, 15, 92 P3d 758 (2004) (reasoning that physically approaching the petitioner was a nonexpressive contact even though the respondent also spoke, because the encounter was not \u201cpurely expressive\u201d); <em>State v. Sierzega, </em>236 Or App 630, 637, 237 P3d 234 (2010) (finding that a face-to-face contact was \u201cnot purely communicative so as to import the additional requirement of *** <em>Rangel\u201d </em>even though the respondent spoke). If the expressive conduct does not qualify as a threat under <em>Rangel, </em>that communication can still provide relevant context for the nonexpressive contact. <em>See Blastic, </em>248 Or App at 419; <em>Habrat, </em>208 Or App at 237; <em>Castro, </em>194 Or App at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Initially, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the trial court created an exemption from SPOs for disputes between neighbors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In previous cases we have explained that it is often necessary to view contacts in context in order to determine whether they give rise to objectively reasonable alarm. <em>See Weatherly v. Wilkie, </em>169 Or App 257, 263, 8 P3d 251 (2000) (explaining that contacts might appear innocuous when viewed in isolation but, when viewed in context, may take on a different character). Here, the trial court considered the context in which the disputes took place \u2014 that is, disagreements about \u201ctrees, the paint, the projects, [and] the dynamics of the HOA\u201d \u2014 to determine whether it would be objectively reasonable for a person in petitioner\u2019s situation to be alarmed by each contact; it did not create a broad exemption from SPOs for all disputes between neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Next, we address the court\u2019s determination that there were not two qualifying contacts with either respondent that caused objectively reasonable alarm. We agree with the trial court that only one contact between petitioner and Bosket constituted a qualifying contact; accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>we affirm the denial of that petition. However, as to Carter, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence of at least two nonexpressive contacts in the record that could have caused alarm that would meet the statutory requirement of objective reasonableness. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying the issuance of the SPO against Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We first address Bosket\u2019s interactions with petitioner and conclude that only the second of those interactions\u2014 the strangling incident \u2014 constituted a qualifying \u201ccontact\u201d under ORS 30.866(1). The first interaction \u2014 the July 28 confrontation regarding the garage sale sign \u2014 involved expressive conduct that did not constitute a \u201cthreat\u201d under <em>Rangel </em>and, consequently, was not a qualifying contact for purposes of ORS 30.866. \u201c[W]e have repeatedly held [that] offensive, hostile, and aggressive statements are not enough to satisfy the standard, nor are equivocal threats or threats that are not objectively likely to be acted upon.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 585 (concluding that the respondent\u2019s offensive and hostile statements, including the statement, \u201cWe know what to do with your type[,]\u201d were insufficient to meet the <em>Rangel </em>standard); <em>see, e.g., State v. Jackson, </em>259 Or App 248, 250-51, 313 P3d 383 (2013) (the defendant\u2019s attempt to \u201clure\u201d the alleged victim into a fight by yelling profanities did not constitute a threat under <em>Rangel)', Goodness, </em>224 Or App at 577-78 (the respondent\u2019s repeated e-mails to the petitioner, including profanities and threats that \u201cI\u2019m going to get you back\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re going to pay\u201d were insufficient to meet the <em>Rangel </em>standard because they did not unequivocally threaten violence). As explained in <em>Rangel, </em>\u201chyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration\u201d can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee. 328 Or at 303 (internal quotation marks omitted). Petitioner asserts that Bosket\u2019s statement, \u201cCome down here, motherfucker, and I\u2019ll show you[,]\u201d was a \u201cthreat\u201d under <em>Rangel. </em>However, Bosket\u2019s statement was only a vague invitation to fight, which petitioner declined by going into his home, not an unequivocal threat of imminent and serious personal violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Petitioner also contends that Bosket\u2019s nonexpressive conduct \u2014 shaking his clenched fists \u2014 constituted a qualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>contact. We disagree. To the extent that the interaction involved nonexpressive conduct separable from the expressive conduct, we agree with the trial court that respondent\u2019s nonexpressive conduct did not give rise to objectively reasonable \u201calarm.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Brown, </em>249 Or App at 581, 584 n 3 (concluding that the respondent\u2019s nonspeech conduct\u2014 running up to the petitioner aggressively, \u201cclearly angry,\u201d with fists clenched and \u201cfury in her eyes\u201d \u2014 did not give rise to objectively reasonable \u201calarm\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying a SPO against Bosket.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">We now turn to Carter\u2019s interactions with petitioner. Petitioner contends that the trial court erred because Carter made direct threats to physically harm him on at least three separate occasions. In addition, petitioner argues that several of Carter\u2019s interactions \u2014 such as when Carter approached petitioner in his carport and threatened petitioner while shaking his fist \u2014 included nonexpressive conduct, as well as expressive conduct, which was objectively alarming under ORS 30.866.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Under our standard of review, we must determine whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s denial of the SPO. The trial court did not specify which incidents it relied on when it determined that there were not two qualifying contacts, but it reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that it would be objectively reasonable for a person to believe the way [petitioner] believe[s] *** [because] what you have to believe is not that they\u2019re upset, not that it\u2019s not offensive, but that they\u2019re actually going to be harmed * * * because that\u2019s what stalking is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">^ ^ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201cI also find that *** the unwanted contact there was replete with [a] situation where it was really communicative ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">As we interpret it, the trial court made two distinct conclusions. First, the trial court concluded that the interactions between Carter and petitioner were not qualifying contacts because it would not be objectively reasonable for a person in petitioner\u2019s situation to have been alarmed as required by ORS 30.866(l)(b). Second, it concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>unwanted interactions between petitioner and Carter were expressive and, because they were not \u201cthreats\u201d under the <em>Rangel </em>standard, did not constitute qualifying contacts. We disagree with both conclusions. Because we determine that there were at least two qualifying contacts that were nonexpressive that would cause objectively reasonable alarm, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Assuming that Carter\u2019s expressive contacts did not meet the <em>Rangel </em>standard for threats, there were at least two nonexpressive contacts that, when considered in context with Carter\u2019s expressive conduct, meet the statutory standard of causing objectively reasonable alarm. <em>See Blastic, </em>248 Or App at 419; <em>Habrat, </em>208 Or App at 237; Castro, 194 Or App at 14. As mentioned, \u201calarm\u201d is \u201capprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d ORS 163.730(1). \u201cWe understand \u2018danger,\u2019 as used in ORS 163.730(1), to refer to a threat of physical injury, not merely a threat of annoyance or harassment.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>249 Or App at 586. We conclude that at least two of Carter\u2019s nonexpressive contacts, when considered in context with his use of homophobic slurs and vague expressions of violence, would alarm an objectively reasonable person and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying the SPO against Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We first note that on August 10 \u2014 when Carter tried to run down petitioner with his bicycle \u2014 it was objectively reasonable for petitioner to be alarmed for his personal safety. Therefore, we conclude that that encounter was the first qualifying contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">As for the second qualifying contact, we agree with petitioner that Carter\u2019s actions on August 18 \u2014 when he approached Kirk and petitioner, who were in their carport, with clenched fists \u2014 were not purely expressive in nature, and that the nonexpressive conduct constituted a qualifying contact. Because we rely on the nonexpressive conduct when analyzing whether it was a qualifying contact, we need not consider whether the expressive conduct satisfied the additional requirements under <em>Rangel. See Castro, </em>194 Or App at 15-16. Petitioner argues that, on that occasion, Carter\u2019s actions of standing in the parking lot shaking his fist while angrily yelling at petitioner as petitioner drove into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>parking lot, and then angrily approaching petitioner with clenched fists as he was getting out of his car in his carport was a qualifying nonexpressive contact. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The act of \u201ccoming into\u201d petitioner\u2019s \u201cvisual [and] physical\u201d presence constituted a nonexpressive contact. <em>See </em>ORS 163.730(3)(a). Taken in isolation, this contact may not have been enough to cause objectively reasonable alarm; however, when analyzed in the context of the expressive contacts, the record does not support the trial court\u2019s determination that it was not objectively reasonable for petitioner to have been alarmed and apprehensive for his and Kirk\u2019s personal safety. Less than a week before this interaction, Carter had tried to run down petitioner with his bicycle and told petitioner that he would be off the HOA board by Sunday or he would \u201cbe dead.\u201d In addition, merely two days before this interaction, petitioner heard Carter yell to Bosket, \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d while Bosket was strangling him in his home. Finally, almost every interaction that Carter had with petitioner starting with the July 31 incident was replete with homophobic slurs. Accordingly, we conclude that, when Carter angrily approached petitioner in his carport yelling with clenched fists, it was objectively reasonable for petitioner to have been alarmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In sum, we conclude that there was only one possible qualifying contact between petitioner and Bosket, and, consequently, that the trial court did not err in denying that SPO. However, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying petition for a SPO against Carter because there were two interactions that were qualifying contacts that caused subjective alarm in petitioner, and that alarm was objectively resonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Judgment in A149922 reversed and remanded; judgment in A149923 affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> Petitioner sought two different permanent SPOs, one against each of his neighbors. Because the events leading up to the petitions for the SPOs were intertwined, the trial court held a consolidated hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\"> Specifically, petitioner relies on the following statement by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201c[A]ll of the [encounters] revolve around a dispute that\u2019s a neighborhood \u2014 not about, you know, parties that were in a personal relationship, not out of a break-up and heartache, which we all know can escalate into things that are twisted, not out of the, you know, ex-wife or the ex-husband, but things that revolve around the trees, the paint, the projects, the dynamics of the HOA.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
