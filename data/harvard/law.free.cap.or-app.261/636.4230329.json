She contends that the trial court improperly applied ORS 107.137(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which states that, in determining custody of a minor child, a court shall give primary consideration to the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests and welfare\u201d and sets forth the factors that a court shall consider in making that determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In its ruling, the trial court determined that father was the primary caregiver during the marriage and that mother was the primary caregiver since the date of separation, \u201cbut only through her actions in alienating [father.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>As we have previously stated, \u201c [g] enerally, the primary caregiver is the party who has provided more care for the child and with whom the child has lived a majority of his or her recent life.\u201d <em>Nice v. Townley, </em>248 Or App 616, 622, 274 P3d 227 (2012). Like any other factor set forth in ORS 107.137(1), the primary caregiver factor is not dispositive. ORS 107.137(2); <em>Maurer and Maurer, </em>245 Or App 614, 628, 262 P3d 1175 (2011) (\u201cNo single statutory factor is dispositive.\u201d). However, the primary caregiver is afforded a statutory preference, and that preference must be properly considered. <em>Nice, </em>248 Or App at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In this case, the trial court failed to properly consider the preference in ORS 107.137(l)(e) in favor of the primary caregiver. Although the trial court determined that each party was, at one time, the primary caregiver, it failed to determine which party was entitled to the statutory preference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having failed to make that determination, the trial court then failed to balance that preference against the other factors set forth in ORS 107.137(1) related to determining custody of the parties\u2019 children. Accordingly, we vacate the custody award as well as the child support award \u2014 which is predicated on the custody award \u2014 and remand for reconsideration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Custody and child support awards vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> ORS 107.137 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201c(1) *** [I]n determining custody of a minor child ***, the court shall give primary consideration to the best interests and welfare of the child. In determining the best interests and welfare of the child, the court shall consider the following relevant factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201c(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\u201c(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">\u201c(d) The abuse of one parent by the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">\u201c(e) The preference for the primary caregiver of the child, if the caregiver is deemed fit by the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">\u201c(f) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child. However, the court may not consider such willingness and ability if one parent shows that the other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in a pattern of behavior of abuse against the parent or a child and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will endanger the health or safety of either parent or the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-14\">\u201c(2) The best interests and welfare of the child in a custody matter shall not be determined by isolating any one of the relevant factors referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or any other relevant factor, and relying on it to the exclusion of other factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-15\"> Mother requests that we exercise <em>de novo </em>review. \u201cUpon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals, acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d ORS 19.415(3)(b). We conduct such review only in exceptional cases. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c); <em>Nice v.

Because this is not an exceptional case, we decline to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo. </em>Thus, we review for legal error. <em>Nice, </em>248 Or App at 618.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\"> The trial court\u2019s failure to properly consider the preference in favor of the primary caregiver may relate to its determination that mother was the primary caregiver \u201conly through her actions in alienating [father.]\u201d Because, as noted above in <em>Nice, </em>a court determines which party is the primary caregiver by considering which party has provided more care for the child and with whom the child has lived a majority of his or her recent life, the court should not have considered mother\u2019s attempts to alienate father under ORS 107.137(l)(e).
