In 2007, petitioner was convicted on four counts of first-degree sexual abuse following a jury trial at which a doctor testified that he had diagnosed sexual abuse in three of the five alleged child victims. Petitioner appealed to this court; his appellate counsel argued that admitting those diagnoses was error because they amounted to improper comments on the truthfulness of the child witnesses. We affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction; the Supreme Court subsequently denied review. Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, asserting, among other things, that his appellate counsel was constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise an argument that the admission of the doctor\u2019s diagnoses of sexual abuse violated OEC 403. Petitioner asserts that his appellate counsel should have raised that issue in this court after the Supreme Court accepted the petition for review in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Petitioner was charged with six counts of first-degree sexual abuse and two counts of sodomy. One of the sexual abuse counts and the two sodomy counts were dismissed, and petitioner was tried by a jury on the remaining five sexual-abuse counts. The state alleged that petitioner touched the breasts of five children, S, C, T, H, and A, while working as a receptionist at a children\u2019s health clinic. All five of the children testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">During the state\u2019s case, it sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Oddo, a pediatrician and the director of the Jackson County Children\u2019s Advocacy Center. Petitioner objected to Oddo\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following an offer of proof outside the jury\u2019s presence, the trial court overruled petitioner\u2019s objection and allowed Oddo to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Oddo began by stating that he had extensive experience in child sexual abuse cases and that he had conducted interviews and examinations of approximately 1,500 to 1,800 children over a seven-year period. He also stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>that he had attended national conferences specializing in child abuse and that he was responsible for training others to diagnose sexual abuse. Oddo testified that he had interviewed S, C, T, H, and A for the purpose of evaluating whether they had been sexually abused. Oddo outlined the procedure he generally followed in assessing a sexual abuse claim. He explained that he began by interviewing each child\u2019s parent or caregiver; he would then interview the child to gather his or her \u201chistory\u201d in order \u201cto find out what has happened to them to figure out what I\u2019m go[ing to] do with them when I\u2019m done examining them and taking the history.\u201d Finally, Oddo would perform a \u201chead to toe\u201d physical exam, which ordinarily included an inspection of the child\u2019s genitalia and rectal area for signs of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">S reported to Oddo that there had been an incident at petitioner\u2019s place of employment. With respect to the results of S\u2019s physical exam, Oddo stated that \u201c[S] had a normal exam in regards to sexual abuse.\u201d The state then asked Oddo whether he had been able to make a diagnosis of S. He replied, \u201cYes. My assessment was[,] based on the history and physical exam[,] she was sexually abused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The state next asked Oddo about C, who had refused to allow him to perform an examination of her genitalia or rectal area. When asked whether he was able to make a diagnosis with respect to C, Oddo replied, \u201cYes. I\u2019m able to make a diagnosis that she was sexually abused based on her history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">When asked about T, Oddo stated that he obtained \u201cthe same background information\u201d from her as he had from S. He then stated that \u201c[s]he had a normal physical exam.\u201d The state then asked whether he had been able to make a diagnosis of T; he replied, \u201cShe was sexually abused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">With respect to H, Oddo stated that he had performed an examination of her pursuant to the same procedures described above. Oddo noted that H reported an incident of abuse that took place many months before the other alleged incidents. The state asked Oddo whether the delay in H\u2019s reporting \u201cplayted] into [his] diagnosis in any way.\u201d He replied that such a delay was not \u201cworrisome\u201d and stated \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the most common thing we see that they do.\u201d Aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>from the reference to a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d in the above-quoted question, the state did not directly ask Oddo whether he had diagnosed H as having been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Similarly, Oddo stated that he had performed an examination of A and that A had reported an incident of abuse at petitioner\u2019s workplace. Oddo was not asked to provide a diagnosis for A.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">After he had outlined his examinations of the children, the state asked Oddo whether he had experience with children fabricating incidents of sexual abuse:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\u201c[ODDO]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Could you describe that please. Is that unusual? And just in your training and experience why that phenomenon would happen?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">\u201c [ODDO]: The most common cases we see are actually in teenagers for a variety of reasons. If they have sexual contact with someone and they decide that that was not a bad [sic] idea, or if they think they could potentially be in trouble with their parents for that reason, or \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of reasons. But we have teenagers that will come in and report sexual assault when it does not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">\u201cThere are cases where, due to a caregiver wanting to get back at someone [,] or custody disputes, where a child could potentially be coached into a false disclosure of sexual abuse. We see those as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">\u201c[THE STATE]: You said teenagers. Are the girls whose exams you\u2019ve already spoken about here, are those latency age children?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">\u201c[ODDO]: Yeah. They\u2019re preteens.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Okay. In your training and experience, have you had a child of that age make up an incident?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">\u201c [ODDO]: A child of that age.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Latency age. Tell us what that is, latency age?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">\u201c [ODDO]: Well, I mean really, you know, it\u2019s sort of like for medicine when you become a teenager is when puberty starts, but for most people\u2019s diagnosis, it\u2019s gonna be like 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>and above for girls, they\u2019re gonna be started to consider to be teenagers. So, prior to age 12 would be pre-teen.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Have you had children in that age range make up a sexual abuse incident?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\u201c[ODDO]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\u201c[THE STATE]: And in your training and experience, are there particular factors or red flags that you look for?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\u201c [ODDO]: Yeah. In pre-teens, it would be because they are out to get someone. I mean, if they have a stepfather that they did not like, didn\u2019t want to live with, or something like that where they\u2019re out to get them, they can make a false report of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">\u201c[THE STATE]: They\u2019re out to get somebody. You said a stepfather or someone else. In your training and experience, have those people been related to the false reporter?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">\u201c[ODDO]: As best as I can remember. There\u2019s actually not that many cases. But as best I can remember in preteens, most of them will be an issue of someone living in their home, making up that story.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">\u201c[THE STATE]: In your training and experience, has the false incident regarding children that age included more than one child?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">\u201c[ODDO]: It is possible that there [will] be siblings in those cases. I don\u2019t remember a specific case where there are siblings, but there is a possibility. \u2019Cause I don\u2019t remember the ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Oh, that\u2019s okay. What about unrelated, back to the \u2014 I\u2019m still referencing the last question. In your training and experience, more than one reporter that\u2019s not related to each other?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">\u201c [ODDO]: In pre-teens, I haven\u2019t seen that.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">\u201c[THE STATE]: It is possible?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">\u201c[ODDO]: It is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-16\">\u201c[THE STATE]: How long have you been doing this again?</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">\u201c[ODDO]: Since 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Approximately 14 years?</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\u201c[ODDO]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">\u201c[THE STATE]: And you\u2019ve never seen the phenomenon I\u2019ve just described?</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201c [ODDO]: I mean, one of the issues is it can be difficult for me to tell whether for sure if someone is making it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\u201c [THE STATE]: Why is that?</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\u201c[ODDO]: Because I\u2019m not really an investigator. I\u2019m not gonna talk to the suspect, I\u2019m not going to go and talk to corroborating witnesses. I\u2019m just gonna take a history from the patient. There are times when we have teenagers that are friends that come in and make a report of sexual abuse. And for me to know that they were fabricating it, it\u2019s gonna be hard for me to know, just taking their history.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">\u201c[THE STATE]: And all of these questions have assumed that you figured out at some point they were fabricating the story, how was it that you determined that they were fabricating the story?</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">\u201c[ODDO]: Yes, I mean, it takes looking at the case as a whole, but in children that are being coached, there may not be specific details, they may change the details too much, they may tell stories that are just not possible or just not plausible. It\u2019s gonna be those type of details. But in children that are telling specific details, they know exactly who, what, when, where, why, that it\u2019s obvious that emotionally when they\u2019re talking to you that this event has had an impact on them, that it\u2019s embarrassing for them to talk about, those are all signs that it\u2019s truthful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">On redirect examination, Oddo explained why he found the children\u2019s reports credible in this particular case:</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">\u201cI mean, one of the things that I do during the evaluation * * * I have to look at the history as a whole to pick out one specific line of a history and say, \u2018Well, that detail is not right.\u2019 It\u2019s relatively common. I mean a lot of times kids have very consistent stories, but there may be some detail that has changed. What I\u2019m looking for is do they know the person, do they know what happened to them, do they know where they were, you know, what type of details are they describing of the incidences of touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 Hi \u2021</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201cIn these cases * * * because the incidents happened one time, I\u2019m looking for specific details of what happened that one time and what they know about what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Oddo was then asked whether it would have been appropriate for him to look at the children\u2019s medical records as a part of his examination. He replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\u201cI\u2019m sure I would take it into consideration, but I\u2019m really looking for a specific incident. I\u2019m really looking at one specific incident and trying to figure out what\u2019s happened to them during that incident. So unless those reports contain a lot of information about that incident, they\u2019re not gonna be helpful to me. But it\u2019s in the same way I don\u2019t review police reports, I don\u2019t review DHS reports. I get a very brief history from the caregiver, just to sort of let me know the background about what\u2019s happening. But really my assessment [is] based on my interaction with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The jury found petitioner guilty of four counts of first-degree sexual abuse, but acquitted him on the charge that he had sexually abused H. Defendant appealed the resulting judgment of conviction to this court. In his opening brief, he asserted that the admission of Oddo\u2019s diagnoses that S, C, and T had been sexually abused was in error. Petitioner\u2019s specific argument was that each diagnosis was an impermissible comment on each child\u2019s credibility as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983) (\u201c[I]n Oregon[,] a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Twelve days after petitioner filed his opening brief in this court, the Oregon Supreme Court accepted review in <em>Southard, </em>a child-sexual-abuse case in which the defendant was convicted by a jury of three counts of sodomy, 347 Or at 132. The charged conduct was not of the sort that left physical evidence of abuse. The child victims in that case, a boy and a girl, were each evaluated at the KIDS Center, a nationally accredited medical facility that examined child victims for the purpose of detecting abuse. Following national- and state-recognized procedures and guidelines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>KIDS assigned a social worker and a physician to examine each child. The social worker interviewed the children\u2019s mother and foster mother, and conducted an interview with each child. The physician conducted a physical examination for signs of sexual abuse; none were detected. After considering the obtained information, the physician diagnosed the boy as having been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Before trial, the defendant moved, <em>in limine, </em>to exclude evidence of the doctor\u2019s diagnosis on the grounds that it was \u201cscientific evidence\u201d under OEC 702 and that there was an insufficient foundation to admit that diagnosis. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal to this court, the defendant argued that the diagnosis of sexual abuse did not meet the foundational requirements for scientific evidence under <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995); he also argued that the diagnosis constituted an improper comment on the child witnesses\u2019 credibility. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction without opinion. <em>State v. Southard, </em>214 Or App 292, 164 P3d 351 (2007), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">In overturning our decision, the Supreme Court began by stating the three criteria that govern when scientific evidence is admissible: \u201cIt must be relevant, OEC 401; it must possess sufficient indicia of scientific validity and be helpful to the jury, OEC 702; and its prejudicial effect must not outweigh its probative value, OEC 403.\u201d <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 133. The court began with the question of whether the <em>evidence </em>\u2014 viz., a diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence \u2014 had sufficient scientific validity to be admissible. After a consideration of the procedures and methodologies employed by the KIDS Center, the court concluded that the \u201cdiagnosis possesses sufficient indicia of scientific validity to be admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138-39 (footnote omitted). The court also concluded that the evidence was relevant under OEC 401. <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The court then turned to the third part of the analysis, \u201cwhether, under OEC 403, the probative value of the diagnosis \u2018is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>of cumulative evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that the diagnosis was of \u201cmarginal\u201d probative value because it \u201cdid not tell the jury anything that it was not equally capable of determining ***.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. The court reasoned that \u201cwhether defendant caused the boy to engage in oral sex * * * does not present the sort of complex factual determination that a lay person cannot make as well as an expert.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The court next turned to the unfair prejudice portion of the analysis, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cThe risk of prejudice, however, was great. The fact that the diagnosis came from a credentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method, created a substantial risk that the jury \u2018may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the evidence.\u2019 <em>[Brown, </em>297 Or at 439]. As in <em>Brown, </em>the diagnosis is particularly problematic because the diagnosis, which was based primarily on an assessment of the boy\u2019s credibility, posed the risk that the jury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible. <em>See id. </em>at 440-41 (reasoning that polygraph evidence could effectively take over the jury\u2019s traditional function of judging the credibility of witnesses). In our view, the risk of prejudice substantially outweighs the minimal probative value of the diagnosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 140-41. The court then stated, \u201cWe hold that where, as here, that diagnosis does not tell the jury anything that it could not have determined on its own, the diagnosis is not admissible under OEC 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southard, </em>Oregon\u2019s approach to the admissibility of a diagnosis of sexual abuse under OEC 403 was explained in <em>State v. Sanchez-Cruz, </em>177 Or App 332, 33 P3d 1037 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 463 (2002). There, a doctor testified that she had diagnosed sexual abuse based on both a physical examination of the child victim and historical information provided by the child. The physical examination revealed that the child had a large hymenal opening for her age and stage of puberty. The doctor stated that the victim\u2019s genitals were consistent with penile penetration and that the victim\u2019s lack of reaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>to a swab taken by the doctor was further cause for concern. The defendant argued that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis was inadmissible scientific evidence. We began by examining whether the diagnosis met the foundational requirements of OEC 401 and OEC 702. We concluded that it did, stating, \u201c[T]he methodology followed by [the doctor] in reaching her diagnosis of child sexual abuse in this case is reliable scientific evidence and, accordingly, the trial court did not err under OEC 401 and OEC 702 in admitting it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">We then turned to whether the diagnosis complied with OEC 403. The defendant argued that the jury would give undue weight to such evidence because of the status of physicians, disdain for those accused of sexual abuse, and the inherent comment on the credibility of the reporting child. <em>Id. </em>at 343. The defendant also argued that admission of diagnoses would lead to confusion of the issues and undue delay. We disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\u201cWe reject defendant\u2019s contention that the qualification of a witness as an expert somehow \u2018stamps\u2019 the expert with \u2018legal\u2019 approval. Under defendant\u2019s reasoning, the testimony of <em>any </em>expert would be unduly prejudicial. Furthermore, we are unpersuaded that whatever prejudice a jury might feel against a person charged with child sexual abuse has more than speculative bearing on the weight a jury will place on medical testimony. Finally, we disagree that a medical diagnosis based in part on medical history per <em>se </em>measures truthfulness and deception as does a polygraph examination. The sole purpose of a polygraph is to determine whether or not the subject is telling the truth. By contrast, the purpose of a medical examination is to diagnose and plan treatment for illness or injury. Moreover, a polygrapher is looking for physical cues that a subject is telling the truth or lying, while a medical doctor * * * considers physical conditions during an examination of the patient\u2019s body, as well as responses to questions, and evaluates findings from the physical and verbal examination to reach his or her conclusions. Those conclusions are not that a patient is or is not truthful, but that the patient\u2019s physical condition and verbal report are consistent with a particular illness or injury. The reasons that such testimony would be persuasive to a jury are related to its power to establish a material fact, namely whether the victim was sexually abused, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>to its power to appeal to preferences of the jury not related to material facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 344-45 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Returning now to the facts of this case, petitioner filed his opening brief in his direct appeal to this court on April 4, 2008. Twelve days later, the Supreme Court accepted the petition for review in <em>Southard. </em>On October 28, 2008, the state filed its answering brief in petitioner\u2019s case; this court heard oral arguments on February 27, 2009; on March 25, 2009, we affirmed the convictions without opinion. Petitioner then filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court on May 22, 2009; several weeks later, the Supreme Court issued an order holding that petition in abeyance pending the decision in <em>Southard, </em>which eventually issued on October 1, 2009. The Supreme Court then denied the petition for review on January 21, 2010. The appellate judgment in petitioner\u2019s case issued on March 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Six days later, we issued opinions in <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010), and <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 228 P3d 666 (2010). In both of those cases, we exercised our discretion, in light of <em>Southard, </em>to reverse a trial court\u2019s admission of a diagnosis of sexual abuse as a matter of plain error. Several days after those decisions, petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel filed motions with this court to recall the appellate judgment, for relief from default, and for leave to file a petition for reconsideration. Counsel argued that his case was not meaningfully distinguishable from <em>Lovern </em>or <em>Merrimon </em>and urged us to reverse petitioner\u2019s conviction as plain error. We summarily denied those motions; petitioner then sought review in the Supreme Court, but his petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Acting <em>pro se, </em>petitioner timely filed for post-conviction relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680.

Instead, petitioner contends that his counsel was deficient for failing to raise the OEC 403 argument at either of two points: (1) after the Oregon Supreme Court accepted review in <em>Southard </em>but before petitioner\u2019s appeal was decided in this court, or (2) after the <em>Southard </em>decision issued but before the entry of the appellate judgment in petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>In assessing petitioner\u2019s claims, it is necessary to first resolve whether petitioner\u2019s trial counsel adequately preserved an argument under OEC 403 such that it could subsequently be raised in this court on appeal. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d).

It is necessary to quote that objection at some length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cYour Honor, this is a touching case. In other words, it\u2019s not the kind of case that one would expect to find, nor is there an allegation of, any kind of physical injury, physical evidence, frankly of what happened here. And, of course, one of Dr. Oddo\u2019s purposes in examining the alleged victims is to determine whether there has, in fact, been some evidence, physical evidence, of sexual touching. But even taking the State\u2019s witnesses in the light most favorable to the State, there shouldn\u2019t be any evidence, and there wouldn\u2019t be any * * * physical evidence of touching in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cAnd so, I don\u2019t think his testimony would be relevant regarding what examinations he performed, physical examinations. <em>And then, moreover, what his conclusions were based on those examinations. </em>At least what he medically concluded he saw, I guess is what I\u2019m trying to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">\u201cThen we get into this additional issue of Dr. Oddo is basically \u2014 in every report he writes, he states an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>regarding whether the child was sexually abused. And I have, in the hundreds of reports I\u2019ve read from Dr. Oddo, he\u2019s never once concluded that a child wasn\u2019t sexually abused regardless of whether it\u2019s a touching case or not. And that, obviously goes to the ultimate issue [,] which is basically can Dr. Oddo express the opinion this child was physically abused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">\u201cAnd I just want to get [an] advance[] ruling on *** that question. * * * I\u2019ve never had a case in which he\u2019s been allowed to testify in a touching case that this child has been sexually abused. Because obviously there\u2019s no physical evidence to support his opinion because there\u2019s \u2014 now what he will say is the absence of physical evidence doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that they were abused. And I would grant that, of course, because there\u2019s no way to tell one way or the other just from the physical evidence. It doesn\u2019t rule it out, it doesn\u2019t rule it in. What my concern is, is that he\u2019s gonna get up there, and I know he knows better, but I\u2019ve had him try to do this before, get up there and say, \u2018This child was sexually abused based on my examination.\u2019 And obviously \u2014 first of all, again, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a foundation established for that. He\u2019s not an expert psychologist. I don\u2019t think a psychologist would be able to testify in his or her medical opinion that the child was sexually abused. <em>And my concern would further be that the jury would </em>be\u2014 <em>like accord that some weight unduly if he gets up there and says, \u2018Yeah, I believe this child and this child was sexually abused.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cSo I think then * * * we get in the issue of * * * what precisely is he go[ing] to testify to. <em>Now he does do interviews with the children, and I guess I would be objecting to the extent that he testifies about the interviews that it\u2019s cumulative. </em>I suppose I could see the State making a case that he could testify to what these girls said, but it is a bit cumulative. I mean, we could probably run a hundred people in here who have, you know, could say this is what she told me, this is what she told me, this is what she told me, this is what she told me, this is what she told me. But at some point, you know, it\u2019s got to end. We\u2019ve already had the child testify, we\u2019ve already had the interview with the officer, we\u2019ve had a couple of parents testify. You know, at some point it has to end, in other words. You know, at some point you\u2019ve got to say look, enough bringing in so many people who are saying what the child testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>\u201cBut again, I think that\u2019s more of a contentious issue. My main concern is with basically what relevance does his physical exams <em>[sic] </em>have? In other words, if this were a theft case and I brought a doctor in to say the [Defendant isn\u2019t suffering from any injuries, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be allowed to testify in that kind of situation. And again, the State\u2019s theory here, is this is a touching, and obviously there wouldn\u2019t be any physical evidence, especially given that the alleged touching in these cases happened at least a couple weeks and in some cases even longer before the incidents. And none of the children have testified that there w[ere] any scars, marks, or anything left like that on their person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cAnd so, I guess I\u2019m just worried about limiting his testimony. Because the reason, to be quite frank, they bring Dr. Oddo in just to give some aura of credibility to their case and to their witnesses. And they think, you know \u2014 and I can understand why they do it, it\u2019s tactically, you know, a good move. <em>But to bring a doctor in and say, [\u2018Jwe\u2019re putting a doctor up here, we\u2019re taking this case seriously, therefore you should convict him.f\u2019]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201cTo the extent that he\u2019s allowed to get into his examinations and all that kind of stuff, again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant, but I\u2019m especially concerned with him testifying to the ultimate issue in this case on each of those victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">(Emphases added.) The state then volunteered to make an offer of proof to establish what Oddo would testify about. After the trial court indicated that it would overrule his objection, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201cWell just so I can make a record here, * * * he is a pediatrician and he does have experience in interviewing, but he\u2019s not a psychiatrist, he\u2019s not a psychologist. And just for the same reason that the detective, who has also received training in interviewing techniques, would not be allowed to get up there and say, \u2018This child was sexually abused,\u2019 there\u2019s really nothing to distinguish Dr. Oddo\u2019s training, he may have more of it, but it\u2019s not qualitatively different than what the detective\u2019s training is with regard to interviewing techniques of alleged sexual abuse victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201cAnd again, I\u2019m really concerned, your honor, that if he gets up there and is able to say, \u2018[I]n my opinion she was sexually abused,\u2019 <em>that\u2019s gonna carry so much weight with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number><em>the jury when he\u2019s not, again, qualified at least to render that ultimate opinion on that question. And again, we\u2019re not talking about a psychologist, we\u2019re not talking about a psychiatrist, he\u2019s an M.D., a pediatrician. And when there is no physical evidence to say one way or the other what happened here, I think then we get beyond his realm of expertise. </em>And I have no problem with him testifying that, you know, T interviewed these children and this is what they told me,\u2019 okay? <em>I think it\u2019s </em>cumulative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">(Emphases added.) After the state\u2019s offer of proof, the court overruled petitioner\u2019s objection, stating, \u201cI think the jury-makes the ultimate decision even if whatever Dr. Oddo\u2019s opinion is, the jury has the right not to accept that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">To sufficiently preserve an argument \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). \u201c[I]t is essential to raise the relevant issue at trial, but less important to make a specific argument or identify a specific legal source with respect to the issue raised.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 122, 970 P2d 215 (1998). \u201c[I]n considering whether an objection at trial raises the \u2018issue\u2019 being advanced on appeal, an appellate court must view the facts in light of the purposes of fairness and efficiency that underlie the [preservation] requirement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel adequately preserved the OEC 403 argument such that appellate counsel could have properly raised it before this court in his direct appeal. Although trial counsel\u2019s objection was lengthy and wide-ranging, the language we have emphasized above was sufficient to alert the trial court and the state to the nature of defendant\u2019s objection. Trial counsel explicitly stated his concern that, because there was no physical evidence of abuse, the jury would give improper weight to Oddo\u2019s testimony by reason of his title; he also argued that the evidence was not \u201crelevant,\u201d and was \u201ccumulative.\u201d In short, trial counsel argued that the evidence was minimally probative, that it unfairly prejudiced defendant, and that it should therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>not be admitted. That is the rule of evidence that OEC 403 embodies. Moreover, the trial court apparently took that to be the basis of defendant\u2019s objection, stating that the \u201cjury has the right not to accept\u201d Oddo\u2019s opinion; we understand that to mean that the trial court considered the jury both capable of weighing the evidence for its legitimate evidentiary value and unlikely to be unduly influenced to decide the case on improper grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Because the OEC 403 issue was properly preserved\u2014 and appellate counsel, in the exercise of \u201creasonable professional skill and judgment,\u201d would have recognized that it was \u2014 we turn to whether appellate counsel reasonably could have concluded that the OEC 403 issue was not worth raising on appeal. As noted, the first point at which appellate counsel may have been deficient for failing to raise the issue is between the time that the Supreme Court accepted review in <em>Southard </em>but before we issued a decision in petitioner\u2019s appeal. At the time that the court accepted review of <em>Southard, </em>it issued a media release, which explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\u201cOn review, the issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\u201c(1) Whether a medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse based on the child\u2019s claim of abuse and his behavior, without confirming physical evidence, is scientifically valid under the requirements of <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201c(2) Whether a medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of corroborating physical evidence is unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">\u201c(3) Whether a diagnosis of child sexual abuse that is based on the evaluator\u2019s detailed explanation as to why the child\u2019s statement is truthful is an impermissible comment on the credibility of the alleged victim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>We reject petitioner\u2019s argument that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the OEC 403 argument after the Supreme Court accepted review in <em>Southard </em>rendered his counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally inadequate. We do so both because of the state of the law regarding the issue that appellate counsel <em>did </em>raise \u2014 inadmissible vouching \u2014 and the state of the law regarding the issue that counsel <em>did not </em>raise \u2014 OEC 403. <em>See Krieg, </em>221 Or App at 40 (\u201c[W]hether petitioner\u2019s * * * appellate counsel exercised reasonable professional skill and judgment * * * entails an examination of the state of the law at the relevant times.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Petitioner asserts that the inadmissible vouching argument that his appellate counsel raised was almost certain to fail in this court because of our decision in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>121 Or App 460, 855 P2d 657, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 61 (1993). There, a doctor conducted an interview and a medical examination of a child; the examination revealed no physical evidence of abuse. The doctor diagnosed sexual abuse; the defendant moved to prohibit the admission of that diagnosis on the grounds that \u201cany comment on an alleged diagnosis * * * would be a direct comment with regards to the credibility of the [child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted; omission in original). The trial court denied the motion; the defendant appealed, contending that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis should have been excluded \u201cbecause the jury could have inferred from that diagnosis that [the doctor] believed the child\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. We affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">\u201c[The doctor] testified that, on the basis of her evaluation of the child\u2019s interview, physical examination and history, she diagnosed the child as having been sexually abused. Although, if believed, [the doctor\u2019s] testimony supported the child\u2019s testimony, that does not render it a <em>direct </em>comment on the child\u2019s credibility. It was an opinion as to the proper medical diagnosis. A medical doctor is not precluded from testifying as to her medical diagnosis simply because the jury may infer from that testimony that another witness is or is not telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Although there is no doubt that an impermissible vouching argument would have looked unpromising in light of <em>Wilson, </em>the law was not so contrary to appellate counsel\u2019s argument as petitioner suggests. We recently explained as much in <em>Logan v. State of Oregon, </em>259 Or App 319, 328, 313 P3d 1128 (2013), <em>rev pending </em>(2014), where we noted that, as of the time of the petitioner\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court \u201chad repeatedly made it clear that, \u2018in Oregon, a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes another witness is telling the truth.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 284, 844 P2d 195 (1993)) (brackets omitted). We also noted the then-existing distinction \u201cbetween inadmissible vouching as to the credibility of a witness and admissible evidence that merely tends to bolster the credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328. That distinction had been developed over several cases, including <em>Middleton, </em>294 Or at 438, <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), <em>Keller, </em>315 Or at 284, and <em>Wilson, </em>121 Or App at 465. <em>Keller </em>is particularly instructive. There, a doctor testified as an expert in the field <em>of </em>sexual abuse after diagnosing sexual abuse in a young child. In explaining to the jury why she reached that diagnosis, the doctor stated that \u201c\u2018there was no evidence of leading or coaching or fantasizing\u2019\u201d during the child\u2019s interview and that the child was \u201c\u2018obviously telling you about what happened to her body.\u2019\u201d 315 Or at 285 (brackets omitted). The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthose statements amount [ed] to testimony that the child was credible\u201d and were therefore inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>Thus, whatever <em>Wilson </em>stated about the matter, at the time that petitioner\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court had held that a doctor\u2019s testimony that a child had been sexually abused could, in certain circumstances, constitute inadmissible vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In <em>Logan, </em>we explained the distinction that existed between <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Keller, </em>which we restate using terms that are applicable here: \u201c[T]he dispositive question at the time of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial was whether [Oddo\u2019s] testimony about the [diagnosis of sexual abuse] was directed, either expressly or implicitly, at the credibility of [the child witnesses] or whether it simply allowed an inference in support of [the children].\u201d 259 Or App at 331. Presumably with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>that understanding in mind, petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel cited \u2014 by way of a quote from <em>State v. Leaky, </em>190 Or App 147, 152-53, 78 P3d 132 <em>(2003) </em>\u2014 Middleton, <em>Milbradt, </em>and <em>Keller </em>in his opening brief to this court, stating: \u201cTn fact, expert testimony that is even \u201ctantamount\u201d to saying that a particular witness is telling the truth is inadmissible\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Leaky, </em>190 Or App 152-53). The brief went on to argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">\u201cDr. Oddo\u2019s testimony established that he had formed his expert opinions and medical diagnoses that S, C, and T, were sexually abused solely on the victims\u2019 statements that defendant had touched their breasts at the clinic. His opinions were nothing more than statements that he believed that those victims were telling the truth, which were impermissible comments on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel also cited <em>Keller </em>directly. After setting out the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case, the brief stated that \u201c[t]he situation here is no different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In light of <em>Keller, </em>that was a reasonable argument to make, especially given Oddo\u2019s testimony that his diagnoses were based entirely upon what the children had told him. Oddo stated that he had experience with children fabricating evidence of sexual abuse, implying that he was capable of perceiving such fabrication. Further, Oddo implied that, in cases of children who had been \u201ccoached,\u201d he had been able to uncover made-up allegations because the stories were not plausible and the details either changed or were not specific enough. He also stated that, when children presented him with specific details, when it was \u201cobvious\u201d that the described event had an \u201cemotional[]\u201d impact on them, and when the children were embarrassed to talk about an incident, \u201cthose are all signs that it\u2019s truthful.\u201d He also implied that preteen children, such as the ones that defendant was accused of abusing, generally lacked the motive to fabricate abuse that sometimes existed in teenagers. The import of all that testimony was clear: Oddo thought the children were being truthful because they did not exhibit signs of having been coached, they were not of an age or in a circumstance where he believed that they had an incentive to lie, and they exhibited what he considered to be signs of truthfulness. Whichever side of the line drawn by <em>Keller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>and <em>Wilson </em>that petitioner\u2019s vouching argument fell on, it was not unreasonable, even after the Supreme Court had granted review in <em>Southard, </em>for appellate counsel to argue that petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction should be reversed under <em>Keller. </em>The relevance of that argument\u2019s merit is in the fact that appellate counsel may have more reasonably declined to raise a speculative OEC 403 argument when he had already presented this court with a viable, albeit not particularly compelling, argument under the law as it then stood.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Turning now to the argument that petitioner asserts should have been made, it must first be noted that, although the Supreme Court had indicated that the OEC 403 issue <em>might </em>be considered in <em>Southard, </em>there was nothing to particularly indicate that the court was going to decide the case on that issue, let alone decide it in a manner favorable to petitioner. Indeed, <em>Southard </em>represented a substantial departure from previous law. <em>See Umberger v. Czerniak, </em>232 Or App 563, 564-65, 222 P3d 751 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 13 (2010) (stating that <em>Wilson </em>\u201cexemplified\u201d the \u201crule regarding expert testimony as to a diagnosis of child sexual abuse,\u201d citing <em>Sanchez-Cruz </em>for the proposition that a diagnosis of sexual abuse was then-considered admissible evidence, and stating that \u201c[o]nly recently, in [Southard] did the Oregon Supreme Court hold differently\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In assessing the performance of appellate counsel, the potential benefits of raising the OEC 403 issue after the Supreme Court accepted review in <em>Southard </em>may seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>large; however, those potential benefits appear vastly more speculative without the assistance of hindsight. In considering whether to raise an OEC 403 argument in this court after the Supreme Court took review in <em>Southard, </em>the following facts confronted appellate counsel. First, counsel would have had to seek the permission of this court to raise the issue. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1); <em>State v. Jones, </em>184 Or App 57, 60 n 2, 55 P3d 495 (2002) (declining to consider an issue not raised in an opening brief); <em>Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>170 Or App 219, 237 n 20, 12 P3d 507 (2000) (declining to consider an issue not raised in opening brief that was asserted for the first time on reply).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Assuming, then, that appellate counsel could have reasonably expected us to exercise our discretion to allow petitioner to present an OEC 403 argument, there was nothing, in light of <em>Sanchez-Cruz, </em>to reasonably indicate to counsel that the outcome of the appeal in this court would be any different than what it eventually was. As we have stated in the context of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the constitution does not require appellate counsel to be \u201cclairvoyant.\u201d <em>Umberger, </em>232 Or App at 565. Petitioner points us to no authority for the proposition that appellate counsel is ineffective for failing to anticipate a change in the law when there is controlling, contrary precedent during the entire pendency of the appeal. As we said in <em>Turner v. Maass, </em>103 Or App 109, 110 n 3, 795 P2d 617, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 547 (1990) (some citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201cIt is pure hindsight to suggest that because, subsequent to petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, the Supreme Court impliedly overruled <em>State v. Bennett </em>in <em>State v. Lyon, </em>appellate counsel should have known that it would do so. What we must look at in evaluating the first prong of the test stated in <em>Guinn v. Cupp </em>[304 Or 488, 747 P2d 984 (1987)] is what was the state of the law at the time the appeal was pending. Without a more substantial disavowal of the underpinnings of [a prior case] competent appellate counsel could properly rely on the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Although it is tempting, in reviewing the outcome in <em>Southard, </em>to say that competent counsel would have raised the argument that was eventually deemed meritorious by the Supreme Court, we must make every attempt to not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>analyze counsel\u2019s performance with the benefit of hindsight. <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">As such, appellate counsel may have reasonably perceived that the only direct benefit that would obtain by asserting an OEC 403 argument in this court would be the chance to raise that argument in petitioning the Supreme Court for review of our decision. Any prospective value in that chance, however, was entirely contingent on the Supreme Court not just reaching the OEC 403 issue in Southard,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but deciding the case on that ground and in a manner favorable \u2014 and applicable \u2014 to petitioner\u2019s claim. Without the benefit of hindsight \u2014 and perhaps even with it \u2014 it was not at all obvious from appellate counsel\u2019s position at the time that the stars would align so propitiously. <em>See Southard, </em>347 Or at 142 <em>(\u201cOur </em>holding today is narrow.\u201d); <em>State v. Pekarek, </em>249 Or App 400, 402 n 1, 277 P3d 594 (2012) (Edmonds, S. J., dissenting) (\u201cIn <em>Southard, </em>the court was careful to point out that its holding was confined to the circumstances of that case ***.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In sum, appellate counsel may have reasonably decided, given the circumstances that we have discussed above, that raising OEC 403 after the Supreme Court granted review in <em>Southard </em>was not worth the candle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Petitioner has not carried his burden of putting forth \u201cfacts demonstrating that counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d in failing to raise an OEC 403 argument while petitioner\u2019s appeal was pending in this court. <em>Holloway, </em>225 Or App at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\">The dissent would hold, as a constitutional matter, that petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel provided deficient representation for failing to raise an OEC 403 argument in this court before the state submitted its answering brief. The dissent thus advances the proposition that, in order to be constitutionally adequate, appellate counsel must, after filing an opening brief, not only keep apprised of which issues become pending in the Supreme Court, but assert each of those issues that might conceivably, one day, be resolved in a manner that holds out some prospect for the client\u2019s success. Moreover, appellate counsel would be required to assert those issues not because doing so would \u2014 in the view of counsel\u2019s professional judgment \u2014 improve a client\u2019s chances of success on the merits under existing law, but instead because counsel must position the client to take advantage of subsequent favorable changes in the law that may potentially occur, regardless of what counsel\u2019s professional judgment might reasonably indicate about the likelihood that such changes will be forthcoming. <em>See </em>261 Or App 783 n 6 (describing the focus of the briefing in <em>Southard). </em>The Oregon Constitution does not require appellate counsel to advance every conceivable argument in a given appeal on the off-chance that one of them will eventually prove effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">There remains the issue of whether appellate counsel was constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise the OEC 403 issue after the decision in <em>Southard </em>was issued and while the Supreme Court was holding his petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>review in abeyance. On this point, we conclude that the prejudice prong of the analysis is dispositive. Even assuming\u2014 without deciding \u2014 that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to attempt to present this court with an OEC 403 argument after <em>Southard </em>issued constituted a failure to \u201cexercise reasonable professional skill and judgment,\u201d petitioner assumes the following sequence of events: (1) we affirm petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction; (2) the Supreme Court holds petitioner\u2019s petition for review in abeyance; (3) <em>Southard </em>is decided; (4) petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel attempts to raise, in this court, for the first time, the OEC 403 issue as a matter of plain error; (5) we exercise our discretion to allow petitioner to present that argument; and (6) we exercise our discretion to reverse petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction as plain error in light of <em>Southard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Again, it is petitioner\u2019s burden to show that it is more likely than not that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficiencies, that is, that the outcome of his appeal would have been different if appellate counsel had asserted the OEC 403 argument. Petitioner cites no authority for his argument that this court would have allowed him, as a matter of discretion, to raise the OEC 403 issue after <em>Southard </em>was decided. At that point, we had affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction, his appeal from that decision was being held in abeyance by the Supreme Court, and the period during which he could petition this court for reconsideration had expired.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot say that it is more likely than not that we would have exercised our discretion to allow petitioner to present that argument, let alone that we would have then exercised it a second time to reverse petitioner\u2019s convictions based on OEC 403 as a matter of plain error. Petitioner has not met his burden of showing that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to raise the OEC 403 issue after <em>Southard </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We reach similar conclusions with respect to petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that appellate counsel\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to raise the OEC 403 issue in this court during his appeal did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Additionally, petitioner has not demonstrated that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue while his petition for review was being held in abeyance after the decision in <em>Southard </em>created a \u2018\u201creasonable probability that * * * the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u201d <em>Holloway, </em>225 Or App at 180 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 US at 688).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> We discuss the grounds for petitioner\u2019s objection below. 261 Or App at 774-77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\"> Petitioner also assigned error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a special jury instruction requiring a unanimous verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\"> At the post-conviction hearing, the court stated, \u201c[T]he appellate attorney properly raised the issues of the diagnosis of sexual abuse.\u201d Petitioner asserts that that statement represents an erroneous conclusion by the post-conviction court that appellate counsel raised the OEC 403 issue in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. It is not clear to us, from that statement and the context in which it was made, whether that statement was indeed a conclusion to that effect. Despite having argued differently before the post-conviction court, defendant now concedes that appellate counsel did not raise the OEC 403 issue. We agree; whatever conclusion the post-conviction court intended by that statement, our review of the record reveals that, as a matter of law, appellate counsel did not raise the OEC 403 issue before this court in his direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> The media release stated that it was provided for the benefit of the media, and that practitioners \u201cshould not rely on the summaries, or the statement of issues to he decided in the summaries as indicating the questions that the Supreme Court will consider.\u201d Nonetheless, the quoted material sufficiently captures the issues that the defendant in <em>Southard </em>had raised in this court, and thus, the issues that were properly before the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>ORAP 9.20(2) (\u201cIf the Supreme Court allows a petition for review, the court may limit the questions on review. If review is not so limited, the questions before the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Court include all questions properly before the Court of Appeals that the petition or the response claims were erroneously decided by that court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> Petitioner\u2019s original appellate brief made no attempt to distinguish <em>Wilson, </em>whereas the state argued that <em>Wilson </em>squarely controlled the issues in petitioner\u2019s appeal. At all events, however, petitioner does not allege that appellate counsel was inadequate for failing to more vigorously or diligently develop the impermissible vouching argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Moreover, before oral arguments in petitioner\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court had accepted review in <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010), another case involving an expert\u2019s diagnoses of sexual abuse in young children. The only issue in that case, as relevant to this discussion, was whether those diagnoses constituted improper vouching. That is, at the time that petitioner\u2019s case was submitted to this court, and at the time that the Supreme Court held petitioner\u2019s petition for review in abeyance, the Supreme Court had accepted review of two sexual-abuse cases in which impermissible vouching was at issue, and only one case where OEC 403 was at issue. Approximately two months after petitioner\u2019s appellate judgment issued, the vouching argument advanced in <em>Lupoli </em>prevailed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\"> Reasonable appellate counsel could have easily concluded \u2014 from reading the briefing that was submitted to the Supreme Court in <em>Southard </em>\u2014 that the OEC 403 issue would not be central to the eventual resolution of that case. As noted, aside from the vouching issue, the precise question in <em>Southard </em>was whether a doctor\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse was admissible as scientific evidence. Resolution of that question, in turn, required analysis of three criteria, <em>viz., </em>relevance under OEC 401, scientific validity under OEC 702, and the balancing of OEC 403. That is, the OEC 403 component of the case was a smaller part of the larger issue of whether the diagnosis was admissible as scientific evidence. The <em>Southard </em>appellant\u2019s opening brief in the Supreme Court focused almost exclusively on the OEC 702 issue, devoting approximately 24 pages to that argument and three pages to the OEC 403 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> Although we acknowledge that the risks in attempting to raise the OEC 403 issue in this court were, perhaps, marginal, we hesitate to hold that counsel was constitutionally required to raise an argument when the benefits of doing so offered, at all times during the pendency of his appeal in this court, a minimal chance of success. In the words of Justice Jackson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">\u201cOne of the first tests of a discriminating advocate is to select the question, or questions, that he will present orally. Legal contentions, like the currency, depreciate through over-issue. The mind of an appellate judge is habitually receptive to the suggestion that a lower court committed an error.

Yet, his lawyer failed to assert a ground for a new trial that was preserved in the trial court and that was the subject of Supreme Court review in a significant case during the briefing in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal in this court. <em>See State v. Southard, </em>344 Or 401, 182 P3d 200 (2008) (allowing review April 16, 2008). Had his lawyer done so and covered all the bases, petitioner would have received a new trial pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 140-42, 218 P3d 104 (2009) (under OEC 403, admission of a physician\u2019s medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse is reversible error in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse). Because petitioner proved that his appellate lawyer could and should have preserved his argument and that he suffered prejudice, I would reverse the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">To recap the trial court proceedings briefly, petitioner, a receptionist at a free health clinic on the grounds of an elementary school, was charged with six counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, one count of sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.405, and one count of sodomy in the second degree, ORS 163.395. The trial court dismissed one count of sexual abuse and the two sodomy counts. Petitioner was tried on the remaining counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, in which he was accused of fondling the breasts of five girls who attended the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>During trial, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel moved to exclude testimony from the pediatrician who had examined the girls, arguing that the pediatrician\u2019s examination and opinions were not relevant in the absence of physical findings, or were cumulative; the pediatrician\u2019s opinion as to whether the girls were sexually abused would give an \u201caura of credibility\u201d to the state\u2019s case and \u201ccarry so much weight with the jury\u201d because that opinion would be qualitatively like that of a trained detective; the pediatrician would be testifying as to ultimate issues in the case reserved for the jury; the pediatrician was not qualified to offer an opinion that the children had been sexually abused, in the absence of physical findings; and the pediatrician\u2019s testimony was an impermissible comment on the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. The trial court denied the motion after hearing the pediatrician\u2019s testimony in the state\u2019s offer of proof. The jury acquitted petitioner of one count but found him guilty of the other counts. Thus, petitioner was convicted of four counts of first-degree sexual abuse, sentenced to serve 150 months in prison and 10 years of post-prison supervision, and ordered to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\">Petitioner appealed the judgment, and his appellate lawyer filed the opening brief on April 4, 2008, raising four assignments of error on behalf of petitioner. One assignment challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to give petitioner\u2019s requested instruction that the jury must reach a unanimous verdict. In the other three, petitioner asserted that the trial court had erred by denying his motion to exclude the pediatrician\u2019s testimony as to his sexual abuse diagnosis for three of the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">For the assignments concerning evidentiary error, petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer prepared a combined argument that the pediatrician\u2019s testimony about the sexual abuse diagnosis of the three girls was an impermissible comment on their credibility. Although petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer cited a case in support of that argument in which a federal trial court had held that admission of a physician\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse would not meet Federal Rule of Evidence 403\u2019s balancing test between probative value and unfair prejudice, <em>United States v. Funds Held in the Name or for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>Wetterer, </em>991 F Supp 112, 120-21 (EDNY 1998), petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer did not make an argument that a medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of corroborating physical evidence is unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Of the three issues on review in <em>Southard, </em>that one turned out to be the winning issue. As the majority notes, the Supreme Court announced in a media release that the three issues on review in <em>Southard </em>were scientific validity, unfair prejudice, and improper comment on a witness\u2019s credibility, specifically:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">\u201c(1) Whether a medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse based on the child\u2019s claim of abuse and his behavior, without confirming physical evidence, is scientifically valid under the requirements of <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201c(2) Whether a medical diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of corroborating physical evidence is unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201c(3) Whether a diagnosis of child sexual abuse that is based on the evaluator\u2019s detailed explanation as to why the child\u2019s statement is truthful is an impermissible comment on the credibility of the alleged victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\"><em>See </em>261 Or App at 777. The majority also observes that the media release adequately described the issues that the defendant had raised on review in <em>Southard. Id. </em>at 777-78 n 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Simply stated, the crux of this case is whether petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer could have and should have timely protected his client\u2019s position that the trial court committed reversible evidentiary error by relying on all preserved grounds that were accepted for review in <em>Southard. See Guinn v. Cupp, </em>304 Or 488, 494-95, 747 P2d 984 (1987) (in a case involving ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, stating the issues as whether a claim could and should have been raised on the first appeal, and with what result). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>I conclude that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer both could have and should have protected his client\u2019s position in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The issue of whether petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer could have timely protected his client\u2019s position on appeal is largely answered in the affirmative by the majority opinion. Although trial counsel does not appear to have preserved the first issue on review in <em>Southard, </em>namely, the scientific validity of a child sexual abuse medical diagnosis, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel adequately preserved an objection to the pediatrician\u2019s child sexual abuse diagnoses under OEC 403. 261 Or App at 776-77 (\u201cIn short, trial counsel argued that the evidence was minimally probative, that it unfairly prejudiced defendant, and that it should therefore not be admitted.\u201d). The majority then assumes for purposes of the analysis that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer could have added the OEC 403 issue to petitioner\u2019s briefing in time to protect his client\u2019s position on appeal, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s media release of the issues on review in <em>Southard </em>approximately one week after petitioner\u2019s opening brief was filed. <em>See </em>261 Or App at 781-82 (noting that the appellate lawyer could have sought leave of this court to file another brief to present the OEC 403 argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I do not doubt the assumption that we would have allowed a motion by petitioner for leave to file a supplemental brief in light of the issues on review in <em>Southard. </em>The evidentiary error was a key aspect of petitioner\u2019s appeal, and the state\u2019s briefing period was hardly underway. In fact, the state filed its answering brief in the appeal more than six months later, in late October 2008. Thus, I conclude that petitioner could have filed an appellate brief raising the argument that the trial court had erred under OEC 403 when it allowed the pediatrician to testify to sexual abuse diagnoses absent any physical evidence, because the minimal probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Taking the next step, I conclude that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer also should have raised the OEC 403 argument. On that point, as the majority notes, a petitioner seeking relief under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Constitution must establish that his lawyer failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, <em>Gable v. State of Oregon, </em>353 Or 750, 758, 305 P3d 85, <em>cert </em>den,___US___, 134 S Ct 651 (2013), and in seeking relief under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the petitioner must show that the lawyer\u2019s performance fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d under \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984). \u201cFor a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, a petitioner must show that competent appellate counsel would have raised that claimed error.\u201d <em>Monahan v. Belleque, </em>234 Or App 93, 97-98, 227 P3d 777, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010) (emphasis omitted). We evaluate the lawyer\u2019s performance \u201cfrom the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Lichau v. Baldwin, </em>333 Or 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">In this case, the likelihood of petitioner prevailing in this court on the arguments that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer had to work with were dim. As petitioner and the majority observe, 261 Or App at 778, the argument that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer did focus on \u2014 impermissible comment on the credibility of witnesses \u2014 was \u201calmost certain to fail in this court\u201d because of <em>State v. Wilson, </em>121 Or App 460, 465, 855 P2d 657, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 61 (1993) (rejecting that argument). The argument that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer failed to raise \u2014 testimony that a witness was diagnosed with child sexual abuse, in the absence of physical evidence of abuse, is inadmissible under OEC 403 \u2014 had also been rejected by this court in <em>State v. Sanchez-Cruz, </em>177 Or App 332, 346, 33 P3d 1037 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 463 (2002), as the majority explains. 261 Or App at 768-70. The majority emphasizes that \u201cthere was nothing, in light of <em>Sanchez-Cruz, </em>to reasonably indicate to counsel that the outcome of the appeal <em>in this court </em>would be any different than what it eventually was.\u201d 261 Or App at 782 (emphasis added). I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Thus, paying attention to the issues on review in the Supreme Court in <em>Southard </em>and pursuing petitioner\u2019s preserved arguments like those to be heard in <em>Southard, </em>a case with exactly the same trial court ruling being appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>in petitioner\u2019s case, was a promising avenue, if not <em>the </em>avenue, for petitioner to gain a new trial. However, there is no evidence from petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel that he made a tactical decision to refrain from adding the OEC 403 issue to petitioner\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The majority rationalizes the failure of petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer to make the OEC 403 argument on several grounds, but none, in my view, are persuasive. The majority notes that, despite <em>Wilson, </em>there were Supreme Court cases that lent some weight to petitioner\u2019s argument on direct appeal that a child sexual abuse diagnosis constituted an impermissible comment on a witness\u2019s credibility, or vouching. <em>See </em>261 Or App at 779-81. The majority, however, fails to recognize that the same could be said about the OEC 403 argument that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer failed to make on behalf of petitioner in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">For example, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 438-42, 687 P2d 751 (1984), which we discussed in <em>Sanchez-Cruz, </em>177 Or App at 345-46, the Supreme Court concluded that polygraph evidence was scientific evidence and that it might possess probative value, but the court also considered whether OEC 403 required exclusion of the polygraph evidence in that case. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence given, among other factors, that OEC 403 requires courts \u201cto evaluate the degree to which the trier of fact may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the evidence\u201d and polygraph evidence was the type of evidence on which a jury would likely place undue weight. <em>Id. </em>at 439-40. Thus, it was also possible, based on existing Supreme Court precedent, to make an argument under OEC 403 in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal in case the Supreme Court ruled on OEC 403 grounds in Southard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The majority also reasons that to hold that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer should have raised the OEC 403 issue in the direct appeal would require the lawyer to be \u201cclairvoyant\u201d and to anticipate the stars aligning for a positive outcome in <em>Southard. </em>261 Or App at 782-83. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>rationale, though, misses the key aspect of this case: preservation in light of the issues under review in <em>Southard. </em>Petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer was not going to gain a new trial for petitioner in this court under our precedents and so had to be looking to a favorable Supreme Court decision in <em>Southard </em>for relief for his client. And, if petitioner was to have any chance to take advantage of a favorable ruling in <em>Southard, </em>his appellate lawyer had to raise those arguments in this court. That the final outcome in <em>Southard </em>was going to be many months further down the litigation path in the Supreme Court, and was unknown, does not change the fact that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer had the opportunity to preserve two of the three issues on review in <em>Southard </em>but, instead, preserved only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Our decision in <em>Turner v. Maass, </em>103 Or App 109, 795 P2d 617, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 547 (1990), on which the majority relies, 261 Or App at 782, is not to the contrary. In that case, the petitioner, Turner, sought and was denied post-conviction relief by arguing that in <em>State v. Lyon, </em>304 Or 221, 744 P2d 231 (1987), the Supreme Court \u201csubsequent to [the] petitioner\u2019s direct appeal,\u201d had overruled precedent in this court that was adverse to the petitioner during his direct appeal. <em>Turner, </em>103 Or App at 110 n 3. Although superficially similar, <em>Turner </em>is actually far different from the present case. Turner\u2019s direct appeal was filed in May 1984; we affirmed without opinion in June 1985. <em>State v. Turner, </em>74 Or App 179, 702 P2d 1174, <em>rev den, </em>300 Or 64 (1985). The petition for review in <em>Lyon </em>was not filed until March 18, 1987, approximately two years and 10 months after the commencement of Turner\u2019s direct appeal. Appellate counsel in <em>Turner </em>would indeed have had to have been prescient to know that there would be a case accepted for review by the Supreme Court on the very issue involved in Turner\u2019s appeal almost three years after appellate counsel filed the appeal. In this case, in contrast, the media release describing the issues on review in <em>Southard, </em>a case being handled by a colleague of petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel, came out only days after petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer filed petitioner\u2019s opening brief. No omniscience was needed to understand that the Supreme Court was going to decide the evidence issue presented in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The majority also suggests that there was a legitimate tactical reason for petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer not to add the OEC 403 argument to petitioner\u2019s brief, namely, winnowing out weaker arguments. 261 Or App at 783-84 n 7. I disagree that that was or could have been a tactical decision. First, there is no evidence that the lawyer engaged in a tactical decision-making process, much less considered the OEC 403 argument to be a distraction or a disadvantage to petitioner\u2019s appeal. Second, I can see no downside to including the argument. For example, the briefing did not have to be extensively enlarged to argue for inadmissibility under OEC 403, to the detriment of the arguments that were asserted on appeal. Third, once the issues on review in <em>Southard </em>were known, omission of the OEC 403 argument posed a significant risk for petitioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">One can legitimately argue about how a reasonable lawyer would have perceived the likelihood of the Supreme Court ruling the way it did. For example, the majority suggests that a reasonable lawyer would have concluded that the chance of the Supreme Court ruling that the evidence of a child sexual abuse diagnosis was inadmissible under OEC 403 was low. 261 Or App at 783 n 6. But even a high probability of an adverse Supreme Court ruling on the OEC 403 issue was not the risk to which petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer exposed petitioner. Instead, the risk for petitioner was that he would lose his only realistic chance for a new trial if the OEC 403 argument were successful in <em>Southard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">To state it another way, going into his appeal, petitioner held two of the three keys that the defendant in <em>Southard </em>contended should unlock the door to a new trial based on the erroneous admission of a child sexual abuse diagnosis. Because the outcome in <em>Southard </em>was unknown, it was possible that petitioner could unlock that door with either key he held, yet he lost one of those keys on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>when his appellate lawyer failed to preserve it. The benefit of pursuing the OEC 403 issue was not, as the majority concludes, speculative; rather, by doing so, petitioner would maximize his chance to gain a new trial. Accordingly, I would hold that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer did not meet the standard of reasonable professional skill and judgment in petitioner\u2019s appeal. <em>See Laymon v. State, </em>280 Kan 430, 444, 122 P3d 326, 335 (2005) (allowing post-conviction relief when appellate counsel for the movant failed to preserve a line of argument under review in the state high court in a case being handled by appellate counsel\u2019s colleague; the state of developing law favored preserving that argument and counsel could be charged with knowledge of the status of the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">There can be no doubt that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result: petitioner never received a new trial. While <em>Southard </em>was being litigated in the Supreme Court, in March 2009, this court affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction without opinion. <em>State v. Mesta, </em>227 Or App 289, 205 P3d 890 (2009). Petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer filed a petition for review in May 2009. The Supreme Court held petitioner\u2019s case in abeyance pending its forthcoming decision in <em>Southard. </em>The court issued the <em>Southard </em>decision in October 2009. The Supreme Court then denied review in petitioner\u2019s appeal approximately three months later, and the appellate judgment issued on March 25, 2010. <em>State v. Mesta, </em>347 Or 533, 225 P3d 43 (2010). One can reasonably infer that the denial was because the issue had not been raised before this court. Later, petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer filed a motion to recall the appellate judgment, after this court had issued two decisions in which we held that a trial court had committed \u201cplain error\u201d under <em>Southard </em>by admitting a doctor\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence. <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 521-22, 228 P3d 666 (2010); <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 514, 228 P3d 688 (2010). By that time, it was too late for petitioner. We denied his motion, and the Supreme Court denied petitioner\u2019s second petition for review. <em>State v Mesta, </em>348 Or 461, 234 P3d 983 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Because petitioner met his burden to establish the elements of a claim of inadequate assistance of counsel, I would reverse the judgment of the post-conviction court. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-10\"> The <em>Southard </em>petition for review had been filed by another appellate lawyer in the Appellate Division of the Office of Public Defense Services, the office of petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\"> We now know, of course, that the Supreme Court in <em>Southard </em>relied on <em>Brown </em>in its analysis of the OEC 403 issue. <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 139-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-6\"> Defendant notes that the OEC 403 issue \u201cwas less clearly preserved at trial\u201d than the vouching issue. Perhaps a more plausible explanation for petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the argument that the unfair prejudice from admission of the medical diagnosis evidence outweighed its probative value is that he thought it was not well preserved at trial. However, the majority\u2019s conclusion, with which I agree, is that the unfair prejudice argument was preserved and that petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel should have recognized that and could have asserted the OEC 403 argument. 261 Or App at 776-77.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
