J.</author>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Clackamas River Water (CRW), a domestic water supply district, brought this action seeking a declaration that defendants had to return to CRW documents that defendants had obtained through a public records request, so that CRW could determine which parts of the documents, if any, should have been withheld because they were exempt from public disclosure. CRW also sought a \u201ctemporary and preliminary\u201d injunction requiring defendants immediately to return the documents. In response, defendants invoked Oregon\u2019s Anti-SLAPP statute, under which a defendant in an action arising out of some forms of the defendant\u2019s public participation can file a \u201cspecial motion to strike\u201d a plaintiffs claim unless the plaintiff can establish, at a preliminary hearing, \u201ca probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d ORS 31.150(1), (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>defendants\u2019 special motions and dismissed CRW\u2019s complaint. However, the trial court also included in the judgment an order that granted CRW injunctive relief. The judgment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendants\u2019 respective Special Motions to Strike are GRANTED. It is also ordered that defendants are hereinafter prohibited from using, disclosing, or otherwise disseminating any records created, maintained, or kept in the ordinary course of plaintiffs business that are now or have been in defendants\u2019 possession at any time, if such records are or would be exempt from disclosure under Oregon\u2019s public records law, ORS 192.410 to 192.505.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Defendants appeal the judgment, characterizing the second sentence as a grant of the injunction that CRW sought and to which the court determined, in the first sentence, that CRW was not entitled. CRW, for its part, does not cross-appeal; it concedes, in other words, that its action against defendants \u201carises out of\u2019 defendants\u2019 statements in a proceeding authorized by law \u2014 presumably, defendants\u2019 written request for CRW to comply with the public records law \u2014 and that CRW could not establish a probability that it would prevail on its claim. Rather, CRW characterizes the judgment as \u201ceffectively dismissing [CRW\u2019s] claims, and fashion [ing] appropriate equitable relief.\u201d We agree with defendants. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Because this action ended at an early stage, before either party had the opportunity to develop a factual record, and because the court made no findings, the facts are murky. As best we can discern, they are as follows. CRW, as noted above, is a domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264 and subject to the public records disclosure laws in ORS chapter 192. Defendant Holloway was at all relevant times a CRW board member, and defendant Mitchell is a former board member. Between September 2007 and January 2008, Mitchell repeatedly sent public records requests to CRW\u2019s management seeking several months\u2019 e-mails sent or received through the CRW e-mail system. When his repeated requests went unfulfilled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Mitchell, pursuant to ORS 192.450 and ORS 192.460,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioned the Clackamas County District Attorney for an order requiring CRW to disclose the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The district attorney\u2019s office contacted CRW and informed it of the request. CRW provided a letter in response, attached to which were six compact computer discs. CRW claimed that \u201ceach individual disc\u201d contained all of the requested e-mails. CRW also explained that it had not verified the contents of the discs and that it was possible that the discs contained material that could be exempt from public records requests. Specifically, CRW seems to have been concerned that the discs might have contained private personal information about CRW employees, as well as documents subject to attorney-client privilege. The district attorney\u2019s office did not open the contents of the discs due to \u201csoftware problems.\u201d Nevertheless, the district attorney issued an order explaining that e-mails are generally subject to disclosure as public records and that it was CRW\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to review [its] own records to determine whether any specific personal privacy exemptions or attorney-client privileges exist and to adequately articulate the same.\u201d Finally, the order allowed petitioner\u2019s request \u201cfor disclosure of all emails received or sent through the Clackamas River Water e-mail system for the period July 2,2007 through January 3, 2008 * * * as to all non-exempt e-mail detailing the public\u2019s business.\u201d Presumably, \u201cnon-exempt\u201d meant e-mail that CRW determined was not exempt from disclosure under the public records law. The district attorney, in other words, ordered CRW to determine which e-mails were exempt from disclosure, and to release the others to Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Subsequently, in February and March of 2008, CRW\u2019s acting general manager, Lidston, provided Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>with approximately 24 computer disks \u2014 18 more than the district attorney had seen \u2014 supposedly containing all of the requested records, without claiming that any were exempt from disclosure. The parties disagree about some of the facts underlying that event. Defendants appear to assert that CRW turned over the records in response to the district attorney\u2019s order. CRW, however, while acknowledging that its acting general manager at the time (Lidston) arranged for defendants to receive \u201c24 or possibly more computer discs,\u201d nonetheless alleged in its complaint that \u201c[defendants did not obtain the documents pursuant to the public records request process.\u201d Regardless of whose account is more accurate, it is undisputed that (1) Mitchell repeatedly requested certain e-mails, (2) CRW originally did not provide them, (3) Mitchell requested intervention from the district attorney, (4) the district attorney ordered CRW to provide nonexempt e-mails, and (5) CRW\u2019s general manager subsequently provided Mitchell with the computer discs that CRW, in this action, wants returned. Holloway apparently received the discs from Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">In February 2009, CRW, having hired a new general manager, began its attempt to secure the return of the computer discs. It intensified its efforts after a representative of CRW\u2019s employees\u2019 union protested that the employees had \u201cconcerns * * * about the possible mishandlings of employees\u2019 personal information.\u201d A series of communications between CRW and defendants followed. CRW offered to have the information in the discs reviewed by a neutral third-party who would identify information that was exempt from public disclosure, allowing defendants to retain the other information. Defendants did not accept the offer and did not return the discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">CRW subsequently brought this action against defendants, asking for a judgment declaring that \u201cdefendants are required, in their capacities as both current or former CRW Commissioners and members of the public, to return the documents to CRW, so that CRW may determine what information the documents contain that is exempt from public disclosure.\u201d CRW also requested an order \u201cfor temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, specifically requiring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>defendants immediately return the documents to CRW, which shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the Court orders otherwise.\u201d With respect to its claim for injunctive relief, CRW argued that it had no adequate remedy at law and it would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-4\">\u201cbe irreparably harmed by defendants\u2019 continued possession of information that is likely exempt from public disclosure along with the possibility that such information will be disclosed to additional members of the public thus exposing CRW to the possibility of legal action by employees who feel their privacy rights may have been violated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In response, defendants filed special motions to strike under ORS 31.150, the \u201cAnti-SLAPP statute.\u201d Defendant Mitchell argued that CRW\u2019s case was a civil action arising out of a public records request. Thus, according to Mitchell, defendants had succeeded in making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the case arose out of a proceeding authorized by law. Mitchell then argued that CRW would be unable to meet its burden by \u201cestablish [ing] that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a <em>prima facie </em>case,\u201d as required by ORS 31.150(3). Defendant Holloway filed a similar motion providing additional reasons why CRW could not meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">A hearing on defendants\u2019 special motions to strike occurred in July 2011. During the hearing, it became clear that CRW did not know precisely what information had been provided to defendants. The court reluctantly granted defendants\u2019 motions dismissing CRW\u2019s claim, explaining that \u201cthe motion at least on its face does appear to be an appropriate use of the anti-SLAPP statute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CRW responded that dismissing the lawsuit would leave it without any way of recovering any personal employee information that may have been disclosed. The court sought to address that concern by suggesting that the court add language to the order that would \u201cprohibit the defendants from using, disseminating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>[or] publishing\u201d such information. Both defendants objected to the court\u2019s proposed order, to no avail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The trial court\u2019s judgment and CRW\u2019s defense of it find no support in the law. For instance, CRW repeatedly states that the court did nothing more than require defendants to obey the mandates of Oregon\u2019s public records law. That is not correct for at least two reasons. First, the public records law imposes disclosure obligations, and exemptions from those obligations, on public entities; it does not impose any obligations or exemptions on private parties. Second, and more importantly, the public records law does not prohibit disclosure of exempt records; it gives public agencies and officials the <em>option </em>to withhold records from disclosure. <em>Guard Publishing Co. v. Lane County School Dist., </em>310 Or 32, 38 n 6, 791 P2d 854 (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When CRW\u2019s employee, Lidston, released documents to defendants after the district attorney made it clear to CRW that it was <em>CRW\u2019s </em>obligation to identify and withhold any exempt information that it did not want to release, CRW manifested an intention to refrain from exercising its option to withhold. Plaintiffs cite no authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that an agency that has released possibly exempt documents can have second thoughts and recall them for a do-over.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">CRW attempts to dissociate itself from Lidston and his actions. In its complaint, CRW asserts that \u201cdefendants obtained the documents *** pursuant to an arrangement with CRW\u2019s then-Acting General Manager, Steve Lidston. Defendants did not obtain the documents pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>public records request process.\u201d In its brief, CRW asserts that Lidston \u201cwas acting outside the scope of his authority in releasing exempt documents.\u201d Nothing in the record supports either of those assertions. There is no dispute on this record that, when Lidston released the records, he was CRW\u2019s acting general manager, that review of public records requests was among his duties, and that he released the records after the district attorney\u2019s decision. Indeed, CRW\u2019s statement of facts confirms as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">\u201cThe District Attorney\u2019s decision was consistent with Oregon public records laws, and specifically recognized the personal privacy and attorney-client privilege exemptions from public disclosure. The decision stated that it was CRW\u2019s responsibility to review its records to determine if any of the documents Mitchell had requested fell within these exemptions. But Lidston thereafter simply released all the requested records, and by all accounts did not engage in further (or any) review to first determine if any of the information contained within the records was exempt from disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">(Citations omitted.) The fact that a subsequent general manager believed that Lidston\u2019s exercise of judgment was ill advised does not mean that Lidston\u2019s exercise of judgment was illegal or outside of the scope of his authority. Because its agent voluntarily released the documents, CRW was not entitled to their return, as it requested in its complaint, nor to compel defendants to refrain from disseminating or using them, as the court ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Further, we agree with defendants that the court erred in its attempt to dismiss CRW\u2019s complaint, as required by the anti-SLAPP statute, while also deciding the case on its merits in favor of CRW. Our conclusion has nothing to do with chronological sequence. CRW may be correct in asserting that the judgment containing the grant of defendants\u2019 special motion to strike and the injunction granting CRW the relief it sought occurred simultaneously, when the judgment was entered. The dispositive fact, however, is that the motion to dismiss CRW\u2019s complaint is <em>logically </em>prior to a decision on the merits. The anti-SLAPP statute provides defendants with a mechanism by which they can minimize or avoid costly litigation. \u201cThe purpose of the procedure * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>is to provide a defendant with the right to <em>not proceed to trial </em>in cases in which the plaintiff does not meet the burden specified in ORS 31.150(3).\u201d ORS 31.152(4) (emphasis added). That burden is \u201cto establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d ORS 31.150(3). The trial court, when it granted defendants\u2019 special motion to strike, ruled that CRW did not meet its burden, and CRW does not appeal that decision. Nothing in the anti-SLAPP statute allows a court to grant a defendants\u2019 special motion to strike, but to then \u201cproceed to trial.\u201d For that reason, the court erred in also reaching the merits of CRW\u2019s underlying complaint after granting defendants\u2019 motion to strike. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of a judgment of dismissal without prejudice. ORS 31.150(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\"> \u201cSLAPP\u201d is an acronym for \u201cStrategic Litigation Against Public Participation.\u201d Hence, an \u201cAnti-SLAPP\u201d statute is one that allows defendants who claim that the litigation against them is a strategic attempt to chill their participation in public affairs to expeditiously obtain dismissal before incurring significant litigation expenses by filing, instead of an answer, a \u201cspecial motion to strike\u201d the complaint. Oregon\u2019s version, ORS 31.150, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">\u201c(1) A defendant may make a special motion to strike against a claim in a civil action described in subsection (2) of this section. The court shall grant the motion unless the plaintiff establishes in the manner provided by subsection (3) of this section that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim. The special motion to strike shall be treated as a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A but shall not be subject to ORCP 21 P. Upon granting the special motion to strike, the court shall enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice. If the court denies a special motion to strike, the court shall enter a limited judgment denying the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">\u201c(2) A special motion to strike may be made under this section against any claim in a civil action that arises out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\u201c(a) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in a legislative, executive or judicial proceeding or other proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">\u201c(3) A defendant making a special motion to strike under the provisions of this section has the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that the claim against which the motion is made arises out of a statement, document or conduct described in subsection (2) of this section. If the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff in the action to establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a prima facie case. If the plaintiff meets this burden, the court shall deny the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\"> ORS 192.450 provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cany person denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of a state agency may petition the Attorney General to review the public record to determine if it may be withheld from public inspection.

Defendant Holloway filed a notice of appeal from that order in September. The court subsequently issued a general judgment on November 18, 2011. When that judgment was entered, however, the court lacked jurisdiction over the case because of Holloway\u2019s premature appeal. We ordered defendants to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed. Defendants then filed a motion to give the trial court leave to reenter the judgment pursuant to ORS 19.270(4). We granted that motion. The amended judgment, which was entered on April 2, provided that plaintiffs claims were dismissed and that the \u201corder dated August 30, 2011 [, including the requirement that defendants release all non-exempt documents] remains in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\"> This case does not require us to decide, and we do not decide, whether provisions outside of the public records law might prohibit the disclosure or publication of public records.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
