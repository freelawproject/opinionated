The court imposed a downward departure sentence, from the presumptive sentence of 24 months in prison, as required by ORS 137.717, to a sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation, subject to conditions. Defendant violated his probation by committing the offense of driving while suspended. The trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and imposed a sentence of 24 months in prison, and also denied defendant\u2019s eligibility for early release or alternative incarceration programs (AIP) under ORS 137.750. On appeal, defendant does not challenge the revocation of his probation or the imposition of the 24-month prison sentence. He asserts only that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that there were substantial and compelling reasons for denying defendant\u2019s eligibility for sentence modification programs. Because we conclude that the court did not err, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The significant facts are largely undisputed. Defendant admitted the probation violation at a probation revocation hearing. The state requested that defendant receive a sentence of 24 months in prison, with one year of post-prison supervision, explaining that that the 24-month prison sentence was justified by defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested a sentence of 18 months in prison, explaining that the lesser sentence was warranted because defendant had not had any \u201cdirty UAs\u201d while on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The court agreed with the state that the purposes of probation were not being served and revoked defendant\u2019s probation. The court also agreed with the state\u2019s sentencing recommendation:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will sentence you to 24 months with the Department of Corrections, with 12 months post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201cYour criminal history is so lengthy, sir, that anyone would think twice about giving you a break at this point. It\u2019s rare that when I look at them they go the full page and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>then on to the second page. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah, but a child molester gets 13 months and I get 24 months. That makes no sense. That\u2019s all I got to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s because you\u2019re you, and you have a different criminal history, and obviously a different attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I sure do.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, you do, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Can I go now?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: No. * * * Have a seat in the jury box.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The trial court further concluded that defendant would not be eligible for any sentence modification programs under ORS 137.750:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Oh, also, there will be no [programs] and no good time. I find substantial and compelling reasons based on his attitude as well as his criminal history, to deny both. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: For the record, your Honor, we would object.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes. Your objection is noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">The judgment revoking defendant\u2019s probation imposed a 24-month prison sentence and expressly provided that defendant would not be eligible for any sentence modification programs:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant may not be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release, alternative incarceration program or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which defendant is otherwise eligible at the time of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-17\">On appeal, defendant does not challenge the revocation of his probation or the imposition of the 24-month sentence or the term of post-prison supervision. He challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>only the court\u2019s decision to deny eligibility for sentence modification programs, contending that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons,\u201d as required by ORS 137.750 (in sentencing a defendant, a court may find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons to order that the defendant not be considered for\u201d sentence modification programs).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The state asserts that any objection to the finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d is not preserved, is not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and is not reviewable. We conclude that the objection is preserved. Although cryptic, the record reflects that defendant\u2019s objection was a challenge to the finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons.\u201d ORS 137.750(1). The court noted defendant\u2019s objection, and it is apparent that the court understood defendant\u2019s objection to relate to the finding of substantial and compelling reasons, which was a prerequisite to the court\u2019s decision to deny eligibility for sentence modification programs. We conclude that defendant\u2019s objection was sufficient to preserve for appeal defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred in finding substantial and compelling reasons for denying eligibility for sentence modification programs. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The state next contends that, because defendant pleaded guilty, his claim is not reviewable under ORS 138.050, which defendant cites as the basis for this court\u2019s jurisdiction. We agree with the state that ORS 138.050 is not a basis for jurisdiction over the appeal of defendant\u2019s sentence on the felony offense of second-degree burglary. <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 91, 261 P3d 1234 (2011); <em>State v. Brewer, </em>260 Or App 607, 320 P3d 620 (2014). However, the appeal is within this court\u2019s jurisdiction under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>138.222(7) (\u201cEither the state or the defendant may appeal a judgment of conviction based on the sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989 [,]\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, we conclude that defendant\u2019s contention that the factual bases on which the trial court relied are insufficient to support a finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d is subject to review as an error in the imposition of a sentence, ORS 138.222(4)(a), and also presents a colorable claim of error. ORS 138.222(7). <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rardin, </em>338 Or 399, 408, 110 P3d 580 (2005) (claim of error is \u201ccolorable\u201d if it reasonably may be asserted under current law and is plausible given the facts and the current law or a reasonable extension or modification of current law); <em>see also State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Balderas, </em>172 Or App 223, 18 P3d 434 (2001) (discussing \u201ccolorable claim\u201d in context of challenge to sufficiency of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The remaining question is whether the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that substantial and compelling reasons support its order that defendant not be eligible for sentence modification programs. There is no definition of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d in the context of a court\u2019s decision under ORS 137.750. In defendant\u2019s view, in making a \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d determination under ORS 137.750, the nonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors set forth in OAR 213-008-0002 (l)(b) for determining whether substantial and compelling reasons exist for a departure sentence should guide the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Under those factors, defendant contends, the court erred in treating defendant\u2019s attitude at the hearing as a substantial and compelling reason because, when compared to the more extreme conduct that might be expected from a defendant at sentencing, defendant\u2019s behavior was mild. At most, defendant contends, he expressed displeasure with the sentence, which he asserts is a natural response that should not be considered a substantial and compelling reason to deny him access to programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Defendant further contends that his lengthy criminal history has previously been taken into account in setting his criminal history score and his presumptive sentence of 24 months and cannot, by itself, also provide a substantial and compelling reason for denying him access to programs. At the time of his original sentencing, the court determined that defendant was within sentencing grid block 2A, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>would have resulted in a presumptive sentence of probation on the burglary charge. But because defendant had prior property crime convictions, the version of ORS 137.717 then applicable provided for a presumptive sentence of 18 months in prison, to be increased by two months for each property offense, up to 12 additional months. ORS 137.717(3) (2009). By that calculation, defendant explains, his prior convictions necessarily have been taken into account in his prison sentence of 24 months, and cannot be considered again in determining his eligibility for programs. In support of his position, defendant cites <em>State v. Perez, </em>196 Or App 364, 372-73, 102 P3d 705 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 488 (2005), in which we held that aggravating factors used to impose a departure sentence necessarily require a finding of one or more facts other than the offender\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The state responds that a court\u2019s determination under ORS 137.750 for eligibility for AIP is not a departure sentence and that the factors set out in OAR 213-008-0002 relating to a court\u2019s finding of substantial and compelling reasons for a departure sentence do not explicitly apply and thus do not restrict a court\u2019s determination of eligibility for early release programs or AIP. In the state\u2019s view, there is nothing in the Oregon Criminal Code or the Oregon Justice Commission rules to prevent the trial court from considering defendant\u2019s attitude at the sentencing hearing, as well as his criminal history, in determining his eligibility for sentence modification programs under ORS 137.750.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We agree with the state that the factors set forth in OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b) are not expressly applicable to the determination under ORS 137.750. We conclude, further, that a defendant\u2019s attitude at sentencing is a circumstance that the trial court may take into account at sentencing in determining eligibility for sentence modification programs. <em>See State v. Schaeffer, </em>9 Or App 609, 611-12, 497 P2d 684 (1972) (noting that at probation revocation hearing, the trial court could \u201cbelieve that defendant\u2019s former manipulative attitude and defiance were continuing\u201d (in determining that the purposes of probation were not being served)). Although we are not in a position to assess defendant\u2019s demeanor at sentencing, having read the transcript, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to permit the trial court to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>defendant displayed an attitude that showed that he was not remorseful, and we conclude that the court could take that attitude into account in determining defendant\u2019s eligibility for sentence modification programs under ORS 137.750.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">We conclude that the trial court could also take into account defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history. As the state points out, the court\u2019s order does not simply duplicate consideration of defendant\u2019s criminal history that provided the basis for the presumptive 24-month sentence. Defendant\u2019s criminal history is not in the record, but the record is sufficient to conclude that defendant\u2019s criminal history, which the trial court found \u201cis so lengthy\u201d that it extended to the second page, includes convictions or juvenile adjudications in addition to those that would be required to support a 24-month sentence. There is nothing that precludes a court from basing its \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d determination under ORS 137.750 on factors such as a defendant\u2019s criminal history beyond that providing a basis for a presumptive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The trial court noted on the record the exceptional length of defendant\u2019s criminal record. We conclude that the trial court did not err in taking that record into account, along with defendant\u2019s attitude, in determining that defendant would not be eligible for sentence modification programs under ORS 137.750. The trial court initially accepted the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement when the court imposed a downward departure sentence of 36 months\u2019 probation. Under the circumstances at the time of sentencing defendant on the probation revocation, the trial court did not err in finding that there were substantial and compelling reasons for denying defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> ORS 137.750(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cWhen a court sentences a defendant to a term of incarceration upon conviction of a crime, the court shall order on the record in open court as part of the sentence imposed that the defendant may be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which the defendant is otherwise eligible at the time of sentencing, unless the court finds on the record in open court substantial and compelling reasons to order that the defendant not be considered for such leave, release or program.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-5\"> ORS 138.222(7) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cEither the state or the defendant may appeal a judgment of conviction based on the sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1,1989, to the Court of Appeals subject to the limitations of Or Laws (1989), ch 790.
