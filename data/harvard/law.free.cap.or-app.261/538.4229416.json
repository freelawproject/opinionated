We conclude that the record is legally insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that the bases for continued jurisdiction persisted. The grounds for jurisdiction recited by the juvenile court did not pose a current threat of serious loss or injury to A that is reasonably likely to be realized. Therefore, we reverse and remand with instructions to terminate the wardship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The parties do not request that we exercise our discretion to review the facts of this case <em>de novo, </em>ORS 19.415 (3)(b), and we decline to do so. ORAP 5.40(8)(a). Thus, we view the evidence \u201cas supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s [determination] and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d De<em>pt. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Pursuant to that standard, we recite the facts consistently with the juvenile court\u2019s expressed and implied findings. Father was a resident of the State of Washington when A was removed from mother\u2019s care in Oregon in February 2012.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DHS petitioned the juvenile court to take jurisdiction over A, pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Father stipulated to the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction based on the following pertinent facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u201cg) Further, DHS spoke with [father] on February 24, 2012 [,] and he stated his [wife] currently has an open DHS case in Douglas County as to her two children * * *. [Those] children *** are not in [wife\u2019s] care due to [DHS] intervention, although Washington State Child Welfare has determined it would be safe for their newborn son, [G], [t]o remain in their care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201ch) Further, [wife]\u2019s *** two children were removed from her care in 2009 due to the condition of her home, domestic violence, and [wife]\u2019s drug use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cj) [S]ince splitting up with [mother] in September 2010, [father] has not been able to have very much contact with [A]. He last had a facet-]to[-]face visit approximately eight months ago in California. [Father] and [A] need the assistance of DHS to help them reestablish their relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201ck) Further, [father] does not have custody of [A] and would be unable to protect her from [mother]\u2019s drug use and neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Before the Oregon juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over A, the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (WDSHS) had opened a dependency case for father\u2019s youngest child, G, in Washington. G was initially placed in the custody of wife\u2019s grandmother, but father and wife shared a residence with G and wife\u2019s grandmother at all times. G was returned to the custody of his parents, and all three then moved to a separate residence while the WDSHS dependency case remained open.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In July and December 2012, to enable placement of A with father, DHS requested that WDSHS complete a home study of father\u2019s home through the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC). On both occasions, WDSHS summarily denied father approval as a placement resource, without completing a home study. WDSHS closed its dependency case relating to G in February 2013. In March 2013, father participated in a parent-child interaction facilitated by DHS, which yielded positive results, such that the evaluator recommended that DHS place A with father. In April 2013, DHS again asked WDSHS to evaluate father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Father also successfully maintained ongoing telephone contact with A, and he and wife travelled to Oregon to have face-to-face visits with A once per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In May 2013, the juvenile court held a permanency hearing. DHS requested that the court continue the permanency plan of reunification with father. As relevant here, father\u2019s attorney filed a motion to dismiss jurisdiction and terminate the wardship. Father argued that he had ameliorated the adjudicated bases for jurisdiction, and to the extent that any of the jurisdictional bases persisted, they did not expose A to a current threat of serious loss or injury that was likely to be realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">DHS\u2019s primary argument at the hearing in support of continuing jurisdiction was that more time was necessary to obtain a home study through the Washington ICPC so that DHS could place A with father. DHS also argued that the facts on which dependency jurisdiction had been based, as to father, persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">No sworn testimony was offered at the permanency hearing. DHS offered 22 exhibits, all of which were received into evidence without objection. Much of the evidence presented focused on mother\u2019s past drug and alcohol use, mother\u2019s sporadic progress at engaging in recommended services, general information regarding the WDSHS case relating to G and the Douglas County cases relating to wife\u2019s two older children, a recent incident involving wife in which she spoke to her two older children in an inappropriate manner during a visit, the successful parent-child interaction between father and A, father\u2019s and wife\u2019s ongoing positive contact, and A\u2019s recent behavioral issues in which she had begun acting out in response to visits with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">With regard to the jurisdictional basis that A\u2019s conditions or circumstances are endangered due to the Douglas County <em>cases </em>\u2014 i.e., paragraph \u201cg\u201d and paragraph \u201ch\u201d \u2014 DHS submitted minimal evidence, providing only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>those children were removed from wife\u2019s custody and care in 2009, due to the condition of her home, domestic violence, and drug use. Reportedly, at the time of the permanency hearing, the Douglas County cases were close to finalization. Wife planned to consent to placement of the children with a relative in Oregon in a permanent guardianship. A\u2019s DHS caseworker was investigating whether wife presented any safety concerns to A by contacting the Douglas County caseworkers, but she had not received adverse information to present to the court at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">At the close of the hearing, the juvenile court denied father\u2019s motion to dismiss jurisdiction and terminate the wardship, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cSo, the other Motion that I have pending is the Motion to Dismiss. And I\u2019m going to deny the Motion to Dismiss. * * * I do agree with the State\u2019s argument that several of the concerns identified in the Amended Petition have not yet been ameliorated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cOne is Letter (k), where it alleges that [father] does not have [a] Custody Order at this point in time. I indicated earlier that he could certainly file for Custody. I encourage him to do that. My understanding of the law * * * js * <em>* </em>* he can\u2019t yet get a Status Quo Order because the child has not been with him for three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m not aware that there would be a basis \u2014 at least, what I\u2019ve heard so far \u2014 for an Immediate Danger Custody Order [under ORS 107.097(3)(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>], because [A] \u2014 I mean, <em>there would be no evidence [that A] is in immediate danger. Mother is not a threat to this child. She\u2019s not up there doing anything bad to this child. </em>So, I don\u2019t think that [father] could go forward and get an Immediate Danger Custody Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201cSo, [Letter] (k) is still out there and needs to be resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cAnd I also agree with Letters.(g) and (h). On this record, <em>I don\u2019t have any evidence </em>that the condition of the home, or some issues with regard to [wife]\u2019s domestic violence * * * that those issues have been resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cThe argument that, \u2018Look, they must have been resolved because [G] was returned to their care,\u2019 I\u2019d be speculating if I went down that road. And I just can\u2019t do this on this record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to deny the Motion to Dismiss, finding specifically\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cAnd * * * I should indicate that Paragraphs (g), (h), and (k) of the Amended Petitions, I find * * * those matters have not yet been ameliorated to my satisfaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the court concluded that continued jurisdiction was warranted, based on paragraphs \u201cg,\u201d \u201ch,\u201d and \u201ck\u201d from the amended petition, set forth above, due to wife\u2019s open dependency cases relating to her older children in Oregon (the Douglas County cases) and father\u2019s lack of a custody order over A.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">On appeal, father asserts that the juvenile court erred in denying the motion to dismiss jurisdiction over A.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">ORS 419B.100(l)(c) grants a juvenile court jurisdiction over a child \u201c[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare\u201d of the child. A child determined to be within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction becomes a ward of the court. ORS 419B.328(1). \u201cA wardship cannot continue if the jurisdictional facts on which it is based have ceased to exist.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. D. M., </em>248 Or App 683, 685, 275 P3d 971 (2012). DHS also has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts on which jurisdiction is based \u201cpersist to the degree that they pose a current threat of serious loss or injury that is reasonably likely to be realized.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. M., </em>260 Or App 261, 267, 317 P3d 402 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Father contends that, although some of the facts on which jurisdiction was based persist, DHS did not prove that those facts would expose A to a current threat of serious loss or injury to A. Specifically, father asserts that DHS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>failed to present sufficient evidence that the facts presented in paragraphs \u201cg\u201d and <em>\u201ch\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., the Douglas County cases\u2014 would expose A to a threat of serious loss or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Although some of our cases have stood for the proposition that evidence sufficient to establish jurisdiction as to one child is a sufficient jurisdictional basis for other children in the same household, we must differentiate \u201camong the circumstances of each child.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Shugars, </em>202 Or App 302, 315, 121 P3d 702 (2005); <em>see State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Smith, </em>316 Or 646, 853 P2d 282 (1993) (upholding jurisdiction over son where the father sexually abused son\u2019s 12-year-old aunt, concluding that such abuse constituted \u201cconditions or circumstances * * * such as to endanger the child\u2019s welfare\u201d because the abuse created a harmful environment for the son); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Brammer, </em>133 Or App 544, 549, 892 P2d 720, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 268 (1995) (upholding jurisdiction over three children after the mother was convicted of repeatedly sexually abusing an unrelated child in the family home, concluding that jurisdiction was appropriate because the mother\u2019s abuse of the unrelated child created a harmful environment for her own children). The question becomes whether the abuse suffered by one child creates a harmful environment for the other child so that the juvenile court should exercise jurisdiction. <em>Brammer, </em>133 Or App at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Here, wife\u2019s children had been out of her care for a significant period of time, having been involved with DHS at least since 2009. However, the exact extent of any prior involvement by DHS in the Douglas County cases is not apparent from the record. The limited evidence presented by DHS demonstrates that wife had prior issues in Oregon relating to \u201cthe condition of her home, domestic violence, and * * * drug use.\u201d The juvenile court concluded that, on this record, it did not have \u201cany evidence\u201d of the condition of the home or that wife\u2019s domestic violence issues had been resolved. Notwithstanding that conclusion, no evidence was presented that the Douglas County cases remained open for any reason other than finalizing the guardianship. That is, there is also no evidence in the record from which the juvenile court could have inferred that the Douglas County cases contained some jurisdictional allegation that persisted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>would have created a harmful environment for A or otherwise present a danger to A. Although it is true that safety concerns <em>may </em>have existed, based on the continued existence of the Douglas County cases at the time of the permanency hearing, DHS was still in the process of investigating whether those concerns existed and failed to present any evidence that such safety concerns persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Simply put, wife has previously engaged in conduct that led to DHS involvement in the Douglas County cases. The evidence submitted by DHS \u2014 that wife anticipated consenting to a permanent guardianship, such that those children would not be returned to her care \u2014 may constitute a failure on wife\u2019s part to address and remedy any of the issues stemming from the Douglas County cases, which \u201cmay well fall short of what would be expected of [a] \u2018model parent [.]\u2019\u201d <em>Shugars, </em>202 Or App at 322. However, DHS did not present any evidence that wife\u2019s actions, or her failure to act, in the Douglas County cases \u201cpose a current threat of serious loss or injury\u201d to A \u201cthat is reasonably likely to be realized.\u201d <em>J. M., </em>260 Or App at 267. Thus, we conclude that, although the Douglas County cases remained open, DHS presented insufficient evidence from which the juvenile court could have concluded that the jurisdictional bases for A, that were premised on the Douglas County cases \u2014 paragraph \u201cg\u201d and paragraph \u201ch\u201d \u2014 persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We turn to examine the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that A\u2019s conditions or circumstances continued to be endangered due to father\u2019s lack of sole legal custody, such that he \u201cwould be unable to protect her from [mother]\u2019s drug use and <em>neglect\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., paragraph \u201ck\u201d from the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At the hearing, the parties engaged in a lengthy colloquy regarding the status of father\u2019s custody at the hearing. Father filed for sole legal custody of A on the day of the review hearing. At the hearing, in response to the court\u2019s inquiry regarding how father would protect A if mother travelled to Washington and requested A over father\u2019s objection, father\u2019s attorney represented to the court her intent to file an <em>ex parte </em>motion and order on father\u2019s behalf so that father would be granted immediate custody of A. After a prolonged discussion, the court intimated that such orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>were only for use when there was an \u201cimmediate danger\u201d and, were one requested by father, the court would not grant such an order in this case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\u201cI issue those <em>[ex parte] </em>Orders when I\u2019m convinced the Child is in imminent, immediate danger, which would be * * * exposing [the child] to drugs, domestic violence. Just the fact that [father] needs a Custody Order wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The state then argued that, based on the court\u2019s representations, allegation \u201ck\u201d \u2014 father\u2019s lack of a custody order \u2014 had not been ameliorated. The juvenile court ultimately agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Father relies on <em>State v. A. L. M., </em>232 Or App 13, 16, 220 P3d 449 (2009), for the proposition that, without some evidence that mother is a present danger to A\u2019s welfare, his lack of a custody order alone is an insufficient basis for continued juvenile court jurisdiction. The state contends that, on the facts, <em>A. L. M. </em>is distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In A. <em>L. M., </em>the child had been removed from the parents\u2019 custody due to the mother\u2019s neglect, the father\u2019s substance abuse, and the father\u2019s inability to protect the child due to lack of a custody order. After a permanency hearing, the juvenile court vacated the child\u2019s commitment to DHS, but continued the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over the child. After completing a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we reversed the juvenile court and remanded the case with instructions to terminate the wardship. We concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201c[biased on all the evidence *** presented in this case, the only allegation of the amended petition that appears to still be present is [the] father\u2019s lack of a custody order with respect to [the child]. However, without some evidence that [the] mother is a present danger to [the child]\u2019s welfare, the lack of a custody order alone is not sufficient for jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 419B.100.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">A. <em>L. M., </em>232 Or App at 16. We explained that what was necessary to sustain jurisdiction was some evidence that, at the time of the hearing, the child\u2019s welfare was endangered by his or her present circumstances, or, alternatively, some evidence that the mother\u2019s existing circumstances presented a threat of harm to the child\u2019s welfare. <em>Id. </em>The child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>had been placed with the father for more than six months when the review hearing occurred. The child was doing well, there were no safety concerns, DHS had no further services to offer, and the child\u2019s commitment to DHS was vacated at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 23 (Sercombe, J., dissenting). The dissent noted that, at the time of the review hearing, the mother was not operating under a case plan for reunification with this child, and the mother\u2019s parental rights to two other children were being terminated. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. The dissent asserted that, because the mother presented no evidence that any facts about her situation had changed, continued jurisdiction was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>The majority rejected that notion, and instead focused on whether any evidence had been presented regarding the mother\u2019s present circumstances and whether those circumstances presented a danger to the child, such that the father\u2019s lack of a custody order presented a danger to the child sufficient to support continued jurisdiction. We concluded that it did not. <em>A. L. M., </em>232 Or App at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Although <em>A. L. M. </em>\u201cdoes not dictate that in all circumstances the lack of a custody order alone is insufficient to support jurisdiction [,] *** jurisdiction [i]s no longer proper once\u201d the facts that are the bases for jurisdiction have been addressed and rectified. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. N., </em>253 Or App 494, 503 n 5, 291 P3d 765 (2012) (discussing A. <em>L. M., </em>232 Or App at 17-18). When \u201cthere was no evidence that the lack of a custody order would expose the child to a reasonable likelihood of harm[,] *** continued jurisdiction was improper.\u201d <em>J. N., </em>253 Or App at 503 n 5. Stated another way, without evidence that one parent is unable to protect the child from the other parent, or that the child will suffer some risk of actual harm because one parent lacks sole legal custody, lack of a custody order alone is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. R. L. F., </em>260 Or App 166, 172, 316 P3d 424 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In this case, DHS presented no evidence that mother\u2019s circumstances, as they existed at the time of the permanency hearing, posed a danger to A, such that father\u2019s lack of a custody order presented a reasonable likelihood of danger to A. The juvenile court considered whether A would suffer some risk of actual, immediate harm due to father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>lack of sole legal custody.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> DHS presented no evidence that mother would engage in behaviors from which father would need to protect A; the hypothetical situation put forth by the court was not supported by any evidence in the record and was pure conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Because DHS failed to establish a current risk of serious loss or injury to A for each of the bases on which the juvenile court concluded continued jurisdiction was warranted, we conclude that the record is legally insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s continued jurisdiction. Thus, the juvenile court erred in denying father\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to terminate the wardship.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> In light of our holding that the record is legally insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s continued jurisdiction, we do not reach father\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> Mother is not a party to this appeal. Father subsequently remarried, and we refer to his current wife as \u201cwife\u201d throughout our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> As relevant here, ORS 419B.100 provides for dependency jurisdiction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u201c(1) *** [T]he juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\"><em># </em>$ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">\u201c(c) Whose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> Although WDSHS had issued father two previous summary denials, we note that this may have been a futile effort on the part of DHS, because the Washington Court of Appeals has ruled that the ICPC does not apply to parental placements. <em>In re Dependency of D. F.-M., </em>157 Wash App 179, 236 P3d 961 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>170 Wash 2d 1026 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> ORS 107.097(3)(a) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201c[a] court may enter ex parte a temporary order providing for the custody of, or parenting time with, a child if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201c(A) The party requesting an order *** presents an affidavit <em>alleging that the child is in immediate </em>danger; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">\u201c(B) The court finds, based on the facts presented * * * that the child is in immediate danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> Although the statutory standards under ORS 419B.100(l)(c) (\u201cendangered\u201d) and ORS 107.097(3)(a)(A) and (B) (\u201cimmediate danger\u201d) are not identical, for purposes of this opinion, we conclude that the former standard has a broad scope, as defined by our case <em>law </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cwhether the child is exposed to conditions or circumstances that present a current threat of serious loss or injury\u201d \u2014 which encompasses the latter. <em>See R.
