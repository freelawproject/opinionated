The jury convicted defendant on misdemeanor charges of second-degree disorderly conduct, ORS 166.025, and resisting arrest, ORS 162.315. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on her defense of self-defense and that she was prejudiced by the erroneous instruction. Because we agree that the instruction was erroneous and could have confused the jury on an issue crucial to the defense, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. On September 30, 2010, defendant attended a hearing in her son\u2019s criminal case. Near the conclusion of the hearing, defendant caused a disturbance from the gallery. The judge instructed defendant not to leave the courtroom. Defendant rose from her seat and began moving toward the door. A deputy sheriff present in the courtroom directed defendant to obey the judge\u2019s instruction, but defendant continued toward the door. The deputy then grabbed defendant by the wrist and, with the assistance of another deputy, forced defendant into a sitting position on a bench. The officers then pinned defendant\u2019s upper body to the bench. While still restrained, defendant tried to stand up. Two deputies then brought defendant to the ground. She suffered abrasions on her forehead, brow, and cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Defendant was charged with one count each of disorderly conduct in the second degree, resisting arrest, and contempt of court. The disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges were tried to a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, defendant argued that she had acted in self-defense. Following a conference with the parties on jury instructions and after closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">\u201cI instruct you that a peace officer is justified in using physical force on a person being arrested when and to the extent the officer reasonably believes it necessary to take the person into custody unless the officer knows the arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>is unlawful. The defense of self-defense has been raised and I instruct you that a person is justified in using physical force on a peace officer to defend herself from what she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of excessive, unlawful physical force. In defending, a person may use only that degree of force which she reasonably believes necessary under the circumstances. With regard to self-defense, the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Defendant timely objected to that instruction. Citing <em>State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 218 P3d 1281 (2009), defendant argued that the instruction was erroneous and prejudicial to the extent that it directed the jury to consider the peace officers\u2019 state of mind in evaluating defendant\u2019s argument that she acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The jury found defendant guilty on both the disorderly conduct and the resisting arrest charges. Defendant was sentenced to 18 months of bench probation on the disorderly conduct charge and ordered to pay a $412 fine on the resisting arrest charge. The sentence for the contempt charge was discharged by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the issue of self-defense was erroneous and prejudiced defendant. We review jury instructions for errors of law. <em>State v. Frey, </em>248 Or App 1, 3, 273 P3d 143 (2012). An erroneous jury instruction constitutes reversible error if, taken as a whole, the jury instructions \u201cprobably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jur[ors]\u201d and affected the outcome of the case. <em>State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 210, 82 P3d 130 (2003); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 266, 971 P2d 879 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">A person\u2019s right to use force in self-defense is governed by ORS 161.209, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">\u201c[A] person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self-defense * * * from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Accordingly, in evaluating a defense of self-defense, a jury must weigh the defendant\u2019s state of mind in two respects: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>(1) whether the defendant reasonably believed that the victim used or threatened to use unlawful physical force against the defendant; and (2) whether the defendant used a degree of force in self-defense that the defendant reasonably believed was necessary. <em>State v. Bassett, </em>234 Or App 259, 264, 228 P3d 590, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 461 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In <em>Oliphant, </em>the Supreme Court made explicit what is implicit in the statute: The paramount issue when self-defense is raised is the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>state of mind. 347 Or at 194. In that case, the defendant was charged with, among other things, resisting arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 178. The defendant argued that he had acted in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 182. The trial court included a jury instruction that \u201c[a] peace officer may use physical force on a person being arrested only when, and to the extent that the officer reasonably believes it necessary to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187 (emphasis omitted). The Supreme Court rejected that instruction under the \u201cplain wording\u201d of ORS 161.209, which \u201cestablishes that, in general, a person\u2019s right to use force in self-defense depends on the person\u2019s <em>own </em>reasonable belief in the necessity for such action, and not on whether the force used or about to be used on him actually was unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191 (emphasis in original). The court held that the trial court had \u201cinserted an irrelevant issue \u2014 the arresting officers\u2019 actual state of mind \u2014 into the jury\u2019s deliberations concerning [the defendant\u2019s] claim of self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The trial court here used the same jury instruction regarding the officers\u2019 state of mind that was rejected in <em>Oliphant. </em>Defendant contends that this was reversible error because, under <em>Oliphant, </em>the state of mind of an arresting officer is not relevant to a self-defense analysis and risks confusing the jury, which instead must evaluate the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief as to the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The state concedes that the jury instructions were flawed in light of <em>Oliphant </em>but argues that the material about the peace officers\u2019 state of mind was merely \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \u201cirrelevant\u201d and did not render the jury instructions, as a whole, erroneous or prejudicial. The state contrasts the inclusion of the single-sentence instruction here with the set of instructions that the Supreme Court considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>Oliphant, </em>which contained a far longer discussion of when officers may use force, including deadly force. The state suggests that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Oliphant </em>was rooted in a concern that the far more extensive instructions in that case may have shifted the jury\u2019s focus to the officers\u2019 state of mind rather than the defendant\u2019s \u2014 a concern that is not present here because the instruction as to the officers\u2019 state of mind was a smaller part of the whole. Moreover, the state suggests that <em>some </em>instruction as to a peace officer\u2019s state of mind is not unwarranted, even after <em>Oliphant. </em>The reason for this, the state argues, is that the defense of self-defense requires an inquiry into whether the defendant reasonably believed that actual or threatened use of force against him was \u201cunlawful\u201d \u2014 and such force is not \u201cunlawful\u201d if the arresting officer \u201creasonably\u201d believes that it is \u201cnecessary.\u201d ORS 161.235.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">To the extent that the state argues that the inclusion of the jury instruction about the officers\u2019 state of mind was anything less than clear error under <em>Oliphant, </em>the Supreme Court has disposed of that argument. In <em>State v. Vanornum, </em>354 Or 614, 630, 317 P3d 889 (2013), the state asserted, as it does here, that <em>Oliphant </em>was distinguishable because it had involved several additional instructions concerning officers\u2019 use of force. The Supreme Court rejected that view, explaining that \u201c[t]he other instructions given in <em>Oliphant </em>* * * played no part in our assessment\u201d of the challenged instruction. <em>Id. </em>(concluding that \u201cthe fact that the instruction is an incorrect statement of the law, and thus was error to give under our decision in <em>Oliphant, </em>is beyond reasonable dispute\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Given that the inclusion of the instruction about the officers\u2019 state of mind in this case was clearly erroneous under <em>Oliphant </em>and <em>Vanornum, </em>we must also address whether defendant was prejudiced. <em>See Vanornum, </em>354 Or at 630 (noting that \u201cthe content of other instructions given or not given may bear on whether\u201d the inclusion of the flawed instruction was prejudicial). Although it is true that the jury instructions in this case included less material about an officer\u2019s state of mind than was the case in <em>Oliphant, </em>we believe that the concerns that led to the decision in <em>Oliphant </em>are no less present here. An instruction to the jury about an officer\u2019s reasonable belief as to the use of force in making an arrest necessarily detracts from the jury\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s belief as to that same use of force. The risk of jury con fusion is substantial; a jury that believes that an officer acted reasonably may feel obliged to conclude that a defendant did not act reasonably in self-defense. But, as explained in <em>Oliphant, </em>it is the defendant\u2019s state of mind that is \u201cparamount.\u201d 347 Or at 194 (the defendant has \u201ca right to have the jury consider the circumstances surrounding the event from his own point of view\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the jury instructions were erroneous and prejudicial to the extent that they called for the jury to consider the state of mind of the arresting officers.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> The charge of contempt was tried to the court, which found defendant guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\"> The state alludes to an apparent quandary that results if an officer\u2019s state of mind is wholly excluded from jury instructions in a self-defense case. The problem, the state argues, is that a self-defense analysis calls for the jury to consider whether a defendant reasonably believed that the actual or threatened use of force against him was \u201cunlawful,\u201d ORS 161.209 \u2014 and the lawfulness of an officer\u2019s use of force depends, in part, on the officer\u2019s reasonable belief as to its necessity. ORS 161.235. Therefore, to exclude from the jury instructions any reference to the officer\u2019s state of mind is, arguably, to exclude an issue that the jury needs to consider in evaluating whether the defendant\u2019s own belief was reasonable. We disagree; it is possible to accurately instruct the jury without expressly referring to the peace officer\u2019s state of mind. That is demonstrated by the following statement in <em>Oliphant: </em>\u201cIf [defendant] believed, and a reasonable person in his position would have believed, that the use or imminent use of force against him <em>exceeded the force reasonably necessary to effect the arrest, </em>then he was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>defend himself from that use of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194 (emphasis added). The italicized text captures the \u201cunlawful\u201d element relevant to a self-defense analysis without taking the additional step of inquiring into an arresting officer\u2019s actual state of mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> We note that the judgment includes a conviction of contempt; however, defendant does not challenge that conviction on appeal. <em>See State v. Caldwell, </em>247 Or App 372, 375 n 1, 270 P3d 341 (2011) (\u201cA conviction for contempt is not a proper disposition.\u201d); <em>State v. Campbell, </em>246 Or App 683, 267 P3d 205 (2011) (accepting state\u2019s concession that contempt is not a crime and that the court erred in entering a conviction for contempt); <em>see also State v. Gostevskyh, </em>256 Or App 472, 300 P3d 306 (2013) (accepting the state\u2019s concession that the trial court plainly erred in entering a finding of contempt as a misdemeanor conviction and exercising our discretion to correct the error). On remand, the trial court should correct that mischaracterization. <em>See Pavlovets/State v. Karimzadeh, </em>254 Or App 342, 292 P3d 665 (2012) (failing to reach contention that trial court plainly erred in entering conviction for contempt because \u201cthe trial court will be able to easily correct the judgment on remand so that it does not refer in any way to defendant being \u2018convicted\u2019\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
