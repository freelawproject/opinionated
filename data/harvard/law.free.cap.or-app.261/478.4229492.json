J.</author>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">This case involves a dispute regarding the proper administration and disposition of the assets of plaintiffs mother\u2019s trust. Plaintiff brought an action for an accounting of his mother\u2019s trust, contending that the successor trustees failed to carry out the terms of the trust after her death. After a trial at which the parties disputed the effect of certain provisions in the trust instrument, the trial court modified the dispositive terms of the trust pursuant to ORS 130.205(1) and ORS 130.225. In its ruling, the court concluded that, as written, the trust instrument was consistent with plaintiffs proffered interpretation of the document. Nevertheless, the court modified the terms of the trust to meet, as determined by the court, the mother\u2019s probable intent. The court\u2019s modification of the trust\u2019s terms validated the prior actions of the successor trustees in administering and distributing the trust assets; thus, the court dismissed plaintiffs claims. On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the court erroneously modified the trust\u2019s dispositive terms. We conclude that the court acted without authority to modify the trust\u2019s terms under either cited statute, because neither party requested such relief or advanced the legal theory that the trust should be modified, and \u201c [i] n neither law nor equity does a court\u2019s authority extend to the fashioning of remedies based on legal theories not advanced by the parties.\u201d <em>C. A. M. Concepts, Inc. v. Gwyn, </em>206 Or App 122, 129, 136 P3d 60 (2006). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We begin with some general background and the relevant text of the trust instrument. In 1992, Cecilia and Robert Head established separate, but essentially identical, revocable living trusts. Cecilia and Robert had three children: plaintiff, George, and Roderick. The Cecilia F. Head Revocable Trust of 1992 (the Cecilia Head Trust) named Cecilia as trustee and life beneficiary, and funded the trust with a number of assets, including interests in real property, stocks, bonds, and cash. The trust instrument named Robert as successor trustee upon Cecilia\u2019s death or incapacity. Two sections of the trust instrument are central to plaintiffs claims and the parties\u2019 dispute at trial. First, Section 8 set forth the powers of the trustee. Second, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>10 designated the distribution of the trust assets to be made upon Cecilia\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The latter section provides, as relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201cOn my death, the following payment shall be made from the trust estate as then constituted:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u201cI. [Directing trustee to pay taxes and assessments].</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u201cII. [Directing trustee to pay taxes related to settlor\u2019s death].</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u201cHI. [Directing trustee to pay funeral and trust administration expenses].</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u201cIV. The balance of the trust estate remaining after the payments mentioned above in this section, as such balance may be augmented by any distribution from my probate estate, shall constitute the residuary trust estate. The residuary trust estate shall be held in trust for the following persons and purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">\u201cA. If my Husband survives me, the residuary trust estate shall be divided into two trusts, hereinafter referred to as Trust \u2018A\u2019 and Trust \u2018B\u2019 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\u201c1. Trust \u2018A\u2019 shall consist of the maximum pecuniary amount, if any, which can pass free of federal estate tax in my trust estate by reason of the federal unified credit and state death tax credit (provided that the use of the credit does not require an increase in the state death tax paid), but no other credits allowed for federal estate tax purposes. In determining that pecuniary amount, the trustee shall take into account all deductions (other than the marital deduction) allowable in my trust estate for federal estate tax purposes, and shall further take into account the net value of all other property included in my gross estate which passes or has passed to any other person, trust or entity in which it does not qualify for the federal estate tax marital and charitable deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">\u201cMy trustee shall determine which assets or interests in my residuary trust estate shall be distributed in satisfaction of this bequest, and the trustee may include therein all or any part of, or an undivided interest in, any particular asset or interest, other than those specifically disposed of [by] the provisions in this trust or otherwise, with assets so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>used to be valued at their fair market value at the date or dates of allocation and distribution to Trust \u2018A\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Trust \u2018B\u2019 shall consist of the remaining portion of my residuary trust estate. This trust shall be distributed to my Husband forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u201cB. The trustee shall pay to or apply for the benefit of my Husband, during his lifetime, quarter-annually, or at more frequent intervals, the entire net income of Trust A.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u201cC. If the trustee deems such income payments to be insufficient, the trustee shall, from time to time, pay to or apply for the benefit of my Husband such sums out of the principal of Trust A as the trustee, in the trustee\u2019s discretion, deems necessary to provide for his reasonable support, health, maintenance, and education.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u201cD. On the death of my husband, or on my death if he does not survive me for a period of thirty (30) days, the Trustee shall distribute all of Trust A\u2019 and Trust \u2018B\u2019, and any residue of any trust estate to the following persons: To my children, hereinafter named, equally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Section 10 of Robert\u2019s trust, the Robert C. Head Trust of 1992 (the Robert Head Trust), initially contained essentially identical text.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Cecilia died in 2004, and Robert became successor trustee of her trust. The parties do not dispute that, at the time Cecilia died, the federal unified credit amount was $1,500,000, and the value of the assets in Cecilia\u2019s trust was less than $1,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The specific details of Robert\u2019s acts as trustee of Cecilia\u2019s trust are not important to the issues on appeal, so we provide only those details that provide necessary context. Suffice it to say that Robert generally treated the trust assets as his own. Of particular note, he transferred trust assets from the Cecilia Head Trust into the Robert Head Trust in 2007. A few weeks later, acting as successor trustee, he purported to terminate the Cecilia Head Trust, stating that it no longer owned any interest in any real or personal property. Two months later, Robert changed the terms of the Robert Head Trust to eliminate any distribution of the trust\u2019s assets to plaintiff upon Robert\u2019s death. Robert died in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>February 2010, and George was named successor trustee of both the Robert Head Trust and the Cecilia Head Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Plaintiff initiated this action against George as successor trustee of the trusts, and also named George and his wife Peggy as defendants in their individual capacity. Plaintiff sought an accounting of the trusts, arguing that Robert, as trustee of the Cecilia Head Trust, had failed to comply with Section 10 of the trust instrument. Plaintiff alleged that, upon Cecilia\u2019s death, the unambiguous terms of the trust instrument required the trustee to transfer all assets in the Cecilia Head Trust into \u201cTrust A\u201d because Section 10 of the trust instrument dictated that Trust A was to \u201cconsist of the maximum pecuniary amount *** which can pass free of federal estate tax in my trust estate by reason of the federal unified credit\u201d and, at the time of her death, the trust estate consisted of assets that were less than the \u201cmaximum pecuniary amount\u201d that could have passed free of the federal unified credit. Therefore, according to plaintiff, Trust A should have been funded with all of the assets of the Cecilia Head Trust and Robert, pursuant to Section 10(IV)(B) and (C), was only entitled to the income of Trust A and, if needed, discretionary supplemental disbursements from the principal of Trust A for his reasonable support, health, maintenance, and education. Under plaintiffs proffered interpretation of the trust instrument, he would have been entitled to a distribution of an equal share of the remaining assets of Trust A upon Robert\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In defendants\u2019 answer, they admitted that Robert had a duty to place all of the assets of the Cecilia Head Trust into Trust A upon Cecilia\u2019s death, but denied that the trust instrument required Robert, as trustee, to maintain Trust A for the named beneficiaries. Instead, defendants raised an affirmative defense of \u201creliance on trust instrument, ORS 130.825,\u201d contending that Robert had relied on the powers granted to him in Section 8 of the trust instrument which, according to him, granted him complete discretion to distribute assets out of the trust. Further, defendants raised a \u201cgenuine power of appointment\u201d affirmative defense, contending that Robert\u2019s distribution of the trust assets was authorized under such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>At trial, plaintiff presented a straightforward case, relying mostly on the terms of the trust instrument to advance his argument that, upon Cecilia\u2019s death, Trust A should have been funded with the entirety of the assets of the Cecilia Head Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Defendants took the position at trial that the trust instrument created, by its explicit terms, a \u201cdiscretionary trust,\u201d which authorized a trustee to \u201cmake, -at any time, any distribution of assets out of trust to any beneficiary.\u201d Defendants maintained, therefore, that Robert\u2019s actions as trustee were within the scope of his powers. Defendants also argued that the trusts were drafted \u201cso that, upon the first of the two of them to pass away, the survivor would have maximum use of all remaining assets for their personal use for the remainder of their lives.\u201d They asserted that, among other things, the trust was created for estate-tax-avoidance purposes, and if there was no need for the tax avoidance provisions, then the trust was a \u201cdiscretionary trust\u201d of which the trustee had complete discretion to use the trust\u2019s assets as he saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Members of the Head family testified at trial as to circumstances surrounding the creation of the trusts, the deterioration in the relationship between plaintiff and Robert, and how Robert used some of the assets of the Cecilia Head Trust. Defendants also called John Babin, the attorney who drafted the trust instruments for Cecilia and Robert in 1992, to testify about his role in drafting the trust instruments, and his understanding of Cecilia\u2019s and Robert\u2019s intent in creating the trusts. Over plaintiffs objection, Babin testified that, in 1992, the Heads had total assets of approximately $2 million and the \u201cfederal tax exemption\u201d was $1 million per person. He testified that the Heads\u2019 concerns in creating the trusts were \u201c[c]onveying the property to the descendents as they wished, number one; number two, avoiding or reducing federal estate taxes; and number three, retaining as much control over property that had to be put in some sort of trust to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">At the close of trial, the trial court indicated that the case was \u201creally * * * about the language of the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>themselves.\u201d Subsequently, the court issued a letter opinion which explained, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s trial memorandum is extremely well written and well researched. The legal analysis and conclusion is unassailable. Under the law, it appears clear that the remedies he is requesting should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u201cHowever, the bothersome question is how would that result be equitable?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u201cIt is not uncommon for lay people to ignore the structure and existence of trusts and to continue to treat the assets as their \u2018own\u2019 after they have conveyed to a trust. Both parties agree that [Robert] did act as if he was the owner of the property in [Cecilia\u2019s] trust to do with as he chose. His actions though were guided by legal advice throughout; two different attorneys assisted him and in essence treated the trust as if it were discretionary or precatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u201cThe attorneys, and [Robert], were interpreting the trust in accordance with [Cecilia\u2019s] intent in creating the trust. The purpose of Trust \u2018A\u2019 was not to provide for ultimate distribution to the sons. The trust language clearly demonstrated an intent that [Robert] should inherit all of [Cecilia\u2019s] assets except to the extent necessary to preserve her tax exemption. Trust \u2018B,\u2019 which was to consist of all assets \u2018not needed\u2019 for the tax exemption, was to be immediately distributed to [Robert]. [Cecilia\u2019s] will further provided that at the time of her death, if her trust should fail or if for any reason was inoperative or invalid, the residue of her estate was to go to [Robert],</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u201cThere are two provisions of the Uniform Trust Code, as adopted by the Oregon legislature, which provide support for finding in favor of defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u201cORS 130.205(1) appears to allow \u2018equitable deviation.\u2019 A court can modify both administrative and dispositive trust terms, or terminate the trust, because of circumstances not anticipated by the trustor if the modification or termination will further the trustor\u2019s broader purposes and if in accord with the trustor\u2019s probable intention. In this case, trustor\u2019s intention was clear and the fact that there would ultimately be no tax liability to either estate was a circumstance not anticipated at the time the trusts were drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201cORS 130.225 specifically allows a court to modify a trust to accomplish the trustor\u2019s tax objectives if the modification is not contrary to the trustor\u2019s probable intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u201cThe attorney who prepared both the trusts and the wills for [Cecilia and Robert] testified at trial. He stated that they had estate tax concerns when they first consulted with him; their marital assets were in excess of $2 million at the time. He recommended to them that they divide all of their property equally and establish trusts so as to shelter the maximum possible from tax liability. The attorney testified that he drafted the living trust so that if there was no tax liability at the time of the first death, there was no need for Trust \u2018A.\u2019 He stated that was what the parties wished and that is what he believed he had accomplished with the trust instrument. The trust language the attorney prepared was to have given discretion to the trustee to transfer the maximum amount if necessary into Trust A.\u2019 He testified he accordingly so advised [Robert] after [Cecilia\u2019s] death.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201cThe second attorney *** assisted [Robert] in transferring properties from [Cecilia\u2019s] trust to his trust. This attorney\u2019s interpretation of Trust A\u2019 was that the principal could be used to benefit [Robert] in addition to it being a completely discretionary trust. They were \u2018[Robert\u2019s] assets to do with as he wished.\u2019 The attorney also assisted [Robert] in the attempted termination of [Cecilia\u2019s] trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u201c[Cecilia\u2019s] Trust A\u2019 was a traditional, \u2018automatic bypass\u2019 trust to allow full use of her tax exemption and to avoid any balance remaining in the trust at the time of her death to be included in the surviving spouse\u2019s estate for tax purposes. In other words, the only purpose for Trust A\u2019 was to take advantage of the available tax exemption and to shelter assets. There was no need for Trust A\u2019 as the total estate of [Cecilia\u2019s] was considerably less than the maximum amount of the federal and state exemptions. Under [Cecilia\u2019s] will, if there was no trust, all of her property was to be distributed to [Robert]. Under the terms of [Cecilia\u2019s] living trust, all of her property was to be distributed to [Robert] except that which needed to be sheltered in Trust A\u2019 for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u201cIt is reasonable and equitable, and in accord with ORS 130.205(1) and 130.225, for the court to modify the revocable trust by finding that Trust A\u2019 did not need to be created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>or funded. Therefore, at [Cecilia\u2019s] death all of her assets were to be distributed outright to [Robert].</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u201cAccordingly, plaintiff\u2019s claims are denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The court entered, a general judgment against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the trial court\u2019s modification of the terms of the Cecilia Head Trust pursuant to ORS 130.205(1) or ORS 130.225, and to the court\u2019s admission of extrinsic evidence as to Cecilia\u2019s intent when establishing the trust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We begin with plaintiffs challenge to the court\u2019s actions taken pursuant to ORS 130.205(1). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cThe court may modify the administrative or dispositive terms of a trust or terminate the trust if modification or termination will further the purposes of the trust and the modification or termination is requested by reason of circumstances not anticipated by the settlor. To the extent practicable, the modification must be made in accordance with the settlor\u2019s probable intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Plaintiff contends that, under the plain text of the statute, a court can modify a trust only if the modification \u201cis requested.\u201d He asserts that neither party requested modification of the Cecilia Head Trust. Plaintiff explains that defendants acknowledged that the trust assets should have been placed in Trust A, and argued instead that the trust was a discretionary trust that allowed Robert unfettered access to the trust assets. Plaintiff points both to defendants\u2019 answer and their argument at trial that the text of the trust instrument unambiguously created a discretionary trust that authorized Robert\u2019s actions. Plaintiff complains that he had no notice that a possible modification of the Cecilia Head Trust was at issue and, as a result, he had no opportunity to defend the issue. In sum, plaintiff maintains that the parties asked the court only to interpret the text of the trust instrument, but the court decided the case on grounds that the parties did not raise, and granted relief that was never requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Defendants counter that although they did not request the specific relief granted by the <em>court </em>\u2014 i.e., modification of the trust terms \u2014 they did request the ultimate relief granted by the court \u2014 \u201cto allow the distributions from the Robert and Cecilia Head Trusts to stand\u201d and \u201cdismissal of plaintiffs claims and judgment in favor of defendant.\u201d Alternatively, defendants argue that ORS 130.205(1) authorizes the court to modify the terms of a trust when such relief is not requested. Defendants assert that plaintiffs reliance on \u201cis requested\u201d in ORS 130.205(1) is misplaced because the statutory text is ambiguous as to whether it requires that modification be requested before a court may grant relief on those grounds. Defendants maintain that \u201cis requested\u201d is written in passive voice and \u201cis not attached to any subject or object in the sentence.\u201d Accordingly, defendants assert that the legislature\u2019s use of \u201cis requested\u201d does not clearly indicate that a party must request modification in order for a court to do so. At oral argument, defendants posited that \u201cis requested\u201d created a \u201cpassive presumption\u201d that relief is requested by a party \u2014 but not necessarily that modification was requested as relief. Defendants point to the general purposes behind the legislature\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Trust Code \u2014 that it was intended to give courts more tools to modify the terms of trusts to preserve a settlor\u2019s intent. Defendant also notes that nothing in the comments to ORS 130.205 suggest that a party must request modification for the court to impose such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Plaintiff also challenges the court\u2019s authority to modify the trust under ORS 130.225 when neither party has asked for that relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although plaintiff acknowledges that the text of ORS 130.225 does not explicitly require that such relief be \u201crequested,\u201d he argues that, because relief under ORS 130.225 was not requested, he never had notice that a modification based on that statute was at issue, \u201cso he had no opportunity to present evidence or legal arguments regarding that issue.\u201d He also argues, as to the substance of the court\u2019s modification under ORS 130.225, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>court did not modify Cecilia\u2019s trust \u201cto achieve [Cecilia\u2019s] tax objectives\u201d because her tax objective was to avoid paying as much estate tax as possible, and the trial court\u2019s modification of the trust either had no effect on that objective or could have negatively affected her tax objectives by placing some of her assets at risk of tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We agree with plaintiff that the court erred by modifying the terms of Cecilia\u2019s trust under ORS 130.205(1) or ORS 130.225. The court lacked authority to grant relief under either statute when such relief was not reasonably contemplated by the parties and represented a substantial departure from the pleadings and the legal theories upon which they relied. As a general rule, a court in equity has broad discretion in crafting relief, and the parties in equity are not necessarily limited to the relief that they seek in their complaint. <em>Port of Morrow v. Aylett, </em>186 Or App 70, 76, 62 P3d 427 (2003). Yet, there are some limitations on the scope of relief that a court may order. <em>Id. </em>Chief among them is the principle that \u201c[t]he broad power of a court of equity should not be invoked to shape a decree which was not reasonably contemplated by the parties and which * * * represents a substantial departure from the pleadings and the legal theories relied upon by the parties.\u201d <em>Shumate v. Robinson, </em>52 Or App 199, 205, 627 P2d 1295 (1981). Put more succinctly, \u201c[i]n neither law nor equity does a court\u2019s authority extend to the fashioning of remedies based on legal theories not advanced by the parties.\u201d <em>C. A. M. Concepts, Inc., </em>206 Or at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The trial court violated that principle in this case. We readily conclude that the pleadings and legal theories advanced by the parties did not request modification of the trust\u2019s terms. Neither party has directed us to anywhere in the record where relief under ORS 130.205(1) or ORS 130.225 was requested or contemplated. Instead, the record reflects that the pleadings, as well as the arguments and evidence at trial, focused on the proper interpretation of the trust instrument, not on whether the terms of the trust instrument should be modified. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting relief that was not reasonably contemplated by the parties and substantially departed from the pleadings and legal theories relied upon by the parties. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>C.
