On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred in denying her motion to suppress that evidence because the jail\u2019s inventory policy, which gives officers unbridled discretion to open closed containers, is unconstitutional. <em>See State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 10, 688 P2d 832 (1984) (a constitutionally permissible inventory must be conducted \u201cpursuant to a properly authorized administrative program, designed and systemically administered so that the inventory involves no exercise of discretion by the law enforcement person directing or taking the inventory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Defendant\u2019s zippered pouch was opened pursuant to the \u201cDouglas County Sheriffs Office Jail Procedures\u201d for inventory of detainee property. The policy provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cPreliminary Intake \u2014 At initial intake, detainee will be relieved of all personal items (watches, jewelry, monies, wallets, etc.) whether on the physical person or in clothing. <em>All these items will be placed in a clear sealed bag *** and will remain with the booking deputy for purposes of examination and inventory (this includes closed containers for example: purses, fanny packs, wallets, canisters, boxes and such).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u00abH; Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201cPrior to placing the inmate\u2019s clothing into a garment bag, all of the inmate\u2019s clothing will be searched. * * * All money in the possession of the inmate will be counted by the booking deputy and placed into the inmate\u2019s trust account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">(Emphasis added.) The policy defines \u201cInventoried Property\u201d as \u201c [p]roperty physically examined and entered into the computer by a deputy[,]\u201d but the policy does not otherwise provide any guidance to officers with regard to the opening of closed containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The state acknowledges that the jail\u2019s inventory policy does not pass constitutional muster and offers the following concession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">\u201cBecause this policy does not describe in detail which kinds of closed containers may be opened to check for valuables or contraband \u2014 to distinguish them from those that are simply placed apart from the prisoner in the sealed bag- \u2014 the state agrees that the search was invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The concession is well taken. <em>See State v. Cordova, </em>250 Or App 397, 404, 280 P3d 1036 (2012) (explaining that \u201cwe have been scrupulously rigorous in our construction of the terms of inventory policies\u201d). The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and we therefore reverse the conviction in Case No. 11CR1916FE and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In Case No. 11CR1916FE, reversed and remanded. In Case No. 10CR1169FE, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> This consolidated appeal includes two cases, Case No. 11CR1916FE (possession charges) and Case No. 10CR1169FE (probation violation). Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress concerned evidence in Case No. 11CR1916FE; she does not challenge the judgment in Case No. 10CR1169FE.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
