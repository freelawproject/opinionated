Of the five assignments of error that defendant raises on appeal, we reject the fourth and fifth without discussion. Of the remaining three assignments of error, we write primarily to address the first, which is dispositive. In conjunction with that assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on his claim for false arrest and, alternatively, for a new trial on that claim. He makes a preserved argument and an unpreserved argument in support of that contention. Because defendant\u2019s preserved argument does not establish that any error by the trial court substantially affected defendant\u2019s rights \u2014 and because we decline to address the unpreserved argument \u2014 defendant has presented no basis for reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>335 Or 164, 174, 61 P3d 928 (2003) (\u201cIn every case, the appellate courts must adhere to the limitation of ORS 19.415(2) and reverse or modify a judgment only if it can be determined from the record that the error \u2018substantially affect[ed] the rights of a party.\u2019\u201d(Brackets in original.)). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, who prevailed below. <em>Jensen v. Medley, </em>336 Or 222, 226, 82 P3d 149 (2003). This case involves events that occurred at a convenience store, US Market 107, which is operated by US Market 107, Inc. Plaintiffs brother, Bains, and defendant\u2019s father, Ditta, each own 50 percent of US Market 107, Inc. Ditta signed a power of attorney that gave defendant authority to act as president of that company. Bains and defendant\u2019s brother, Din, own another store, US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Market 105, as equal partners. Plaintiff was employed as the person \u201cin charge\u201d of both stores: US Market 107 and US Market 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In 2007, litigation (distinct from this case) arose between the various owners of the two stores. Defendant, acting on Ditta\u2019s behalf, filed suit against Bains. Bains countersued. Din and Bains also litigated against each other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In January 2008, defendant sent plaintiff a letter terminating plaintiffs employment at US Market 107 and informing him that he was \u201cbarred from all US Market\u2019s property\u201d and that he would \u201cbe arrested for trespassing if [he] set foot on US Market Property [,]\u201d including US Market 107. Two days later, Din\u2019s attorney sent a letter to plaintiffs attorney requesting that plaintiff \u201cbe replaced immediately as manager of US Market #105 * * * \u201d The letter cited the store\u2019s decreased profitability as the reason for the requested termination. In that letter, Din\u2019s attorney also suggested turning management over to a third party or, alternatively, dissolving the partnership and shutting down the store. However, Bains, who owned half the stock in the corporation that operated US Market 107 and who was an equal partner with Din in the ownership of US Market 105, separately told plaintiff that he was free to continue working at both store locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Also in early 2008, McLaughlin, the attorney for US Market 107, Inc., hired Kuenzi, a private investigator, to look into US Market 107\u2019s decreased profitability. Kuenzi analyzed inventory and sales and determined that employee theft likely had caused the decreased profits, as overall sales had actually increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On June 26, 2008, Kuenzi was working at the offices of US Market Enterprises LLP<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and watching a live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>video feed from US Market 107, as recorded and broadcast by the store\u2019s security system. Kuenzi later testified that the video had shown plaintiff wheeling a handcart with approximately four full cases of beer out of the store and loading the beer into a vehicle. Kuenzi testified that she showed the video to other people, including attorney McLaughlin, and then concluded that she had probable cause to believe that plaintiff had committed theft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, she called the police. Law enforcement officers went to the store, Kuenzi completed a citizen\u2019s arrest form, and the officers took plaintiff into custody. Plaintiff was released later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Earlier in 2008, before plaintiffs arrest, US Market 107, Inc., Ditta, and defendant had moved for appointment of a custodian for US Market 107, apparently in conjunction with the then-ongoing litigation between the store owners. Bains had objected to the motion, and a hearing had occurred in May 2008. The day after plaintiffs arrest at US Market 107, McLaughlin sought an expedited order appointing a custodian for the store, citing concerns about inventory control and plaintiffs arrest for theft. McLaughlin later wrote to plaintiffs attorney, demanding plaintiffs resignation and opining that \u201c [n] o competent person would allow [plaintiff] near US Market #107 at any time.\u201d The court granted McLaughlin\u2019s motion in July 2008 and appointed a custodian for US Market 107, which effectively ended plaintiffs employment at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The district attorney eventually dismissed the charges that had been brought against plaintiff. Plaintiff then initiated this litigation, alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process. Plaintiff pursued those claims against defendant on a theory that defendant was liable for Kuenzi\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case went to trial before a jury. At trial, the parties presented a great deal of evidence about video recordings of the events that occurred at US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Market 107 on June 26, 2008. Kuenzi and others testified that they had watched the video feed on June 26 and that it showed plaintiff taking beer out of the store. When plaintiff played what he asserted was the same video at trial, however, it appeared to show a different man \u2014 not plaintiff-wheeling empty beer bottles out of the store. Kuenzi testified that plaintiffs video recording was not the same video that she had viewed on June 26, 2008. The defense suggested that plaintiff had somehow altered the video that he played at trial and that, as a result, it did not show what actually had happened on June 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Defendant moved for a directed verdict after the parties presented their evidence. The trial court denied that motion and submitted the case to the jury, which was instructed on the elements of each of plaintiffs tort claims. The court also instructed the jury that defendant could be held liable for Kuenzi\u2019s actions in either of two ways. First, the court explained that defendant could be liable for Kuenzi\u2019s actions if Kuenzi was defendant\u2019s agent and had acted within her actual or apparent authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cThe person who authorizes or appears to authorize an agent to act is called the principal. The principal may be liable for acts of an employee agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cA person or entity is an actual agent when a principal, through words or conduct, gives that person or entity the authority to act on the principal\u2019s behalf, subject to the principal\u2019s control, and that * * * person or entity agrees to act on the principal\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cActual authority exists when a principal, through words or conduct, directs an agent to act, and includes any other acts that are reasonably necessary to carry out the authorized act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cThe Plaintiffs claim that *** Kuenzi and [another involved individual] were [defendant\u2019s] agents and were acting with [in] the scope of their authority at the time involved in this case. [Defendant] denied *** Kuenzi or [the other individual] were acting within the scope of their actual authority at the time involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201cA principal is bound only by the acts of the agent [that] are within the scope of the agent\u2019s actual authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Second, the court instructed the jury about the circumstances in which a person can be liable for actions of an independent contractor that the person has hired. The jury could have determined, based on that instruction, that defendant would be liable for Kuenzi\u2019s actions if Kuenzi was an independent contractor and defendant actively participated in or ratified her actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">\u201cThe person or entity who hires an independent contractor is not liable for any economic, non-economic, or punitive damages caused by the actions of the independent contractor unless the person actively participated in the actions of the independent contractor or ratified the actions. But the independent contractor may be liable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff on all three of his claims against defendant, Kuenzi, and another named defendant, including the false-arrest claim that is the subject of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error. With respect to defendant, the verdict form did not require the jury to specify the basis on which it found him liable for false arrest. Rather, the verdict form simply asked the jury to declare whether defendant was \u201cat fault\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cWas [defendant] at fault for having plaintiff falsely arrested, or maliciously prosecuted, or subjected to an abuse of process?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201cFor False Arrest:__________________</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Yes or No</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u201cFor Malicious Prosecution:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Yes or No</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u201cFor subjecting plaintiff to an Abuse of Process:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Yes or No</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The verdict form instructed the jury that, if it answered any of those questions \u201cyes,\u201d it should determine whether defendant caused plaintiff any damages and, if so, how much. The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to each of the three questions, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>awarded plaintiff $75,000 in noneconomic damages, $1,800 in economic damages, and $90,000 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The trial court entered a general judgment in plaintiffs favor on May 4, 2011. Defendant filed a notice of appeal on June 3, 2011, within 30 days after entry of judgment, as ORS 19.255(1) generally requires.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Before he filed that notice of appeal, however, defendant moved for a JNOV under ORCP 63 and, alternatively, for a new trial under ORCP 64. In his JNOV motion, defendant argued that Kuenzi was an independent contractor and that defendant had not actively participated in or ratified her actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201c[T]he uncontroverted evidence was that Ms. Kuenzi was an independent contractor working for US Market # 107 on the day of Plaintiffs arrest. This is significant because the jury was instructed that a person who hires an independent contractor is not liable for any economic, non-economic, or punitive damages caused by the actions of the independent contractor unless the person participated in or ratified the actions of the independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201cHere Plaintiff presented no evidence that [defendant] participated in or ratified the actions of Ms. Kuenzi * * *. Defendants presented a great deal of evidence that [defendant] was out of the state at the time of the arrest and did not participate in or ratify the actions of * * * Ms. Kuenzi at any time after they took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Defendant filed the motions for JNOV and for a new trial on May 12, 2011. Although the trial court issued a letter opinion denying those motions on July 12, 2011, the motions already had been deemed denied, by operation of law, on June 29, 2011 \u2014 the day following 55 days after entry of judgment. ORCP 63 D(l); ORCP 64 F(l); <em>Propp v. Long, </em>313 Or 218, 225-26, 831 P2d 685 (1992) (explaining operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>those rules). Defendant filed an amended notice of appeal on August 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In this court, plaintiff first argues that defendant\u2019s appeal must be dismissed as untimely. Plaintiff acknowledges that defendant filed his initial notice of appeal within 30 days of the date on which the general judgment was entered. Nonetheless, plaintiff argues, that notice of appeal was ineffective because, by the time defendant filed it, defendant already had moved for a new trial. Accordingly, plaintiff contends, this court could have gained jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal only if defendant had filed <em>another </em>notice of appeal within 30 days after June 29, 2011, the day on which his motions for JNOV and new trial were deemed denied. Defendant did not do that \u2014 he did not file his amended notice of appeal until August 1, 2011. Accordingly, plaintiff concludes, this appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As plaintiff acknowledges, we recently rejected the same jurisdictional argument in another case, <em>Assoc. Unit Owners of Timbercrest Condo. v. Warren, </em>242 Or App 425, 256 P3d 146 (2011), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>352 Or 583, 238 P3d 958 (2012). In <em>Warren, </em>we concluded that an appeal may go forward as long as the appellant filed a notice of appeal within 30 days after the entry of judgment, even if a new-trial motion was pending at that time. Under those circumstances, the appellant need not file a new notice of appeal after the new-trial motion is denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201c[T]his court has jurisdiction to decide the merits of an appeal from a trial court decision without first requiring the filing of a new notice of appeal, if: (1) when the initial notice of appeal was filed, the trial court intended to enter an appealable judgment, but (2) the notice of appeal was premature, <em>i.e., </em>when the initial notice of appeal was filed, * * * a party had timely filed a motion for new trial and the motion had not yet been disposed of under ORCP 64 F(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 436-37 (footnotes omitted). We decline plaintiffs invitation to revisit the rule announced in <em>Warren. </em>Accordingly, we turn to the merits of defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In his first assignment of error, defendant primarily challenges the court\u2019s denial of his JNOV motion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>false-arrest claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant acknowledges that the jury could have found him liable for Kuenzi\u2019s actions, which led to plaintiffs arrest, on <em>either </em>of two theories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201cIn order for the jury to have found [defendant] liable for the arrest of Plaintiff by Kuenzi, they must have found from the preponderance of the evidence that Kuenzi was an agent of [defendant], [and] that in making the arrest she was exercising the authority imparted to her by [defendant] , <em>or, </em>if she was an independent contractor acting outside the scope of her authority, that [defendant] ratified her actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Defendant\u2019s appellate brief challenges both of those two possible routes to liability. First, he contends that the record does not include evidence supporting a determination that defendant was liable for Kuenzi\u2019s acts because, in carrying out a citizen\u2019s arrest or in prompting police officers to arrest him, she acted within the scope of her authority as defendant\u2019s agent: \u201cThere is no substantial evidence to conclude that Kuenzi was an agent of [defendant], or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>if she was that she had authority to arrest Plaintiff.\u201d In that regard, defendant asserts, \u201cThere is no evidence that [defendant] expressly authorized Kuenzi either to investigate or to arrest Plaintiff.\u201d He also contends that no evidence suggests \u201cthat Kuenzi had implied authority to make an arrest.\u201d Second, defendant argues that \u2014 assuming that Kuenzi was an independent contractor \u2014 the record includes no evidence that defendant actively participated in or ratified her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The difficulty for defendant is that only the second of those arguments is preserved for our consideration. Defendant\u2019s JNOV motion focused exclusively on whether defendant had ratified Kuenzi\u2019s actions and, therefore, could be held liable for any activities that she undertook as an independent contractor. Defendant did not argue in his JNOV motion that Kuenzi had not otherwise acted as an agent; nor did he argue that her actions were outside the scope of any authority she had as defendant\u2019s agent. Thus, defendant did not preserve for appeal any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a determination of liability based on an <em>agency </em>theory, as opposed to a theory that defendant had ratified the acts of an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">That lack of preservation is fatal to defendant\u2019s appeal given the jury instructions and the general form of verdict that were submitted to the jury. As noted, the jury instructions provided that the jury could find defendant liable for Kuenzi\u2019s acts for either of two reasons: (1) that Kuenzi was acting within the scope of her authority as defendant\u2019s agent; or (2) that defendant had ratified the acts that Kuenzi performed as an independent contractor. The verdict form did not ask the jury to specify on which of those two theories it found defendant liable; rather, it asked the jury only whether defendant was \u201cat fault\u201d for any false arrest. Thus, it is not possible to tell from the verdict in plaintiffs favor whether the jury based the verdict on the agency theory or on a theory that defendant ratified Kuenzi\u2019s acts as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">To establish entitlement to reversal of a trial court\u2019s judgment, an appellant must show that the trial court committed error \u201csubstantially affecting the rights of [that] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>party.\u201d ORS 19.415(2). In <em>Shoup, </em>the Supreme Court explained that, in challenging a judgment entered on a jury\u2019s verdict, ORS 19.415(2) requires the appellant to show more than mere speculation about whether an alleged error affected that verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201cThe possibility that an error might have resulted in a different jury verdict is insufficient under the statute. Instead, the court must be able to conclude, from the record, that the error \u2018substantially affect [ed]\u2019 the rights of the losing party. Moreover, the statute protects the trial court judgment from reversal or modification \u2018except for\u2019 error substantially affecting a party\u2019s rights, indicating that reversal of a judgment is the exception, not the rule. The rule embodied in ORS 19.415(2) is neutral as between plaintiffs and defendants; it <em>places the burden to make a record that demonstrates prejudicial error on whichever party loses in the trial court and then seeks reversal or modification of the judgment on appeal\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Shoup, </em>335 Or at 173-74 (brackets in original; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Shoup </em>involved a defendant\u2019s appeal from a jury verdict favoring the plaintiff in a negligence action. In that case, the court had submitted three specifications of negligence to the <em>jury </em>\u2014 i.e., three ways in which the defendant allegedly had acted negligently \u2014 two of which were valid and one of which was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 178. The Supreme Court explained that the trial court\u2019s submission of the invalid specification to the jury did not warrant reversal because it was only <em>possible </em>that the jury had based its verdict on that invalid specification. Because the defendant had \u201cnot identified anything in the record to demonstrate that the jury based its verdict on [the invalid] specification,\u201d it had not established that \u201cthe inclusion of the invalid specification of negligence \u2018substantially affected\u2019 [its] rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets omitted). Accordingly, the defendant was not entitled to reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Here, too, defendant has not established that his rights were \u201csubstantially affected\u201d by any error that the trial court may have committed by denying his JNOV motion. With respect to the issues regarding Kuenzi\u2019s actions that defendant raises on appeal, the motion was based solely on defendant\u2019s contention that he had not ratified actions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Kuenzi took as an independent contractor. As explained above, the jury could have reached its determination that defendant was \u201cat fault\u201d for plaintiffs false arrest on a different theory altogether \u2014 that Kuenzi had been acting within the scope of her authority as defendant\u2019s agent. Because defendant has not raised a <em>preserved </em>challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision that the record included evidence permitting the jury to find liability on that agency theory, he has not established that the jury\u2019s verdict was based on an impermissible theory of liability or that the trial court erred by not granting his JNOV motion. Under <em>Shoup, </em>therefore, his first assignment of error does not present any basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error similarly challenge the trial court\u2019s denials of his motions for JNOV and for new trial on his claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. We reject those challenges for the same reason that we reject the arguments he makes in conjunction with his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> Plaintiffs complaint named multiple defendants, but of those defendants, only Sidhu is a party to this appeal.

However, we also have noted some \u201cinconsistency in our cases\u201d on that point. <em>See Najjar, </em>203 Or App at 489 n 1.

We decline to resolve this appeal on the ground that defendant\u2019s first three assignments of error challenge unreviewable rulings, given (1) the inconsistency in the case law, (2) the fact that defendant moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, (3) the fact that any argument made in conjunction with assigning error to the denial of the directed-verdict motion would have been substantively identical to the argument that defendant makes in conjunction with his challenge to the denial of his JNOV motion, and (4) plaintiff\u2019s apparent acquiescence in the reviewability of defendant\u2019s first three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">We also note that, although defendant\u2019s first assignment of error purports to challenge the denial of his motion for a new trial, in addition to the denial of his JNOV motion, he makes no separate argument directed against the former ruling. Accordingly, we do not further address the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s new-trial motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
