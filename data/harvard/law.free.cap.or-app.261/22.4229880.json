He seeks to have his conviction set aside and the case remanded for a new trial. We conclude that, even if the court erred in giving the instruction, the error does not require reversal. We therefore affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The facts are largely undisputed. Defendant was discovered sleeping in a sleeping bag on property along the Willamette River belonging to Zidell Marine Corporation. The property was marked with \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and was enclosed on three sides by a chain link fence and barbed wire. Only the side along the Willamette River was not fenced. Defendant testified that he reached the property at night on an established trail from a paved walkway.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Defendant was charged with second-degree criminal trespass, ORS 164.245(l)(a), based on his presence on Zidell\u2019s property. A person commits that offense \u201cif the person enters or remains unlawfully * * * in or upon premises.\u201d ORS 164.245(1). ORS 164.205(3)(a) defines \u201cto enter or remain unlawfully\u201d as \u201c[t]o enter or remain in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d The charging instrument alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly and recklessly enter and remain in and upon\u201d the Zidell property.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">At trial, the state put on evidence that the Zidell property was not open to the public and that defendant did not have permission to be there. Defendant did not contradict that evidence. His defense was that he went to the property to sleep with the purpose of helping a friend and that, given the configuration of the property, the path to it, and the placement of the no trespassing signs, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would have thought that the property was open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The trial court gave Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction (UCrJI) 1900, which defines \u201cto enter or remain unlawfully\u201d in the same terms as the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant objected to the instruction, contending that, despite following the language of the statute, the instruction was erroneous under this state\u2019s case law, in particular <em>State v. Hartfield, </em>290 Or 583, 624 P2d 588 (1981), and <em>State v. Collins, </em>179 Or App 384, 39 P3d 925, <em>rev dismissed, </em>334 Or 491 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In <em>Hartfield, </em>the Supreme Court held that, where one is permitted or invited to enter premises not open to the public, to prove an unlawful entry under ORS 164.205(3)(a), the state must prove that the person giving permission was without actual authority to do so, and that the entrant knew or believed that there was no actual authority. 290 Or at 595. In <em>Collins, </em>this court concluded that, consistently with <em>Hartfield, </em>to prove the offense of criminal trespass when premises are not open to the public at the time of entry, the state <em>also </em>had to prove that the entry was not otherwise licensed or privileged. 179 Or App at 393. As we understood <em>Hartfield, </em>the \u201cor\u201d in ORS 164.205(3)(a) must be construed as the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In this case, defendant argued below that, as we held in <em>Collins, </em>to prove second-degree criminal trespass under ORS 164.205(3)(a) when premises are not open to the public, the state must prove <em>both </em>that the premises were not open to the public <em>and </em>that the entry was not otherwise licensed or privileged. 179 Or App at 393. Defendant contended that UCrJI 1900 misstated the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to UCrJI 1900, and explained why outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201cI believe that the uniform instruction is an accurate statement of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cI do not believe that the State is always required to prove both portions in that statute. There are times certainly when a premises is open to the public, yet a person is committing Criminal Trespass because they are not licensed or privileged to be there. And there are times when a premises is not open to the public * * * but yet they are licensed or privileged to be there, so the State is not required to prove both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Defense counsel subsequently asked that the state be required to elect the theory of trespass that it planned to pursue \u2014 entering and remaining on private property not open to the public <em>or </em>entering on property without a license. The prosecutor argued that he should not be required to make an election, because \u201ceither way I think there\u2019s evidence in the record to support it[.]\u201d The trial court ruled that the state was not required to elect a particular theory of trespass. The jury convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that, in light of <em>Hartfield </em>and <em>Collins, </em>the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict defendant of criminal trespass if it found <em>either </em>that the premises were not open to the public <em>or </em>that the entry was not otherwise licensed or privileged, when the case law required the jury to find both facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">We review the sufficiency of jury instructions for errors of law. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>329 Or 327, 986 P2d 1160 (1999). In determining whether the trial court erred in giving a particular instruction, \u201cwe read the instructions as a whole to determine whether they state the law accurately.\u201d <em>State v. Woodman, </em>341 Or 105, 118-19, 138 P3d 1 (2006) (no error when instructions, read as a whole, accurately reflect statutory requirements). The giving of an erroneous instruction amounts to reversible error if it caused prejudice, <em>i.e., </em>if \u201cthe instruction probably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the [jury] which affected the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Waterway Terminals v. P. S. Lord, </em>256 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>361, 370, 474 P2d 309 (1970); <em>Maas v. Wilier, </em>203 Or App 124, 129, 125 P3d 87, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 411 (2005). In determining whether an error in instructing the jury probably affected the outcome of the case, the court considers the instructions as a whole, in light of the evidence at trial and the parties\u2019 theories of the case. <em>State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>350 Or 576, 578, 260 P3d 439 (2011) (\u201cTo assess whether the error in instructing the jury could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the various charges involved, * * * it is important to describe both sides\u2019 respective evidence and theories of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">As noted, it is undisputed that the Zidell property was not open to the public, and defendant never contended that he was licensed or had permission to be on the Zidell property; defendant\u2019s theory was that he did not reasonably know that the Zidell property was private property. Defendant asserts that UCrJI 1900 nonetheless allowed the jury to find him guilty if the jury found <em>either </em>that defendant knew that the premises were not open to the public <em>or </em>that defendant knew he was not licensed or privileged to be there; contrary to <em>Collins, </em>defendant contends, the instruction did not require the state to establish both elements. In other words, defendant contends, if the jury found that defendant knew he was not licensed or privileged to be on the property, the jury could convict defendant without also finding that defendant knew that the premises were not open to the public. Conversely, if the jury found that defendant knew that the premises were not open to the public, the jury could convict him without also finding that defendant knew he was not licensed or privileged to be there. In that sense, defendant contends, the giving of UCrJI 1900 was erroneous, because it relieved the state from proving both circumstances. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (it is error not to instruct the jury on all elements of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The state does not concede that UCrJI 1900 was erroneous, nor does the state assert that the instruction alone was a correct statement of the law. Rather, the state argues that whether defendant had permission was never in contention; indeed, the uncontradicted evidence was that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>did not have permission to be on the premises. Defendant\u2019s theory was that the premises reasonably appeared to be open to the public. The state\u2019s theory was that, under the circumstances, no reasonable person could have believed that the property was open to the public. The state points out that, in closing argument, the prosecutor focused on whether, as charged, defendant recklessly entered property not open to the public:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">\u201cNow, recklessly means that when [defendant] entered, he was aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that that premises was not open [to] the public, that he consciously disregarded that risk and went in anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cNow, the judge also instructed you on what it means to be open to the public. And basically to paraphrase * * * what it means is would a reasonable person, looking at what [defendant] looked at that night, understand the property not to be open to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The prosecutor then described the evidence that supported a finding that defendant knew that he was trespassing on private property. The prosecutor made no mention of the evidence that defendant did not have permission to be on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Defendant\u2019s theory, in response, was that, in light of the attributes of the property, he reasonably believed that the premises were open to the public. Defense counsel\u2019s closing arguments focused on that issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The state points out that the jury instructions also emphasized the question whether a reasonable person would believe that the property was open to the public. The jury was instructed that premises \u201copen to the public\u201d are \u201c[p] remises that by their physical nature, function, custom, usage, notice or lack thereof or other circumstances at the time would cause a reasonable person to believe that no permission to enter or remain is required.\u201d Under that instruction, the state contends, the jury would have acquitted defendant if it had believed defendant\u2019s claim that he reasonably believed, because of the nature of the property, that he did not need permission to enter or remain. The state asserts, further, that it is unlikely that the jury convicted defendant on the basis that he was not licensed or privileged to be on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the property and ignored the question whether the property was open to the public, because defendant was charged with having \u201crecklessly\u201d entered upon the property, and the recklessness instruction related only to defendant\u2019s knowledge that the premises were not public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the state asserts that, read as a whole, the instructions adequately apprised the jury of the legal requirements for finding defendant guilty of second-degree criminal trespass, and the jury could not reasonably have believed that it could convict defendant if the state proved only that defendant was not licensed or privileged to be on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Defendant responds that, even if the jury found that defendant reasonably believed the property to be open to the public, under the instructions given, it could have convicted him based on the evidence that he did not have a license or privilege to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We need not decide whether the \u201center or remain\u201d instruction was erroneous, because we agree with the state that, for the reasons the state cites \u2014 the evidence presented at trial, the legal theories asserted, and the jury instructions as a whole \u2014 there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury mistakenly believed that it could convict defendant without finding that defendant knew or should have known that the property was not open to the public. That was the entire focus of the state\u2019s case and defendant\u2019s defense. We conclude for that reason that, in the context of all of the jury instructions, the single instruction would not have misled the jury to decide the case on an incorrect theory and that any error in giving the instruction was harmless and does not require reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> UCrJI 1900 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cEnter or remain unlawfully \u2014 (a), to enter or remain in or on premises when the premises at the time of such entry or remaining are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> Defense counsel argued to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cI realize that this is a direct quote from the statute, but it does misstate the law as it currently stands. \u2018The premises are not open to the public or whether the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court have both held that that \u2018or\u2019 is actually an \u2018and,\u2019 that the State has to prove both that the premises are not open to the public and that the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The complaint charged that defendant did \u201crecklessly enter and remain in and upon\u201d the premises. The instruction told that jury that \u201crecklessly\u201d \u201cmeans that the person is aware of and consciously disregards the substantial and unjustifiable risk that Zidell Marine Corporation\u2019s property is not open to the public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
