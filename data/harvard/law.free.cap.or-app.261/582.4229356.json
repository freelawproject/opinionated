The convictions arose out of defendant\u2019s conduct during a traffic incident in which defendant, who was under the influence of intoxicants, performed a number of reckless driving maneuvers while following a vehicle that he believed had cut him off. At sentencing, the trial court imposed a 78-month term of imprisonment for defendant\u2019s various offenses and entered a judgment of conviction to that effect. However, the judgment failed to reflect that defendant\u2019s sentences would run consecutively to any previously imposed sentences that defendant was serving, as the trial court had orally indicated at defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing. Subsequently, and without written notice to defendant, the trial court amended the judgment to correct that omission. Defendant appeals, raising three assignments of error. We write to address only defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by amending the judgment without first providing defendant with written notice of the court\u2019s intention to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">As we have previously observed, ORS 138.083(1) permits a court to amend a judgment to delete or modify any erroneous term, but it also expressly requires that the court provide \u201cwritten notice to all the parties\u201d before doing so on its own motion. <em>E.g., State v. French, </em>208 Or App 652, 657, 145 P3d 305 (2006). The state concedes that the trial court erred by failing to comply with that notice requirement, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Amended judgment vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
