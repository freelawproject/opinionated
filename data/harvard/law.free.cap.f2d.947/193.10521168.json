GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Torch, Inc. (\u201cTorch\u201d), a Louisiana corporation with its principal offices in Louisiana, complains that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing its declaratory judgment action. Finding no such abuse of discretion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">While in the employ of Torch as a seaman, Michael P. LeBlanc allegedly sustained injuries on two separate occasions: (i) on February 21, 1989, off the coast of Texas, and (ii) on April 24, 1989, while working near the coast of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">Torch filed a (preventative) limitation proceeding in federal district court on or about February 23, 1990, and obtained this stay. LeBlanc then filed a motion in that same court to lift the stay so that he could file and pursue a claim against Torch in Texas state court. That motion was granted and the stay was lifted on October 3, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">Within three days after the stay was lifted, Torch filed its Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in federal court. On December 28, 1990, LeBlanc filed a suit against Torch in Texas state court and, soon after, he also filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in federal court. LeBlanc\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was granted by a Judgment entered on February 22,1991. It is from that Judgment that Torch now appeals, alleging that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">Declaratory relief is a matter of district court discretion. <em>See Mission Ins. Co. v. Puritan Fashions Corp., </em>706 F.2d 599, 601 (5th Cir.1983) (noting that Declaratory Judgment Act bestows \u201ca choice, not a command\u201d on district court). The district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-19\">may consider a variety of factors in determining whether to decide a declaratory judgment suit. For example, declaratory judgment relief may be denied [i] because of a pending state court proceeding in which the matters in controversy between the parties may be fully litigated, [ii] because the declaratory complaint was filed in anticipation of another suit and is being used for the purpose of forum shopping, [iii] because of possible inequities in permitting the plaintiff to gain precedence in time and forum or [iv] because of inconvenience to the parties or the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-20\"><em>Rowan Companies, Inc. v. Griffin, </em>876 F.2d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). In reviewing a district court\u2019s declaratory judgment decision, this court\u2019s inquiry is limited to determining whether there has been an abuse of this broad discretion. <em>See id..; Mission, </em>706 F.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">Torch has brought three issues before this court: (a) whether the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>abused its discretion in dismissing Torch\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Judgment; (b) whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider the <em>forum non conveniens </em>factors raised by Torch in this Complaint; and (c) whether the district court abused its discretion in considering that sustaining Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment action would establish non-liability for Torch and defeat LeBlanc\u2019s right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\n<em>A. Whether the District Court Abused its Discretion in Dismissing Torch\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The district court considered each of the variables established in <em>Rowan, </em>876 F.2d at 29 (quoted supra), and noted that: (i) there is a pending state court action that \u201cwill resolve all the issues present in this declaratory judgment action\u201d and judicial economy is a factor that can be taken into account; (ii) \u201cthe declaratory judgment action filed in [federal] court strongly suggests forum shopping on Torch\u2019s part\u201d; and (iii) \u201callowing the declaratory judgment proceeding to go forward could effectively deprive Mr. LeBlanc of his right to present the Jones Act claims to a jury.\u201d <em>See </em>Transcript of Hearing Before the Honorable Robert F. Collins at 14-15, <em>Torch, Inc., v. LeBlanc, </em>No. 90-3198 (5th Cir. filed Mar. 28, 1991) [\u201cTranscript\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The district court weighed the relevant facts. In light of the breadth of the district court\u2019s discretion <em>(see supra </em>Part II), this court\u2019s standard of review <em>{see id.), </em>and the fact that the district court did assign reasons for its dismissal <em>{see Rowan </em>at 29), we have no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>B. Whether the District Court Abused its Discretion in Failing to Consider the Forum Non Conveniens Factors Raised by Torch</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Torch contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">Between LeBlanc\u2019s concession that many of the same considerations are used in determining declaratory judgment dismissals and <em>forum non conve-niens </em>dismissals and statements by this Court in <em>Rowan </em>and <em>Puritan Fashions </em>to the same effect, it is clear that there is a relationship between declaratory judgment dismissals and <em>forum non conve-niens </em>dismissals and that many of the same considerations do apply_ Because there is absolutely no showing that the trial court considered convenience to the parties and witnesses in determining whether to hear or dismiss Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment, the trial court abused its discretion and its dismissal of Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment should be overturned. In fact, had convenience of the parties been considered, the court would have been virtually compelled to maintain the declaratory judgment action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant, Torch, Inc. at 5-6, <em>Torch, Inc. v. Michael P. LeBlanc, </em>No. 91-3193 (5th Cir. filed May 1, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Torch is misreading the law on this point. The district court has discretion to consider a number of variables<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, as stated by this court previously, declaratory judgment analysis is <em>not </em>a euphemism for <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-15\">A district court\u2019s discretion in dismissing declaratory judgment actions is not directly governed by considerations relevant in a suit dismissed under the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine. Stated differently, the factors to be considered by the district court in exercising its sound discretion concerning the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action are not the same factors that are to be considered by a district court in exercising its sound discretion in dismissing a case under the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine. Pacific has tried to impose a consideration found appropriate in <em>&amp; forum non conveniens </em>case, the United States citizenship of a party, to a declaratory judgment action. The argument is not persuasive in showing that the district court abused its discretion in the ease <em>sub judice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-16\"><em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. M/V Capt. W.D. Cargill, </em>751 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 909, 106 S.Ct. 279, 88 L.Ed.2d 244 (1985). Torch\u2019s argument has, therefore, already been rejected by this court and, conscious of the discretion of the district court, we must now reject it again.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>C. Whether the District Court Abused its Discretion in Considering that Sustaining Torch\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Action Would Defeat LeBlanc\u2019s Right to a Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">Torch also contends that, \u201cbecause the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment was at least in part based on its belief that maintaining Torch\u2019s declaratory action would defeat LeBlanc\u2019s right to a jury, the dismissal is erroneous as a matter of law and should be reversed.\u201d Reply Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant Torch, Inc. at 10, No. 91-3193 (5th Cir. filed Jul. 15, 1991) [\u201cReply Brief\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at 9 (citing and quoting from the Transcript at 10). Torch relies upon <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 504, 79 S.Ct. 948, 953, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959): \u201cThe District Court\u2019s finding that the Complaint for Declaratory Relief presented basically equitable issues draws no support from the Declaratory Judgment Act ... That statute, while allowing prospective defendants to sue to establish their non-liability, specifically reserves the right to jury trial for both parties.\u201d Reply Brief at 10. Torch goes on to argue that \u201c[bjecause LeBlanc\u2019s underlying obligation would have been triable to a jury, Torch\u2019s declaratory action is still triable to a jury at LeBlanc\u2019s option.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While debating whether or not to dismiss Torch\u2019s declaratory judgment action, the district court was cognizant that there was a pending state court action, and that granting Torch\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment in federal court would establish non-liability for Torch and deny LeBlanc his right to have his case heard before <em>a Texas state court jury. </em>Transcript at 14. Even <em>if </em>Torch were correct in challenging portions of the district court\u2019s reasoning regarding these jury trial implications, the district court\u2019s consideration of such implications is buttressed by the holding in <em>Cunningham Brothers, Inc. v. Bail, </em>407 F.2d 1165, 1169 (7th Cir.1969), <em>cert, denied, </em>395 U.S. 959, 89 S.Ct. 2100, 23 L.Ed.2d 745 (1969) (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">We agree with plaintiff that a declaratory judgment action should not be dismissed solely because a more traditional remedy is available ... However, when the traditional remedy provides the parties with the procedural safeguards required by the law to insure the availability of a proper remedy, the courts, in exercising their discretion, may properly dismiss the declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP7\">In light of this holding and the district court\u2019s discretion regarding declaratory judgment, we again defer to the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\">. <em>See supra </em>Part II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. <em>Id. </em>at 1168 (citation omitted): \"To allow a declaratory judgment action under the facts before us would be to allow a substitute for the traditional procedures for adjudicating negligence cases ... \u2018it is not one of the purposes of the declaratory judgment acts to enable a prospective negligence action defendant to obtain a declaration of non-liability.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
