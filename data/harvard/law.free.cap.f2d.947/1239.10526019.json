This offense carries a maximum penalty of forty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(B). Carr and Hunter are scheduled to be sentenced on December 11, 1991. Both women were on release for the two years pending their trial, it having been determined before trial that neither was a flight risk nor a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The district court denied release pending sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2). This provision mandates, inter alia, detention pending sentencing of persons convicted of Title 21 violations for which the maximum sentence is at least ten years when there is no showing that a motion for a new trial or acquittal will likely be granted. Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">Defendants\u2019 first argument is that although the offense involved here is a Title 21 offense for which a maximum of at least ten years is prescribed, \u00a7 3143(a)(2) should not mandate detention because there is no realistic exposure of these defendants to a sentence of ten years under the sentencing guidelines. Section 3143(a)(2), however, does not refer to the sentencing guidelines in determining which defendants must be detained. Instead, it refers to persons convicted of crimes listed under \u00a7 3142(f)(1), which includes Title 21 offenses carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more. The fact that the defendants might not receive a sentence of ten years under the sentencing guidelines is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">Defendants also contend that the district court erred by refusing to consider granting relief under the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c). This provision states that \u201ca person subject to detention pursuant to section 3143(a)(2) or (b)(2), and who meets the conditions of release set forth in section 3143(a)(1) or (b)(1), may be ordered released, under appropriate conditions, by the judicial officer, if it is clearly shown that there are exceptional reasons why such person\u2019s detention would not be appropriate.\u201d The district court ruled that \u00a7 3145 was inapplicable \u201csince the court itself has ruled on the motion for bond pending sentencing.\u201d The district court was apparently under the impression that the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d clause of \u00a7 3145(c) applies only to appeals from initial detention orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">Section 3145(c) is confusing because it is entitled \u201cappeal from a release or detention order.\u201d At the same time, the language of the sentence included in \u00a7 3145(c) is direct. It states that \u201cthe judicial officer\u201d may order release if certain conditions are met and there are exceptional reasons why detention would be inappropriate. This sentence was added to \u00a7 3145(c) with the mandatory detention provisions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2) and (b)(2) and was apparently designed to provide an avenue for exceptional discretionary relief from those provisions. <em>See </em>Crime Control Act of 1990, P.L. No. 101-647, \u00a7 902, 104 Stat. 4826, 4827 (1990). Section 3143(a)(2) and (b)(2) use the term \u201cjudicial officer\u201d when referring to the individuals initially ordering such mandatory detention. Furthermore, at least two district courts have applied \u00a7 3145(c) in the first instance. <em>United States v. DiSomma, </em>769 F.Supp. 575 (S.D.N.Y.1991); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>759 F.Supp. 685 (D.Colo.), <em>aff'd, </em>940 F.2d 1539 (10th Cir. 1991). We see no reason why Congress would have limited this means of relief to reviewing courts. Thus we conclude that the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d language of \u00a7 3145 may be applied by the judicial officer initially ordering such mandatory detention, despite its inclusion in a section generally covering appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-13\">We must therefore remand to the district court to consider whether the defendants meet the conditions for release set forth in \u00a7 3143(a)(1) or (b)(1) and whether there are \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d why their detention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>would be inappropriate under \u00a7 3145(c). We express no opinion regarding defendants\u2019 likelihood of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">AFFIRMED in part; REMANDED in part for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
