It is alleged that the petitioners have been enjoined in an action to which they were not parties, and therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of the court granting the injunction. If they can appeal it is conceded they have no right to the writ, and there is no doubt that they can appeal by making themselves parties in the manner pointed out in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>144 Cal. 509, [103 Am. St. Rep. 102, 77 Pac. 1109].</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
