If the acceptance be not unqualified, or go not to the actual thing proposed, then there is no binding contract. A proposal to accept, or an acceptance based upon terms varying from those offered, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>a rejection of the offer.

Whittlesey, of which the following is in part a copy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">May 11th, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u201cMr. Chas. F. Whittlesey, Architect,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201cLos Angeles, Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">\u201cDear Sir: Referring to wires exchanged and inclosing herewith confirmation of our wires to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">\u201cIn explanation of our first wire would state that in our proposition to Gen.

Four bags or 380 lbs. equal a barrel.

Terms and other conditions as per reverse side of first sheet of this letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\">It is not necessary to quote the conditions mentioned, as they are the same as those appearing in the letter to General Wentworth to which reference was made. The letter to General Wentworth, dated May 3, 1906, contained practically the same terms as those appearing in the letter of May 12th just quoted above, with the exception of a statement that the net price of the cement would be about $3.46 per barrel. This was obviously a mistake in calculation, and on May 10th had been corrected by the Hunkins-Willis Company by a telegram to General Wentworth as follows:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cOur proposition third three \"eighty-five including sacks, thirty cents barrel rebate when sacks returned mills.

F. Whittlesey,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cLos Angeles, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cDear Sir: We received last p. m. wire reading: \u2018Your wire 11th.

We now await your shipping instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cRespt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">\u201cHunkins-Willis L. &amp; C. Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">A telegram to the same effect was sent on the same day. Mr. Whittlesey was also informed by wire on May 17th that the letter mentioned in his telegram of the 11th had not been received. On May 19th Mr. Whittlesey wired the re-as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">\u201cLos Angeles, Calif. May 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">\u201cHunkins-Willis Lime and Cement Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">\u201cSt. Louis, Mo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">\u201cYour letter received. Understood your price Wentworth three forty six. Can buy here less than three fifty. Cancel order for seven thousand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">\u201cChas. F. Whittlesey.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The respondent corporation refused to cancel the order, and shipped 1080 barrels of cement to Los Angeles. This shipment was declined and no more cement was sent. Judgment was given for the loss caused by demurrage and cost of resale of this shipment and as to the remaining 5920 barrels in accordance with the provision of section 3311 of the Civil Code. Appellant contends that there Avas no meeting of the minds of the alleged contracting parties, while respondent\u2019s position is that Mr. Whittlesey\u2019s telegram of the 11th: \u201cYour wire eleventh place order for seven thousand barrels particulars by letter to-day,\u201d and the respondent\u2019s letter of the same day, together with its telegram of the day folloAving: \u201cWire received. Order booked. We await letter particulars,\u201d constitute the closing acts in the contract. We find ourselves unable to agree with this view. Ignoring the final sentence of Mr. Whittlesey\u2019s telegram \u201cparticulars by letter to-day,\u201d there is abundant evidence in respondent\u2019s own telegram and letter that the contract was not considered complete. The former communication advised Mr. Whittlesey that the order was booked\u2014not accepted\u2014and referred to the expected letter of particulars, while the latter contains this very significant language: \u201cReferring to our first wires as to reference. ' You were entirely unknown to us, but investigation since has resulted satisfactorily and we would feel honored to open business relations with your good self. Earnestly hoping to have the pleasure of serving you, we are,\u201d etc. There was not that meeting of the minds of the parties which must take place before a contract is complete. Upon this subject, in the case of <em>Four Oil Co. </em>v. <em>United Oil Producers, </em>145 Cal. 624, [79 Pac. 366], Mr. Justice Henshaw used the folloAving language: \u201cThe rules for determining whether or not a proposal and acceptance constitute a binding contract are well settled, and by this court have been expressed in the following language: \u2018To constitute a binding contract made in this form (letters), there must be a proposal squarely assented to. If the acceptance be not unqualified, or go not to the actual thing proposed, then there is no binding contract. (1 Wharton on Contracts, sec. 4.) A proposal to accept, or an acceptance based upon terms varying from those offered, is a rejection of the offer. <em>(National Bank </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>101 U. S. 43, 51.) An offer imposes no obligation unless it is accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>upon the terms upon which it was made. <em>(Tilley </em>v. <em>County of Cook, </em>103 U. S. 161.) An acceptance must be absolute and unqualified. A qualified acceptance is a new proposal. (Civ. Code, sec. 1585.)\u2019 <em>(Wristen </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>82 Cal. 84 [82 Pac. 1136].)\u201d That there was not here a \u201cproposal squarely-assented to\u201d seems too obvious to require further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Henshaw, J., and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
