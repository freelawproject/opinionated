The statute does not require it to be settled on the oath of the guardian.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-9\">Joshua Stetson, guardian of a person <em>non compos mentis, </em>had been removed by the judge of probate of the county of Plymouth, and the appellant appointed guardian in his place. Stetson was cited to settle his account in the probate court, but did not appear ; apd the appellee, as administrator on the estate of Charles Bailey, one of the sureties in Stetson\u2019s probate bond, exhibited, without the knowledge of Stetson, an account of the guardianship, which the judge of probate decreed should be allowed. Curtis appealed from this decree, and assigned, as one reason of the appeal, that the judge of probate had no right to act upon such an account so presented.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-11\"><em>W. Baylies, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP2p\">By <em>St. </em>1783, c. 38, \u00a7 5, it is provided, that a guardian shall give bond for the rendering a just and true account of his guardianship when and so often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>as he shall be required. The guardian should settle the account himself, and upon his oath ; but, in the \u2022 present case, it does not appear that Stetson so much as authorized the exhibiting of this account, nor that any oath was taken even by the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\"><em>Beal, </em>for the appellee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ALO\">The Court are of opinion, that\u2019the judge of probate was correct in admitting the appellee to exhibit the account. It may happen, that other persons must necessarily take the place of a guardian in settling an account; for instance, where a guardian dies. It does not appear, by the statute, that it must be settled upon the oath of the guardian. The judge of probate might have sworn the appellee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-15\"> See <em>Baylies </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>post, 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
