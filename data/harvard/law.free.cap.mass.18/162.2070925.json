At the trial, which was upon the general issue, before <em>Wilde </em>J., the plaintiffs, to prove the warranty, read to the jury an advertisement stating that machine cards were manufactured -by the defendants, <em>warranted equal to any in America. </em>The judge instructed the jury, that a warranty in these terms was equivalent to the warranty set forth in the declaration. The jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, the defendants moved for a new trial, <em>partly </em>on the ground of the misdirection of the judge in this particular.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-9\"><em>Phinney, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACa\">A warranty should be proved as it is set forth in the declaration. <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>Doug. 665; <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Moses, l </em>Johns.

A warranty that the cards should be equal to any in America cannot be considered the same with a warranty that they should be good and merchantable, although an article agreeing with the former warranty might be superior to one agreeing with the latter. Proof which would support one of these warranties might not support the other. The best cards in America might not be merchantable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-4\"><em>Webster, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWl\">In an action on a contract, the party may declare upon the meaning of it. He may set out a part only of the contract and recover. It is true, he must set out the whole of the consideration for that part. The object of the plaintiffs was to purchase good cards; they did not want the very best. Neither did the defendants want to sell any but such as were of the ordinary quality. The expression in the advertisement is equivalent to the word <em>warranted </em>simply; which means that the article should be of the ordinary quality What would have been the result, if the defendants had proved that the cards sold were as good as other cards usually are, and the plaintiffs had proved, that, in some particular place in America, cards of an extraordinary good quality were manufactured ? Would this show that the warranty had been broken? A common advertisement is not to be viewed with as much strictness as a deed indented. It was a question for the jury to determine, whether the cards were not warranted to be of the ordinary quality, and they have found for the plaintiffs. The warranty, indeed, set out in the declaration is not so strong as that in the advertisement, but it is not for the defendants to make this an objection. The plaintiffs have taken the substantial port, and a recovery here will be a bar to any future action on the warranty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The cause was continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, and at the following March term, at Concord, the Court granted a new trial, on account of variance between the warranty alleged m the declaration and the contract proved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Otis, post, </em>368; <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Lovering, </em>2 Pick. 214; <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Whitmarsh, </em>4 Pick. 233; <em>Baylies </em>v. <em>Fettyplace, 7 </em>Mass.
