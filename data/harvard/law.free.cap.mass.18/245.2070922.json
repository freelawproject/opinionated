For this purpose they proved, that the records of the Court of Sessions for the county to which Hingham belonged, when the warning was supposed to have been given, had been destroyed or lost; and then they offered the deposition of Thomas Lovis, taken <em>in perpetuam, </em>to prove the warning ; but as it had not been recorded pursuant to the statute, it was rejected by the Court. The defendants then moved the Court to admit the declaratians of Lovis, contained in the deposition and sworn to by him, to go to the jury, as <em>hearsay </em>evidence, to prove that he came to Hingham in March 1751, and that in the spring of the same year he was warned by a constable to leave the town. This evidence also was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXv\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs. If the evidence rejected ought to have been admitted, a new trial was to be granted ; otherwise, judgment was to be entered according to the verdict ; unless it should be arrested for the reasons assigned by the defendants in a motion for that purpose.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ApZb\"><em>B. Sumner </em>and <em>Cushing, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYJ\">The loss of the best evidence having been proved, the next best that the case admitted of was offered and ought to have been received. Hearsay evidence is admissible in cases of pedigree, reputation, prescription and custom. This case is most like those relating to pedigree. The warning was an ancient fact, and could be proved in no other way than by hearsay. There was no living witness. The fact was not notorious, and came from a person who must have had the best knowledge of it ; and it was one about which he could not be mistaken. He had no bias, for he could neither gain nor lose by his testimony ; or, if he preferred continuing in Hingham, where he had lived a long time, the bias would rather be contrary to his testimony. It does not appear that any suit had been commenced, or was likely to be ; it was a common precaution with towns to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>such depositions taken. The evidence was from a credible source ; the veracity of the witness has not been impeached. The truth would be obtained by his declaration as much as if the deposition had been regularly taken. The recording does not make a deposition true. His declaration has an advantage over common hearsay evidence, because it has been sworn to. This evidence comes within all the reasons for admitting hearsay evidence respecting pedigree, and there are several cases in which such evidence has been admitted. <em>Rex </em>v. Greenwich, Burr. S. C. 243; <em>Rex </em>v. Nutley, ibid. 701; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Creech St. </em>Michael\u2019s, ibid. 765; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>The Inhabitants of Holy </em>Trinity, <em>&amp;c., </em>Cald. 141. In <em>Rex </em>v. Eriswell, 3 D. &amp; E. 707, the court was divided. The cases to the contrary, <em>\u2014Rex </em>v. Chadderton, 2 East, 27; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Ferry </em>Frystone, ibid. 54; <em>Rex </em>v. Abergwilly, ibid. 63, \u2014 were decided without being argued. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Nuneham </em>Courtney, 1 East, 373, the person, whose declarations were offered in evidence and rejected, was living, having absconded. That case, too, was not argued, and no reasons are given for the decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">Such evidence has been admitted on the ground of analogy, in cases not relating to pedigree, but where the same reasons existed. <em>Davies </em>v. Pierce, 2 D. &amp; E. 53; <em>Peaceable d. Uncle </em>v. Watson, 4 Taunt. 16; <em>Thompson </em>v. Trevannion, Skin. 402; <em>Aveson </em>v. <em>Kinnaird, </em>6 East, 188; <em>Hingham </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>10 East, 109; <em>Herbert </em>v. Tuckal, T. Raym. 84; <em>Jackson d. Miner </em>v. Boneham, 15 Johns. Rep. 226; <em>Douglass\u2019s Lessee </em>v. Sanderson, 2 Dallas, 116; <em>Crouch </em>v. Eveleth, 15 Mass. Rep. 306. In Rex v. Erith, 8 East, 539, the declaration of a father respecting the <em>place </em>of his child\u2019s birth was rejected, and Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, the point turned on a single fact, involving no question but of locality, and, therefore, not falling within the rules applicable to cases of pedigree ; but this reason is not satisfactory.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>Thacher, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AUq8\">The deposition, when offered as such, having been properly rejected because it was not recorded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was next attempted to prove by it the declaration of the depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>nent.

The question related to the citizenship of a man who had deserted from Burgoyne\u2019s army. Evidence was offered of his saying that he was born in Germany; but it was rejected on the same ground, not being evidence of pedigree, &amp;c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The provincial act of 4 <em>Will. Mar. c. </em>13, required several steps to be taken in regard to warning a person to leave a town, of which a return was to be made to the Court of Sessions. The records in the present case were lost, and inferior evidence might, therefore, have been admitted. But here was evidence of a single fact only, which would, not show that all the requisite steps had been taken, even if the evidence were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 Mass.
