This is the most that the proof in behalf of the relators can be held to have established in the present case. If one\u2019s own assessment \u201cis not out of proportion, as compared with valuations generally on the same roll, it is immaterial that some one neighbor is assessed too little and another to much.\u201d Cooley on Taxation (2d Ed.) p. 410. This doctrine has been adopted by the Court of Appeals in construing chapter 269, p. 402, of the Laws of 1880, from which the certiorari provisions of the present tax law are derived. People ex rel. Warren v. Carter, 109 N. Y. 576, 581, 17 N. E. 222; People ex rel. Allen v. Badgley, 138 N. Y. 314, 317, 33 N. E. 1076. It is fatal to the case of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Moreover, I agree with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Gaynor at Special Term that the comparison made by the relators is with property not in the same circumstances or category with their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
