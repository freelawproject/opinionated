The rule is perfectly well settled that a person dealing with an agent is bound at his peril to inquire and ascertain the extent of the agent\u2019s power and authority. There is not only no.evidence that Murphy had authority to make a contract, but there is also a total lack of evidence that defendant, or any of its responsible officers', ever knew that there had been any negotiations between plaintiffs and Murphy. And, finally, taking plaintiffs\u2019 own version of their conversation with Murphy, it amounts on its face to nothing more than his expression of opinion that the mwest bidder would get the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The order denying the motion for a new trial is reversed, and the .notion granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
