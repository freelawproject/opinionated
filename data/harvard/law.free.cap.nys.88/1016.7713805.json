On redirect he was asked if there was a \u201cbreaker\u201d at or near this corner, and the question was excluded on the ground that he had already-testified there was. <em>Held </em>error; the witness being entitled to explain the seeming contradiction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1036-12\">Appeal from City Court of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1036-13\">Action by John O\u2019Donnell against the Interurban Street Railway Company.

The case turned upon the conduct of the motorman, what he did and where he did it, as observed and related by the different witnesses, and incidentally upon his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Some of the witnesses for plaintiff testified that the car was going rapidly; others, very slowly; and one, that after it had the wagon jammed up against the fence the car went fast. The motorman said, on his direct, he was going very slowly at the time, about a mile an hour; that when he hit the forward wheel of the wagon his car came to a stop, and did not go at all; that he put on the reverse\u2014\u201cI reversed it, and it went back about five feet.\u201d On his cross he said that about 20 feet south of Spruce street he started to put on the brake; that he had no power on then because there was a \u201cbreaker\u201d there\u2014 a \u201cbreaker\u201d being, as afterwards explained, part where the power is cut off, or a separation between the channel works. Now, if \u201c20 feet south of Spruce street\u201d were taken, as it might be from some of the evidence, as the place where he said before that he had put on the reverse, the motorman might be deemed to have contradicted himself. Evidently to explain away, as he had a right to do, if he could, this seeming contradiction, the defendant\u2019s counsel recalled the motorman and asked him, \u201cDo you know whether there is a breaker at or near Spruce street, on Park Row?\u201d which was objected to, \u201con the ground that witness had already testified there was.\u201d The objection was sustained, to which defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The exception was well taken, for the exclusion of the question was a reversible error. Not only was the evidence wrongly referred to, but the defendant, also, was entitled to have from the witness himself whatever explanation he could give of the seeming contradiction in his testimony; for, as said in People v. Buchanan, 145 N. Y. 1, 24, 39 N. E. 846, by Gray, J.:</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">\u201cI understand the rule to be that a witness may be re-examined by the party calling him upon all topics upon which he is cross-examined, with \u00e1 purpose of explaining any new facts which may come up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Practically the same may be said as to the exclusion of two other questions, asked for the same purpose and excluded on a mere \u201cObjected to,\u201d without statement of any reason, and which were as to whether or not there was a separation between the channel works on Park Row, at or near Spruce street, and also as to whether there was a \u201cbreaker\u201d within 50 or 60 feet of Spruce street. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
