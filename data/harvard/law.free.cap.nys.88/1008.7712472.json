It is difficult to avoid the conclusion either that the verdict was the result of a compromise or that the jury misunderstood and disregarded the testimony. In either case justice would be better served by ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-17\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
