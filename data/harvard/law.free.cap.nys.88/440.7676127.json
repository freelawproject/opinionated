The answer is a general denial. On the trial it was stipulated between the parties that the lumber and other building material mentioned in the complaint were delivered to the defendant, and that the value thereof is as stated in the complaint, and that the only issue to be tried is to whom the goods, the lumber, and other building material were sold. The defendant did not purchase the goods -of the plaintiff in person. His agent, Allen, opened negotiations with the plaintiff\u2019s business house for the supplying of this lumber, which was delivered upon the promise of one Peek, for the erection of a building for the latter. The plaintiff relies especially upon an instrument in writing which be claims was a contract between Peck and the defendant, by the terms of which the defendant agreed to build for Peck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the structure for which the lumber and other materials were supplied, \u201cand supply all labor and material\u201d for the same for a given sum of money. Allen, the defendant\u2019s agent, testified in behalf of his principal that he made arrangements with .those in charge of the plaintiff\u2019s business that credit for the lumber and building materials was to be given and extended to Peck. There was evidence on both sides of the controversy, and all of the testimony presented a clean-cut question of fact, whose solution by the jury could not have been otherwise than difficult on account of the evenly balanced weight of evidence, and, were it not for the error in the admission of the evidence, which we will discuss, the judgment should be affirmed. There was no dispute upon the trial that $100 had been paid in part satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and it developed that Peck had paid this sum himself. On the redirect examination of the plaintiff he was asked this question: \u201cWhat conversation was had between you and Mr. Peck at the time he paid you that money?\u201d This was objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and hearsay, and not binding on the defendant. The learned trial court overruled the objection, and defendant excepted. The witness then answered: \u201cMr. Peck brought in a check for $100, and said that he would pay that on Mr. Gabler\u2019s account. Q. Mr. Gabler had told him to pay that money ? A. That is the way I got it.\u201d The issue that was litigated presented the question whether the goods were sold to Peck or defendant, Gabler, and a statement by Peck to the plaintiff that he would pay $100 on Mr. Gabler\u2019s account, and that Gabler had told him to pay that money, was hearsay. The conversation was in the absence of the defendant, and under well-settled principles was clearly incompetent. As Mr. Justice Sewell remarked in Abrams v. Braunstein, 64 App. Div. 538, 539, 72 N. Y. Supp. 298, speaking of similar evidence, \u201cIt was not part of the res geste, but a mere declaration of statements made by a third person, with which the plaintiff was not chargeable;\u201d and the judgment in that case was reversed for the reception of that character of evidence. No claim was made that Peck was acting in any manner in this transaction, or any other, as agent for the defendant, Gabler, or had authority to represent him in this payment, or to speak for him in the transaction; and no evidence is to be found, after a careful examination of the record, to support such a contention. We cannot say that the reception of the evidence did not affect the result. For-this error the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">.Tndgivrr-t .\"ihI order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
