Moreover, an examination of th\u00e9 record discloses that the ownership of the automobile at the time of the accident was not conclusively proven to have existed either in the defendants Homan or Schulz or in the defendant Pendleton, and there was sufficient evidence from which the judge could have found that the appellants were still the owners at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">There was also sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that the appellants\u2019 employ\u00e9 was on the occasion of the accident directed to accompany. the operator of the machine for the purpose of instructing and assisting him in its operation, and that, therefore, the negligence of the operator was imputable to the appellants, and that the machine was under their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
