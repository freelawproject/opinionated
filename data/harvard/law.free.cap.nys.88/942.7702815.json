It was therefore negligence on the part of the mother, \u2018he natural and actual guardian of the child, who, unattended and unwarned, was allowed to go into and across the street, occupied on a holiday with crowds of many people and vehicles of divers sorts. For this actual and imputable negligence, judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.
