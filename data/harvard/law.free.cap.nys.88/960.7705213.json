The proceedings were therefore properly dismissed, but as the appeal herein is from a final order, and no such order as required by section 2249 of the Code of Civil Procedure appears from the record to have been made, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.
