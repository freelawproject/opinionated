In the case at bar there was no such prior contract, and the plaintiff had rendered services for only 10 months. The presumption stated above does therefore not attach to his continuance in service for a few months longer, and, there being no evidence to sustain the theory, of a renewal for another year upon which the verdict is based, the judgment cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
