I hereby lease the stoop floor at 174 Orchard St. south side to Mr. Miller from 1901 to May 1st, 1905 for the sum of $17 per month.' A Greenspan.\u201d Upon that, Miller claimed to be in possession as a lessee from the plaintiff\u2019s vendor, Greenspan, who testified that he had given this paper, and that he had told the plaintiff, his vendee, that Miller was in under a lease. That he had been so told, or had any such information, the petitioning landlord denied. The learned justice evidently disregarded the story of personal notice, and found the petitioner a purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration. If this memorandum, signed by the landlord only, be called a lease, on the doctrine that one who has delivered a contract subscribed by himself is estopped from denying that it was well' executed, it still is insufficient to support the defendant, for, being for a period exceeding three years, it-would be a \u201cconveyance,\u201d and require record, which might not be of this unacknowledged paper. Sections 240, 241, Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 607, c. 547). The final order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Final order affirmed, with costs and disbursements.
