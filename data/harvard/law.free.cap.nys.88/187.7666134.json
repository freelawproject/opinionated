The proper practice requires that the order \u201cshall specify the grounds upon which the motion is made and the ground or grounds upon which it was granted.\u201d Rule 31 of the General Rules of Practice. A reading of the testimony convinces me that the discretion vested in the trial justice was not abused in setting aside the verdict upon the ground that it was contrary to the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">It is, however, well settled that when a verdict is thus set aside, it must be conditioned upon the payment of costs \"of trial and disbursements.

Supp. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The order will therefore be modified by requiring the defendant to pay costs of trial and disbursements to date, together with the costs of this appeal, and, in default of such payment, the order will be reversed and judgment directed upon the verdict, with costs and the costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
