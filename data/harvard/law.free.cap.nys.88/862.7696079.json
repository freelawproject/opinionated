What was meant by the substituted phrase \u201cby September 15th, or verj'- soon thereafter,\u201d and whether the plaintiff performed the contract in that respect, and delivered and set up the stone within the required time named in the contract, was therefore a question of fact to be determined by the trial court from the testimony and all the facts and circumstances of the case. Upon this question the court below found in favor of the defendant, and, there being sufficient testimony to uphold such finding, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
