The contention that summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent may not be-maintained by a landlord when the lease provides for re-entry is without basis in law, for the case of McMahon v. Howe, 40 Misc. Rep. 546, 82 N. Y. Supp. 984, so holding, has incorrectly interpreted the Court of Appeals in Michaels v. Fishel, 169 N. Y. 381, 62 N. E. 425, wherein it was determined merely that ejectment is the proper action for reentry, when the lease provides for re-entry and reletting, if posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>sion and right to a deficiency from reletting on account is sought; but, if possession is acquired by means of summary proceedings, the lease, and so the relation of landlord and tenant, is terminated, and the right to relet on account is lost. The final order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Final order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
