See section 29 of the stock corporation law (Laws 1892,.p. 1831, c. 688). Said section 29 provides that every corporation that shall neglect or refuse to keep or cause to be kept any book open for inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tion \u201cas herein required\u201d shall forfeit to the people the sum of $50 for every day it shall so neglect or refuse. But such section does not give to a stockholder such as the plaintiff any right to bring an action for a failure or refusal to keep said books. Such right of action is given only to the people of the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The action against the defendant Whitney, who is the secretary of the corporation who is the defendant in the first action, was brought under the last sentence of said section 29, which provides that if any officer or agent of any such corporation shall willfully neglect or refuse to make any proper entry in such books, or shall neglect or refuse to exhibit the same, or allow them to be inspected and extracts taken therefrom, as provided in said section, such officer or agent shall forfeit and pay to the party injured a penalty of $50 for every said neglect or refusal. As stated, the evidence shows that the book required by the first part of said section 29 was not kept by the corporation, and therefore the defendant Whitney, who was the secretary of the corporation, could not be said to have neglected or refused to exhibit a book that was not in existence at the time the demand for the inspection of the book was made upon him. It was said in Lozier v. Saratoga Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Company, 59 App. Div. 390, 69 N. Y. Supp. 247, that it could not have been intended that a servant of a corporation should be made liable for the penalty for failing to do what it was not within his power to do. To the same effect is Kennedy v. Chicago, etc., Pacific Railroad Company, 14 Abb. N. C. 326, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Judgments appealed from are reversed, and new trials Ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
