While lawfully in the yards of the defendant upon the morning of February 17, 1899, he was struck by the tender of a switch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>engine operated by the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. The claim of the plaintiff is that this engine proceeded down the track upon which he was employed without warning by whistle, bell, or light, and that he himself was free from contributory negligence. The defendant contends that its employ\u00e9s were free from negligence, and that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the plaintiff. This being the issue, the court defined the duty which the plaintiff owed to the defendant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u201cIt was the plaintiff\u2019s duty, gentlemen\u2014Mr. George Heck\u2019s duty\u2014to use the reasonable care of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances, which was his duty to look and listen for the approach of any train or engine upon the track at that time. If you find that he did not use such care, and that he was injured as the result of his lack of care, then your verdict will be for the defendant railroad company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The trial judge thereafter defined the duty which the defendant owed to the plaintiff in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cIt was the duty of the defendant, the railway company, and its employ\u00e9s in charge of this engine and tender, to use great care in running this engine and tender, and to give sufficient warning of its approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The court thereafter charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u201cIf you find that this defendant, the railway company, used such care in the operation of its engine and tender as I have stated to you was necessary, and that it gave sufficient warning of its approach, then you may find in this case a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">At the end of the charge the defendant\u2019s attorney noted the following exception:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u201cMr. Patterson: I except to that part of your honor\u2019s charge in which you state it was the duty of the defendant to use great care in the running of this engine and tender\u2014whatever your honor said upon that subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We are unable to see why this exception is not fatal to the judgment. It appeared in the evidence that the defendant company had a rule requiring its employ\u00e9s to use great care to avoid injury. The rule, however, which an employer gives to an employ\u00e9, cannot change the degree of care which the law requires from the employer to a stranger. The duty of the plaintiff was defined to be the reasonable care of a reasonably prudent person, while almost in juxtaposition to this the jury was told that the defendant\u2019s duty was to exercise great care for the plaintiff\u2019s protection. At no other point in the charge was the jury told that reasonable care was the measure of the defendant\u2019s duty, and the inference seems to be irresistible, under the instructions of the court, that a greater degree of care was required from the defendant toward the plaintiff than he was required to exercise in his own behalf. This error was distinctly pointed out in the exception taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and for it we are of the opinion that the judgment and order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">In Leonard v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 57 App. Div. 125, 67 N. Y. Supp. 985, a charge was sustained which defined the duty of the defendant to exercise \u201ca very high degree of care.\u201d This case followed the authority of Koehne v. N. Y. &amp; Q. C. R. Co., 32 App. Div. 419, 52 N. Y. Supp. 1088. But those cases were both of them cases of injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to passengers to whom a railroad company owes a greater degree of care than to a stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
