Although evidence was introduced tending to show that the goods .were returned to the vendors, the acceptance of the goods by the plaintiffs in the former action was in no way involved in the issues presented in that case. The question in this case is one of possession, and the judgment in the former action is not a bar to a recovery here. Upon the evidence, however, we feel that the plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of proof upon the question of delivery. The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses-was contradictory, and in conflict with their testimony given on the former trial, and upon the whole case we think that the interests of justice require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
