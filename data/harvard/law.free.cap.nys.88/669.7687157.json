Section 139 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1533, c. 580) provides that no action shall be maintained in this court which arises on a written contract of conditional sale of personal property, a hiring of personal property when the title is not to vest in the person hiring until payment of a certain sum, or a chattel mortgage made to secure the purchase price of chattels, except in an action to foreclose a lien, as provided in this article. As this action is founded upon one of the instruments enu.merated in said section upon which no action can be begun .except to foreclose the lien created thereby, it follows that the action should have been dismissed upon that ground.
