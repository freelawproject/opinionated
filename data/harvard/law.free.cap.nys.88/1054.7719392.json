Its application to the former District Courts of the City of New York and the present Municipal Court depended entirely upon the operation and effect of section 1347 of the consolidation act (chapter 410, p. 349, Laws 1882). This last section was expressly repealed by section 364 of the Municipal Court act (chapter 580, p. 1595, Laws 1902). It follows that the power of the Municipal Court to direct the service of bills of particulars is no longer governed by section 2942 of the Code, but by section 145, p. 1534, of the Municipal Court act, which, unlike section 2942 of the Code, does not limit the time for making an order for a bill of particulars to the time of joining issue. The time afforded by the justice was rather short, but no objection was made by defendants on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">The allegations of the answer do not correspond with the terms of the written lease. The plaintiffs did not agree to \u201cgive entire possession and control of the premises, fully completed, on the 15th day of October, 1903, if possible, but not later than the 2d of November.\u201d All that plaintiffs agreed to was to give possession of the premises on the dates specified, but the lease is entirely silent as to how far they should then be completed. The term demised by the lease was not to begin until January 15th, and the only obligation as to preparedness assumed by plaintiffs was the implied one that the premises should then be completed and ready for occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">The appeal appears to be without merit, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
