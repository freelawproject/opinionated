Upon the trial there wag testimony given upon both sides as to the extent of the noises complained of; and whether they were of such a character and duration as to constitute an eviction, or whether they were of a kind that did not injuriously affect the enjoyment of the demised premises, became a question of fact to be determined by the trial judge (Hall v. Irvin, 78 App. Div. 107, 79 N. Y. Supp. 614), and, he having found upon that question, his decision cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
