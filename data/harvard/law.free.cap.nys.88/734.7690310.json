The suggestion was made in behalf of the proponents upon the argument that the requirements of section 2623 had been complied with, and therefore this court could not interfere, because it did appear to the learned surrogate that the testatrix at the time of executing the paper was in all respects competent to make a will. The phrase \u201cIf it appears,\u201d at the beginning of the section, however, is equivalent to a requirement that the fact of competency must be established by sufficient evidence; and, unless this requirement is complied with, probate should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In the Matter of Ramsdell\u2019s Will (Sup. Ct.) 3 N. Y. Supp. 499, the General Term of the Fifth Department (Barker, P. J., and Haight, Bradley, and Dwight, JJ.), said:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201cIt was incumbent on the proponents, in the first instance, to make prima facie proof of the competency of the deceased to make a will. Failing to do so, probate was properly denied. There was not only failure to make such proof in this case, but the evidence was to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">It seems to me equally true in the case at bar that there was not only failure to make prima facie proof of the competency of the testatrix to make a will, but that all the proof on that subject tended to a contrary conclusion. The will in question was executed at the city of Yonkers on the 5th day of October, 1903, between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock in the evening. The testatrix was at the time confined to her bed by an illness which proved fatal 10 days later. She was too feeble to sign her name, and signed the paper by making her mark. Five persons were present: Mary S. Alexander, Frances R. Jones,, and Louisa B. Nelson, who subscribed their names to the will as witnesses ; Dr. Charles A. Miles, the physician in attendance on the testatrix, and John W. Alexander, the lawyer by whom the will appears to have been prepared, and who is the father of Mary S. Alexander. Only two of the five persons present were called to testify as to the circumstances under which the will was executed\u2014Mary S. Alexander and Frances R. Jones. Miss Alexander did not say a word in reference to the competency of Mrs. Goodwin. She testified that an earlier will had been signed by the testatrix, about 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, to which she and Miss -Jones had been witnesses; that in the evening the paper now propounded was in the sickroom; and that Mr. Alexander, the father of the witness, said that Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s signature on the will which was signed in the afternoon was so illegible that he thought it best to have her sign by mark, and he had made a copy of the will and brought it with him, and he then asked Mrs. Goodwin to sign by mark, saying to her, \u201cIt is an exact copy, Mrs. Goodwin, of the will made this afternoon.\u201d Mrs. Goodwin then signed the will, the witness standing beside her and holding the pen. Miss Alexander further testified that she then asked Mrs. Goodwin if she -declared that to be her last will and testament, and if she requested Mrs. Nelson, Miss Jones, and herself to act as witnesses, and that she said \u201cYes,\u201d and they then all signed in her presence- and in the presence of each other. The statement of Mr. Alexander that the propounded paper was a copy of the will previously signed is not shown to be the fact, nor does it appear from any evidence in the case that either will had ever been read to or by the testatrix, or that she had any actual knowledge of the contents of either paper. Miss Frances R. Jones, the other witness to the will, who was examined orally in behalf of the proponent, says that Mrs. Goodwin\u2019s response to Miss Alexander was neither \u201cYes\u201d nor \u201cNo,\u201d but merely a mumble, and that she could not say whether it was expressive of assent or dissent. Miss Jones was a trained nurse in charge of the sick woman, having been in attendance from the 29th of September, 1903, and remaining until the death of the testatrix. She. testified that in her opinion Mrs. Goodwin was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>not of sound mind and memory on the 5th day of October when the mark was made by her upon the propounded paper. She explained this statement by saying that she meant that Mrs. Goodwin was under the influence of bromide, and was so far under the influence of drugs that she had not control of her mind. \u201cAt times,\u201d said the witness, \u201cshe would .have possession of her mental faculties, and then almost immediately it was gone.\u201d She also describes the testatrix as being much of the time in a drowsy condition. \u201cThese drowsy states,\u201d she says, \u201cwere something that occurred most of the time. She lay in that state most of the time. When she was in that condition it was necessary to arouse her to get her attention before she would understand and act.\u201d She also stated that two nights before the will was made, and the night after the will was made, the testatrix was delirious and talked at random. The physical condition of Mrs. Goodwin at the very time of the execution of the instrument was such that she was unable to control the exercise of her bodily functions, and Miss Jones called the attention of Dr. Miles, just before she signed bier name as witness to the will, to the fact that the bed was wet with the urine of the patient involuntarily discharged. I have not undertaken to state all the evidence in the case bearing upon the question of the competency of this lady to make a will, but, considering it all together, I cannot resist the conclusion that its tendency is to establish her incompetency rather than the reverse. It is true there is no proof as to the quantity of bromide administered to the patient, or as to what quantity is necessary to produce a given effect upon the mental condition of a person to whom that drug is administered. Nevertheless, such proof as there is on the subject is the testimony of a qualified trained nurse, expressive of her opinion as an expert that a sufficient quantity of bromide had been taken by Mrs. Goodwin to deprive her of sound mind and memory, and as against this there is nothing. If the conclusion of the witness was incorrect in this respect, it would have been easy to controvert it, and yet three persons who saw the patient and could have testified as to her condition were not called as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">I think that the appellants are entitled to a reversal of the decree, under section 3588 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and to an order directing the trial by a jury of the question of the competency of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Westchester county reversed, and proceeding remitted for trial before a jury on the question of the competency of the testatrix. All concur; HIRSCHBERG, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
