Upon her failure, and after she was in default two months in filing the security, the defendant made a motion to dismiss her complaint, with costs of the action and of his motion. Upon an or'der to show cause, the plaintiff thereafter moved for leave to discontinue the action, after tendering to the defendant\u2019s attorney $10 costs, and a stipulation of discontin\u00faance, which the latter refused to sign. Both motions were heard by the County Court at the same time, and resulted in the order appealed from, which denied, without costs, the motion to dismiss the complaint, and directed that leave be granted to' the plaintiff to discontinue upon the payment of $25 within 10 days after service of a copy of the order. The defendant has appealed, and urges upon us that, inasmuch as the case was an action at law, plaintiff could discontinue only upon payment of all the taxable costs to the date of the motion. This Appellate Division, however, in National Wall Paper Co. v. Szerlip, 9 App. Div. 206, 41 N. Y. Supp. 376, has held the contrary. It is there said:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">\u201cThe terms or condition on which the plaintiff\u2019s application should be granted was addressed to the discretion of the County .Court, and, leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>being given to discontinue the action, the defendant\u2019s right to costs was derived. from the order. Overton v. Nat. Bank of Auburn, 3 N. Y. St. Rep. 169; De Barante v. Deyermand, 41 N. Y. 355. While it may be usual to require the payment of all accrued costs, as a condition of allowing the discontinuance of an action on plaintiff\u2019s application, there may be cases where reasons appear to the court for imposing more moderate terms as to costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
