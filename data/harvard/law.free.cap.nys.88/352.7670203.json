The justice had the benefit of an opportunity to judge from the plaintiff\u2019s manner and appearance whether he was entitled to be believed. Under such circumstances, we should, in any case, be slow to reverse a determination deliberately arrived at. ' Even on the face of the evidence there are certain peculiarities which tend to justify the judgment. \u2022 According to the plaintiff and his physician, the injuries were very serious\u2014much more so, indeed, than would ordinarily result from such an accident as the plaintiff describes. Notwithstanding'the nature of the injuries, and the fact that one of the attorneys is the plaintiff\u2019s nephew, it did not occur to plaintiff to sue at all 'until several weeks after the accident, and then he contented himself with bringing suit for less than $250\u2014a most inadequate amount of damages for such injuries as he says he suffered. On the whole, we find no reason for reversing the judgment, which is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
