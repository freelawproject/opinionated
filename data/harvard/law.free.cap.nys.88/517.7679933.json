The plaintiff complains that the inn \u201cwas carelessly and negligently maintained,\u201d inasmuch as the defendant \u201cnegligently and carelessly permitted the window and its appliances in room 107 to become defective, worn, and rotten, and otherwise out of repair,\u201d and that \u201cby reason of the defective, worn, and rotten condition of the window and of its appliances, and solely owing to -said condition, the window fell,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant or his servants knew, or had reason to know, that the said window and its appliances were, defective, worn,,and rotten and otherwise out of repair, but omitted to repair' the same,\u201d and that \u201csuch defective, worn, and rotten condition was not observable by ordinary and reasonable inspection thereof, but was well known, or should have been well known, to the defendant, but' was- not known to the plaintiff.\u201d It is not alleged in what respect the window or its appliances were defective, worn, rotten, or otherwise out of repair. The moving affidavit states that the defendant has the entire management of the hotel, and that he is completely ignorant that there is any need of repair, and that he has interviewed all of his 150 employes Who would be likely to have been near the room, of whom all advise him that they knew of no defect or anything defective, worn, rotten, or otherwise out of repair, or aught to cause a suspicion of such a condition. He further deposes that immediately after the accident he examined the window and its appliances, and could not find any defect or any need of repair or change in window or appliances, other than a new cord. The opposing affidavit states that the defendant, being in possession, was in a better position to know the condition of the window than the plaintiff, that .the -defendant\u2019s own servants were present shortly after the accident and released the plaintiff, and that his workmen afterwards repaired the window, that plaintiff\u2019s case must be elicited from defendant\u2019s employes, presumably hostile witnesses, and that the plaintiff cannot give the'specific defects at this time, because such witnesses have not been interrogated on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">We think that, under the authority of our decision in Robinson v. Stewart, 84 App. Div. 594, 82 N. Y. Supp. 928, the motion should have been granted in part, namely, that the defendant should be apprised as to the respects in which the window and its appliances were defective, worn, and rotten, and the window was out of repair, and in what respects the inn was negligently and carelessly main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>tained, so that the defendant negligently and carelessly permitted the window and its appliances to become defective, worn, and rotten, and otherwise out of repair, so as to be dangerous to life, limb, and person, and that the time of the accident should be stated. The showing of the plaintiff that she cannot now \u201cgive the specific defects of the window,\u201d if thereby she intends to state that she is ignorant to the extent that she cannot in advance of the trial give such intimation as the bill requires, is no reason for withholding the bill. For a plaintiff who does not rely upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is bound to establish a prima facie case of negligence; if he cannot show how he expects to establish his case, how can he recover in the action? See O\u2019Hara v. Ehrich (Super. N. Y.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion should be granted to the extent indicated in this opinion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
