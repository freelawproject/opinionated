Clarke, 165 N. Y. 420, 425, 59 N. E. 202), and we are clearly of opinion that it was error to dismiss the complaint. There was evidence from which the jury might properly have found that the plaintiff was a passenger upon one of the defendant\u2019s street surface railroad cars; that, while she was quietly sitting in the middle of the qar,and without negligence on her part, \u00f1ames and smoke appeared in various parts of the car, creating a panic among the passengers; that she, with others, attempted to leave the car\u2014some through the windows, and others by means of the door\u2014and that, while thus endeavoring to escape from what appeared to be a menace to their safety, the plaintiff fell or was pushed down, receiving injuries of a more or less serious character. It is true that her complaint alleged that, \u201cbelieving herself in great peril, and to save her life, jumped from said car, and fell upon the ground, and was thereby severely bruised,\u201d etc., while the evidence developed that she did not recollect what occurred in the rush, and one of her witnesses testified that she fell upon the platform of the car; but this did \u201cnot change substantially the claim or defense,\u201d and the pleadings might very properly have been deemed amended, to conform to the facts proved, under the provisions of section 723 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In all other respects we are unable to distinguish this case from that of Poulsen v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 18 App. Div. 221, 45 N. Y. Supp. 941; and Poulsen v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 30 App. Div 246, 51 N. Y. Supp. 933, and this requires a reversal of the judgment. The views of the court in Weiler v. Manhattan Railway Co., 53 Hun, 372, 6 N. Y. Supp. 320, where the duty of the defendant was that only of ordinary care, are applicable to the facts developed in this case\u2014particularly the comment at page 375, 53 Hun, page 322, 6 N. Y. Supp.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; \" costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
