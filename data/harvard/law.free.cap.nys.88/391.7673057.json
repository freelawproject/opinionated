It nowhere appears how much was advanced on account of the sum of $15 per week, or what sum was advanced for traveling expenses. The whole $499 may have been advanced for traveling expenses. In Schlesinger v. Burland, 42 Misc. Rep. 206, 85 N. Y. Supp. 350, it was held that a contract of employment as a salesman at a certain commission, the employer to \u201cadvance\u201d the salesman a certain sum monthly, \u201csaid advances to be charged and deducted from the c'ommissions * * * computed at the end of the period of employment,\u201d did not create a pergonal liability on the part of the salesman to repay the advances in excess of commissions earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs, with leave to the appellant to amend the complaint and plead anew on payment of costs in the court below and in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
