Upon oral pleadings, apparently, and upon conflicting testimony respecting the buying and selling of a restaurant and business, the trial justice found in favor of the plaintiff, and his determination calls for no interference, particularly as the earlier or first lease of the premises, under which, as claimed, \u201cthe place\u201d was to be transferred, contained a clause against underletting by the lessee of the whole or any part without the written consent of the lessor, and consent was not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
