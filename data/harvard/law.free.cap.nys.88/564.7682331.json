Subsequently this order was vacated, and an order granted directing the resumption of the payments by the respondent to the appellant. An appeal was taken to this court from the latter order, and resulted in an affirmance upon the argument. In re White (Sup.) 81 N. Y. Supp. 858. The order now appealed from grants the respondent\u2019s motion for a stay of proceedings under the order so affirmed, and under the order of affirmance, pending an appeal from the latter to the Court of Appeals by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">No allowance of such appeal has been granted by this court, and the order is not appealable to the Court of Appeals as matter of right.
