There is no counterclaim in the action, and the amount of damages, if any, sustained by the defendant, was not proved on the trial. It was therefore not error for the court to refuse to charge, as requested by the defendant, that the defendant was entitled to have furnished and supplied to him materials of good, substantial character and workmanship, because, under the pleadings and the evidence, that proposition was only an academic one.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
