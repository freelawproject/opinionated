The sole point upon which the appellant relies in asking us to reverse judgment is that Mr. Denslow was never served with the summons, and that the only service thereof was in fact made upon one George B. Chase, a bookkeeper in the employ of the Sterling Piano Company. If this be the truth, \u2022 however, the return from the Municipal Court fails to show it. The return does contain papers from which it appears that after the judgment had been obtained the defendant moved to open its default upon affidavits from Mr. Denslow and Mr. Chase, but it is to be observed that, while these affidavits aver that the summons in this action was served upon Mr. Chase, they nowhere allege that it was not served upon Mr. Denslow, the president of corporation; and it would have been necessary to convince the Municipal Court of the truth of the latter proposition in order to require it to open the default and set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Attached to the appellant\u2019s brief are several affidavits, verified a day or two before the argument of the appeal, which contain statements tending strongly to show that process in this suit was never served upon the defendant corporation in the manner required by law, but the appellate court cannot take cognizance of the contents of these affidavits in the first instance. They should have been presented to the Municipal Court upon a motion to open the default and vacate the judgment upon the ground that the defendant had never been properly served; and, if that application had failed, this court woulid have had jurisdiction to review the order denying it upon appeal. New York Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, pp. 1562, 1563, c. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 253-257). As,this record stands, however, it contains nothing which would justify us in interfering with the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Judgment of the Municipal Court affirmed, with costs.
