People ex rel. Tuthill v. Russell, 25 Hun, 524; Berry v. Schaad, 50 App. Div. 132, 63 N. Y. Supp, 349. It is true that by section 295 of the Municipal Court act (chapter 580, p. 1574, Gaws 1902) it is necessary to show as a condition of maintaining an action against a surety on such a bond that a judgment has been recovered against the marshal, and execution issued and returned wholly or partially unsatisfied, and leave given to prosecute- the bond. The act, however, does not declare that the judgment against the marshal shall be evidence against the surety of anything more than the fact that such a judgment has been obtained. As to the ultimate fact whether or not the marshal has been guilty of misconduct, the surety is entitled to his day in court, and an opportunity to litigate. The distinction between such a bond as is involved in this action and one whereby the surety undertakes that the principal shall comply with an order or judgment of the court is clearly pointed out in People ex rel. Tuthill v. Russell, supra. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>plaintiff offered no proof of the marshal\u2019s misconduct except the judgment roll in the action against him. As that was insufficient, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
