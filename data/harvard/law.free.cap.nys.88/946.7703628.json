She testified that she notified the defendant of her loss and the substitution on the day following, and that he refused to make her damage good. The evidence submitted for the defendant tended to show that he had satisfied his duties as bailee by the exercise of ordinary care. Whether or not the defendant duly excused himself was properly left to the jury, for, \u201cwhere agreement of storage and the receipt of goods has been admitted, and evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>given to support failure to deliver, a prima facie case of negligence has been made out.\u201d Mautner v.
