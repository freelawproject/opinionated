Under the provisions of the Municipal Court act we have held that, when a defendant has permitted a judgment to be taken against him by default, no appeal lies therefrom, the remedy being to move to open such default under section 253 (Laws 1902, p. 1562, c. 580). Brown v. Bouse (Sup.) 86 N. Y. Supp. 240; Edelson v. Epstein (Sup.) 58 N. Y. Supp. 334. The defendant herein made a motion to open her default, which was granted upon terms. Under section 257 no appeal lies in the first instance from an order opening a default and vacating a judgment entered thereon. It would seem that under the provisions of the Municipal Court act as it now stands the defendant, who has suffered a default judgment to be entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>against him, and upon motion been allowed to open such default, has no remedy but to comply with the terms imposed as a condition for such favor granted, and proceed to \u00e1 trial of his action. We have, however, examined the record herein to the extent of enabling us to say that the terms imposed in this case as conditions upon which the defendant\u2019s default should be opened-were not an abuse of discretion in the trial court, but were in fact reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
