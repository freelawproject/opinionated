The defendant afforded to its passengers a safe means of passing from the boat to the mainland; one which had been.used on this and other ferries for many years, and had never been found dangerous or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">The justice should not have allowed the amendment of the complaint alleging insufficient lighting as an act of negligence. It introduced what was substantially a new cause of action, and was evidently an afterthought. The plaintiff made but a feeble attempt to sustain this plea, and a verdict certainly could not have been predicated upon it, yet its introduction into the case may have affected the jury in reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">The motion to dismiss the complaint 'should have been granted, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
