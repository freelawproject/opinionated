As he did refuse to strike the evidence out, we are bound to presume that he included the amount in the sum for which he gave judgment. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>plaintiff will within 10 days stipulate to reduce the judgment by $50, the judgment as so modified will be affirmed, without costs; otherwise it must be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
