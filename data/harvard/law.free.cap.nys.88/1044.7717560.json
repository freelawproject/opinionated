This was not cured .by the general allegation permitted- by section 533 of the Code of Civil Procedure, because the word \u201cduly\u201d\u2014 a word of substance,.not of form, was omitted (Clemens v. American Fire Ins. Co., 70 App. Div. 435, 75 N. Y. Supp. 484)\u2014nor by any interlineation of that word in the original amended complaint, for it is recognized \u201cthat a defendant has a right to consider the complaint which is served upon him or his attorney as that alone which he is required to answer, and that it is upon the issues raised by his answer to this complaint that the cause is to be tried.\u201d Trowbridge v. Didier, 4 Duer, 448, 450. Therefore the motion by the defendant, at the opening, to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, was proper, and was saved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>by his exception to its denial. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
