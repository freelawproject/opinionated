Y., known as his homestead, and being unable to personally visit his said property on Fifth avenue and' Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets to collect his rents or to supervise the care thereof, has permitted the defendant to collect the rents thereof for this plaintiff, to be accounted for and paid over to this plaintiff, and has also permitted defendant to attend to the -repairs upon said premises for plaintiff; and the defendant has, as plaintiff is informed and believes, collected the-rents of said premises for plaintiff, and has paid over or pretended to pay over to this plaintiff the rents as collected by defendant for plaintiff.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-16\">[\u201c(4) That defendant represented to plaintiff that it was to the interest of plaintiff to execute a certain paper relating to a lease of a portion of plaintiff\u2019s said real estate, with which said Freed had some connection, and said defendant did state to plaintiff that he was, in plaintiff\u2019s behalf, conducting negotiations in reference thereto, and to the terms and conditions thereof; and plaintiff stated to defendant the terms upon which he would sign such paper, and defendant did on or about the 3d day of February, 1904, inform plaintiff that said terms were satisfactory to the other party, and that he (defendant) would have such paper prepared, and would bring the same to plaintiff for execution. That thereafter, and on or about the 6th day of February, 1904, the defendant brought to plaintiff a paper which defendant told plaintiff was' the said paper relating to such lease, and requested plaintiff to sign the same; and plaintiff, believing the said statements of defendant, and relying thereupon, and having trust and confidence in defendant, did sign such paper without carefully reading the same, and did intrust the same to defendant, believing and supposing it to relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>such lease and nothing else.] That the aforesaid statements by defendant to plaintiff, and each of them, were, and were well known to defendant to. be, false and untrue. That the paper so signed by plaintiff had nothing to do with a lease, but was in fact an assignment to said Edward W. Day, this defendant, of the aforesaid bond and mortgage upon the property of said Freed, and was well known to defendant so to be; and said false statements were deliberately and designedly and fraudulently made by the defendant to plaintiff as aforesaid for the purpose and with the intent of deceiving him into signing said assignment, supposing it to be another and different paper, and in order to defraud plaintiff of his rights as the owner and holder of said bond and mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">\u201c(5) That plaintiff did not discover said fraud so \"practiced upon him until the Hth day of February, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">\u201c(6) That on the 11th day of February, 1804, the defendant caused to be recorded in the office of the register of the county of Kings, at 12:55 p. m\u201e the aforesaid paper so signed by plaintiff as aforesaid, and which purports to be dated February 3, 1904, and acknowledged February 6, 1904, and which was so recorded and indexed in section 4, block 1047, of Mortgages, and which purports to assign to defendant the aforesaid bond and mortgage made and executed as aforesaid by said Philip Freed and wife to this plaintiff. [And plaintiff alleges, upon information and belief, that defendant falsely and fraudulently procured the publication of the record of such assignment of said bond and mortgage to be made in the newspapers under the names of \u2018E. P. Pey to E. W.

White, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-12\">WILLARD BARTLETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfTg\">The learned judge at Special Term complaint as a \u201crigmarole.\u201d it was justly subject to criticism in its original form, it has hardly been improved by the effect of the order under review. As drawn by the pleader, it was at least intelligible, though perhaps not artistic. As left by the court at Special Term, it is meaningless. After striking out all allegations as to what representations were made by the defendant to the plaintiff, the court has allowed the averment to stand to the effect \u201cthat the aforesaid statements by defendant to plaintiff, and each of them, were, and were well known to defendant to be, false and untrue.\u201d There is nothing left in the preceding part of the complaint to which this averment can refer. The power conferred by section 545 of the Code of Civil Procedure to strike out irrelevant or redun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>dant matter could not have been intended to extend so far as to produce such an extraordinary pleading as its exercise has effected in the present case. If the complaint states even the semblance of a cause of action, that semblance may not be destroyed by striking out matter under this section. See Hagerty v. Andrews, 94 N. Y. 195. Allegations in a pleading should not be stricken out as irrelevant or redundant when the portions left consist of allegations which, standing alone, are unintelligible. See Collins v. Coggill, 7 Rob. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The order should be reversed, except so. far as it strikes out the last- allegation of paragraph 7 of the complaint, which has no relevancy to the cause of action attempted to be set out, either as matter of pleading or matter of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Order modified in accordance with opinion of BARTLETT, J., and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
