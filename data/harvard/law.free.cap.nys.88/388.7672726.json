Plaintiff boarded an open south-bound car with her little daughter and son, and paid 10 cents car fare, and received two transfers from defendant\u2019s conductor, for purpose of transferring to a Twenty-Third street cross-town car. At the south side of Twenty-Third street and Second avenue the car came to a full stop, and plaintiff started to alight, and, before she had completely left the car, the car started forward, and she was thrown to the street.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b408-13\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.

In one place the plaintiff testifies that she did not know where the conductor was when she attempted to get off. Afterwards she said that the conductor was standing on the running board of the car, near the front, and in front of plaintiff, and was looking downtown, so that she saw only the back of his head. This testimony is quite inconsistent with any knowledge on the conductor\u2019s part that plaintiff intended to get off the car. The plaintiff thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>wholly failed to show notice to the conductor, either in the particular manner alleged in the complaint, or in any other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
