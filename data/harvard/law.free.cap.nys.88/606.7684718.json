In the present case the petition upon which the application is based, verified by the wife, makes out a case which entitled her to an award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>of alimony, unless the same was completely overthrown by the opposing papers. The fact that plaintiff\u2019s attorney has chosen to lug in and connect with his application a mass of irrelevant and scandalous matter does not operate to destroy the averments of the petition. It may be that the plaintiff will be defeated in her action, but the court should not try or determine such question upon affidavits. Kennedy v. Kennedy, 73 N. Y. 369. As the obligation in this case rests upon the husband to support the wife, and as the averments of her petition show that she has not forfeited that right, it was incumbent upon the court to make some provision therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We think the order should, therefore, be reversed, and the alimony be fixed at $6 per week, payment to begin with the date of the entry of the order. No counsel fees and no costs of this appeal are allowed to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
