Ever since Mott v. Consumers\u2019 Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543, it is true, the rule has been well settled and enforced in a number of cases that.for the acts of the servant, within the general scope of his employment, while engaged in liis master\u2019s business, and done with a view to the furtherance of that business and the master\u2019s interest, the master will be responsible, whether the act be done negligently, wantonly, or even willfully. , But in every case the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of evidence that the servant acted within the general scope of his authority. Apparent authority, is' not enough. McGrath v. Michaels, 80 App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Div. 458, 81 N. Y. Supp. 109. The case at bar is in its essential features identical with Feneran v. Singer Mfg. Co., 20 App. Div. 574, 47 N. Y. Supp. 284, and under the decision of that case the evidence in the present case was insufficient to authorize the submission of the issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
