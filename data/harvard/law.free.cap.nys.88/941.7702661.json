Bopp v. N. Y. Electric Vehicle Co., 78 App. Div. 337, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1035. Even assuming that the facts testified to were at one time sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction, for defense they were ineffectual, for \u201cwhere the right to abandon premises exists the tenant must remove with reasonable promptitude after the circumstances creating the eviction arise, and, if he fails to do s\u00f3, his right to repudiate the hiring is lost.\u201d Seaboard Realty Co. v. Fuller, 33 Misc. Rep. 109, 111, 67 N. Y. Supp. 146, 147. The verdict was therefore properly directed, and the judgment entered thereon must be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.
