The car did not stop, however, at Forty-Fourth street, and she did not notice that she had passed the place until her attention was called to it by a lady sitting next to her, when she signaled the conductor to stop the car. The car. was stopped at the north corner of Forty-Sixth street, and, as she stepped down onto the running board to alight, the conductor' said to her, \u201cGet off quick,\u201d and he pulled the strap before she had time to alight, and the car started and threw her to the pavement, cutting and otherwise bruising her, and rendering her unconscious. Plaintiff produced no other witness besides herself to testify as to how the accident occurred. The defense produced two witnesses who claimed to have seen the accident\u2014one, a lawyer who was sitting on the front porch of a house opposite where the accident occurred; and the other, a policeman who was patrolling his beat. The block between Forty-Sixth and Forty-Seventh streets is 200 feet in length, and the witness Hopkins resided at 491 Lexington avenue, which was about midway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>in the block. He testified that he was sitting upon the stoop of this house. , That he heard a scream, and, looking up, saw a woman in the act of falling from a moving car, and that she fell to the street, about opposite the next house. After she had fallen, Dr. Duncan, who had an office in No. 493, came out, and the plaintiff was assisted to his stoop. That witness got a glass of vichy for the woman, and she remained there until the ambulance came and took her away. That, before leaving, a policeman came, to whom the witness gave his name. The policeman testified: That on the night in question he was at Forty-Sixth street, when he saw the plaintiff \u201cwalk off the car in the middle of the block above. The car was moving nearly at the regular rate of speed.\u201d He immediately went to the place, and assisted a citizen in removing her to a stoop, which the witness thought was 491. That a doctor came, who had an office close by. In the meantime the witness obtained from plaintiff her name, age, occupation, where she was born, and where she lived. That she answered all the questions, and was not unconscious at any time while he saw her. That he sent a telephone call for an ambulance, which came and took her away. The conductor had left the employ of the defendant, and it was proved upon the trial that efforts to find him for the purpose of calling him as a witness were unavailing, and that his whereabouts could pot be located. The plaintiff admitted that she was taken upon the stoop of a house below Forty-Sixth street, where she claimed she was attended by a priest, when she fainted away, and woke in the Flower Hospital. The witness Hopkins testified that he saw no priest present while the plaintiff was upon the stoop. In several other respects plaintiff was contradicted in her story.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We are of opinion that this judgment should be reversed for the reason that the verdict upon which it is based is against the preponderance of credible testimony. The plaintiff is deeply interested in the result. The witnesses called for the defendant are of character and standing, and have no interest whatever in connection with this transaction. The story which they tell agrees exactly with the conceded facts, and there is nothing aside from the unsupported statement of the plaintiff which in the slightest degree tends to destroy the force of such testimony. We therefore conclude that the plaintiff has not successfully borne the burden placed upon her of establishing by a fair preponderance of evidence the elements of the cause of action which she was required to establish, and under such circumstances this court has not hesitated to set the judgment aside as against the fair weight of the evidence. Schroder v. Met. Street Ry. Co., 87 App. Div. 624, 84 N. Y. Supp. 371; Clancy v. Yonkers R. R. Co., 88 App. Div. 612, 84 N. Y. Supp. 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except O\u2019BRIEN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b659-7\">O\u2019BRIEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An7\">I dissent from the conclusion reached by the majority of the court. Upon the facts, the question presented for the consideration of the jury was whether, while the plaintiff was attempting to alight from a car which had stopped pursuant to a sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>nal, it was suddenly started, so as to throw her off, or whether, as testified by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, while the car was in motion she stepped off. As against the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, two witnesses were examined for the defendant, one of whom testified that while sitting on a stoop he heard a scream, and, on looking up, he saw the plaintiff falling from the car, which was then moving. There is nothing inconsistent in this with the plaintiff\u2019s story, because her version was that she was thrown while the car was moving. They differ as to the rate of speed at which the car was going, but, upon the question as to whether the car did or did not stop at Forty-Sixth street, we have not only the plaintiff\u2019s testimony to that effect, but this particular witness said that he thought the car did stop at Forty-Sixth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The piece of evidence upon which the majority of the court have placed their conclusion that the verdict is against the weight of evidence is that given by the two witnesses to the effect that the place at which the plaintiff was thrown was some 60 or 70 feet north of the corner. I do not regard this as of so very much importance, because, if the car stopped at Forty-Sixth street; and, while in the act of alighting, the plaintiff was .thrown, it might be that the car had gone the short distance of 60 feet before she fell; . or the car might have stopped some distance north of Forty-Sixth street, and, though the plaintiff was mistaken as to the exact point at which the car stopped, the crucial question was whether the car did or did not stop, and, while the plaintiff was in the act of alighting, start up again. As I have pointed out, one of the witnesses for the defendant corroborates the plaintiff upon the stopping of the car at or somewhere north of Forty-Sixth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The other witness for the defendant\u2014a police officer\u2014swears positively that the plaintiff stepped off the car while it was going at full speed. The probability of such a hazardous undertaking by a woman impeded with skirts\u2014a feat which would have been dangerous even for a man not so impeded\u2014apart from the plaintiff\u2019s contradiction, would be for the jury. As said in Bente v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 90 App. Div. 214, 86 N. Y. Supp. 85, with respect to similar testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u201cA police officer also testified that when the plaintiff fell the car was moving, which is quite consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, as she says she fell because of the sudden start of the car, and the officer does not testify that the car had not stopped before the plaintiff fell as she attempted to get off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">I think that the. question was, upon the conflicting testimony, one for the jury, and the evidence did not so clearly preponderate in favor of the defendant\u2019s version that we would be justified in interfering with the verdict. I am therefore for affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
