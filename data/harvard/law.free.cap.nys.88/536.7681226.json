A resolution adopted by the council relative to a sewerage disposal plant provided that engineers supervising the construction thereof may call on the department of public works for assistance. <em>Held </em>that, as the assistance was to be furnished from the existing employ\u00e9s of the commissioner of public works, an employ\u00e9 of the commissioner, who sent from the employ\u00e9s of his private office, and not from the city employ\u00e9s, certain engineering assistants, could not recover for the expenditures incurred in furnishing them, though he acted in good faith, and the city received the benefits from the expenditure, and though the commissioner did not have a sufficient force to furnish the required help.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b556-9\">Appeal from Special Term, Westchester County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-10\">Action by George Drumheller against the city of Mt.

It may be presumed that he acted at a fixed compensation, and,, with other employ\u00e9s of the commissioner, wa's paid from a fund appropriated for the defraying of the expenses incident to the performance of the duties devolved upon that official. That the latter had not unlimited power to subject the city to such expenses as he saw fit for the salaries and wages of his subordinates is inferable from section 122 of the charter of the city (chapter 182, p. 380, Laws 1892), which provides as follows: \u201cThe said commissioner of public works shall have the power to employ such men as may be required to perform any public work not done by contract, and to discharge them, the number to be employed at any one time to be subject to the direction and control of the common council.\u201d A resolution, of the common council passed August 6, 1901, relative to a sewerage disposal plant, and the employment of Snow &amp; Barber, sanitary engineers, to design and supervise the construction thereof, provided, among other things, as follows: \u201cThe said city to co-operate with the said Snow <em>&amp; </em>Barber by furnishing such data and requisite assistance from the department of public works and city engineer, and other city departments, as the said engineers may call for, the services of \u2019the corporation counsel, and such labor and material, and tools, as may be needed in digging test pits, and other work, where ordinary labor and tools are required.\u201d Requisition having been made by Snow &amp; Barber upon the commissioner for engineering assistants, the plaintiff, with the knowledge and consent of the commissioner, furnished such assistants from his private office force, and not from his assistants in the city\u2019s employ, and his disbursements for their wages, amounting to 8765, having been presented to, and disallowed by, the common council, he now brings this action to recover the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-14\">A fair construction of the resolution of the common council leads to the conclusion, that.it was contemplated that the engineering assistance to Snow &amp; Barber was to be furnished from the then existing employ\u00e9s of the commissioner. This view is confirmed by the language of section 122, above cited, which makes the number of the commissioners\u2019 employ\u00e9s \u201csubject to the direction and control of the common council.\u201d To hold that the plaintiff can recover in this action, and upon the ground of alleged equities arising in his favor, because he has acted in good faith, and the city has had the benefit of his expenditures, would be to nullify the salutary provisions of the section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>throw down the bar erected thereby, and make the commissioner quite independent of the common council in the employment of his subordinates and the payment of their compensation. There would thus be no limitation upon the commissioner\u2019s power to obligate the city. That the engineering force of the commissioner was insufficient at the time, because of the pressure of other public work, did not justify the assumption of power to employ additional assistants, for it would have been but a simple matter for him to have brought the situation to the attention of the common council, and left its solution with that body. It must also be presumed that the plaintiff acted with full knowledge of the provisions of section 122 of the charter, which thus prescribed the question of power in his superior, and therefore his claim that the employment of additional assistants was a mere irregularity in municipal procedure cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-5\">There should be judgment for the defendant, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b557-6\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.
