Upon the return of the order to show cause, and before the hearing, the plaintiff made a preliminary objection that the moving papers did not comply with rule 37 of the General Rules of Practice, which provides that these matters must be stated. The. objection was good, and should have been sustained. Cole v. Smith, 84 App. Div. 500, 82 N. Y. Supp. 982. Apart, therefore, from the merits, which we do not pass upon, we think the motion to vacate the warrant of attachment for failure to comply with the rules of practice was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">The order appealed from should accordingly be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
