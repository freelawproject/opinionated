The application, a copy of which appeared on the back of the policy, which the plaintiff put in evidence, contained a statement that the insured had \u201cnever been under treatment in any dispensary, hospital, or asylum, nor been an inmate of any almshouse or other institution, except two years ago, rheumatism, Mt. Sinai Dispensary.\u201d The plaintiff herself admitted on cross-examination that in 1901 her husband, the insured, had been at the Presbyterian Hospital for three days for treatment of his arm, and defendant\u2019s proofs tended to establish the\" same fact. To avoid the effect of this, the plaintiff, after both sides had rested, moved to strike out the physician\u2019s testimony. This motion having been denied, she was permitted, over defendant\u2019s objection, to give evidence tending to prove that the insured never signed the application for the policy. Both sides practically acnuiesced in the theory of the case, as presented to the jury, that, if the insured did make the application, the proofs showed a breach of warranty. In allowing such proof, the trial court clearly committed error. Plaintiff was concluded by her own evidence from establishing this fact. She had herself offered in evidence, and her case rested upon, the policy and claim of loss. The former recited that it was issued \u201cin consideration of the statements in the printed and written application for this policy, a copy of which is hereto annexed, all of which are hereby made warranties and part of this contract,\u201d and the copy of the application is marked, \u201c[Signed] Michael J. Barry.\u201d In the latter plaintiff herself states in answer to question 20, \u201cWho made application for this insurance? State name and relationship\u201d: \u201cDeceased himself.\u201d Having asserted her contract, she could not attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the basis and consideration for it, which she herself proved to support it. Beyond what has been said, she wholly failed in establishing the fact that her husband did not sign the application. Her testimony merely proved that on the occasion of the doctor\u2019s visit at their home her husband signed no paper. Non constat that at some other time and at some other place he did sign it. The original application was not brought into court with proof either that there was no signature annexed thereto or that the signature was not that of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
