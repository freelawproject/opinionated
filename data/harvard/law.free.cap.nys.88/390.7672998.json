The defendant O\u2019Brien defaulted upon the trial, and the defendant Wilkes appeared, and filed a written answer. His defense was that on April 23, 1903, the copartnership theretofore existing between himself and his codefendant, O\u2019Brien was dissolved; that he notified all the creditors of said copartnership of such dissolution; that such information was given to the secretary of the plaintiff, \u201cwho expressed himself as being satisfied with said information, and who said that he would thereafter make no further claim for work, labor, and services performed by the plaintiff herein against the said Robert R. Wilkes, and that he would hold said defendant James P. O\u2019Brien responsible for all services performed by the plaintiff in behalf of the said copartnership business.\u201d The liability of the copartners for the work done was incurred prior to April 23, 1903, the time when Wilkes claimed the company was dissolved and the notification thereof given the plaintiff. The only testimony in the case tending to support the testimony of Wilkes that he had been relieved from liability was this, which occurred in a conversation between Wilkes and Goldman, plaintiff\u2019s secretary: \u201cQ. Was there any conversation about your being relieved from all responsibility? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did he say? A. He said, \u2018All right.\u2019\u201d This did not constitute a legal agreement to release Wilkes from liability. Bronx Metal Bed Co. v. Wallerstein (Sup.) 84 N. Y. Supp. 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Judgment as to Wilkes reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
