The attachment is attacked for the insufficiency of the allegations respecting the defendant\u2019s nonresidence and the extent of the damage sustained. The former is amply supported. Even if the two affidavits which are based on information and belief be rejected, notwithstanding that the sources of the information and the grounds of belief are set forth in reliable detail, the third affidavit, made on positive knowledge, would alone satisfy all requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">A more serious question arises with reference to the amount of damage which the plaintiff claims to have'suffered. Upon this subject there is nothing in the complaint except the allegations that the overflow caused \u201cthe said furniture to be damaged, spoiled, and made unfit for use or sale by the plaintiff company,\u201d and \u201cthrough the negligence of the defendant, as above set forth, the plaintiff company has suffered damage in the sum of six hundred dollars.\u201d The only other reference in the papers on attachment to the cause of action and extent of damage appears in the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s secretary, and is couched in this language: \u201cThat the said water flowed in such quantities, and for such a length of time, on the furniture of the plaintiff, as to make a large quantity of said furniture unfit for use and sale, and to seriously injure and damage the same; and that by reason of said negligence of the defendant the plaintiff company has been damaged in the sum of six hundred dollars.\u201d There is no indication anywhere how that damage is computed or arrived at. Neither the value of the furniture before nor after the overflow is given. The court is in no wise apprised of the method by which the plaintiff fixed the amount claimed, and, for aught that appears, it is an arbitrary sum. If the damages are merely nominal, attachment will not lie; if substantial, they are ascertainable, and should be set forth by affidavit to satisfy the court within the requirements of the Code. \u201cWhere the damages are unliquidated, it is necessary to set out the facts which the plaintiff claims prove the damage, in order that the court may determine whether any damage has been sustained.\u201d James v. Signell, 60 App. Div. 75, 76, 69 N. Y. Supp. 680. The insufficient allegation of damage is fatal to the maintenance of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">There is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s point that, even if the defendant\u2019s contention be well founded, she cannot prevail, as her motion papers are insufficient by reason of the omission therefrom of allegations required by rule 37 of the general rules of practice. The presentation of that objection upon the hearing of the motion would have called for its denial (Cole v. Smith, 84 App. Div. 500, 82 N. Y. Supp. 982); but the record does not disclose that the objection was then taken, and, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>cannot be successfully raised for the first time on appeal, it can receive no consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Order reversed, with costs and disbursements of appeal, and attachment vacated, with $io costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
