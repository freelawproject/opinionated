Petty against Samuel Emery. From an interlocutory judgment sustaining a demurrer to the complaint, plaintiff appeals. Affirmed on the opinion of the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The following is the opinion of the court below at Special Term (Clarke, J.):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-4\">The complaint alleges that in May, 1903, the defendant received from Willis B. Dowd, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, a certificate for 250 shares of the common stock of the Smokeless Calorific Company, \u201cas trustee, to hold and cancel said certificate upon the issuance to the said Willis B. Dowd of a new certificate for the same amount of shares of said company, as soon as the same shall be issued for delivery to the subscribers\u201d; that upon the delivery of the old certificate to defendant he delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor an interim certificate, which certifies that Doivd or assigns will be entitled to receive at the office of De Witt &amp; Co., \u201cas soon as the shares of said company are issued for delivery to the subscribers,\" 250 shares upon the surrender of the interim certificate properly indorsed in lieu of the old certificate \u201cwhich was surrendered and canceled.\u201d This interim certificate is signed by the defendant as trustee. The complaint further alleges that the new shares \u201chave long since been ready for issuance,\" and that prior to the commencement of this action the interim certificate, properly indorsed, was offered for surrender, but \u201csaid defendant has arbitrarily and wrongfully manipulated the affairs of said company, so that the said shares have not been placed in the hands of C. H. De Witt &amp; Co. for delivery to the holder of said interim certificate, and has denied and disputed the right and title of said Willis B. Dowd and his assigns to said 250 shares of stock therein mentioned.\u201d The demand is that the defendant account as trustee and deliver back the old certificate, or pay the value thereof to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-5\">The defendant demurs on the grounds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that there is a defect of parties, in that the company should have been made a party defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-6\">As I am of the opinion that the demurrer must be sustained on the first ground, it is unnecessary to pass upon the second. From the complaint submitted it appears that the duty imposed upon the trustee was merely to hold the old certificate, for which the interim certificate was given, until the new shares were issued and placed in the hands of a depository for delivery to the subscribers, and upon the issuance of such new shares to cancel the old certificate. It is alleged that the shares which were to be delivered at the office of the depository have long since been ready for issuance, but it is not alleged that they have been issued. It does not appear' that it was the duty of the defendant trustee to issue the new shares and place them in the hands of the depository. It is not alleged that the defendant was an officer or director or in any way responsible for the issuance or delivery of the new shares, which are not even to pass through his hands. He merely certifies that the holder of the interim certificate will be entitled to new shares as soon as issued for delivery, and upon the happening of that event he is bound to cancel the old certificate (if, indeed, it was not canceled when surrendered, as alleged in the interim certificate). The defendant has performed the duties of his trust, as far as such duties appear from the facts alleged in the complaint. It is only from the facts alleged that the extent and nature of the duty owed plaintiff by defendant may be determined. As stated by Judge Jewett in the case of City of Buffalo v. Holloway, 7 N. Y. 493, at page 498, 57 Am. Dec. 550: \u201cThe difficulty is the want of any statement of facts from which the duty arises; for an allegation of the duty is of no avail unless from the rest of the complaint the facts necessary to raise the duty can be collected.\u201d It is an elemental principle of equity, as contended by plaintiff, that a trustee must not do any act inconsistent with the trust, or deny .the title of the cestui que trust. But the plaintiff must set forth facts which are inconsistent with the trust, or cpnstitute the denial of the cestui\u2019s trust. In Knapp v. The City of Brooklyn, '97 N. Y. 520, where the injury was alleged to have been caused \u201cby reason of the illegal action, frauds, and irregularities of the officers,\u201d etc., of the defendant, Judge Finch, at page 523', says: \u201cNo actions of such officers are pointed out as illegal; no frauds are described or averred; no irregularities are specified; and so no facts are pleaded upon which issue can be taken, or which indicate to the court or adversary the questions intended to be tried.\u201d The allegations in this complaint that \u201cdefendant has arbitrarily and wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>fully manipulated the affairs of said company, so that the said shares have not been placed in the hands of C. H. De Witt &amp; Go. for delivery to the holder of said interim certificate, and has denied and disputed the right and title of said Willis B. Dowd and his assigns to said 250 shares of stock therein mentioned,\u201d are not allegations of facts, but the averment of conclusions of law. In Phinney v. Phinney, 17 How. Prac. 197, the allegations that the defendant has \u201ctaken upon himself the exclusive management of the estate,\u201d .and with the \u201cconnivance and consent\u201d of another has \u201cgreatly mismanaged it,\u201d to the damage of the plaintiffs, were held to be conclusions of law. In Taylor v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., 2 Bosw. 106, where it was alleged that the defendants had wrongfully made use of the slip, Judge Bosworth says, .at page 116: \u201cThe allegation that it was wrongful, and in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, is not an allegation of a fact, but is the pleader\u2019s view of the nature of the acts which he describes.\u201d N. V. &amp; Mt. Vernon Transp. Co. v. Tyroler, 25 App. Div. 161, 48 N. Y. Supp. 1095; Van Schaick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 89. In the case before me not a single fact is alleged from which the court can infer that the defendant\u2019s acts were wrongful, or that he has violated the trust alleged. Upon demurrer, the conclusions of law are not admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b845-3\">As none of the facts upon which the conclusions are based are stated, the demurrer, upon the ground that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action, is sustained. Leave is granted to amend the complaint, upon payment of costs, within 20 days after service of the order herein.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b845-4\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
