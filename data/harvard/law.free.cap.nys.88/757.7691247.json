The contract of insurance provided, in part, as follows: The insurance company, \u201cin consideration of the statements and agreements in the application herefor, which are hereby referred to, and as warranties made a part of this contract and of the premium of fourteen cents * * * agrees to pay,\u201d etc. The twelfth question in the application for the insurance is, \u201cFor whose benefit is the insurance desired?\u201d and is answered, \u201cEdward Makel.\u201d \u201cRelationship to person proposed for insurance ?\u201d answered by the assured, \u201cHusband.\u201d The following evidence given by the plaintiff, however, shows that he was not the husband of the assured:</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">\u201cWas Lena Makel your wife? (Objected to, and objection sustained.) A. Yes, sir. Q. Were you married? A. Not exactly married. I was living with her near two years. * * * Q. Well, did you live with Lena Makel, the person mentioned in this policy? (Objected to. Objection overruled.) By the witness: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">The witness testified that she went by the name of Lena Makel, and that they cohabited together; that she was introduced as Mrs. Makel; and that he supported her, and she took care of the home. He said that the first place they lived together was at Bancroft Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-19\">\u201cQ. Did you have any conversation with her before you went to live with her in Bancroft Place? A. No, sir. * * * Q. When you went to live with her \u2014when you first started in to live together\u2014did you say anything to her, and she say anything to you? (Objected to. Objection overruled.) Q. Tell us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u2022what she said to you? A. The first place I met her was in 105 Johnson avenue. I was to her sister\u2019s, Mrs. Ruoff, and she took a fancy to me, and I took a fancy to her, and she said, \u2018How about if we go housekeeping?\u2019 Q. What else? A. So I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and went to work and got furniture, and we moved in 15 Bancroft Place. Q. Was that all the conversation you had with her? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">It is clear from this evidence that no contract of, marriage ever existed between the assured and the plaintiff, civil or ceremonial, He was not her husband, oand her warranty contained in the application for the insurance to that effect was false. This breach of' warranty was held in Gaines v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. (Sup.) 87 N. Y. Supp. 821, to be sufficient to forfeit the policy. In that case we took occasion to examine the cases on this question at some length, and its further discussion here is unnecessary. Upon the authority of that case, this judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">BARTLETT, J., concurs. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., dissents.</p>\n<author id=\"b778-7\">JENKS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar2V\">I vote for reversal. I think that HOOKER, J., is right in his views that there was a breach of warranty made by the answer that the assured was the husband of Lena Makel. But I do not base my concurrence upon Gaines\u2019 Case (Sup.) 87 N. Y. Supp. 821, for the reason that we limited our judgment in that case to a policy of accident insurance. I prefer to rest my decision upon Jeffries v. Economical Life Ins. Co., 22 Wall. 47, 22 L. Ed. 833. It is true that HOOKER, J., writing for the court in Gaines\u2019 Case, supra, cited Jeffries\u2019 Case, supra; but the decision in Gaines\u2019 Case is not a clear precedent in the case at bar, for the reason just stated. Ruoff\u2019s Case, 86 App. Div. 447, 83 N. Y. Supp. 758, does not deal with the question presented in this case. I think now, as I thought when I wrote in Ruoff\u2019s Case, that the woman could insure her life for the benefit of the man, though they never intermarried, and, of course, that the man could insure his life for the benefit of the woman. Olmsted v. Keyes, 85 N. Y. 593. But the question in this case is as to the breach of warranty made by the assured in writing in his application that he was the husband of the beneficiary, when he was not.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
