The defendant conceded that it received the trunk at its station in New York City from an expressman. The assignor of the plaintiff subsequently went to_ the station, bought a ticket on the defendant\u2019s railway for her carriage to Roselle, N. J., then went to the baggage room, showed her ticket with the express check to the baggage master, and asked that her trunk be checked to her journey\u2019s end. Neither the baggage master nor the passenger could find the trunk. The passenger, desiring to take a certain train, accepted a check for her trunk on the promise of the baggage master that he would send the trunk on to Roselle. She presented the check at Roselle, but the trunk was not delivered to her. It subsequently appeared that it was taken from the possession of the defendant by theft. Despite the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendant, under the circumstances, was a warehouseman, the case was tried on the theory that its relation to the passenger was that of a common carrier. I think that the court did not err.' The passenger did not intrust the trunk to the defendant to keep on storage, nor did the defendant receive it for that purpose. She contemplated a carriage of the trunk in the train whereon she proposed to travel, but, with the alternative of her detention, she consented that the trunk, which presumably at that moment could not be found, although the supposed explanation for its absence was then made to her, should be forwarded by a later train. This is entirely opposed to the idea of keep or storage. I think, therefore, that the defendant must be regarded as a common carrier. Shaw v. Northern Pacific Railroad Company, 40 Minn. 144, 41 N. W. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The law of New Jersey is applicable. Curtis v. Del., Lack. &amp; Western R. R. Co., 74 N. Y. 116, 30 Am. Rep. 271; Brown v. Camden &amp; Atlantic Railroad Co., 83 Pa. St. 316. But I think that the statute raised by the defendant does not apply. The defendant was a common carrier, and, as such, was an insurer, save against an act of God or of the public enemy. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Knight, 58 N. J. Law, 287, 33 Atl. 845. The action is for negligence, and the plaintiff\u2019s assignor made out a prima facie case when he showed a demand for the trunk, accompanied by a presentation of the check at the place where the defendant undertook to deliver the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>trunk, and the failure of the defendant to deliver it. Burnell v. New York Central R. R. Co., 45 N. Y. 184, 6 Am. Rep. 61. The bare proof that the trunk was stolen while in the possession of the defendant did not acquit the defendant of negligence. In Burnell v. New York Central R. R. Co., supra, it is said, \u201cIf it [the trunk] had been burned or stolen without fault on their part, the defendant would not have been liable.\u201d I think that the statute must be construed as a limitation, upon the defendant\u2019s liability as an insurer. This view is strengthened by the provision thereof which reads \u201cunless such person or persons so offering such goods, merchandise, or baggage for transportation, shall pay to said company, by way of insurance, for any additional amount of responsibility to be assumed,\u201d etc. The Supreme Court of New Jersey has held that while a carrier may contract, not contrary to public policy, so that his liability may be regulated, lessened, or limited, yet he cannot contract against \u201chis own clear, positive wrong, default, or misconduct, whether it arise from his own willfulness, recklessness, incapacity, want of skill, or the failure to exercise it.\u201d Ashmore v. Pennsylvania Steam Towing Transportation Co., 28 N. J. Law, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">But \u00e1ssuming that the statute did apply, I think that the judgment may be sustained. It is settled in this state that the provision for general notice is insufficient. Thompson on Carr. 526, 528; Hollister v. Nowlen, 19 Wend. 234, 32 Am. Dec. 455; Cole v. Goodwin, 19 Wend. 251, 32 Am. Dec. 470; Rawson v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 48 N. Y. 212, 8 Am. Rep. 543. And the latter case also applies to such notice as was printed on the railroad tickets.\" The rule seems to be contrary in Pennsylvania. Thompson on Carr. 526; Whitesell v. Crane, 8 Watts &amp; S. 369; Bingham v. Rogers, 6 Watts &amp; S. 495, 40 Am. Dec. 581; Laing v. Colder, 8 Pa. 479, 49 Am. Dec. 533. We are not cited to any decision in New Jersey, and I have not been able to find any authority in that state. Kinny v. Central Railroad Company, 32 N. J. Law, 407, 90 Am. Dec. 675, is not wholly satisfactory, for the reason that the attention of the acceptor of the pass was specifically called to the contract, in addition to the printing on the pass. There is no proof in this case that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor ever saw the notice in the room or on the ticket, or that she had her attention called to either of them'. But assuming that the statute is valid as to its provision for notice, the question still remained whether the defendant had complied with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As the notice to be posted is general, it is but just to regard the requirement that the place of posting shall be conspicuous, as an essential part thereof. \u201cConspicuous\u201d means \u201copen to the view; catching the eye; easy to be seen; manifest.\u201d Cent. Diet. \u201cObvious to the sight; seen at a distance.\u201d Wor. Diet. \u201cExposed to the view; clearly visible; prominent and distinct.\u201d For example, a post box is held to be a conspicuous place for the deposit of a notice (January v. Superior Court, 73 Cal. 537, 15 Pac. 108), and the door of a residence for the affixing of a notice (Ramsey v. Barbaro, 12 Smedes &amp; M. 293).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The question was whether there was a notice at this time in the baggage room, and, if so, whether it was posted in. a conspicuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>place. The word \u201cconspicuous\u201d required the defendant to post the notice in the baggage room, so that naturally, under the general surrounding circumstances, it would be open to the view, obvious to the sight, and catch the eye of the passenger of ordinary care and observation, and be seen by him in the course of checking his luggage. Greenawalt, the baggage master, and Hay, the foreman of the baggage checkers, testify \"that at the time in question notices were posted in the baggage room. They describe with particularity the dimensions of the room, the construction and arrangement thereof, and the relative situation of the notice to the checking counter and the entrances to the room. Hay further testifies:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u201cDifferent persons attend to posting up these notices\u2014the 'baggage master in charge of the room. Mr. Greenawalt is the general baggage agent. He is above that. The baggage agent in charge of the room does that. His name is Mr. Puriek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Greenawalt also testifies that in October, 1900, there was a notice to the left of the counter. \u201cWe put up a new one whenever it would become defaced or anything of the sort. We would keep one up all the time. * * * If they get dirty, we take them down and put a new one up.\u201d In any event, Greenawalt, the general baggage agent, is testifying to the posting of the notice in October, 1900, and what \u201cwe,\u201d i. e., he and others, even if subordinates, did in the posting thereof. There was no other testimony on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">It is contended that the learned court erred in submitting the question of compliance with the statute to the jury. This depends upon whether these witnesses must be regarded as interested, in the sense of bias, so as to make such submission proper in order that, maugre noncontradiction, the jury might pass upon their credibility. The jury were certainly free to infer from the testimony that Greenawalt, the general baggage agent, and those under him\u2014\u201cdifferent persons\u201d\u2014attended to the duty of posting the notices, and hence, if this had not been done, it was the fault or dereliction of Greenawalt and his subordinates. Both Greenawalt and his subordinate Hay \u201chad or might have had a motive for shielding\u201d Greenawalt and those under him \u201cfrom blame,\u201d and consequently their credibility was for the jury. O\u2019Flaherty v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 34 App. Div. 74, 54 N. Y. Supp. 96, affirmed 165 N. Y. 624, 59 N. E. 1128; Volkmar v. M. R. Co., 134 N. Y. 418, 31 N. E. 870, 30 Am. St. Rep. 678; Elwood v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 45 N. Y. 549, 6 Am. Rep. 140. Barker, J., in Michigan Carbon Works v. Schad, 38 Hun, 71, after a learned discussion, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u201cIt is also competent to prove the social and business relations existing between the witness and the party calling him to the stand, and, if it is established that they are such as usually and ordinarily produce an interest in the mind of the witness in favor of the party calling him on the question in dispute, then it is for the jury to say to what extent, if any, the relationship impairs or destroys the credibility of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">In Pratt v. Ano, 7 App. Div. 494, 40 N. Y. Supp. 229, the court, per Ward, J., say:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u201cThis evidence was given by the plaintiff\u2019s foreman, whose business it was to look after this timber and protect it from injury, and who, having failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>to do so, was, in a sense, interested in giving a good reason why he had not done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">I think that, even if th,e court erred in its charge, which I am not entirely prepared to say, the errors were sufficiently corrected by the subsequent qualifications and charges delivered at the request\" of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
