The place where the plaintiff was working was obviously dangerous, as it appeared that the overhang of the defendant\u2019s car was about 15 inches, leaving a space between the fence and the outermost edge of the car of about 15 inches. On February 14, 1902, the plaintiff had been thus engaged for about an hour and a half, and, while in the act of driving a nail into a wooden board upon the fence, he was knocked down by the front part of the defendant\u2019s car and injured. Plaintiff admitted that he did not see the car which struck him, and that he relied upon the sounding of the gong as a warning of its approach, and that it had been his practice to- look for cars from time to time, but that he did not absolutely depend upon his looking, but relied also upon the warnings that he expected would be given him by the motormen. It was testified that, during the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>plaintiff was working upon the fence, the motormen of the defendant\u2019s cars would give warning of their approach by sounding their gongs, and that whenever the plaintiff was thus apprised of an approaching car, or whenever he would notice one coming towards him, he would walk to a bridge which had been built across the trench at a distance of about 30 feet from the place where he was working, and thus get out of the way of the car. The motorman expressly admitted that he was aware that the plaintiff and others were engaged in constructing the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The court, in its instructions to the jury, referring to the rule of contributory negligence applicable to the case, charged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cHe [plaintiff] was also familiar with the fact that cars were almost constantly running along there, as our common experience will teach us. So, therefore, under such circumstances, he was bound to exercise that care, prudence, and diligence which a careful man would exercise, being placed in the position which he was placed in. If he failed to do so, and his failure to exercise the degree of care contributed to the injury in question, in that event your verdict will be for the defendant\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury that the plaintiff, working in a place known to be dangerous to him, was required \u201cto keep his senses alert, and to be vigilant to look out for cars and avoid them at the time of their passage.\u201d This the court declined to do, and, in place thereof, charged that the plaintiff was bound to exercise that care and diligence that a careful and prudent man would exercise under the conditions he was working. The request was substantially one applicable to the degree of care required of pedestrians crossing railway tracks in a city. It seems to me that the rule of law embodied in the request was altogether too broad, when applied to persons whose duty necessarily required them to work on or so near a railroad track that it would be perilous to remain at the place of work when cars are in the act of passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In Smith v. Bailey, 14 App. Div. 283, 43 N. Y. Supp. 856, a street sweeper had not noticed the vehicle that struck him-, because his back at&gt;tiat moment was turned toward it, and the court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">^\u201cIf it were necessary in the prosecution of his business that he should be in that position, of course no negligence could be imputed to him. If by reasonable care he could have put himself in a position where he could protect himself from dangers of this description, then he was bound to use this care, having a view to the work which he was engaged in prosecuting. We think, therefore, that this question was one which the jury were called upon to consider, and which they had a right to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Dipaolo v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 55 App. Div. 566, 67 N. Y. Supp. 421, was also a street sweeper\u2019s case, which followed the rule laid down in the Smith Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">In Bengivenga v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 48 App. Div. 515, 62 N. Y. Supp. 912, the plaintiff \u201cat the time of the injury was carrying hot asphalt upon a shovel from the side of the track and placing it between the rails of the track,\u201d and was struck by one of the defendant\u2019s cars under circumstances which ordinarily would have been held, as matter of law, as constituting contributory negligence. The court held that the defendant was chargeable with notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>fact that workmen were required to be on the track, both by its contract to repair the street made with the firm by whom' plaintiff was employed, and the actual conditions existing; that the person operating the car \u201cwas required to exercise extreme care for the protection of the workmen, and that abundance of warning was required\u201d; that the circumstances required that the car should be \u201cunder such control that it could be stopped practically upon the instant\u201d; that \u201cwhether plaintiff should have observed the car, or not, became a question of fact for the jury\u201d; that the plaintiff \u201chad the right to assume that warning would be given; and that plaintiff might rely upon the presumption that the operator of the car would stop it when it reached the point where he was upon the track.\u201d The reasoning in the cases just cited does not rest upon the circumstance in the one case that the person injured was in the employ of the municipality, or in the other that his employer happened to have a contract with the defendant to do the work in which the plaintiff was engaged at the time of the accident; but it has reference to the peculiar conditions under which those engaged in pursuits on the highway at or near railroad tracks are necessarily obliged to1 perform' their work, and to the obvious knowledge of these conditions on the part of those operating the cars upon such tracks. Bearing in mind the reason for limiting in such cases the ordinary rule of contributory negligence applicable toi pedestrians, it is easy to distinguish the case of Lyons v. Avis, 5 App. Div. 193, 38 N. Y. Supp. 1104, from the present one. In the Lyons Case the person was injured by a passing truck while mixing mortar upon the highway in front of a building then in course of erection. It there appeared that, although his employer had a permit to place material upon the street, the permit did not necessarily confer authority to utilize the street for mixing mortar. Under such circumstances, it was held that the plaintiff \u201cwas nevertheless under protection of the law, and could not be run over with impunity,\u201d but as the plaintiff \u201cwas utilizing the highway for a purpose foreign to its ordinary use\u2014a purpose which is especially permitted only because of exceptional business needs\u201d\u2014and as it was necessarily \u201cfraught with danger, it called for vigilance corresponding to the exigencies of the situation.\u201d Under these circumstances, the court held that the plaintiff could not recover unless he used \u201cdiligence in avoiding danger\u2014especially in looking out for teams.\u201d It will be observed that there is a wide difference between the Lyons Case and the one under review, in that in the former there are absent the elements that the injured one--.was necessarily obliged to work at or near a fixed place of peril, such as a railroad track, over which cars were constantly passing, and that the driver was charged with knowledge of the dangerous conditions under which the work was being done, so as to require him to give warning of his approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">If the defendant was entitled to the instructions requested by it, then it was entitled to a dismissal of the complaint. It was admitted by plaintiff that he did not look for or observe the car that struck him, and, if it was his duty \u201cto be vigilant to&lt; look for cars and avoid them at the time of their passage,\u201d then there was nothing to submit, to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Nor can it be said, as matter of law, that the plaintiff had sufficient space wherein to remain in safety. The proofs affirmatively show that the situation was a dangerous one, and it doies not appear that upon the trial there was any doubt upon this point. If the defendant had any intention of raising an issue of fact as to the sufficiency of this space as a place of safety, then it would, at most, have been entitled to have had that question submitted to the jury, with appropriate instructions as to the law of contributory negligence applicable to a situation which afforded ample space within which to work in safety. O\u2019Connor v. Union Railway Co., 67 App. Div. 99, 101, 73 N. Y. Supp. 606. No such request was made, and as the defendant\u2019s. motorman admitted that he knew that the plaintiff and others were working near the track, and said that he \u201ccame on, ringing his bell\u201d\u2014a fact which was contradicted by the plaintiff and his witnesses\u2014the refusal to charge the jury as requested by defendant\u2019s counsel was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">LEVENTRITT, J. concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b751-6\">FREEDMAN, P. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AyfO\">The plaintiff, while in the employ of a contracting company, at the time of the accident was placing a wooden brace upon a fence that ran parallel to, and about 30 inches east from, the north-bound track of defendant\u2019s road on Broadway. He worked with his back towards the car track, and while in this position was struck by the side of a north-bound ca,r after a portion of the car had passed him. According to. his own testimony, he was familiar with the passing of the cars at the point in question, and knew that he was in a dangerous position, but there is no evidence that he exercised any care to guard against the danger. His testimony does not show that he either looked or listened for the approaching car. In answer to the question, \u201cYou did not look at all unless you heard it?\u201d he answered, \u201cNo,, sir.\u201d In answer to- the question, \u201cDid you look, or didn\u2019t you ?\u201d he answered: \u201cI didn\u2019t look,, because if I looked and I saw it I would not stand there. I relied solely on the motorman giving me warning,\u201d etc. He also testified that he did not listen for the car, because he did not hear it coming, that he was the only man that got hurt, and that everybody else got out of the way. There was not, therefore, under all the circumstances, sufficient evidence upon which his freedom from contributory negligence could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">But even if it be assumed that the case was one for the jury, there was error in the charge. Defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury that, if the plaintiff was working in a place known to be dangerous to him, he was required to\u2019 keep his senses alert, and to be vigilant toi look out for cars and avoid them at the time of their passage. This the court declined to charge, and, in place thereof, charged that the plaintiff was bound to .exercise that care and diligence that a careful and prudent man would exercise under the circumstances similar to the ones that he was working under at that moment. As there were facts to support the request, and the point involved in it had not been covered by anything that preceded it, the refusal to charge as requested constituted reversible error, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the rule laid down in Lyons v. Avis, 5 App. Div. 193, 38 N. Y. Supp. 1104. The cases of Dipaolo v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 55 App. Div. 566, 67 N. Y. Supp. 421, and Bengivenga v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 48 App. Div. 515, 62 N. Y. Supp. 912, do' not apply. In the first \u2022 of these cases, it appeared that the plaintiff, as a street sweeper in the employ of the city, had been working in and about defendant\u2019s tracks for same two years, and that it had been the custom of the motormen to sound a gong as cars were approaching street sweepers on the tr'ack. In the second place, the plaintiff was struck while placing a shovel of hot asphalt between the rails of the track. Under the peculiar circumstances of the case, it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\u201cThe defendant was chargeable with notice of the, fact, both by its contract to repair the street and its actual condition, that workmen were upon the track at this point, and were required to be in order that the work might proceed. * * * As the prosecution of the work required that the asphalt should be deposited while hot, it is quite evident that the operation of the car was to be had with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s being between the rails of the track, and we think that the plaintiff might rely upon the presumption that the operator of the car would stop the same when it reached the point where he was upon the road,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The case at bar is entirely different. Plaintiff\u2019s work was not done upon or between the tracks, but 30 inches away from them. He had sufficient space upon which to remain in safety if he straightened himself up. In fact, a part of the car had passed him before he was struck. No custom was established, pursuant to which he might have relied exclusively upon a warning to be given to him by defendant\u2019s servants, nor was it made to appear that the particular work upon which he was engaged, and in which in no way concerned the defendant, had progressed for such a length of time that he could claim that the defendant should have taken notice of it, and regulated the running of the car with reference to it, and thus absolved him from the duty of \u25a0 looking out for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
