There is no other disposition of such moiety. I think that there is a gift of the principal of that one-half to the said beneficiaries. Earl v. Grim, 1 Johns. Ch. 494; Paterson v. Ellis\u2019 Ex\u2019rs, 11 Wend. 260, 298; Smith v. Post, 2 Edw. Ch. 523, 526; Hatch v. Bassett, 52 N. Y. 359, 362; Bishop v. McClelland\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 44 N. J. Eq. 450, 16 Atl. 1, 1 L. R. A. 551; Matter of Smith, 131 N. Y. 239, 30 N. E. 130, 27 Am. St. Rep. 586. In Bishop v. McClelland\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, supra, the vice chancellor says: \u201cThere can be no doubt that a gift of the interest, income, or produce of a fund, without limitation as to continuance, or without limit as to time, will, according to a settled rule of construction, be held to pass the fund itself; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>this will be the effect given to a gift made in this form, whether the gift be made directly to the legatee or through the intervention of a trustee\u201d\u2014citing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">I think that the executor should not have been deprived of his commissions. In Matter of Rutledge, 162 N. Y. 31, 56 N. E. 511, 47 L. R. A. 721, it was held by a closely divided court that a surrogate might, in his discretion, refuse the statutory commissions. But there was not such misconduct, negligence, or wrongdoing as warranted the deprivation in this case. On the contrary, it appears the executor has rendered services, and has been faithful. No objections were filed to his account, and the special guardian reported approving the accounts as stated. It did appear that one of the grandnieces wrote twice in 1903 to the executor\u2014once saying that she was in need, and stating that she could use \"her portion\u201d; and again, inquiring whether she could get the money left to her\u2014without receiving answers. On the hearing the counsel for the executor stated that he claimed that the lady was married, and that her husband was able to support her, and should do so. And when this was stated as \u201cone of the grounds\u201d the learned surrogate said, \u201cThen I shall not allow any commissions to this executor on that statement of the counsel that he has taken the position that this lady is a married woman, and that her husband ought to support her.\u201d The silence of the executor was discourteous. His position may have been wrong, but it was plausible, in view of the reading of the will, that the entire sum was to be held in solido for the support and maintenance of five persons; and there is some authority in Woodruff v. Woodruff, 54 App. Div. 414, 418, 66 N. Y. Supp. 936, for such position. I think that omission to seek a construction of the will is not a ground for withholding commissions otherwise earned. The imposition of costs for opening the default should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The decree of the surrogate should be modified in accord with this opinion, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to the special guardian out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
