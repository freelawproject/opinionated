We have carefully examined the record, and can find nothing therein to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s contention in that respect. The use made by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s last report cannot be considered as a ratification of the acts of Cullen as defendant\u2019s agent, for the reason that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>there is nothing in the testimony from which it can legitimately be inferred that Cullen ever had authority from the defendant to act as his agent. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
