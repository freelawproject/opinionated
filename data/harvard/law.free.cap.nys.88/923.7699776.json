From the record alone it would be difficult to determine the weight of evidence for either side, as the reader inclines to one or to the other according as he peruses the testimony adduced for the plaintiff or for the defendant, in the dexterous offsets of particulars with plausibilities and probabilities, so that the judgment must be left as the learned justice left it on the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
