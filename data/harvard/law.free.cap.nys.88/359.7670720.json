The trial judge did not charge that, if the jury \u25a0 found a verdict for the defendant, it must bear in mind that he is a poor man, \u201cand can be incarcerated,\u201d and therefore the exception was not well taken. The charge was that, even if the defendant were a poor man, and not able to pay the amount of the recovery, \u201cif you give him a verdict he could be incarcerated until he does pay.\u201d The charge was meaningless. But if we suppose that the judge intended to charge that, if the jury should render a verdict against the defendant, he would be incarcerated such charge was not erroneous. Keller v.
