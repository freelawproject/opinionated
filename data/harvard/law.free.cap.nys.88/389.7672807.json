It is true that the plaintiff testified that he did certain extra work, but nowhere did he testify as to the value of that extra work. The judgment was for $155. The contract price for the work to be done by the plaintiff was $190. The plaintiff admits that he was paid $125. Taking plaintiff\u2019s' testimony as true, and not giving the defendant any credit for moneys paid by him to Labrizzi,, the evidence shows that there was but $65 due plaintiff from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">Judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event, unless the plaintiff consents to reduce the judgment to $75, in which event the judgment is affirmed, without <em>costs o\u00ed </em>this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
