Upon the ground, therefore, of delay and laches in making the application, the defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">In order to justify the granting of such a motion after trial actually had, exceptional reasons should appear. The general rule is that such an application must be made within a reasonable time after issue joined. Hoffman v. Sparling, 12 Hun, 83; Quinn v. Van Pelt, Id. 633. Upon - the ground, therefore, of laches and delay in making the application, and a failure to show exceptional facts to take the case out of the application of the general rule, we think the motion should have been denied.,</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">The order, accordingly, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
