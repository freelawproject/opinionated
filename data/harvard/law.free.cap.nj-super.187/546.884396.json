See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. The action was started by a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs in which plaintiff contended he had been dismissed, without a hearing and demonstration of good cause, from his position as attorney (first count) and from a position he also held with the board in \u201ca responsible administrative capacity\u201d (second count). That position was not otherwise defined in the complaint. The Law Division judge did not deal with the issues raised by the second count and we will treat that count later in this opinion. With respect to the claim of veteran\u2019s tenure grounded in Taylor\u2019s role as attorney to the board, Judge Dowden rendered a comprehensive oral opinion essentially holding that <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) governed the issue; that Taylor as attorney to the board was mandatorily required by that disciplinary rule to withdraw from his position when his client no longer wished him to serve as its counsel, and in such circumstances the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 were inapplicable to Taylor\u2019s tenure claim. We affirm Judge Dowden\u2019s able opinion on that issue substantially for the reasons he gave and add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The trial judge made no specific findings of fact, deeming the issue presented as purely legal in nature. In the exercise of our right to do so, we have examined the record presented and make the following factual findings. <em>R. </em>2:10-5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Taylor was appointed attorney to the board by a resolution effective May 16, 1966 at an initial annual salary of $6,500 payable, as were the salaries of all board employees, in semimonthly installments. There was no fixed term of employment stated in the resolution. Respondent regularly withheld monies for federal and state taxes, Social Security, pension fund contributions and \u201cother key deductions,\u201d the latter not otherwise explained. Taylor apparently enjoyed certain \u201cfringe benefits\u201d not delineated by the testimony below except to designate such benefits as those that were \u201cthe same as every employee,\u201d with the exception, perhaps, of a newly-added dental plan adopted immediately prior to his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Taylor was admitted to the bars of New York and New Jersey. During the time in question he maintained a law office at 160 Broadway in the City of New York where he had a suite of two rooms and employed a secretary. There is no testimony as to whether he also maintained a law office in New Jersey. He was a certified accountant of New Jersey and New York. He practiced that profession and the law in both states for other clients, in addition to his work for the Board. His accounting firm was styled as Robert W. Taylor and Company and he was a principal of that organization. There is no indication as to where the firm was located. Taylor was supplied with board stationery which designated him as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">When first hired in 1966, and until 1973 or 1974, Taylor acted solely as counsel for the board until its former accountant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>resigned. Taylor then performed professional accounting services, but we find that this work was done sporadically and for separate fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In 1975 Taylor was given what he termed \u201cadministrative\u201d duties in addition to his regular legal work. These functions indeed were of an administrative nature but no new position was created for him and no additional job title was granted. The tasks were \u201cmerely assigned to [him] ... and [he] agreed to undertake them.\u201d He admitted that such duties \u201cbecame part of my regular job.\u201d The board passed no resolution creating any additional position for appellant and there was no approval given for any additional title, position or office by the county superintendent of schools.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taylor was given additional salary with these added duties, but no separate pay check was given to him in addition to those made out to him as attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Taylor testified, and we find as a fact, that he did some work for the board in connection with school bonds for new school construction. We find, as he testified, that to the extent he did legal work in this connection it was part of his usual duties for which he was paid his regular salary, and any separately connected billing was merely to obtain reimbursement of expenses. The major part of the legal work for the bond issue was done by independent bond counsel. Appellant stated, and we find as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>fact, that whatever additional tasks he performed relative to the bonds were professional accounting work for which he separately billed the board as an accountant on a professional fee basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Appellant also testified, and we find no evidence or reasonable inferences to the contrary, that all legal work performed for the board during his 13 years with that body was paid for by way of salary and was not billed to the board, or paid for, on any legal fee basis. Taylor worked an average of 1,000 hours a year for the Board and spent about 600 of those hours on purely legal work and about 400 hours on the additional general tasks assigned to him. He had no regular daily hours nor were any expected of him. He, by agreement or understanding, was expected to do whatever work arose that fit within his duties. All of his work was of a continuous nature, performed for a salary with the usual withholding and deductions, and required almost daily attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In April 1979 appellant and the board had a dispute as to the amount of money he was to receive by way of annual salary increase. Taylor insisted upon a 7% increment and the board offered an increase slightly in excess of 4%. As a result, the board passed a resolution terminating \u201cthe service of its legal counsel, Robert W. Taylor, effective May 16, 1979.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On or about July 9, 1979 Taylor filed a petition with the Commissioner of Education claiming veteran\u2019s tenure as school board attorney under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 (first count) and employment tenure \u201cas school business administrator\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:17-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9 <em>et seq. </em>(second count). A third count, not relevant to any issue here raised, was also pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The matter was assigned to Administrative Law Judge Springer who, after a hearing, rendered an initial decision on March 17, 1981 holding he had no jurisdiction to determine the question of veteran\u2019s tenure. <em>Fox v. Newark Bd. of Ed., </em>129 <em>N.J.L. </em>349 (Sup.Ct.1943), aff\u2019d o.b. 130 <em>N.J. </em>531 (E. &amp; A. 1943). With respect to employment in a role appellant termed \u201cschool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>business administrator,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Springer held, as noted, that Taylor\u2019s claim to employment tenure had no merit. In addition to that mentioned in footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>the judge found that Taylor never acquired a certificate as a school business administrator, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:17-14.2 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-1.-18(a)(4), and thus could not, and did not, act <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto </em>as such administrator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">On April 16, 1981 Taylor filed his present complaint in lieu of prerogative writs. The matter was heard by Judge Dowden on September 25, 1981 and was decided October 1, 1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">No person now holding any employment, position or office under the government of this State, or the government of any county or municipality, including any person employed by a school board or board of education, or who may hereafter be appointed to any such employment, office or position, whose term of employment, office or position is not now fixed by law, and receiving a salary from such State, county or municipality, including any person employed by a school board or board of education, who has served as a soldier, sailor, marine or nurse, in any war of the United States, or in the New Jersey State militia during the period of the World War, and has been honorably discharged from the service of the United States or from such militia, prior to or during such employment in or occupancy of such position or office, shall be removed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>such employment, position or office, except for good cause shown after a fair and impartial hearing, but such person shall hold his employment, position or office during good behavior, and shall not be removed for political reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\"><em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) is unequivocal as to an attorney\u2019s duty to withdraw from employment when his client discharges him. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">(B) Mandatory withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">A lawyer representing a client before a tribunal, with its permission if required by its rules, shall withdraw from employment, and a lawyer representing a client in other matters shall withdraw from employment, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">(4) He is discharged by his client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\"><em>R </em>1:14 makes the above rule applicable to Taylor and all other members of the bar of this State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">The Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association, as amended and supplemented by the Supreme Court and included as an Appendix to Part I of these rules, shall govern the conduct of the members of the bar and the judges of all courts of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Our Supreme Court has the exclusive constitutional responsibility as to admission to the bar, the practice of law, the conduct of attorneys and the attorney-client relationship. <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. VI \u00a7 II, par. 3 (1947); <em>American Trial Lawyers </em>v. <em>N.J. Supreme </em>Court, 66 <em>N.J. </em>258 (1974); <em>State v. Rush, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>399 (1966). Even before our present constitution was enacted in 1947, the inherent power of the judiciary to regulate the bar was recognized in a case where a statute attempting to set qualifications for admission to the bar was held void. <em>In re Branch, </em>70 <em>N.J.L. </em>537 (Sup.Ct.1904). This view was. reinforced by our present Supreme Court in <em>New Jersey Bar Ass\u2019n v. Northern N.J. Mtg. Assocs., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>430, 446 (1960), where the court emphatically declared that \u201cthe Legislature may not constitutionally authorize the practice of law by anyone not duly admitted to the bar by this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 is a general statute and in a universal manner makes itself applicable for tenure purposes to any honorably discharged veteran \u201cholding any employment, posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tion or office under . .. the government of any ... municipality, including any person employed by a school board or board of education ... whose term ... is not now fixed by law, and receiving a salary from such ... school board or board of education....\u201d Appellant is such a veteran; he held employment or a position for no fixed term under a municipal government\u2019s school board and received a salary from that board. His services were terminated without a fair and impartial hearing demonstrating good cause, and he asserts that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1, despite the clear language of <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4), requires a holding of veteran\u2019s tenure. The issue of conflict between statute and court rule is squarely presented by these facts and the question raised by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We are mindful of the principle that a declaration holding an act of the Legislature even partially unconstitutional (here only as it applies to members of the bar) is a sensitive ruling not to be undertaken unless there be no possible accomodation between the force of the statute and the conflicting rule. <em>Cf. Ahto v. Weaver, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>418, 428 (1963). Nevertheless, there does come a time when that disagreeable judicial venture arises. <em>See, e.g., New Jersey Bar Ass\u2019n v. Northern N.J. Mtg. Assocs., supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 446-447; <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>240 (1950), <em>cert. </em>den. 340 <em>U.S. </em>877, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>638 (1950); <em>In re Branch, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Our research discloses no case in this State dealing directly with the issue of conflict between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 and <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4). The only case we have found interpreting the disciplinary rule in relation to a statute is <em>Pillsbury v. Monmouth Cty. Freeholder Bd., </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>526 (Law Div.1975), aff\u2019d 140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410 (App.Div.1976). That case presented an issue of contention between <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-43, a statute setting the appointive term of county counsel at three years. The freeholders sought to discharge the county counsel before the expiration of his statutory term and urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) as supplying that right. They contended that the principles of <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, supra, </em>required the statute be struck down. The trial judge held that DR 2-110(B)(4) \u201cdid not indicate nor can it be assumed that it contemplated a situation such as is before me,\u201d and determined that the office of county counsel involves public legal representation as distinguished from the confidential nature of a private attorney-client relationship. 133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534-535. The Appellate Division affirmed, but met the issue by holding that the office of county counsel is a public office, a creature of the Legislature, and that body has the constitutional right to \u201cdetermine the duties and the interrelation among the offices it establishes.\u201d The court held that \u201c[wjithin the constitutional framework the Legislature is the architect of the structure of government.\u201d It also noted, in supporting the constitutional validity of the statute over the disciplinary rule, that county counsel \u201cis not only involved in the practice of law, but also, because of his status as a public officer, has the duty of carrying on the operations of government.\u201d 140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 413-414. Thus, in the particular circumstances of that case, the Legislature\u2019s constitutional prerogative prevailed. The case is clearly distinguishable from the one at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Taylor\u2019s appointment as counsel by the board has its origin in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:16-1, which empowers the board to employ \u201cother officers and employees, as it shall determine. ... \u201d <em>Fox v. Newark Bd. of Ed., </em>129 <em>N.J.L. </em>349, 352 (Sup.Ct.1943), aff\u2019d o.b. 130 <em>N.J.L. </em>531 (E. &amp; A. 1943); <em>Gill v. Hamilton Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>44 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 81 (App.Div.1957). Both of these cases dealt with the question of the right to veteran\u2019s tenure of a school board attorney and granted tenure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. Neither case, however, approached the issue from the standpoint of the client\u2019s inherent right to discharge its legal counsel and the attorney\u2019s corresponding obligation to withdraw from repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>sentation in such event.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue was not raised in <em>Fox. </em>In <em>Gill </em>this court noted that it gave no consideration to other points \u201cotherwise bearing upon the question [of tenure] since no other contention is urged by [the board] on this appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Both cases, however, are apposite to the present matter in that both hold, in contexts similar to that here presented, that an attorney for a school board who is a veteran appointed without a fixed term, is a person holding \u201cemployment\u201d or a \u201cposition\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. <em>Fox, </em>a Court of Errors and Appeals decision, specifically presented a case where the attorney was \u201creceiving a salary from such ... board of education\u201d within the meaning of the tenure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In <em>Koribanics </em>v. <em>Clifton Bd. of Ed., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1966), the Supreme Court dealt with a resolution of a board of education that appointed plaintiff, a veteran, as its attorney at a set annual salary, \u201cto serve without term.\u201d The resolution specifically stated it was the board\u2019s intention \u201cto grant tenure ... in accordance with the provisions of . .. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 <em>et seq.\u201d Id. </em>at 3. After <em>SVz </em>years Koribanics was discharged without the hearing required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. The facts, however, demonstrated that Koribanics, during his term of service, was paid $30,801.39, of which $20,707.14 was salary and $10,094.25 represented fees for extra work. The court held that because of his extra fees Koribanics could not be said to have received a salary for an office, position or employment, as required by the tenure statute. It distinguished <em>Fox, supra, </em>as a case where (as here) the attorney \u201coperated under a straight periodic $7,000 per annum salary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The decision noted that because of its disposition of the matter on the salary question it \u201cneed not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>decide the defendant\u2019s contentions respecting the impact of the Canons of Ethics and the attorney-client relationship upon the problem.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We pointed out in footnote 6, <em>supra, </em>that <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) and its mandatory directive that an attorney, upon dismissal by his client, \u201cshall withdraw from employment\u201d was adopted by court rule in 1971. Although the prior Canons were not specific as to the attorney\u2019s duty in such circumstances, our Supreme Court, before its adoption of <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4), without directly applying the principle did speak in terms of the ancient right of a client to choose and dismiss his attorney. In <em>Parella </em>v. <em>Jersey City Bd. of Ed., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>323 (1968), a case decided on grounds other than the attorney-client relationship, Justice Francis observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">There is no statute which says expressly that an attorney or counsel for a local board of education shall not have veteran\u2019s tenure. There are paths of legislative making, however, which plainly reveal such an intention. Before setting out on these paths, it is necessary to call to mind the peculiar relationship which a member of the bar has as counsel to a public body. It is a position of trust and confidence. It is born in the confidence of the public body, rarely of permanent status, has in the ability, honesty and personality of the individual selected. In common sense the relationship is simply that of attorney and client, basic to which, from time immemorial, has been the desirability of personal selection of the attorney by the client, [at 331]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\"><em>Parella </em>concerned a claim by a discharged counsel to a board of education for salary allegedly owed from the date of his discharge to the date when the board legally abolished the law department he had headed. He founded his right upon his veteran status under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. The decision illustrates the type of approach the court took to deny veteran\u2019s tenure to a government attorney prior to the adoption of <em>DR </em>2:110(B)(4). Recognizing that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 is general in its terms and clearly universal in its intent to cover all veterans, the court looked for statutory exceptions to the Veteran\u2019s Tenure Act. Thus, Justice Francis observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Veterans preference and tenure statutes have had a long existence in New Jersey. L. 1888, c. 104, p. 135; <em>L. </em>1895, c. 155, p. 317, <em>Gen.Stat. </em>3702; L. 1907, c. 14, p. 37; <em>Comp.Stat. </em>4873. They are acts of general application to public employment. But it is well settled that such statutes, including the current one, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1, quoted above, are not applicable to an employment, position or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>office in the service of the State, county, municipality or board of education if later specific enactments adequately indicate a legislative intent to exclude it from tenure protection. <em>Koribanics v. Board of Education of City of Clifton, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>1, 5 (1966); <em>Brennan v. Byrne, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>333, 337 (1960); <em>Barringer v. Miele, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>139 (1951); <em>Ackley v. Norcross, </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>569, 572 (Sup.Ct.1939); <em>Smith v. City Council of City of Hackensack, </em>70 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209 (App.Div.1961), certification denied 36 <em>N.J. </em>300 (1962). [at 330-331]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In <em>Parella, </em>a case where the board of education was subject to the Civil Service Act, the court denied veteran\u2019s tenure to the attorney because under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:22-2(e) and (k) of that act he was held to be a person in the unclassified service excluded from veteran\u2019s tenure by those sections. Thus, the general grant of veteran\u2019s tenure of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 was deemed to be controlled by the later specific legislative exclusion of the Civil Service laws. <em>Id. </em>at 331-343.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The approach taken in <em>Parella </em>and in the cases cited in the above quotation is not applicable here. The respondent in the administrative hearing before Judge Springer stipulated that it is not subject to the Civil Service Act, and respondent does not contend otherwise here. <em>Parella </em>recognizes that there \u201cis no statute which says expressly that an attorney or counsel for a local board of education shall not have veteran\u2019s tenure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. The Civil Service enactments do not apply to this case, nor is there a statute dealing with the appointment of school board counsel expressly stating that such attorney serves at the pleasure of the board. <em>See, e.g., Cetrulo v. Byrne, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330 (1960); <em>Brennan v. Byrne, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>333, 337-338 (1960); <em>Barringer v. Miele, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>139, 143 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"><em>Fox v. Newark Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>a case controlling this court, clearly regards an individual in Taylor\u2019s position as legislatively intended to be covered by veteran\u2019s tenure. <em>Gill v. Hamilton Tp. Bd. of Ed., Parella v. Jersey City Bd. of Ed., </em>and <em>Koribanics v. Clifton Bd. of Ed. </em>equally appear to recognize the application of the general terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 to a veteran who is a salaried school board attorney appointed for no fixed term. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Taylor is of that class.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, if he is to be denied tenure it must be because he, as a member of the bar, is governed by <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4) and cannot seek tenure because, under that rule, he serves at the pleasure of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In our view it would be gross judicial eccentricity to acknowledge the disciplinary rule, the constitutional power of the Supreme Court to enact it and yet hold that the legislative grant of tenure controls. The disciplinary rule and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 are in direct conflict. Likewise, it is clear that the Supreme Court is the exclusive constitutional repository of the responsibility for regulating the attorney-client relationship. <em>American Trial Lawyers v. N.J. Supreme Court, supra. </em>Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>though we are aware of our duty to avoid constitutional conflict, we are obliged to meet the issue. In so doing, we heed the statements of former Chief Justice Hughes in <em>American Trial Lawyers, supra, </em>expressing the constitutional duty of his court and our judicial obligation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">One source of the power of the Court to regulate practice and procedure therein, of course, is its traditional, inherent and integral relationship to the very existence and the functioning of the court. But so precisely and unmistakably (as held below) did Article VI, \u00a7 II, par. 3 of the Constitution, <em>supra, </em>make \u2018the Supreme Court the exclusive repository of the State\u2019s power to regulate the practice of the law, investing it \u201cwith exclusive responsibility, in this area\u201d <em>State v. Rush, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>399, 411 (1966),\u2019 <em>American Trial Lawyers Ass'n v. New Jersey Supreme Court, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[577] at 585 that the existence and exclusivity of the power would seem quite beyond question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">The people\u2019s constitutional reposition of power always carries with it a mandate for the full and responsible use of that power. When the organic law reposes legislative power in that branch, for instance, it is expected that such power will be used, lest it wither and leave the vacuum of a constitutional exigency requiring another branch (however reluctantly) to exercise, or project the exercise of, that unused power for the necessary vindication of the constitutional rights of the people. <em>Robinson v. Cahill, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>473 (1973), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Dickey </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>976, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>292, 38 L.Ed.2d 219; <em>Jackman v. Bodine, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>453 (1964); <em>Asbury Park Press, Inc. v. Woolley, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1960). So it is with the unparalleled executive authority vested by the 1947 Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">And so it has been with the judicial branch of this government. Since 1948 (the Judicial Article became effective September 15, 1948, Article IX, \u00a7 IV, par. 14) the Supreme Court has not hesitated to meet its responsibility for the use of the judicial and administrative power reposed in it by Article VI. Thus, it has \u2018legislatively\u2019 adopted Rules of general application regulating the professional conduct of attorneys and their relationships to their clients and to the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">In this grant of power and reposing of responsibility the people of New Jersey trusted and commissioned the Supreme Court, in effect, to \u2018keep the house of the law in order.\u2019 See, <em>Gair v. Peck, </em>6 <em>N.Y.2d </em>97, 111, 188 N.Y.S.2d 491, 502, 160 N.E.2d 43, 51 (1959), <em>appeal dismissed </em>361 <em>U.S. </em>374, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>401, 4 L.Ed.2d 380 (1960). The Court intends to fulfill that responsibility and to fulfill it within the framework of constitutional right. To do less would degrade the Court, weaken the profession and impede the administration of justice, eventualities against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>which we believe the profession, as well as this Court, to be fully dedicated. [66 <em>N.J. </em>at 262-265],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 does not govern the attorney-client relationship. To the extent it so intends, it must give way to <em>DR </em>2-110(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We have already observed that appellant in his petition to the Commissioner of Education described his alleged additional position with the board as \u201cschool business administrator,\u201d and in his present complaint he asserts his role was one \u201cserved in a responsible administrative capacity in addition to serving as Board Attorney.\u201d Judge Springer found that Taylor did not hold a position as school business administrator in either <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto </em>fashion, and we agree. We are, moreover, convinced that Taylor, under the facts, was not appointed to any position in addition to his role as attorney. He admitted that additional tasks were assigned to him and he agreed to undertake them and that such duties \u201cbecame part of [his] regular job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">It is apparent that no separate office was created. Taylor merely performed additional duties and was paid with a single check for all of his work. In the exercise of their functions lawyers frequently render services to clients beyond the strict limits of their professional franchise. Taylor was engaged initially as an attorney. That he thereafter \u201cstepped beyond the strictly legal role to undertake to render services which a non-lawyer could render, would not justify the conclusion that he was engaged other than as a lawyer.\u201d <em>Ellenstein v. Herman Body Co., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>348, 352 (1957). We conclude that in this case appellant has failed to sustain his burden of proof that a separate administrative employment or position was created for which he received a separate salary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 is, therefore, inapplicable and judgment is entered in favor of respondent denying appellant the relief he sought in the second count of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The judgment of the Law Division in favor of the respondent board of education for the School District of Hoboken on the first count of appellant\u2019s complaint is affirmed. Judgment is entered in this court in favor of respondent and against appellant on the second count of the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">We are presented with a record consisting of a portion of Taylor\u2019s testimony before an administrative law judge given in support of a petition filed with the Commissioner of Education; the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>testimony of two witnesses called by respondent at the Law Division hearing; Judge Dowden\u2019s decision; the pleadings filed with the Commissioner and those filed with the Law Division, and two exhibits apparently placed in evidence before Judge Dowden. These two exhibits are in respondent\u2019s appendix. The record of the brief hearing before the Law Division indicates that only these two exhibits were placed in evidence and two witnesses for respondent were heard. There was brief oral argument. Appellant\u2019s procedural statement indicates that a transcript of his testimony at the administrative hearing was presented to Judge Dowden. We assume it is the one supplied to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The initial decision of the administrative law judge furnished to us in appellant\u2019s appendix reveals that on these same facts the judge found appellant\u2019s claim that he was a school business administrator, entitled to employment tenure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A.-17-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A.-6-9 <em>et seq., was </em>without merit. The judge, among other reasons, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">It cannot be reasonably argued that Taylor was properly appointed to the job of school business administrator. In the first place, the Board failed to apply to the County Superintendent of Schools for certification of the necessity of such position, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:17-14.1 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-1.18(a)(1) and (3). Secondly, the Board never passed any resolution by majority vote of all members to appoint Taylor to that post, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:17-14.1. Indeed, the testimony strongly indicates that the Board never really intended to create such job category at all.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">It is to be noted that appellant, having failed at this designation for his position in the administrative hearing styled his role as one \u201cserved in a responsible administrative capacity in addition to service as Board Attorney,\u201d when he filed his Law Division complaint seeking veteran\u2019s tenure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Appellant\u2019s procedural statement does not tell us whether any appeal was taken from the adverse result before the Commissioner nor, for that matter, does he advise us whether the Commissioner affirmed, modified, rejected or failed to act upon Judge Springer\u2019s initial decision within the 45 days provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10. We may fairly assume such affirmance or appellant would not have filed his Law Division complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-10\">This complaint, filed about two years after Taylor was terminated by the board, was held to have been timely filed by Judge Dowden, perhaps by reason of <em>R. </em>4:69-6(c). Respondent argues this was error but furnished no transcript of the trial judge\u2019s decision and filed no cross-appeal. We do not, therefore, consider any such argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">DR 2:110(B)(4) and the disciplinary rules were by J?. 1:14 adopted by the Supreme Court, effective September 13, 1971. The <em>Canons of Professional Ethics, </em>made applicable to our bar by former <em>R.R. </em>1:25, were at that time deleted. The Canons were not as stringent and had no mandatory provision similar to the DR 2-110(B)(4) requirement that an attorney \u201cshall withdraw from employment\u201d if \u201c[h]e is discharged by his client.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Respondent does not contend that Taylor, because he is an attorney, is an independent contractor and thus beyond any intent of the Legislature in granting tenure by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1. The facts of this case, and the prior decisions referred to above, do not, in our view, furnish grounds for such an approach. Neither does <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 which, in a broad stroke, only lists three qualifications for tenure: (1) veteran status; (2) employment, position or office, without a fixed term with a school board, and (3) receipt of a salary. The Supreme Court, in an other context, has held that an attorney to a public body is not an independent contractor. <em>Reilly v. Ozzard, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>529 (1960). In that case former Chief Justice Weintraub stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">It is argued that from the nature of his profession an attorney can be only an independent contractor. Reliance is placed upon <em>Ewart v. Commissioner, </em>98 F.2d 649 (3 Cir.1938). The court held that upon the record before it the attorney there served the municipalities as an independent contractor. The context was liability to federal income taxation. The case does not hold the inherent nature of an attorney\u2019s service is such as to preclude the creation of an office for their rendition. True, in the general practice an attorney is ordinarily an independent contractor, but in both public and private affairs he may assume another relationship. Attorneys are commonly employed as house counsel by corporate employers. So in the public domain, although an attorney may be engaged in individual matters as an independent contractor, yet he may assume another status. Government needs professional services of many types, legal, medical, engineering, and if the need is sufficient to induce the creation of a post for their rendition, the incumbent is not an independent contractor merely because the services are professional in nature. Surely the Attorney General and the county prosecutor are not independent contractors. They hold office. <em>State ex rel. Clawson v. Thompson, </em>20 <em>N.J.L. </em>689 (Sup.Ct.1846).
