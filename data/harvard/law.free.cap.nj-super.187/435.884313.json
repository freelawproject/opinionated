During the early course of an investigation into an apparent burglary at Madan Plastics, Inc. in Cranford on November 12, 1980, the Cranford, police received information which led them to regard defendant as a suspect in the crime. The investigation had also produced a rear door panel from the property entered, which bore what Cranford Detective Hicks described as the impression of a shoe sole bearing a unique diamond pattern. Armed with that information, Detective Hicks did \u201csome checking on the defendant to check on his past history,\u201d which uncovered \u201can active warrant in Cranford for contempt of court.\u201d Since defendant resided in the adjoining municipality of Roselle Park, Hicks called the Roselle Park police and told them that \u201cI\u2019d like to go to his residence ... and pick the defendant up on the warrant itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">On November 14 Hicks, together with another Cranford officer and two Roselle Park officers, went to defendant\u2019s home. Two of the officers went to the back door and two presented themselves at the front door, which was opened by defendant\u2019s aunt. The officers told her that \u201cwe wanted to speak to Joe,\u201d whereupon she went upstairs and shortly thereafter defendant came downstairs. Hicks told defendant that he was from the Cranford Police Department and that he \u201cheld a contempt warrant out of the Cranford Municipal Court and that I was there to pick him up on that particular warrant.\u201d Defendant said he needed to get dressed and proceeded upstairs. Without invitation or request, Hicks and another officer \u201caccompanied him up to his bedroom,\u201d where defendant put on a shirt and a pair of shoes. In the bedroom Hicks \u201cnoticed a pair of black work boots below the dresser\u201d; he picked up one of the boots and examined it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>And to me at that time I felt that that was the same sole impression that I had seen on the door panel up at Madan Plastics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">I picked the boots up, and I told Joe at the time I was taking the boots with me, and he wanted to know why. And not to aggravate anything at that particular time, I just told him that when we got into our headquarters I would explain to him why I seized the boots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">At the hearing of the suppression motion, Detective Hicks said his intent in proceeding as he did was \u201ctwo fold; one, that we had a warrant for his arrest, and the other was I wanted to speak to him about the burglary due to the fact that he was a suspect.\u201d When later asked whether he went to defendant\u2019s house \u201cto see whether or not you could find any shoes to match up with the investigation,\u201d Hicks frankly acknowledged \u201cthat was in the back of my mind, yes, it was.\u201d He continued that \u201cI needed to speak to him\u201d and that making the arrest on the contempt warrant \u201cwas the easiest way for us to pick him up and talk to him, yes.\u201d But Hicks conceded that his work did not normally entail \u201ccontempt followups\u201d; that defendant\u2019s criminal record check had shown only \u201cminor disorderlies\u201d and, furthermore, that \u201cnormal\u201d procedure in handling contempt warrants is not to arrest but to call the person by telephone and ask him to appear at headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In the trial court counsel for defendant relied principally on <em>State v. Seiss, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269 (App.Div.1979), and argued that Hicks resorted to the contempt warrant with the \u201culterior motive\u201d to \u201cgo in there and look around and perhaps get lucky.\u201d The State acknowledged the authority of <em>Seiss, </em>but argued that there was a \u201csubstantial police need\u201d to accompany defendant to his bedroom in connection with the arrest. The State also sought to justify the seizure as the product of a search incident to the arrest. The trial judge found <em>Seiss </em>essentially dispositive. Although he accepted that the officers had gone to defendant\u2019s home \u201cfor the purpose of arresting the defendant,\u201d he found that \u201cthey were hopeful of finding some evidence to add to whatever they had in connection with the burglary at Madan</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Plastics.\u201d The trial judge framed the \u201cplain view\u201d issue in terms of \u201cwhether this was the result of an inadvertent viewing by the police\u201d or whether \u201cit was a purposeful inspection for investigative purposes.\u201d His conclusion was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">. .. their entire conduct in entering this house, if limited to what they were there for, which was the contempt, would have and should have begun and ended with the defendant going upstairs, coming downstairs and going with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Accordingly, the trial judge ordered the suppression of the boots as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Seiss, supra, </em>this court suppressed evidence found in \u201cplain view\u201d when police officers entered defendant\u2019s home to arrest him for nonpayment of a fine on a motor vehicle charge. Judge Lynch noted that the police may enter a home to effect an arrest, but that such an entry \u201cis to be measured by the rule of reasonableness.\u201d 168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273. The rule of reasonableness, it was explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">... has recently been refined to a dual standard of (1) whether the police acted in good faith in making a search incident to a lawful arrest and (2) whether there existed a \u201c.substantial police need\u201d for the action they have taken. State <em>v. Slockbower, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1979); <em>State v. Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25 (1979). In other words, if a search is unnecessary for the attainment of a lawful police objective, it is illegal.\u201d [Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Finding that \u201cthe officers had no such reason to believe that he might escape,\u201d the court concluded that the \u201cplain view\u201d observation made within the house was improper because \u201cthere was no \u2018substantial necessity\u2019 to enter defendant\u2019s home in order to arrest him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. \u201cRather,\u201d the court found, \u201cit appears the police invaded defendant\u2019s home merely for the purpose of conducting an exploratory search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">On its face the <em>Seiss </em>holding would be dispositive here, as it was found to be by the trial judge. Here, too, the arrest effected was for a relatively minor offense unrelated to that for which the evidence was seized; defendant was cooperative and there was no showing that the police reasonably apprehended that he would seek to escape or arm himself when he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>upstairs to get dressed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and therefore it was unnecessary for the effecting of the arrest to follow defendant through the interior of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The State, however, argues that the holding of <em>Seiss </em>is substantially diluted, if not entirely negated, by the later decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Washington v. Chrisman, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>1, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>812, 70 L.Ed.2d 778 (1982), which held that regardless of \u201cthe nature of the offense\u201d for which an arrest is made, an arresting officer has \u201ca right to remain literally at [a defendant\u2019s] elbow at all times; nothing in the Fourth Amendment is to the contrary.\u201d We recognize and, of course, accept that ruling<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, but we do not regard it as validating the asserted \u201cplain view\u201d seizure which occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We must start with the recognition that not every \u201cplain view\u201d observation permits the<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warrantless seizure of the item observed. <em>See, generally, State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Herron, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>570 (App.Div.1977), <em>cert. </em>den. 439 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>637, 58 L.Ed.2d 695 (1978). The rule is, rather, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">... a warrantless seizure may be made of items in \u201cplain view\u201d in a location where the officer has a right to be; but that the presence of the items cannot alone supply justification for a police officer\u2019s presence at that location. [Id. at 575],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Whether an officer \u201chas a right to be\u201d where the items are observed turns, of course, on the manner in which the intrusion into that location was made. Thus, for example, if the intrusion is itself unlawful, any evidence seized in \u201cplain view\u201d as a result must be suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 574; <em>State v. Rice, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128 (App.Div.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>In <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>443, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), the court identified another kind of intrusion which will not support a seizure of \u201cplain view\u201d items. In his plurality opinion Justice Stewart said that to sustain a warrant-less \u201cplain view\u201d seizure \u201cthe discovery of evidence in plain view must be inadvertent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 403 <em>U.S. </em>at 469, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040. His stated concern was to deny validity to a \u201cplanned warrantless seizure,\u201d which he described as one effected by the police \u201cmaneuvering themselves within \u2018plain view\u2019 of the object they want.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 26. Observing that \u201cthis court has never permitted the legitimation of a planned warrantless seizure on plain view grounds\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 471, n. 27) 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2041 n. 27, Justice Stewart found that an initial intrusion into a constitutionally protected area may be entirely lawful but will still not extend</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">... to the seizure of objects\u2014not contraband nor stolen nor dangerous in themselves\u2014which the police know in advance they will find in plain view and intend to seize.... <em>[403 U.S. </em>at 471, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The contrary view, Justice Stewart reasoned, would be to conclude that the \u201cwarrant requirement should be ignored whenever the seizing officers are able to arrange to make an arrest within sight of the object they are after.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We read the present record, and the conclusions of the trial judge, to establish that the seizure here was just such a \u201cplanned warrantless seizure.\u201d The police used a most anomalous procedure to effect an arrest in an adjoining town on a minor charge; an expressed reason for executing the contempt warrant by arrest was that defendant was a suspect in an entirely unrelated burglary and that \u201cwe wanted to talk to him\u201d; the officer \u201chad in the back of my mind\u201d that he might find the footgear to match the only physical evidence he had from that burglary; at the time of the arrest there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>suggestion that defendant was angry or exercised, likely to become violent or to escape, and the police, without advising defendant of their plan to \u201ctalk to him\u201d concerning the burglary, followed him without invitation into his own bedroom where they made the hoped-for \u201cplain view\u201d observation. Those facts fully support the finding of the trial judge that the arrest and seizure went well beyond what could reasonably be attributed to an intent to arrest defendant on a contempt warrant; in these circumstances the conduct of the police in arresting defendant and remaining at his elbow must realistically be seen as a pretext to obtain a view of the interior of his house and, as it fortuitously worked out, to make a \u201cplain view\u201d seizure. This kind of improper police procedure was specifically envisioned in \u201cThe Supreme Court, 1970 Term,\u201d 85 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>3 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">... where the police have probable cause to arrest, their best strategy is to defer arrest until the suspect is at home so that they have a chance of discovering evidence in plain view which they would not have had if they made their arrest elsewhere. This use of the arrest power for the ulterior purpose of gaining access to a person\u2019s house amounts to a planned warrantless search and seems at the heart of Justice Stewart\u2019s concern. <em>[Id. </em>at 245]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Application of these principles is well illustrated in <em>Harding v. State, </em>301 So.2d 513 (Fla.App.1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 314 So.2d 151 (Fla.Sup.Ct.1975). There deputy sheriffs learned that one, Hardison, could be found at Harding\u2019s home, although they were not looking for Hardison, they did know him to be involved in \u201cthe local drug scene\u201d and concluded that \u201cit would be a good bet\u201d that there would be drugs in his possession. The deputy sheriffs learned that Hardison had two minor traffic arrest warrants outstanding and, without advising the local police, they went to Harding\u2019s home. They announced their purpose to arrest Hardison, gained entry to the house and arrested him; Harding then happened to enter the house carrying in \u201cplain view\u201d the marijuana which was the subject matter of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, the Court of Appeal noted that none of the deputy sheriffs was \u201cnormally engaged in executing municipal traffic warrants\u201d; that it was \u201cmost unusual\u201d for deputy sheriffs to serve city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>traffic warrants; that the arrest therefore could not be characterized as one accomplished by a deputy sheriff \u201croutinely acting in reasonable pursuit of his usual and normal duties,\u201d and that the arrest and seizure occurred \u201cwithout any pretense of necessity or without any suggestion of exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514-515. Based upon those considerations the Court of Appeal concluded that the arrest warrants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASz\">... were used as an excuse to scavenge for contraband and on such a predicate the plain sight seizure from Harding, the owner of the invaded home, was unreasonable, that is to say, fatally pretextual in violation of his rights under the Federal and State Constitutions relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>[Id. </em>at 514]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We find this holding and its reasoning to be fully consistent with <em>Coolidge </em>and persuasive in the present setting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although our research does not disclose any published New Jersey opinions involving a fact pattern such as presented here, we do note that recent New Jersey cases have recognized, in cognate settings, that the intent of police officers may be determinative of the validity of their arrests and seizures and that the \u201ctrue facts\u201d must prevail over the \u201cobjective facts.\u201d <em>See State v. Ercolano, supra </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In <em>Ercolano </em>the court held invalid what was claimed by the police to be an inventory search of an automobile. Judge Conford, speaking for the court, noted (at 38) that \u201c[t]he intent and purpose of the police in conducting a search has frequently been held material to the validity thereof.\u201d He recited with approval the holding of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>493, 500, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>78 <em>S.Ct. </em>1253, 1257, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514 (1958), that although government agents could lawfully have entered a house with intent to arrest a defendant and thereby legally seize illicit equipment in plain view, nevertheless the seizure there was invalid because the court found \u201ctheir purpose in entering was to search for distilling equipment and not to arrest petitioner\u201d; therefore, Judge Conford recounted, \u201c[t]he actual intent of the officers was regarded as fatal to the search as a matter of law.\u201d 79 <em>N.J. </em>at 39. Based upon that and other authorities, Judge Conford found that \u201cthe principle that the intent and purpose of the searching officers may be material, indeed crucial, to the validity of the search, is fully applicable here.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Slockbower, supra, </em>our Supreme Court found, as one ground for \u201ccondemning\u201d what was sought to be justified as an inventory search upon impoundment of an automobile, that \u201cthe purported impoundment was pretextual\u201d and therefore that there was not \u201csubstantial necessity\u201d for the impoundment. 79 <em>N.J. </em>at 13. And in <em>State </em>v. <em>Seiss, supra, </em>the conclusion that there was no \u201csubstantial necessity\u201d to enter defendant\u2019s house was based, as already recited, upon the court\u2019s finding that \u201cit appears the police invaded defendant\u2019s home merely for the purpose of conducting an exploratory search.\u201d 168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274\u2014276. These cases are but exemplars of the broadly accepted view that \u201cbad faith\u201d searches or seizures are unconstitutional even though they may appear to be objectively constitutional. See, generally, Burkoff, \u201cBad Faith Searches\u201d, 57 <em>N.Y.U.L.Rev. </em>70 (1982); Amsterdam, \u201cPerspectives on the Fourth Amendment,\u201d 58 <em>Minn.L.Rev. </em>349 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Our finding of the invalidity of the alleged \u201cplain view\u201d seizure is equally dispositive of the State\u2019s alternate contention that the seizure here was the product of a search incident to arrest. Not only did the officers testify that they did not conduct a search at all, but a search conducted upon the pretex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tual arrest would also be invalid under the authorities already cited. See, generally, BurkoiT, \u201cBad Faith Searches,\u201d <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In reaching our conclusions we have not overlooked <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>128, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1717, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>168 (1978), reh. den. 438 <em>U.S. </em>908, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>3127, 57 L.Ed.2d 1150 (1978), in which Justice Rehnquist, speaking for the court, described certain earlier precedents as holding that searches are to be evaluated \u201cunder a standard of objective reasonableness without regard to the underlying intent or motivation of the officers involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1723. The accuracy of that recitation, however, as well as the application of the <em>Scott </em>holding, has been the subject of considerable dispute. See, <em>e.g., </em>Burkoff, \u201cBad Faith Searches,\u201d <em>supra, </em>57 <em>N.Y.U.L.Rev. </em>at 72 84; 1 <em>LaFave, Search and Seizure </em>(Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 1.2 at 4-19 (1978). We do not read <em>Scott </em>to overrule <em>Coolidge </em>or to require any retreat from the principles enunciated by our court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ercolano </em>and <em>State v. Slockbower, </em>both <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Moreover, we find that the seizure here would be vulnerable even in the absence of a finding of subjective bad faith or pretext. As Professor LaFave has pointed out <em>(Search and Seizure, supra </em>(Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 1.2 at 17), the United States Supreme Court has recognized in a number of settings that \u201carbitrary action is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u201d; therefore it is surely approprite to consider, in a case of this nature, <em>whether </em>the officer deviated from usual police practice, even if we disregard <em>why </em>he did so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">It is the <em>fact </em>of the departure from the accepted way of handling such cases which makes the officer\u2019s conduct arbitrary, and it is the arbitrariness which in this context constitutes the Fourth Amendment violation.... <em>[Id. </em>at 16]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">LaFave suggests, as an alternative to an examination of \u201cthe underlying intent or motivation of the officers involved,\u201d that the courts \u201cascertain in a more direct fashion whether the police in the particular case had departed from their usual practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. He suggests, in short, \u201cmore widespread application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of the requirement utilized by the Supreme Court in <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>364, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976), namely that the Fourth Amendment activity \u2018was carried out in accordance with <em>standard procedures </em>in the local police department.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Application of that rationale would require suppression of the evidence seized here since it is acknowledged that the arrest, whether or not characterized as subjectively \u201cpretextual,\u201d was not effected in accordance with \u201cnormal\u201d procedures in the local police department. The seizure can fairly be characterized as the product of arbitrary police activity and thus in violation both of the Fourth Amendment and of <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), <em>Art. </em>I, par. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We have carefully considered the contrary views expressed by our dissenting colleague. Our conclusion, however, is that his analysis overlooks the \u201ctrue facts\u201d realistically perceived by the trial judge and, further, that it fails to give proper recognition to the case law which condemns pretextual or arbitrary police searches. On the record before us and in light of the trial judge\u2019s findings and the reasoning and authority above recited, we determine that the observation and seizure of the boots, although ostensibly valid, were in fact pretextual and arbitrary and accordingly were in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the parallel provision of our New Jersey Constitution. The evidence was therefore properly suppressed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The July 10, 1981 order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Detective Hicks did make a reference to a report that defendant \u201chad tendencies of becoming violent with the police,\u201d but the trial judge gave that report no apparent weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\">We need not here determine whether the more stringent standard of <em>Seiss </em>survives, notwithstanding <em>Washington v. Chrisman, </em>as an authoritative interpretation of <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), <em>Art. </em>I, par. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Although the discussion of inadvertence in Justice Stewart\u2019s plurality opinion was not joined in by a majority of the court, our own Supreme Court has treated the inadvertence requirement as part of the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine. See, <em>e.g., State v. Ercolano, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We are aware of the variant views expressed both in case law and academic discussion concerning the point at which a police officer\u2019s expectation or suspicion renders his \u201cplain view\u201d observation no longer \u201cinadvertent.\u201d <em>Compare, e.g., United States v.

However, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the police legally entered defendant\u2019s home in order to arrest him on the previously slumbering warrant, there is some doubt that the seizure of the boots can be upheld under the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine. Although the work boots were eoncededly plainly visible, they may not have been in plain view as incriminating evidence of the commission of a crime. Only after the police picked them up, turned them over, and inspected their soles did it become apparent that the boots constituted such evidence. At any rate, the alacrity with which the police did so illuminates glaringly their true reason for being at defendant\u2019s home in the first place. If any further proof of their real purpose is needed, it can be found in the testimony of defendant, referred to in footnote 5 of the dissenting opinion, that the detective and an accompanying Roselle Park police officer had \u201clooked under the bed, behind the TV, just looking around, you know.\u201d Since the trial judge found that the witnesses \u201con both sides\u201d had been \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ccandid\u201d, defendant\u2019s testimony in this respect should not be ignored.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b475-7\">MILMED, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"AWYS\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">I cannot agree with my colleagues\u2019 strained reasoning. If allowed to stand, it surely would deter police officers generally from exercising logical and appropriate rights and initiatives in their pursuit of effective law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">First, let us put the facts in their proper perspective. Three witnesses testified at the suppression hearing\u2014Detective John M. Hicks, of the Cranford Police Department, for the State, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>defendant Joseph P. Bruzzese and his aunt Vinnie Schuha in support of the motion to suppress. At the conclusion of the testimony the trial judge observed that he had \u201cthe strong feeling in this case that all of the witnesses on both sides have been honest witnesses, so to speak, candid.\u201d In the context of this evaluation, the relevant facts may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On November 12,1980 a burglary and theft allegedly occurred at the premises of Madan Plastics on North Avenue in Cranford. In the ensuing police investigation conducted by Detective Hicks and other police officers, defendant\u2019s \u201cname came up as a suspect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hicks testified that from conversations with other police officers and from official reports he had learned that defendant was a former employee of Madan Plastics and \u201cthe night before this alleged burglary took place he was at someone\u2019s house in Cranford.. .and prior to his leaving, he stated that he was going to get even with the people at Madan Plastics for firing him.\u201d He also learned that defendant walked home that night and that he lived about a quarter of a mile from the Madan Plastics establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Hicks \u201cviewed latent fingerprints that were taken from the scene, and.. .a panel which was taken from one of the rear doors.\u201d The panel had a \u201cunique\u201d sole impression on it. As Hicks described it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">... It was a full sole impression on the door panel itself, which had a diamond pattern in the center on the sole, and the heel had holes which appeared to be nail holes all the way around the circumference of the heel. And around these holes were other holes where the nails went in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">He \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell from the imprint on this panel,\u201d however, whether it was \u201cmade with black boots or brown boots or white boots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Upon checking into defendant\u2019s \u201cpast history\u201d Hicks discovered that there was an outstanding warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest for contempt of court, for failure to appear, issued out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Cranford Municipal Court. Thereupon, he contacted the Roselle Park Police Department and \u201ctold them [he would] like to <em>go </em>to [defendant\u2019s] residence [in] Roselle Park, and pick the defendant up on the warrant itself.\u201d He spoke with Officer Thomas Mayer of the Roselle Park Police Department, who was familiar with defendant. On November 14, less than 36 hours after the alleged burglary at Madan Plastics, Detective Hicks, armed with the information regarding defendant\u2019s possible involvement, proceeded to defendant\u2019s residence accompanied by Officer Mayer, who was in uniform, Officer Jenkins, also of the Roselle Park Police Department, and Officer Michael Cavalla of the Cranford Police Department. Hicks explained that Patrolman Mayer went along because he had \u201chad dealings with [defendant] in the past, in that [defendant] had tendencies of becoming violent with the police.\u201d Hicks also explained why he went to defendant\u2019s home at the time, stating: \u201cMy reasons were twofold; one, that we had a warrant for his arrest, and the other was I wanted to speak to him about the burglary due to the fact that he was a suspect.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Upon arriving at the premises Hicks and Patrolman Mayer went to the front door<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and rang the door bell. Defendant\u2019s aunt, Vinnie Schuha, who lived there with her sister and nephew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>(the defendant), responded. The officers identified themselves and told her they \u201cwanted to speak to Joe [defendant].\u201d She asked them \u201cinside the house\u201d and then \u201cwent upstairs to the second floor of the residence, came down, and Joe was behind her.\u201d Detective Hicks immediately identified himself, informed defendant of the outstanding arrest warrant, placed him under arrest, and told him he was going to be taken to Cranford.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Defendant, dressed in pants and a shirt, told the officers that they had just awakened him and that he wanted to go upstairs to get some shoes and a jacket. He told them to wait downstairs \u201cwhile I go upstairs and put on my shoes and grab a coat.\u201d His aunt testified that she heard defendant tell Detective Hicks \u201cto wait downstairs, he\u2019d be right down,\u201d but that Hicks said \u201cI\u2019ll have to go upstairs with you.\u201d When defendant turned around and went upstairs, the two officers, Hicks and Mayer, \u201caccompanied him up to his bedroom.\u201d Hicks explained that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d for accompanying defendant was \u201cthe fact that.. .he had a history of violence.\u201d The detective also described what occurred upstairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">We went upstairs to the bedroom, and Joe proceeded to get dressed, put [another] shirt on, he put on a pair of shoes. He walked over to his dresser to get some money to pay for the bail. And while he was at the dresser, I noticed a pair of black work boots below the dresser.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] I reached down, picked up one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the boots.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] I looked at the sole impression on the boot. And to me at that time I felt that that was the same sole impression that I had seen on the door panel up at Madan Plastics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">I picked the boots up, and I told Joe at the time I was taking the boots with me, and he wanted to know why. And not to aggravate anything at that particular time, I just told him that when we got into our headquarters I would explain to him why I seized the boots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">At the Cranford police headquarters Hicks, after comparing the soles of the boots with the impression on the door panel from Madan Plastics, informed defendant that he \u201chad a confirmation that the boots matched up with the impression on the panel.\u201d Upon being asked for a statement, defendant gave him an \u201cadmission.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge held that whether the boots were entirely or partially in plain view, their seizure by the police \u201cwould have to fall.. . because this was not plain view where the police had a right to be.\u201d He prefaced this holding by commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">It seems clear to me the police were hopeful of finding some evidence to add to whatever they had in connection with the burglary at Madan Plastics and their entire conduct in entering this house, if limited to what they were there for, which was the contempt, would have and should have begun and ended with the defendant going upstairs, coming downstairs and going with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The Lawful Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">My colleagues suggest that Detective Hicks had no right to go to defendant\u2019s residence to arrest him on the outstanding warrant for contempt of court; that defendant should rather have been called \u201cby telephone\u201d and asked \u201cto appear at headquarters.\u201d There surely is no mandate, constitutional, statutory, or otherwise, that execution of an arrest warrant, of whatever nature, be preceded by a courtesy call to the person to be arrested asking that he voluntarily turn himself in at headquarters. Beyond this, there is nothing in the record to warrant the majority\u2019s characterization of the procedure used to effect the arrest of defendant as \u201cmost anomalous.\u201d Actually, the procedure used was entirely lawful and appropriate in the circumstances. Here, the police had information from an employee at Madan Plastics which made defendant, a discharged employee of the establishment, a prime suspect in the burglary. This being so, it was apparently obvious to Detective Hicks, as it would have been to any alert investigative officer in the same situation, that defendant should be picked up and brought to Cranford for delivery pursuant to the arrest warrant, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:10-8, and for questioning about the break-in. Hicks expressed his intentions clearly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">... due to the fact that there was a warrant and I needed to speak to him, we did go there with the warrant <em>to pick him up.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">It was the easiest way for us <em>to pick him up and talk to him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">When he [defendant] came downstairs [the first time], I made him aware of the fact that we had an arrest warrant for him; and I told him that he was going to be arrested <em>and accompany us back to Cranford. </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\"><em>State v. Seiss, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269 (App.Div.1979), relied upon heavily by my colleagues and the trial judge, is obviously inapposite. There, \u201cthe police invaded defendant\u2019s home merely for the purposes of conducting an exploratory search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276. Here, the clear objective of the police was to take defendant into custody on the outstanding arrest warrant, deliver him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>to Cranford pursuant thereto and \u201ctalk to him\u201d regarding the burglary at Madan Plastics. That \u201ctechnique\u201d did not render the initial arrest on the warrant invalid nor any incriminating evidence properly resulting therefrom inadmissible. <em>See United States v. Atkinson, </em>450 F.2d 835, 840 (5 Cir.1971), <em>cert. den. </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>923, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1790, 32 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>123 (1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The Lawful Seizure of the Incriminating Boots</p>\n<p id=\"A-K\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the police, in going to defendant\u2019s residence, had planned a random search of the premises. Their expressed purpose was to arrest defendant on the outstanding warrant and bring him back to Cranford. If, after being arrested and being told that an officer would have to follow him upstairs, defendant had asked his aunt to go upstairs and bring down whatever he wanted from his bedroom, the inculpatory evidence would not then have been discovered by the police. Defendant would have been taken in custody to Cranford without first leading the police to his bedroom, and the officers would thus not have been in any position to observe the incriminating boots which were there in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Here, following his arrest on the outstanding warrant, defendant chose to return to his room after being informed by Detective Hicks that if he did so the officer would have to go with him. In the circumstances, the detective \u201chad a right to remain literally at [defendant\u2019s] elbow at all times; nothing in the Fourth Amendment is to the contrary.\u201d <em>Washington v. Chrisman, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>1, 6, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>812, 816, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>778, 785 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">... The absence of an affirmative indication that an arrested person might have a weapon available or might attempt to escape does not diminish the arresting officer\u2019s authority to maintain custody over the arrested person. See <em>Pennsylvania v Mimms, </em>434 US 106, 109-110, 54 L Ed 2d 331, 98 S Ct 330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>[332-333] (1977); <em>United States v Robinson, </em>414 US 218, 234-236, 38 L Ed 2d 427, 94 S Ct 467 [476-477], 66 Ohio Ops 2d 202 (1974). Nor is that authority altered by the nature of the offense for which the arrest was made. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The authority of the arresting officer to maintain custody over an arrested person is not something new\u2014it is well embedded in the law. <em>See, e.g., State v. Brown, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>180, 184 (App.Div.1975); <em>United States v. DiStefano, </em>555 <em>F.2d </em>1094, 1101 (2 Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Broward, </em>594 F.2d 345, 350 (2 Cir.1979), <em>cert. </em>den. 442 <em>U.S. </em>941, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2882, 61 L.Ed.2d 310 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Davenport, </em>453 <em>Pa. </em>235, 308 A.2d 85 (Sup.Ct.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Having the right \u201cto monitor the movements\u201d of defendant following the arrest, <em>Washington v. Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 7, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 785, Detective Hicks had the right to accompany defendant to his bedroom, as well as \u201cthe right to act as soon as he observed\u201d the potentially incriminating evidence, <em>id. </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 9, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 818, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786, which, according to defendant himself, could be seen there \u201cwithout looking under the dresser.\u201d Upon examining the boots and verifying their incriminating nature, the arresting officer had the right to seize them and bring them in as evidence in the burglary investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">... This is a classic instance of incriminating evidence found in plain view when a police officer, for unrelated but entirely legitimate reasons, obtains lawful access to an individual\u2019s area of privacy. The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit seizure of evidence of criminal conduct found in these circumstances. [Id. 455 <em>U.S. </em>at 9, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 818, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786-787]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\"><em>And see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>443, 465-466, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2022, 2037-2038, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>564, 582-583 (1971); <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>234, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">My colleagues\u2019 attempt to equate what happened in the case now before us with the \u201cplanned warrantless seizure\u201d condemned by Justice Stewart in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>is misguided. In <em>Coolidge </em>the police \u201cknew the automobile\u2019s exact description and location well in advance; they intended to seize it [without a warrant] when they came upon Coolidge\u2019s property. 403 <em>U.S. </em>at 472, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2041, 29 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 586-587. It was this kind of warrantless seizure, \u201cwhere the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>police know in advance the location of the evidence and intend to seize it,\u201d 403 <em>U.S. </em>at 470, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 585, that furnished the basis for a plurality holding that the seizure of Coolidge\u2019s car was unconstitutional. 403 <em>U.S. </em>at 473, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2042, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 587. In the case now before us there is not the slightest suggestion by anyone that Detective Hicks or any of the other officers knew in advance the location of the boots and intended to seize them when they came to arrest defendant. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25, 35 (1979). The record before us is clear. Hicks was at the premises to take defendant into custody on the outstanding arrest warrant and bring him back to Cranford. He made the arrest and, exercising \u201c[h]is right to custodial control\u201d over defendant, <em>Washington v. Chrisman, supra, </em>455 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. at 818, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786, accompanied defendant to the upstairs bedroom. While there he observed the suspected boots in plain view, examined them, and properly seized them upon verifying their incriminating nature. The seizure was clearly constitutional. The evidence was improperly suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">I would reverse the July 10, 1981 order under review and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The information regarding defendant\u2019s possible involvement came from \u2018another employee at Madan Plastics.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">At one point in the cross-examination of Detective Hicks, he was asked whether when he found out there was an arrest warrant outstanding against defendant for contempt of court he \u201ccould have called him on the phone and told him to come down to police headquarters.... \u201d He replied \u201cI could have, yes.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">At a later point in the cross-examination, the detective was asked, \u201cwasn\u2019t one of the main reasons that you went out there was to see whether or not you could find any shoes to match up with the investigation?\u201d He answered \u201c[t]hat was in the back of my mind, yes, it was.\u201d He insisted, however, that \u201cdue to the fact that there was a warrant and I needed to speak to him, we did go there with the warrant to pick him up.\u201d He explained that \u201c[i]t was the easiest way for us to pick him up and talk to him....\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u201cOfficer Cavalla and Officer Jenkins went to the back door of the residence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Answering the question, \u201cWhen is the exact point that you placed the defendant under arrest?\u201d Hicks testified: \u201cAt the time when he came down the stairs I notified him at that time we had an arrest warrant for him and he was under arrest and we were going to take him into Cranford.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">Defendant agreed.
