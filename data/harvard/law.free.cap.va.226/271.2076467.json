Here, Anne McComb\u2019s parents lent $4,000 to be used as a down payment on a house purchased jointly by Anne and her then husband J. C. McComb, II. J. C. gave a note to Anne\u2019s parents which was signed solely by him. In the note he described the $4,000 as money lent to him. After the house was purchased, the McCombs\u2019 marriage failed. Prior to a divorce, J. C. repaid the $4,000. While divorce proceedings were pending, Anne sued J. C., in general district court, on a certain I.O.U. in the amount of $5,000. In response to Anne\u2019s suit, J. C. filed a counterclaim in which he contended that Anne was jointly liable with him for the $4,000 loan from Anne\u2019s parents. J. C. demanded a set-off of $2,000 against any judgment Anne might secure against him. The general district court entered judgment in favor of Anne on her claim of $5,000 but granted J. C. \u2019s counterclaim and ordered a set-off of $2,000 against the $5,000 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Anne appealed the district court\u2019s decision to the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There she challenged the district court\u2019s determination that she was a joint obligor on the $4,000 loan from her parents and was thus bound to contribute to the payment made by J. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The issue was re-tried before the circuit court. The court heard the testimony of J. C., Anne, and Anne\u2019s father, Mr. Blankenship. In addition, the court considered the exhibits filed by the parties and the argument of counsel. The circuit court reached the same conclusion reached by the general district court: that J. C. was entitled to a set-off of $2,000 against the judgment secured against him by Anne because Anne was jointly obligated to repay the $4,000 loan from her parents. Anne appealed to this Court. We think the trial court was correct and we will affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>On this appeal Anne makes two assignments of error. She first contends that the trial court \u201cerred in admitting parol evidence . . . that the obligation evidenced by the note [signed by J.C.] was not the sole obligation of\u201d J. C. Next, she contends that the trial court \u201cerred in requiring contribution [from her] on a note which was the sole obligation of\u201d J. C. We will consider these matters in the order presented by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The first assignment of error concerns a question of law which can be resolved without a detailed consideration of the facts. We have stated the parol evidence rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">[P]arol evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral negotiations or stipulations is inadmissible to vary, contradict, add to, or explain the terms of a complete, unambiguous, unconditional written instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>Godwin </em>v. Kerns, 178 Va. 447, 451, 17 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1941); <em>Walker &amp; Laberge Co. </em>v. Bank, 206 Va. 683, 689, 146 S.E.2d 239, 243 (1966). In this case, the note which Anne contends cannot be varied by parol evidence reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">I J. C. McComb promise to pay on demand to Bernard or Mary Margaret Blankenship the four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) lent to me in August 1977. This to be taken care of within two (2) weeks of the request or as soon as the money can be borrowed from a lending bank if this is the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">[Signed] J. C. McComb II DDS</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Anne points to the parol evidence rule and to the note, then argues that J. C. should not be allowed, after having executed the note, to come into court and attempt to prove something entirely different from what is contained in the note. Anne\u2019s argument has some surface appeal because it quite rightly points out that J. C. is being allowed, in effect, to \u201ctalk out of both sides of his mouth.\u201d On the one hand he signs a writing that the $4,000 was lent to him while on the other hand he says the $4,000 was lent to both Anne and him as joint obligors. Yet, as inconsistent as J. C.\u2019s positions may be, the parol evidence rule is no bar to what he has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">This Court has consistently held, over the years, that the parol evidence rule operates only between the parties to a writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and has no application in a suit involving strangers to the writing nor in a suit involving one party to the writing and a stranger thereto. <em>Poff &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Ottaway, </em>191 Va. 779, 62 S.E.2d 865 (1951); <em>Harriss, Magill Co. </em>v. <em>Rodgers Co., </em>143 Va. 815, 129 S.E. 513 (1925); <em>Roselle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>110 Va. 235, 65 S.E. 526 (1909), <em>aff'd, </em>223 U. S. 716 (1912); <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>The John L. Roper Lumber Co., </em>87 Va. 381, 13 S.E. 153 (1891). In <em>Poff &amp; Co. </em>we stated the principle and the rationale that undergirds it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">It is well settled that the parol evidence rule which makes a written instrument conclusive proof of what the parties have agreed to, thus merging in it all prior negotiations, applies only to a controversy between the parties to the instrument. <em>It does not apply to a controversy between third parties, or to a controversy between a third party and one of the parties to the instrument. This is so because the stranger, not being a party to the instrument, is not bound thereby and is free to vary or contradict it, and consequently his adversary must be equally free to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">191 Va. at 788, 62 S.E.2d at 870 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). A more detailed statement of the rationale supporting the rule is found in <em>Roselle. </em>There, we wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">[T]he general rule of evidence here invoked is not of universal application, and ... it only applies to controversies between parties to the contract or instrument which is the subject matter of the controversy and their privies. It does not apply to controversies between parties to the writing and third persons. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">. . . <em>\u201cThe rule under consideration is applied only (in suits) between the parties to the instrument; as they alone are to blame if the writing contains what was not intended, or omits that which it should have contained. It cannot affect third persons, who, if it were otherwise might be prejudiced by things recited in the writings, contrary to the truth, through the ignorance, carelessness or fraud of the parties; and who, therefore, ought not to be precluded from proving the truth, however contradictory to the written statements of </em>others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>110 Va. at <em>231, 65 </em>S.E. at 527 (citations omitted) (emphasis added) (quoting 1 S. Greenleaf, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 279 (16th ed. 1899)). Here, because Anne was not a party to the note she cannot be bound by the note. She is free to contradict what is set forth therein. And because she is free to contradict the note, J. C. has the same freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We hold, therefore, with regard to the first assignment of error, that since the suit between Anne and J. C. did not involve parties to the note, J. C. was entitled, despite the existence of the note, to prove the true nature of the transaction involving Anne, Anne\u2019s parents, and J. C. even if by so doing he completely contradicted everything contained in the note. The parol evidence issue, then, was correctly decided by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We turn now to the second assignment of error which concerns whether J. C. proved a joint obligation and whether he was entitled to contribution from Anne. The trial court stated that whether a joint obligation existed was a question of the intent of the parties as determined from all the evidence. Since the lower court found that J. C. had proved a joint obligation the question on appeal is whether there is any credible evidence to support that finding. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., 222 </em>Va. 317, 322, 281 S.E.2d 804, 807 (1981). Moreover, since J. C. prevailed below we are required to consider the evidence and the reasonable inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">J. C. sought to prove that despite the existence of the note, the true circumstances were that Anne\u2019s parents made a loan of $4,000 jointly to J. C. and Anne. In that regard he called Anne as an adverse witness. She testified as follows: She admitted that in the summer of 1977 she and J. C. looked at a house located on West Seminary Avenue in Richmond, with the hopes that they could buy the house. She also admitted that at the time she and J. C. looked at the house they did not have enough money to buy it. She denied going to her parents with J. C. to ask their help in buying the house. But she admitted that she \u201ctold them the situation.\u201d When asked to explain what she meant by \u201cthe situation\u201d she responded, <em>\u201cWe </em>had to move out of the M.C.V. apartments. <em>We </em>had to have somewhere to live.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Upon further questioning, Anne admitted telling her parents that she and J. C. had seen a home that they wanted to buy. She also testified that her parents knew that she and J. C. did not have the money to buy the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>On several occasions, when asked directly to whom the loan had been made, Anne said \u201cto J. C.\u201d Yet, in response to a question whether her parents had $4,000 to lend she replied as follows: \u201cI think when <em>they </em>gave <em>us </em>the four thousand dollars it was a real struggle for my father to get it up.\u201d (Emphasis added.) J. C.\u2019s counsel then asked her about the use of the word \u201cus.\u201d Anne then reverted to the general theme of her testimony and said, \u201cJ. C. was responsible.\u201d But J. C.\u2019s counsel persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Q. Didn\u2019t you just say that your parents gave us the four thousand dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">A. <em>We </em>bought the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">(Emphasis added.) Thereafter Anne testified that \u201cWhen <em>we </em>were going to buy the house, J. C. went to my parents and told them that <em>we </em>needed four thousand dollars extra to assume a loan.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Next, J. C.\u2019s counsel asked Anne the following question which goes to the core of the case: \u201cThe money was obtained by your parents and was given to the two of you to buy this house, was it not?\u201d Anne first said that she didn\u2019t know what counsel meant by his question. The question was re-read to Anne, then she answered as follows: \u201cThe <em>two of us </em>bought the house with the money that <em>we </em>got together, yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In another series of questions, Anne was asked about the $4,000 check, who received it, to whom it was made out, where it was deposited, and for what it was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">Q. Did you ever see the check or the money that came from your parents, the four thousand dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">A. I was probably the one that put it in the bank, but I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">She testified that the check came from her parents but gave a non-responsive answer when asked whether the check was given to her. She said she did not remember what kind of check it was nor to whom it was made payable. When asked whether she endorsed the check she responded as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m sure I would have\u2014I don\u2019t know whether I did or not.\u201d She was asked again whether she \u201cgot the check.\u201d She replied, \u201c[o]ne of the two of us did. I don\u2019t know which one did.\u201d She admitted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>$4,000 was used to buy the house in the joint names of Anne and J. C. McComb.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Anne\u2019s father, Bernard Blankenship, was also called by J. C. as an adverse witness. Mr. Bankenship admitted that his daughter apprised him and his wife of the fact that Anne and J. C. were interested in buying a house. He also admitted knowing that Anne and J. C. did not have \u201ca whole lot of money because\u201d J. C. had recently finished dental school. He further admitted knowing that Anne and J. C. had been living in the M.C.V. apartments and that they had to move out since J. C. was no longer a student. Next, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Q. You and your wife offered to <em>help them </em>buy this house, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Q. You gave the two of them four thousand dollars, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">A. I gave J. C. four thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Q. You offered to help both of them, but you gave the money to J. C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">A. But J. C. came to my home and asked me for the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">Q. But you offered to help the two of them to buy the house, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">A. Well, that is what <em>they </em>were telling me that <em>they </em>were going to use the money for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">Q. You understood that is what they were going to do with the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-15\">A. As far as I knew, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-16\">Q. You understood that your daughter and her husband were looking for a place to live, and you wanted, <em>you and your wife wanted to help them </em>to get a place to live, did you not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">In response to another question Mr. Blankenship said that as far as he could remember the check for $4,000 was payable to J. C. He said this was done because J. C. was the one who asked and was \u201cthe man of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Mr. Blankenship first denied that his daughter joined in asking for a loan. Then the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Q. She [Anne] never said a thing to you about letting them have the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">A. Oh, we had talked together about letting them have the money. She didn\u2019t come to us and actually ask us to let them have the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Q. Your daughter expected you and your wife to help her and her husband to buy the house, did she not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">A. <em>Yes I told you that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">On another subject, Mr. Blankenship admitted knowing that the house being purchased by his daughter Anne and J. C. would be bought together by both of them and that both would hold title to it. He was asked again whether his daughter ever asked for the money. First he answered this way: \u201cI don\u2019t recollect. Em telling you, you\u2019re asking me, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d The question was repeated then he said: \u201cNot that I recollect. She didn\u2019t ask me.\u201d He was then asked whether his daughter was present the first time J. C. asked for a loan. He replied as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t recall that. I don\u2019t believe she was.\u201d He was more definite in stating that Anne was not present when the note was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">J. C. McComb\u2019s testimony is in direct conflict with portions of the testimony of Anne and her father. It is consistent with other portions of their testimony. According to J. C., he and Anne became interested in a house on West Seminary Avenue but did not have enough money to purchase it. He said they saw the house on a Sunday and went directly to Anne\u2019s parents\u2019 home to ask for their help in purchasing the house. J. C. said that both he and Anne \u201cdiscussed with her parents the prospective purchase of this house.\u201d He said that both he and Anne asked her parents to lend them \u201csome money to buy this house.\u201d J. C. said that Anne\u2019s parents agreed to help them. J. C. said that after the initial discussion on Sunday he heard Anne on numerous occasions talking to her mother on the telephone \u201ctrying to figure out how much money that we could borrow from them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">J. C. also said that he never saw the $4,000. He said he never knew whether the money was in cash or check or if it was a check to whom the check was made payable. He said, \u201cI just know the money ended up in our joint savings account, in the joint savings account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>J. C. said the note was written at the insistence of his wife with the help of her mother. He said Anne wanted this done because \u201cshe was upset because all the help came from her side of the family.\u201d He said Anne told him what to write down and that the words contained in the note were her words, not his. He said Anne\u2019s mother also participated in telling him what to write down.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">J. C. also testified that the Blankenships specifically agreed to lend him and Anne the $4,000 and that he heard Anne, in his presence, ask her parents to lend them the money to buy the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On another point, J. C. said that the money was not given in exchange for the note. He said that when he delivered the note, no funds were advanced, and he did not even know that the money was in his joint account until the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Viewing the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to J. C., we are bound to conclude the following: J. C. and Anne lived in apartments at M.C.V. but were required to move out because J. C. had completed dental school. However, Anne and J. C. did not have any money with which to purchase a home. Anne\u2019s parents were aware of both the foregoing facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">One Sunday, Anne and J. C. saw a house on West Seminary Avenue in Richmond that was for sale and which they wanted to purchase. Together they went immediately to visit Anne\u2019s parents. Both Anne and J. C. discussed the house with Anne\u2019s parents and both Anne and J. C. asked for their help in purchasing the house. Anne\u2019s parents agreed to lend money to Anne and J. C., together, to help them purchase the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Anne\u2019s parents secured the $4,000 requested by Anne and J. C. The money was given directly to Anne in the form of a check which she deposited in the joint savings account she maintained with her husband. The money never passed through J. C.\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Further, the money was not given in exchange for a note. After Anne\u2019s parents had agreed to lend the money, Anne insisted that J. C. give her parents a note. She, with the aid of her mother, told J. C. what to put in the note. J. C. followed their directions precisely and wrote out, in his handwriting, a note for the indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The money was used as a portion of the down payment on the house on West Seminary Avenue. The house was conveyed to J. C. and Anne as tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We find ample credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Anne and J. C. were joint obligors on a $4,000 loan made by Anne\u2019s parents to J. C. and Anne. Thus, we conclude that there was no error in the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue whether a joint obligation was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In her third argument, Anne contends that even if she was jointly obligated to repay the $4,000 loan she is not liable in contribution to J. C. because, in her view, J. C. voluntarily paid off the loan. She submits that her parents never demanded payment from J. C. and thus he was under no compulsion to pay off the loan. Anne\u2019s third argument must also be rejected because we think that in repaying the $4,000 J. C. acted under legal compulsion and not as a volunteer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The general principles concerning legal compulsion and the law of contribution are well stated in Am. Jur.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">To entitle one co-obligor to contribution from the others, it is the general rule that the <em>payment made by him must have been compulsory in the sense that he must have been under legal obligation to pay. </em>A voluntary payment which he is not under legal obligation to make does not give a right of action against his co-obligors for contribution; but <em>it is sufficient if the payment is made under a legal and fixed obligation. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">In general, a party to a common obligation is not, before an otherwise sufficient payment will entitle him to contribution, obliged to wait until his co-obligor requests payment to be made, nor is he obliged to wait until the obligee brings suit, secures judgment against him, procures an execution to issue, levies upon his goods, or otherwise extorts payment from him. <em>A payment made </em>for his own protection <em>as soon as the obligation becomes due </em>and the liability of the co-obligors is fixed <em>is, in legal contemplation, compulsory and not voluntary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">18 Am. Jur.2d <em>Contribution </em>\u00a7 11 (1965) (emphasis added). <em>See generally Midwest Mutual </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty, </em>216 Va. 926, 929, 223 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1976); and <em>Jackson Company </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>197 Va. 62, 66, 87 S.E.2d 781, 784 (1955), and authorities cited therein. Thus, if the obligation was due at the time J. C. made his payment he is entitled to contribution from Anne.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Although J. C. proved the existence of a joint obligation on which he and Anne were joint obligors, the evidence is silent as to when the obligation was to be repaid. Yet, this silence simply means that the obligation proved by J. C. was payable on demand. In <em>Young v. </em>Ellis, 91 Va. 297, 301, 21 S.E. 480, 482 (1895), we wrote as follows: \u201cAn agreement to pay money, no time being specified, is held to be an agreement to pay the same on demand. . . .\u201d <em>See McDaniel </em>v. Daves, 139 Va. 178, 187, 123 S.E. 663, 665 (1924); and 14B M.J. <em>Payment </em>\u00a7 9 (Repl. Vol. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Next, it is a rule of ancient origin in Virginia that an obligation payable on demand is due immediately. In <em>Bacon\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Bacon\u2019s Trustees, </em>94 Va. 686, 687, 27 S.E. 576, 577 (1897), we wrote as follows on this issue: \u201cA note or bond payable \u2018on demand\u2019 or \u2018on call\u2019 (which is the same thing) is payable at once, and interest and the statute of limitations commence to run from its date.\u201d In this case, then, even though Anne\u2019s parents did not demand payment from him in the sense in which that term might be used by laymen, J. C. was nevertheless, at the time he repaid the loan, under compulsion to do so because the loan was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In light of the foregoing, the decision of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> J. C.\u2019s counsel represented to the circuit court that his client had attempted to appeal the general district court\u2019s ruling on the $5,000 I.O.U. but had not been successful in doing so because the appeal \u201cwas not perfected.\u201d Thus, the only part of the case to reach the circuit court concerned the set-off.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b312-8\">STEPHENSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">I do not believe the evidence supports a finding that the debt was the joint obligation of the McCombs. To the contrary, the evidence conclusively shows that the debt was the responsibility of J. C. McComb alone. Bernard Blankenship, one of the creditors, testified that J. C. was the sole obligor, and the evidence does not indicate that Anne McComb ever promised to pay her parents or that they expected payment by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Although J. C. testified that the debt was a joint obligation, his acts totally belie his words. The note was written and signed by J. C. at a time when, according to the trial court\u2019s finding, Anne McComb was not present. It states, \u201cI J. C. McComb promise to pay . . . the four thousand dollars . . . <em>lent to me . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, it is most significant that, when J. C. satisfied the note, he paid $4,000, rather than $2,000, the amount he claims he owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Despite this evidence, the majority concludes that the trial court correctly found the McCombs jointly liable for the debt. Parental concern motivated the loan, and obviously Anne McComb benefit-ted from the money. The majority, however, confuses \u201cjoint benefit\u201d with \u201cjoint obligation.\u201d In my view, the evidence compels the conclusion that, in advancing the money, Anne\u2019s parents intended to confer a joint benefit to Anne and J. C. but to impose on J. C. alone the legal obligation to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">J. C.\u2019s voluntary payment of the debt is a further reason why his claim is meritless. Although the note was payable \u201con demand,\u201d no demand was made by the creditors. To the contrary, J. C. testified that when he wrote his father-in-law a check, Blankenship \u201ctold [him] he wouldn\u2019t take it. He said, T know you don\u2019t have it.\u2019 . . . And he gave me the check back and said, T don\u2019t want this.\u2019 \u201d Nevertheless, later the same night, J. C. went to the Blankenships and said, \u201cplease take this money because I have heard nothing but about this money for I don\u2019t know how long.\u201d Bernard Blankenship testified, \u201c[m]y wife and I never asked him for a cent of that money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The evidence is conclusive, therefore, that the creditors neither demanded payment, nor had any intention of requiring payment until J. C. was financially independent. For the doctrine of contribution to apply, \u201cthe payment must have been made upon a debt for which the defendant [Anne McComb] was legally liable at the time of the payment, and which the obligor who pays [J. C. McComb] was compellable to pay . . . .\u201d <em>Turner\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Thom, Trustee, </em>89 Va. 745, 747, 17 S.E. 323, 324 (1893). Obviously, J. C. was under no compulsion to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In sum, Anne McComb was not an obligor, and, even if she were, J. C. McComb was not compelled to satisfy the obligation. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter judgment for Anne McComb.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">COCHRAN and COMPTON, JJ., join in dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
