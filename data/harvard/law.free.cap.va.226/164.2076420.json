T. M. Graves Construction, Inc. (Graves) was the general contractor. Graves subcontracted a portion of the work to Weiler Thermospray Company (Weiler), whose job it was to apply a certain type of spray-on insulation to the ceiling and portions of the walls in the new gym. Weiler was a \u201cfranchise applicator\u201d for National Cellulose Corporation\u2019s (National\u2019s) \u201cK-13\u201d spray-on insulating material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of the size of the job and the inexperience of its men, Weiler asked National for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">National dispatched one of its field experts to Richmond who trained Weiler\u2019s men, made repairs on the spraying equipment, oversaw the setting up of the equipment, adjusted and set the controls on the equipment, and started spraying the insulation. Once the job was underway, National\u2019s representative directed Weiler\u2019s men not to alter the settings on the equipment and to carry on with the work as he had shown them.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Within one year after completion of work, the insulation began falling off the ceiling and walls of the gym. At trial, it was undisputed that the insulation fell because it did not contain sufficient glue to hold it in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Graves sued National<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that National \u201cnegligently and defectively applied the insulation.\u201d A jury returned a verdict in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>favor of Graves. The trial court set the verdict aside; it ruled that there existed a variance between Graves\u2019 pleading and its proof and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Moreover, in setting aside the verdict, the trial court did not consider all the evidence; instead, it considered only plaintiffs evidence as if it were ruling on a motion to strike at the close of plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">On appeal, Graves contends that the word \u201capplied\u201d was a term of art with regard to National\u2019s business and was broad enough to encompass Graves\u2019 proof without causing any surprise to National; that on a motion to set aside a jury verdict the trial court is required to consider the same evidence considered by the jury, that is, all the evidence; and that had the trial court considered all the evidence it would have found credible evidence to support the verdict. We agree with appellant\u2019s contentions; therefore, we will reverse the decision of the trial court and enter final judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In this case, the question of variance between pleading and proof is not difficult to resolve. The central focus is whether National was fairly on notice of the claim against it so that it was not surprised by Graves\u2019 proof. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>155 Va. 166, 179, 154 S.E. 568, 572 (1930), we said that \u201cIf the notice be such that the defendant cannot mistake the object of the motion, it is sufficient.\u201d There, we upheld a jury verdict on the ground that even if a variance existed, defendant was not surprised by it. In <em>Kennedy, </em>we went on to discuss the element of surprise as it relates to the question of variance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The rule that the proofs must correspond with the allegation is fully recognized, but like every other rule should be reasonably applied. <em>Its purpose is to prevent surprise. Where there is no surprise to the party invoking it, there is no good reason for enforcing the rule.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 180, 154 S.E. at 572 (emphasis added); <em>accord Caputo </em>v. <em>Holt, Administratrix, 217 </em>Va. 302, 228 S.E.2d 134 (1976). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in the instant appeal, if it appears that National was not surprised by Graves\u2019 proof, a variance between pleading and proof cannot serve to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-377. <em>See also </em>Rule l:4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The trial court found a fatal variance because, in its view, plaintiff alleged that National \u201cnegligently and defectively applied the insulation,\u201d but proved, if anything, that National was \u201cnegligent [in] setting up [the] equipment.\u201d Stated succinctly, the issue is whether negligent application encompasses negligent setting up of the equipment. Admissions by National\u2019s counsel and evidence adduced at trial leave no doubt that the former encompasses the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In a statement to the trial court, out of the presence of the jury, National\u2019s counsel referred to National\u2019s \u201capplication manual\u201d and advised the court that portions of it would be put into evidence. The manual, the full title of which is <em>\u201cAPPLICATION MANUAL OF K-13 SPRAY-ON-SYSTEMS </em>(September 1, 1974)\u201d was introduced into evidence as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 3. In its Index under \u201cII. <em>COMPONENT EQUIPMENT AND FUNCTIONS,\" </em>it refers to \u201cSchematic of System Equipment Set-Up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">William Murphey, one of plaintiffs witnesses and a former employee of Weiler, testified that the application process included setting up the equipment. Thomas Weiler, another of plaintiffs witnesses, gave similar testimony. More specifically he said that, \u201cdetermining the rate of flow of the fiber and the rate of the flow of the glue is all included in the application process.\u201d These determinations were made when the equipment was set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Perhaps of most significance is that defendant\u2019s key witness, Marvin Giffin, who was described as one of National\u2019s \u201cfield experts\u201d in the application of K-13 insulating material, also said that setting up equipment is part of the application process. He admitted that setting the rate of flow of glue and fiber on the equipment was part of the work he was required by National to do on the St. Christopher\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In light of the foregoing, we think that the word \u201capplied\u201d as used by Graves fully and fairly encompasses the setting up of the equipment. Therefore, we conclude that there was no variance. Moreover, even if a variance did exist, it did not surprise and could not have prejudiced National. Consequently, any such variance could not be relied upon by the trial court to set aside Graves\u2019 jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">We turn now to the question of what evidence a trial court must consider in ruling on a motion to set aside a verdict. It appears that this exact issue has never been ruled on by the Court. However, we have, over the years, in a multitude of cases, accepted the proposition that on a motion to set aside a verdict the trial court is to consider <em>all </em>the evidence. For example, in <em>Ricketts </em>v. <em>J. G. McCrory Co., </em>138 Va. 548, 560, 121 S.E. 916, 920 (1924), we discussed the standard to be applied in setting aside a verdict and went on to state that the trial court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">must be satisfied from the evidence adduced either that there was no evidence to support the verdict, or that the verdict was plainly contrary to the evidence. <em>This conclusion must be drawn from the whole evidence in the case. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">(Emphasis added; citations omitted.) <em>See Matney </em>v. <em>Cedar Land Farms, </em>216 Va. 932, 224 S.E.2d 162 (1976); <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Flippo, </em>183 Va. 839, 33 S.E.2d 757 (1945). In essence, the instant appeal gives us the opportunity to confirm that which has always been the practice in our courts; we welcome this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The reason for the rule that a trial court, when considering a motion to set aside a verdict, must consider all the evidence is simple and straightforward: the trial court, in ruling on such a motion, must place itself in the jury\u2019s shoes. It must see what the jury saw so that it can decide whether <em>any </em>credible evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict. It should be self-evident that once the jury has seen all the evidence a court, called on to test the propriety of the jury\u2019s verdict, cannot do so on less than all the evidence. Thus, on a motion to set aside a jury verdict the trial court is required to consider all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In keeping with our discussion in the preceding section, if we find any credible evidence in the record that supports the jury verdict, then that verdict must be reinstated and judgment entered thereon. <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Dodson Bros. Exterminating, </em>217 Va. 745, 232 S.E.2d 770 (1977). Moreover, in analyzing the evidence, even though the trial court set aside the jury verdict, we are nevertheless required to give plaintiff \u201cthe benefit of all substantial conflict in the evidence, and all fair inferences that may be drawn there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>from.\u201d <em>Matney, </em>216 Va. at 934, 224 S.E.2d at 163 (quoting <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>168 Va. 418, 423, 191 S.E. 768, 770 (1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">It is undisputed that the insulation fell from the ceiling and walls of the St. Christopher\u2019s gym because it did not contain enough glue to hold it in place. However, that evidence, by itself, neither proves negligence nor establishes liability on the part of National. To prove negligence and establish liability, Graves was required to show that some act or omission on the part of National proximately caused the lack of glue. In this regard, Graves contended that National, through its agent, Marvin Giffin, negligently applied the insulation. As we have seen, in the context of this case, \u201capplied\u201d did not mean the final act of spraying the insulation on the ceilings and walls at the gym. Instead, it meant the entire process from setting up the equipment, to adjusting the pressure of the glue and the rate of flow of the fiber, to spraying the mixture on the ceiling and walls. Graves\u2019 contention is that National, through Giffin, in setting up the equipment, engaged in conduct that fell below the standard of care of a reasonably prudent technician in National\u2019s Application Department, which conduct led to an insufficient amount of glue and ultimately resulted in the insulation\u2019s falling from where it had been sprayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The following facts emerge from a consideration of all the evidence: the scope of the St. Christopher\u2019s job was too great for Weiler because Weiler had only one employee with any training in the application of K-13 insulation. Weiler requested assistance from National. National responded by sending to Richmond Marvin Giffin, who had, at the time, more than seven year\u2019s experience in applying spray-on insulation, who had traveled to foreign countries on behalf of National overseeing the application of K-13, and who was described as a \u201ctechnician in the [National] Application Department.\u201d Giffin worked on the project in Richmond approximately one week. His first activity was to repair the blowing equipment, which had electrical problems that resulted in its blowing fuses. Next, Giffin helped the Weiler employees set up the equipment at St. Christopher\u2019s. The fiber-blowing machine was on a low setting and Giffin recommended that, because of the inexperience of the Weiler crew, that setting be maintained. Apparently, Giffin was of the view that an inexperienced crew could better handle the blowing equipment if it were set on a low setting than, if it were set on a medium or high setting. Weiler agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Giffin\u2019s recommendation to keep the blowing machine on a low setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Once the equipment was set up, Giffin tested it. There exists a conflict in the evidence concerning the nature of the tests conducted by Giffin on the equipment. Giffin said he conducted several tests for more than one hour to determine the rate of flow of the fiber and the proper pressure for the glue. Giffin says he followed the tests called for in the application manual. However, Graves\u2019 witness, William Murphey, disputed Giffin\u2019s testimony. According to Murphey, all Giffin did was a \u201csight check.\u201d Murphey said Giffin merely turned on the equipment and \u201clooked at it.\u201d Murphey testified that Giffin then said the insulating material coming out of the nozzles \u201clooked good to him.\u201d On this appeal we are bound to conclude that the jury believed Murphey\u2019s testimony that Giffin did nothing but make a \u201csight check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Giffin set the controls on the equipment as he deemed appropriate and instructed Weiler\u2019s men not to change those settings. Other evidence established that Giffin\u2019s settings were, in fact, never altered, even after Giffin left the jobsite. Once Giffin made his settings, the workers did nothing more than periodically change the spray nozzle on the glue gun when it became clogged. The periodic changes were necessary to maintain a proper flow of glue but did not alter Giffin\u2019s basic settings on the equipment. Once the settings were made by Giffin he taught Weiler\u2019s men how to spray and actually did some spraying himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In addition to testimonial evidence, plaintiff introduced two answers to interrogatories from National. In the first interrogatory, Graves asked National to state the proper ratio of glue to fiber in K-13 insulation. National responded as follows: \u201c.051 gallons of adhesive to one pound of fiber.\u201d In the second interrogatory, Graves asked National what was done by its representative on the St. Christopher\u2019s job to assure the proper mixture of the K-13 product. National responded as follows: \u201cNothing specifically was done for this job. All K-13 is applied with standard procedures as outlined in our application manuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Thereafter, additional evidence was adduced in National\u2019s case. Giffin admitted that on the St. Christopher\u2019s job it was his responsibility \u201cto train the crew, to see that the equipment functioned in all respects of pressure involved in every type of application.\u201d He further admitted checking \u201cthe machinery out\u201d at the jobsite to \u201csee that it was functioning properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Giffin had recommended that Weiler leave the blowing machine on a low setting and had received Weiler\u2019s concurrence in that recommendation. But Giffin testified that although the blowing equipment was set on low when he found it, he \u201cchanged it from the low speed to the medium speed.\u201d He went on to testify that at the medium speed fiber was blown out of the blowing machine at a rate of 288 pounds per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Giffin said that once he determined the rate of fiber flow he consulted a chart in the Application Manual to determine the proper nozzle pressure for the glue. He found that number to be 78 psi. He said he set the actual nozzle pressure at 80 psi, which, in his opinion, would not be harmful because it made more glue flow into the fixture than the minimum amount required by the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Giffin also testified that in addition to the nozzle pressure the glue machine had a setting for \u201cpump pressure.\u201d He set the pump pressure at 200 psi though he did not explain how he arrived at that figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In a memorandum handwritten by Giffin near the time of the St. Christopher\u2019s project, he noted the following information: \u201cpump pressure 200,\u201d \u201cnozzle [pressure] 80 pd,\u201d \u201cRPM 16 \u2014 288 pd per hr.\u201d The memorandum was admitted into evidence as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In Section II of the Application Manual, which was also a defendant\u2019s exhibit, at pages 5 and 6 of 18, the rate of flow of fiber where the blowing machine is set on low or medium speed is stated in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\"><em>Low Speed </em>is used in fine finish work; average pound fiber per machine hour \u2014 250-270.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahs\"><em>Medium Speed </em>is used in most K-13 applications. The feed rate at medium speed allows good control of the spray while keeping production footage up. Medium speed is normally used on overhead work. The spray man\u2019s capabilities will, of course, have to be taken into consideration. Average delivery in pounds of fiber per machine hour \u2014 350-360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">There exists a substantial discrepancy between the equipment settings testified to by Giffin and the results he said he obtained from those settings. This discrepancy could have led the jury to believe that Giffin set up the equipment incorrectly. Giffin testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>unequivocally that, acting alone, he changed the speed of the blowing machine from low to medium. He then testified that once the blowing machine was set on medium speed he determined the rate of flow of fiber to be 288 pounds per hour. The Application Manual shows he was mistaken. According to the manual, when the blowing machine is set on medium the rate of flow of fiber is 350 to 360 pounds per hour. It is only when the blowing machine is set on low speed that the rate of flow of the fiber is close to 288 pounds per hour. Giffin went on to testify that he made the settings for the glue on the basis of 288 pounds of fiber per hour. Because his fiber flow figure was incorrect, his glue pressure was likewise incorrect. As a result, the glue was sufficient to mix with 288 pounds of fiber per hour but was obviously insufficient to mix with 350 to 360 pounds of fiber per hour. In short, based on Giffin\u2019s testimony about his adjustments to the equipment, it is no surprise that the insulation did not contain enough glue to hold it in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Based on all the evidence, the jury was entitled to believe that National\u2019s highly touted expert set up and tested the equipment not by the manual but by sight; that he changed the setting on the blowing machine from low to medium and that because he did not make the tests called for by the Application Manual he did not discover the true rate of flow of the fiber; that, in light of National\u2019s answers to interrogatories, it was not proper for Giffin to use a sight test in lieu of procedures set forth in the manual; that he adjusted the glue pressure on the basis of erroneous information concerning the fiber flow; that once he made his settings they were never changed; and that, as a result, throughout the entire job, the amount of glue was insufficient for the amount of fiber leading to the subsequent problem of falling insulation. We think that there is more than enough credible evidence to support the jury verdict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">For all the foregoing reasons we will reverse the decision of the trial court, reinstate the jury verdict, and enter final judgment for plaintiff on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> This type insulation is a mixture of dry fiber and glue. The fiber is blown through a blowing machine. The blowing machine can be set on \u201cLow, Medium, or Hi\u201d speeds. The setting controls the rate of flow of the fiber. The glue is pumped through a pump machine and shot out through an eight-jet nozzle. The pressure on the pump machine is variable: the greater the pressure the greater the amount of glue that passes through the nozzle. The hose that blows the fiber and the nozzle that shoots the glue are bound together in such a way that the fiber and glue mix in mid-air then hit the surface on which they are being sprayed. Typically, if the fiber and glue are properly mixed, the insulating material will adhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> Originally, Church Schools in the Diocese of Virginia, the entity which operates St. Christopher\u2019s School, sued Graves. <em>Church Schools in the Diocese of Virginia </em>v. <em>T. M. Graves Construction, Inc., </em>at Law No. 1418 (Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Division I, filed November 24, 1978).
