The jury fixed his punishment for rape at confinement in the penitentiary for life. In the second part of the bifurcated proceeding required by Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4 in the capital murder case, the jury fixed Coleman\u2019s sentence at death. On April 23, 1982, after considering the probation officer\u2019s report, the trial court imposed the death sentence; in the same order, the court entered judgment on the jury verdict in the rape case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have consolidated the automatic reivew of Coleman\u2019s death sentence with his appeal of his conviction of capital murder and have given them priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The evidence against Coleman was entirely circumstantial; it will be stated in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Bradley D. McCoy, 21, testified that on the date of the murder he and his wife, Wanda Fay McCoy, who was 19, lived on the outskirts of Grundy in a rented house at Long Bottom on Slate Creek. The McCoys, who had been married for two and one-half years, had no children. Wanda was not employed; her husband was a parts clerk for United Coal Company, working the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>shift from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. On March 10, 1981, at 2:15 p.m., McCoy went to work, leaving Wanda at home alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">McCoy testified that about 9:00 p.m. he telephoned Wanda \u201cto see if she was okay.\u201d They talked about 10 or 15 minutes, discussing among other things how they would spend an anticipated income tax refund. McCoy said he always telephoned his wife at this time, when he took a break from work, because she was \u201cmore or less afraid to stay by herself\u2019 and was \u201cshy.\u201d She did not indicate anyone was with her and McCoy believed she would have told him \u201cif anyone was there or had been there that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">At the end of his shift, McCoy drove home in his car, arriving about 11:15 p.m. Although Wanda usually left the porch light on for him, no outside lights were shining when he knocked on the door; Wanda usually kept both the storm door and the wooden front door locked. Receiving no answer, McCoy opened the storm door, which was unlocked, then opened the front door with his key, and entered the living room. He saw that the coffee table had been moved, there were \u201cslight drips of blood on the floor,\u201d and the light and the television were on. He called for Wanda but heard nothing. Going to the back bedroom, where a light was on, he found his wife lying on her back on the floor. Her hair was pulled over her face, she had a wound in her chest, and there was blood beside her head. Her arms were stretched behind her head and her legs were lying straight out and apart. She appeared to be dead; McCoy did not touch her. He found no signs of forced entry into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">McCoy telephoned his father, Max McCoy, known as Hezzie, who lived 400 to 500 yards away, and told him that Wanda had been killed. McCoy turned on the porch light, initially waited for his father, but after a few minutes ran to meet him. After Hezzie called the sheriff\u2019s office at 11:21 p.m., McCoy and his father returned to McCoy\u2019s house, looked at the body but did not touch it, and met the police officers who began to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">McCoy said that Coleman\u2019s wife was a younger sister of Wanda\u2019s, that the Colemans lived in the home of Coleman\u2019s grandmother, which was a five-minute walk from the McCoy house, and that on the night before Wanda\u2019s death the Colemans stopped by the McCoys\u2019 but only Coleman\u2019s wife came into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Sergeant Steven D. Coleman, of the Buchanan County Sheriff\u2019s Department, arrived about 11:25 p.m. accompanied by another of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ficer. He tried to check Wanda\u2019s neck for a pulse but found it \u201cso badly torn up\u201d that he could not do so. There was a large gaping hole in the front of her neck; a pool of blood was around her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Other local and state law enforcement officers promptly came to the McCoy house to assist in the investigation. Randall S. Jackson, Chief of Police for the Town of Grundy, arrived about 11:27 p.m. He observed what appeared to be bloodstains on the floor and wall of the living room, and \u201ctracks of blood, where something had been dragged\u201d through the hallway and into the bedroom in which he found Wanda\u2019s body. Jackson felt her wrist, which was \u201cvery warm,\u201d but found no pulse. He sent an officer for Dr. Thomas D. McDonald, the medical examiner, and arranged to secure the premises. At daybreak, Jackson measured the depth of Slate Creek, located 75 to 100 yards from the McCoy house, at 10 to 12 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Dr. McDonald, who lived nearby, arrived at 11:35 p.m. He made a superficial examination of Wanda, confirmed that she was dead, but did not move her pending the arrival of a State Police special investigating unit. Wanda was lying on her back, partially clothed, with her panties around her left ankle, arms over her head, and legs extended. She had a large laceration of the neck and two puncture wounds in her chest. Dr. McDonald determined that the cause of death was the \u201cslashing wound to the throat.\u201d The body was still warm, rigor mortis had not set in, and Dr. McDonald estimated that Wanda had died about 10:30 p.m., or within 30 minutes before or after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">A neighbor testified that when she took the trash out of her house about 10:30 p.m. she saw the porch light burning at the McCoy residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The Commonwealth offered color photographs showing the scene of the crime and different views of the victim\u2019s body. Over Coleman\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted 14 of the photographs after excluding two as repetitious and one as inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The victim\u2019s body was removed to Roanoke where Dr. David W. Oxley performed an autopsy on March 12. Dr. Oxley testified that death was caused by a \u201cslash wound\u201d of the throat with cutting of the \u201cright carotid artery, jugular vein and larynx.\u201d He also found two stab wounds in the chest. One, measuring <em>VA </em>inch by 1/16 inch, with a depth of 4 inches, had penetrated the heart and lung. Because there was little or no hemorrhaging from this wound Dr. Oxley concluded it had been inflicted after death. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>other, measuring 1% inch by 1/16 inch, also with a depth of 4 inches, had penetrated the liver; Dr. Oxley was of opinion that this wound was inflicted after death or close to the time of death. He described the neck wound as a single cut, two to three inches in depth without \u201chesitation marks,\u201d leading from the right side of the neck to the left and downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Dr. Oxley found two foreign hairs in the victim\u2019s genital area. He submitted these, samples of her pubic hairs, blood, swabs from her mouth, hands, vagina, and rectum, and the panties found wrapped around her left foot, to Elmer Gist, Jr., a forensic scientist.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Out of the presence of the jury, the trial court conducted a hearing on the admissibility of statements made by Coleman on March 11 and 12 to Jack E. Davidson, Special Agent with the Virginia State Police, one of the investigating officers. Davidson testified there were several suspects, including Coleman, whose activities police were \u201cexploring at that particular time.\u201d He and another officer went to Coleman\u2019s grandmother\u2019s residence on March 11 and asked Coleman \u201cif it was all right, if he could talk to us.\u201d According to Davidson, Coleman said \u201csure,\u201d and the interview was conducted, beginning at 12:32 p.m., as the two sat in Davidson\u2019s car; the other officer remained at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Davidson explained that he did not give Coleman <em>Miranda </em>warnings because the suspect was \u201cnot in an accusatory status\u201d but was \u201cin an investigative status.\u201d Davidson said Coleman was not under arrest and was free to go at any time. The officer was unable to record his interview because of a malfunction of the equipment; but he made notes of Coleman\u2019s statement. Coleman was a coal miner, employed by T J and M Coal Company. His statement was exculpatory, purporting to account in detail for his time on the night of the killing. Thus, he said he left his home at 8:30 p.m., left the Speedy Market at 9:05 p.m., went to other listed places at specified times before and after finding that his shift at the mine had been terminated, and arrived at 10:50 p.m. at the bathhouse in town where he took a shower and changed his clothes before returning home.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">When Davidson asked Coleman for the clothes he wore that night, Coleman turned over to him a plastic bag of clothing and a knife. In the bag was a pair of dirty blue jeans; the bottom 10 to 12 inches of each pants leg were wet. Davidson had the clothing delivered to the Bureau of Forensic Science in Roanoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>On March 12, Davidson interviewed Coleman again. Davidson testified that Coleman was still a suspect, but was free to leave if he wished to do so, and was not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Davidson told Coleman that he had investigated the mine site and found there was no water there to get his blue jeans wet. Coleman then said when he took a shower at the bathhouse, he probably laid his blue jeans down and water from the shower got them wet. Subsequently, Coleman relinquished another knife to Davidson. Coleman was arrested on April 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Over Coleman\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled the statements of March 11 and 12 were admissible because Coleman gave them when he was neither under arrest nor in a \u201ccustodial interrogation situation\u201d but instead was free to leave; <em>Miranda </em>warnings, therefore, were not required. A portion of one of the statements relating to polygraph examinations was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On March 13, Davidson testified, he met Coleman \u201cat his in-laws\u2019 residence\u201d and asked if he would consent to a search for body fluids and hair. Davidson said Coleman agreed and, after being informed of his constitutional right to insist upon a search warrant, signed a consent authorizing a warrantless search of his body. The consent permitted removal of any property \u201cor body fluids.\u201d Davidson testified that Coleman also consented to have samples of body hair taken. Over Coleman\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled, on the basis of Davidson\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, that Coleman had consented to a search of his body and that all items taken in the search would be admissible. Davidson stated that samples of Coleman\u2019s blood, head hairs, pubic hairs, and saliva were taken and mailed to the Bureau of Forensic Science.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Elmer Gist, Jr., a forensic serologist employed by the Commonwealth of Virginia Bureau of Forensic Science, testified that he made an analysis of the items delivered to him by Dr. Oxley and the investigating officers. He said the two apparently foreign hairs found in Wanda\u2019s pubic area were, in fact, not those of the victim but were consistent with pubic hair samples taken from Coleman. Gist concluded that these two hairs came either from Coleman or, by a possible but unlikely coincidence, from some other person of the same race whose hair had the same color, diameter, general configuration, and microscopic characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Gist testified that Coleman was a secretor, one whose \u201cblood type factor\u201d is present \u201cin semen, saliva or other body fluids,\u201d and that 80% to 85% of the population are secretors. Gist determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that Coleman had Type B blood, a rare type possessed by only 10% of the population. Wanda\u2019s blood was type O, a type which 40% to 45% of the population have; her husband\u2019s was Type A. From Gist\u2019s examination of the vaginal specimen taken from the victim\u2019s body he found that spermatozoa had been deposited in her vagina by a secretor with Type B blood. He also determined that a bloodstain on Coleman\u2019s blue jeans was made by Type O human blood. Gist found blood on one of Coleman\u2019s knives but not in sufficient quantity to enable him to determine whether it was human or animal blood. According to Gist, Coleman\u2019s blue jeans were dirty and had \u201cblackish stains on the upper legs in particular.\u201d Photographs of the victim depicted a very dark, fine substance on her hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Charles Crabtree, owner of the Speedy Market, testified that Coleman came into his store on March 10 about 8:00 p.m. and stayed about ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Gary Scott Stiltner testified that on March 10 he was scheduled to work his regular 3:30 to 11:30 shift but had not gone to work. About 10:15 or 10:20 p.m. Coleman came to his trailer in Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park,, where he and his wife, Sandra, and infant daughter lived, and asked for the return of a tape which Stiltner\u2019s wife had borrowed. Upon receiving the tape, Coleman departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Sandra K. Stiltner recounted an incident that occurred on Friday, March 6. Shortly after her husband went to work that afternoon, Coleman stopped by her trailer and discussed tapes with her and a neighbor. During a brief interval when they were alone, Coleman asked her what she liked to drink and offered to get her whatever she wanted, but she declined and left to join other neighbors. Sandra Stiltner also testified that when Coleman stopped by for his tape on March 10 she glanced at a clock and noticed that it was 10:20 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Roger L. Matney, a convicted felon, testified that when he had been incarcerated in the same cell block with Coleman in the county jail, Coleman had described for him the killing and rape of the victim. According to this witness, Coleman drew on a newspaper a diagram of the McCoy house and said he and another man were in the house and after the victim\u2019s husband called her about 9:00 p.m., Coleman\u2019s companion cut her and she began to scream. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Matney believed Coleman said the other man was \u201cDanny Ray.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Coleman told Matney the two men took the victim to the bedroom and both raped her. The knife \u201cwas supposed\u201d to have been hidden under Black Watch Bridge. Coleman began to say something about a paper towel when the conversation ended. (Other evidence of the Commonwealth showed that a paper towel was found near the victim\u2019s body).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence by the Commonwealth, Coleman moved to strike the evidence as to the charge of capital murder because Matney\u2019s testimony showed that Coleman did not inflict the fatal wound. The trial court, concluding that the Commonwealth was not bound by Matney\u2019s testimony relating to statements alleged to have been made to him by Coleman, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Elmer T. Miller, a forensic scientist, testifying for the defense, said that from his examination of swabs received from Dr. Oxley he determined that the very dark, fine substance found on the victim\u2019s hands was soil and particles of plant material, not coal dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Other witnesses for the defense testified to times and places they had seen Coleman on the night of the crimes. Kermit Stiltner said he saw Coleman at the Speedy Market about 8:00 p.m. and talked with him 10 or 15 minutes. Johnny L. Stiltner, a night watchman at T J &amp; M Coal Company, who also regularly drove miners to the mine, saw Coleman in work clothes at Breeding\u2019s Store about 9:25 p.m. and told him Coleman had been \u201claid off\u2019 his job which normally began at 9:30. Coleman followed Stiltner to the mine, \u201cgot his stuff,\u201d and left between 9:30 and 9:45. Ronald G. Perkins, second shift foreman at T J &amp; M Coal Company, saw Coleman about 10:00 p.m. when he came to the mine for his boots and hat. Coleman was bearing blue jeans, which the witness did not think were wet. Philip VanDyke, who worked at another mine, met Coleman at the mouth of Looney\u2019s Creek about 10:10. They talked for 10 to 15 minutes and parted company about 10:25 to 10:30. Other evidence established that from the mouth of Looney\u2019s Creek it was approximately four miles to the McCoys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>neighborhood and eight miles to Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park, the McCoy residence being approximately halfway between the two. VanDyke clocked in at his mine across the creek at 10:41. Gary Owens saw Coleman alone in his truck near the Gary Scott Stiltner trailer between 10:00 and 11:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Coleman\u2019s wife, Patricia, 17, testified that between 8:00 and 8:30 on March 10 her husband left for work from his grandmother\u2019s house where they were living. She did not recall when he came home but he explained that he had returned early because he had been \u201claid off.\u201d The night before the murder, she and Coleman drove to the McCoys\u2019 house. Patricia returned some recipes to her sister while Coleman remained in the truck. The Colemans often visited the McCoys and \u201ca couple of times\u201d stayed with Wanda when her husband was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Garnett M. Coleman testified that Coleman was her grandson but she and her husband had adopted him when he was 14 and he had lived with her nearly all his life. According to her, Coleman left to go to work on March 10 about 8:30 and returned about 11:05. She said that she \u201cgot mixed up\u201d when she first told one of the investigating officers Coleman came home at 11:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Coleman, 23, testified in his own defense. He described the events at Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park on March 6. That day, he said, he and David Keller got off work about 6:30 or 7:00 a.m., went to the trailer of Keller\u2019s brother, Tom, and spent the day drinking. Several of them went to the Stiltner trailer and in the company of Sandra Stiltner listened to tapes, including one Coleman brought from his truck. After 30 to 45 minutes, Coleman departed, forgetting to take his tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Coleman\u2019s testimony about his activities on March 10 closely followed the statement he gave to Special Agent Davidson on March 11. Coleman said he left home at 8:30, drove to the Speedy Market, got a box there, talked to Crabtree and Kermit Stiltner, and left about 9:05. He drove to the mouth of Looney\u2019s Creek, arriving at 9:10, but his transportation to the mines had already left. He drove on to Breeding\u2019s Store, where he found the \u201cman trip\u201d (vehicle used to transport workers to the mines) stopped. Johnny Stiltner and David Keller were there; Stiltner told Coleman his shift had been laid off. After five or ten minutes Coleman drove back to Grundy but remembering that he had left his mining equipment at the mine, he turned around about 9:25 or 9:30, and drove to the mine site, arriving about 9:45 or 9:50. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>talked to Perkins, the second-shift foreman, Johnny Stiltner, and David Keller. Leaving the mine site about 10:00 he met VanDyke on the road. At the mouth of Looney\u2019s Creek they talked for 15 or 20 minutes. Coleman said he looked at his watch for the exact time only at 8:30 when he left home and about 9:05 when he left the Speedy Market. All other times to which he testified were estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Coleman said he drove to Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park to see Tom Keller but when he discovered the lights were out at Keller\u2019s trailer he went to the Stiltner trailer and retrieved the tape he had left there. It was then about 10:40 to 10:45. Coleman drove to the bathhouse in Grundy, arrived about 10:50, showered, left about 11:00, and was at home about 11:05. His pants probably got wet when he threw his work clothes on the floor of the shower. He said the blue jeans he had been wearing that evening were the pants he had worked in the two previous evenings. He acknowledged that on March 11 he told Davidson that he probably got his pants wet at the mines. He conceded that in going from the mouth of Looney\u2019s Creek to Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park and then to the bathhouse he passed the McCoys\u2019 residence, but he denied having stopped there or having murdered or raped Wanda McCoy. He found out about the crimes when Peggy Stiltner, his wife\u2019s sister, came to his grandmother\u2019s house after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Coleman denied having made any admission to Matney or any other inmate of the jail. He said he had heard some details of the crime from his wife\u2019s family. He related to inmates what he had learned, that the victim\u2019s throat had been cut, she had been stabbed twice, she only had her socks on, and a paper towel had been found. According to Coleman, his uncle, who apparently got the information from Randall Jackson, told him about the towel.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On cross-examination Coleman acknowledged that he knew Bradley McCoy worked the second shift. Later in his testimony, when he was asked how Type O blood got on his blue jeans, he replied that the cat at his house might have scratched someone there, or that someone at the mine the night before might have been cut. Coleman was then shown a picture of the victim depicting blood on her right leg and was asked whether the blood on the left leg of his pants had not actually come from the right leg of the victim. An objection to this question was overruled; Coleman answered in the negative. Coleman said the blood found on one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>his knives was from squirrels he had killed in September or October.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Coleman said \u201c[i]t seemed like . . . [the officers] came just about every other day, sometimes every day, for three or four days in a row,\u201d he was willing to talk with them and he cooperated because he was \u201ctrying to clear\u201d himself \u201cso the police would go on and find who did this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Commonwealth called two rebuttal witnesses. Patricia Coleman said she was not aware the cat had scratched anyone in such a fashion as to cause blood to get on her husband\u2019s blue jeans; Randall Jackson denied having told Coleman\u2019s uncle about a paper towel found at the scene of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Shortly before 11:00 p.m. on March 18, 1982, the jury found Coleman guilty of capital murder. On the next morning, Coleman\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the ground the evidence was insufficient was denied. The sentencing phase of the trial followed promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Brenda F. Rife, 36, testified as a witness for the Commonwealth. She described an attempted rape committed by Coleman on April 7, 1977. On that date, the witness stated, because of flooding several days earlier, electric and telephone services were cut off and all the schools were closed. As she was a school teacher, she remained at home with her six-year-old daughter after her husband left for work that morning. Coleman, whom she had never seen before, was admitted to the house when he asked for a drink of water. After some conversation, Coleman pulled a gun and forced her to tape her daughter\u2019s hands and feet and place her in a child\u2019s rocking chair. Coleman then walked Mrs. Rife at gunpoint upstairs to the bedroom where he ordered her to undress. When she refused, he ripped open the bathrobe she wore, threw her on the bed, and got on top of her. She struggled, scratched the intruder on the neck, and attempted to dissuade him from his purpose. Seizing an opportunity to escape when Coleman went for his gun, which he had laid down, Mrs. Rife ran downstairs, picked up her daughter, and fled from the house. Coleman ran after them and attempted to pull them back inside but in the ensuing struggle Mrs. Rife seized his weapon, threw it under the porch, and screamed for help. As neighbors came to the rescue, Coleman ran away. The entire episode lasted approximately ten minutes, according to Mrs. Rife, and throughout this time Cole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>man \u201cnever really raised his voice,\u201d which she described as \u201c[v]ery cold.\u201d She recalled, \u201cIt was just like, do it or die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Commonwealth introduced a certified copy of Coleman\u2019s conviction for the attempted rape of Brenda Rife. He was sentenced to serve three years in the State penitentiary by order entered July 29, 1977, by the Circuit Court of Buchanan County.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The defense called two ministers as witnesses. Thomas F. Bradley, a jail chaplain, visited Coleman six days a week during the period of three months prior to trial when Coleman had been incarcerated in jail in Bristol. Bradley stated that his communications with Coleman were privileged. Contrary to the recommendation of his attorneys, Coleman declined to waive the privilege and asserted that he did not want to appear to be \u201cusing the Lord\u201d in any way. The minister testified that he believed Coleman was sincere in his religious convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Michael Trent, minister of Little Prater Church of Christ, had known Coleman since he was about nine years old but had not had \u201ca good connection with him\u201d during the past ten years. He had come to know him personally after Coleman was incarcerated. Coleman decided to be baptized about a month after he was first confined and, at his request, Trent baptized him in jail. Coleman pursued Bible study in jail; Trent believed he was sincere.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Coleman testified again in his own behalf. He said that after the jury found him guilty it made no difference whether the penalty was death or life imprisonment, that \u201c[i]t\u2019s up to the Lord now, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">On appeal, Coleman challenges the denial by the trial court of his motion for a change of venue, rulings of the court during the guilt phase of the trial, and the sufficiency of the evidence of his guilt. He has not alleged that errors were committed during the sentencing phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">I. Change of Venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Coleman filed a pretrial motion for a change of venue. At a hearing on the motion, Coleman presented five newspaper articles appearing in a newspaper of local circulation in Buchanan County to show that there was prejudice against him in that jurisdiction. The Commonwealth presented numerous affidavits of citizens stating that Coleman could receive a fair trial in Buchanan County. By order entered January 5, 1982, the trial court denied the motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Coleman notified the court by letter dated February 15, 1982, that he was not satisfied with his attorneys\u2019 efforts to obtain a change of venue, that his uncle was obtaining signatures on a petition stating that Coleman could not receive a fair trial in the county, that a sign at a local gas station in Grundy stated in reference to the case, \u201cTime for another hanging in Grundy,\u201d and that he had received threats of death or bodily harm. No petition was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It appears from the record that the trial court questioned forty-two prospective jurors, and excused fourteen because they had formed an opinion as to guilt or innocence and eight because they were unwilling to impose the death penalty under any circumstances. Coleman then renewed his motion for a change of venue. The trial court denied the motion but stated that \u201cmuch leniency\u201d would be granted to Coleman\u2019s counsel in proceeding with individual <em>voir dire </em>of each of the twenty prospective jurors remaining. Moreover, the court gave assurances that if the <em>voir dire </em>so justified the court would consider another renewal of the motion. Extensive and searching <em>voir dire </em>was conducted. On motion of Coleman\u2019s counsel, the trial court struck for cause and replaced one member of the panel who did not satisfy the court that he fully understood the presumption of innocence to which the defendant was entitled. Coleman\u2019s counsel made no other motions to strike for cause and did not renew the motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Coleman acknowledges that a motion for a change of venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose action in overruling the motion will not be reversed unless the record shows an abuse of discretion. <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 247, 257 S.E.2d 797, 801 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). He also concedes that the burden is on him as the moving party to rebut the presumption that he can receive a fair trial by a local jury in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 257 S.E.2d at 801. Coleman argues, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We disposed of a similar contention in <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 41, 49-50, 286 S.E.2d 172, 176-77 (1982) where the factual situation was analogous. Here, as in <em>Clanton, </em>the record fails to show any widespread prejudice against the defendant in the jurisdiction where the crime was committed. The trial court, while exercising commendable caution in excusing any pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>spective juror whose impartiality appeared to be doubtful, had no unusual or unexpected difficulty in impaneling a jury free from bias. All the jurors who were impaneled assured the court they had formed no opinions as to Coleman\u2019s guilt or innocence and would decide the case on the basis of the evidence in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Coleman\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">II. Admissibility of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">A. Coleman\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Coleman argues that the statements which he gave to Special Agent Davidson on March 11 and 12, 1981, were given during custodial interrogation when he had not been given the warnings against self-incrimination mandated by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and were, therefore, inadmissible. He relies primarily upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>392 F.2d 373, 376 (4th Cir. 1968), stating that custodial interrogation \u201cincludes all station-house or police-car questioning initiated by the police,\u201d and also upon <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ballone, </em>658 F.2d 218 (4th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">We are not persuaded by <em>Gibson </em>or <em>Moore </em>that Coleman was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The language quoted above from <em>Gibson </em>is dicta; indeed, that decision held that a suspect who was located in a tavern by a police officer, asked to step outside, and questioned on the sidewalk, was not the subject of custodial interrogation. Thus, although <em>Miranda </em>warnings had not been given, the statement was held to be admissible. In <em>Moore, </em>the statement of a suspect who had been taken to a police station, questioned extensively, and told many times that if he talked he could leave, was held to have been given during custodial interrogation and was excluded because no <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been given. The numerous circumstances indicating that the suspect in <em>Moore </em>was in custody are not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The Supreme Court has made it clear that the prescribed warnings must be given before statements are taken from suspects only where there is custodial interrogation as thus defined in Miranda: \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>It is the custodial nature rather than the location of the interrogation that triggers the necessity for giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 346 (1976). Thus, under certain circumstances police must inform a suspect of his constitutional rights even though he is questioned in his home. <em>See Orozco </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324 (1969). Conversely, the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is not required in every case where a suspect is interrogated at police offices. <em>See Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In <em>Mathiason, </em>a suspect came to police offices at an officer\u2019s request and was there questioned about and confessed to a burglary. The officer informed the suspect he was not under arrest, but that he was believed to be involved in the burglary. The officer also made the false statement that the suspect\u2019s fingerprints had been found at the scene. After a few minutes, the suspect confessed, and the confession, not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was held to be admissible. The Supreme Court held that it was clear from the record that the suspect\u2019s freedom to leave the police station was not restricted in any significant way. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required, the Court held, unless the suspect\u2019s freedom has been so restricted as to render him \u201cin custody.\u201d 429 U.S. at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 740, 160 S.E.2d 793 (1968), cited by Coleman, we held that the defendant was in custody at the sheriff\u2019s office when he confessed. Members of his family were denied access to him during various interrogations and his freedom was significantly restricted. 208 Va. at 747, 160 S.E.2d at 798. We held that failure to give the defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings rendered his confession inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The trial court in the present case found that the statements were taken from Coleman during non-custodial interrogation. The evidence supports this finding. Special Agent Davidson testified that Coleman was one of several suspects interviewed at the investigatory stage about the crime. Coleman\u2019s statements were exculpatory rather than inculpatory and Coleman was not arrested until a month after he gave the statements. He was asked to cooperate and, as he freely admitted when testifying in his own defense, he did so voluntarily. We hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that Coleman\u2019s statements of March 11 and 12, 1981, except for irrelevant matter deleted without objection, were admissible as statements given during non-custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>B. Photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Coleman says the trial court erred in admitting in the guilt phase several photographs of the victim\u2019s body which he claims were unduly inflammatory. In particular, he objects to Commonwealth Exhibits 7, 8, 10, and 17. All were color photographs. Exhibit 7 showed the position of the body when it was found. Exhibits 8 and 10 showed the victim\u2019s hands with dark stains and blood on them. Exhibit 17 was a photograph, taken by Dr. Oxley at the autopsy room in Roanoke, showing the slashing wound to the victim\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The trial court examined all the photographs proffered by the Commonwealth, excluded three, and, relying on <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 251 S.E.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979), admitted fourteen, including Exhibits 7, 8, 10, and 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The admissibility of photographs is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. at 51, 286 S.E.2d at 177; <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 270, 257 S.E.2d 808, 816 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980). We reject Coleman\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting any of these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Exhibit 7 tended to support other evidence that the victim\u2019s body had been dragged from the living room through the hallway and into the bedroom. It also corroborated other evidence that the victim\u2019s panties were wrapped around her left ankle. Exhibit 8 showed the victim\u2019s left hand resting on the floor. Exhibit 10 showed her right hand in a similar position. There were fresh spots of blood on the floor near her left hand. Both hands, including her fingernails, were discolored, from which a reasonable inference might be drawn that she struggled with her assailant and got dirt on her hands from his clothing. Exhibit 17 showed the nature and extent of the fatal wound. Dr. Oxley described the measurements of the wound. The photograph itself, however, showing the wound after blood had been wiped away from other parts of the body, was relevant to a determination that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. Moreover, an autopsy photograph by its very nature is more clinically objective and less bloody than one taken at the scene of a violent crime. That the photographs were harmful to Coleman is undeniable. Much of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence in this case, as in every case, was prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>udicial to the defendant. But to be inadmissible, the photographs had to be so inflammatory that they would tend to induce a guilty verdict, regardless of the other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the photographs in the guilt trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">C. Evidence obtained in body search.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Coleman signed a consent to a warrantless search of his body. The consent did not expressly authorize the removal of hair, and Coleman argues that the scope of the search and the ensuing seizure was limited by the language of the authorization. <em>See Lugar </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 609, 202 S.E.2d 894 (1974). Consequently, he says the trial court erred in admitting body hairs that he alleges were improperly removed from him at the same time body fluids were properly taken. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The consent form signed by Coleman authorized \u201ca complete search\u201d of his body. Special Agent Davidson testified that he explained to Coleman when the consent was signed what items were sought. Davidson stated that the words \u201cor body fluids\u201d were written on the form before Coleman signed. Davidson also said he informed Coleman that body hairs were needed and Coleman orally consented to have such hairs removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Consent to search may be oral as well as written. <em>See Lowe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 670, 239 S.E.2d 112 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 930 (1978). The trial court, based on Davidson\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, found that Coleman consented to the search for the items proffered in evidence by the Commonwealth. We agree. The consent authorized seizure of these items, and we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the products of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">III. Cross-examination of Coleman by the Commonwealth Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Elmer Gist, Jr., the serologist, testified that there was Type O blood on Coleman\u2019s blue jeans. He did not specify where on the pants he found the blood. When the blue jeans were offered in evidence, Coleman\u2019s objection to their admissibility on the basis of a break in the chain of custody was sustained, and the blue jeans were excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Coleman, asked by his counsel on direct examination whether the pants he wore on the night of the murder were dirty, replied that there was coal dust on them. During extensive cross-examination, the Commonwealth Attorney questioned Coleman as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Q. Now, sir, I will show you a picture of Wanda Fay Thompson McCoy\u2019s legs and it shows blood here on her right leg. Isn\u2019t that how blood got on the left leg of your pants, from her leg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Defense counsel objected that there was no evidence as to blood on the left leg of the pants. The Commonwealth Attorney replied that Gist\u2019s evidence showed there was Type O blood on the left leg of the pants, and the trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The questioning continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">Q. Isn\u2019t that how you got blood on those pants? You were down on her raping her and you got blood on your pants, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">Q. And your left leg came in contact with her right leg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">Coleman says the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s question based upon an incorrect statement that the evidence showed Type O blood on the left leg of the blue jeans. The Commonwealth Attorney could properly cross-examine Coleman as to matters brought out on direct examination, including the condition of his clothing. The cross-examination could properly focus on the presence of blood on Coleman\u2019s blue jeans. Although the Commonwealth Attorney, in responding to Coleman\u2019s objection, incorrectly stated there was testimony from Gist that blood was on the left leg of the blue jeans, he could properly ask Coleman if the blood was not on the left leg and if the blood had not come from the victim\u2019s right leg during his commission of rape. Coleman answered all the questions in the negative, just as he answered in the negative questions asked on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>examination whether he had committed the crime charged or was present in the McCoy house when Wanda McCoy was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The trial court did not err in overruling Coleman\u2019s objection to the questions. The Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s question suggested a possible and reasonable explanation for the presence of human blood on Coleman\u2019s pants. Coleman was free to and did deny this and other aspects of the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the events which took place on the night of March 10, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">IV. Instruction XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The trial court, over Coleman\u2019s objection, gave the jury Instruction XIII which read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The Court instructs the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">When the death of the victim occurs in connection with rape, it shall be immaterial in the prosecution thereof whether the alleged rape occurred before or after the death of the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Coleman says the court erred in giving this instruction because there was no evidence whether the victim was dead before or after the alleged rape. Coleman also says the instruction was unnecessary because of Instruction IV. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Instruction XIII was based on Code \u00a7 18.2-63.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court gave it because it was \u201chelpful to the jury.\u201d Without the instruction, the jury might have been misled. Instruction IV only provided as to the capital murder charged in this case that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cthe killing was of a person during the commission of rape.\u201d The jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the victim was murdered first and then raped. Without the guidance of Instruction XIII the jury might have concluded that Coleman could not be found guilty of capital murder if the rape had been committed after the murder. The trial court, therefore, did not err in granting Instruction XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>V. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Coleman moved to set aside the verdict of guilty on the ground that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict. He argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic evidence was not unqualified and that, based on other evidence of the Commonwealth showing times and distances, he could not possibly have committed the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The victim died between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. As there was no evidence of forced entry into her house, the jury reasonably could infer that she knew her assailant and voluntarily admitted him. Coleman was her brother-in-law, had with his wife visited in the house when the victim\u2019s husband was at work, and knew the husband worked the second shift. Two witnesses placed Coleman at Boyd\u2019s Trailer Park approximately four miles from the McCoy residence, about 10:20. The McCoys\u2019 porch light was still shining around 10:30. McCoy found his wife\u2019s body upon returning from work about 11:15. These times were not fixed with scientific precision, but were only estimates believed to be reasonably accurate. In any event, however, they readily disprove Coleman\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that he could not have been at the McCoy house when the crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The legs of Coleman\u2019s blue jeans were wet for 10 to 12 inches from the bottom; Slate Creek, not more than 100 yards from the victim\u2019s house, was 10 to 12 inches deep the morning following the crimes. The jury reasonably could infer that Coleman waded across the creek to and from the McCoy residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Roger Matney testified that Coleman confessed that he raped the victim after his companion killed her, and that Coleman mentioned a paper towel. The jury reasonably could have concluded that Coleman alone was with the victim and saw the paper towel at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The forensic evidence established that the spermatozoa found in the victim\u2019s vagina came from a secretor with Type B blood, that Coleman was a secretor with Type B blood, that the foreign pubic hairs found in the victim\u2019s genital area were consistent with Coleman\u2019s pubic hair, that the human bloodstain found on Coleman\u2019s blue jeans was made by Type O blood, and that the victim\u2019s blood was Type O. Blood was also found on one of Coleman\u2019s knives, but it could not be classified. The jury reasonably could infer from the evidence that Coleman cut the victim with his knife and raped her either before or after inflicting the fatal blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Circumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt. <em>See Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. at 272, 257 S.E.2d at 817; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 141, 145-46, 235 S.E.2d 357, 360 (1977). We hold that the evidence in this case meets the required standard and is, therefore, sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">V. Review of the Death Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Under Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and 19.2-264.4C,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a jury may impose the death sentence upon either of the alternative findings therein provided. In the present case, the trial court, without objection, gave the jury an instruction stating the verdict form specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4D. The prosecutors argued to the jury both alternatives, that Coleman would be a continuing serious threat to society, and that his conduct in committing the capital murder was outrageously or wantonly vile. The jury returned a verdict, handwritten in the exact language of the verdict form, fixing Coleman\u2019s punishment at death. It is readily apparent that the jury based its sentencing verdict on both statutory alternatives; indeed, Coleman has never contended otherwise. <em>Cf. Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 148, 295 S.E.2d 643, 653 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">A trial court, pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, is required to have a probation officer make a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s history \u201cand any and all other relevant facts.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201c[a]fter consideration of the report, and upon good cause shown,\u201d the court may set aside the death sentence and impose in lieu thereof a sentence of imprisonment for life. The conviction order states that the court considered the probation officer\u2019s report, that the defendant was given the opportunity to cross-examine the probation officer, and that, upon Coleman\u2019s motion, references in the report to juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>court proceedings in which Coleman was involved were deleted. The court then imposed the death sentence. We find nothing in the record to show that Coleman established good cause for the trial court to set aside the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We are required, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 17-110.1C to determine:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; and</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">2. Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">As we have demonstrated, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting in evidence photographs showing the scene of the crimes and the victim\u2019s body. These photographs were relevant and probative and we find nothing in the record to indicate that they caused the jurors to act under the influence of passion. The <em>voir dire </em>established that the jurors who were impaneled were not prejudiced against Coleman and were prepared to decide the case on the evidence presented to them. From our careful review of the record, we hold that the verdict of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">In determining whether the sentence of death was excessive or disproportionate, we have compared the present case with all other capital murder cases that have been reviewed by this Court. We have given particular emphasis to those cases where the death sentence was based upon both the dangerousness of the defendant and the vileness of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">We have affirmed death sentences imposed upon findings of both dangerousness and vileness in these cases: <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 248 S.E.2d 135 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919 (1979); <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 273 S.E.2d 36 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1011 (1981); <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 273 S.E.2d 48 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981); <em>James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980); <em>Clanton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 41, 286 S.E.2d 172 (1982); <em>Quintana </em>v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 127, 295 S.E.2d 643 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983). In <em>Smith, </em>for example, the defendant, who had previously been convicted of rape, confronted his victim alone on a beach, forced her at knife point to disrobe, raped her, choked her, held her head under water, and stabbed her several times. The facts were somewhat analogous to those in the present case, where the jury found that Coleman, who had previously been convicted of attempted rape, raped his victim, cut her throat, dragged her through her house, and stabbed her twice at or after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">From our review of the cases, we hold that the sentence of death imposed upon Coleman was not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by Virginia juries in crimes of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We have found no reversible error in the rulings of the trial court, and we have independently determined that the sentence of death was properly imposed. Accordingly, we will not disturb the verdict establishing guilt, we decline to commute the sentence, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-13\"> Coleman filed a separate petition for appeal of the rape conviction.
