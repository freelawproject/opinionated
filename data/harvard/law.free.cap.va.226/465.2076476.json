WALLEN to haul coal and timber from Brown\u2019s property only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">Relying upon this agreement, Meade secured the right to mine coal and cut timber on the Brown property. At the time of trial in June, 1980, Meade had not yet mined any coal; however, during the years 1978 and 1979, he had cut timber on the Brown property and hauled it over the right-of-way on Wallen\u2019s land. Then, on April 21, 1980, Wallen directed Meade\u2019s timber contractor not to use the right-of-way further.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">On May 3, 1980, Meade filed a bill of complaint for an injunction restraining Wallen from interfering with Meade\u2019s use of the right-of-way and for damages. After a hearing, the trial court enjoined Wallen from interfering with Meade\u2019s use of the right-of-way to haul coal, but held the agreement of August 26, 1977, \u201ctoo vague to give Meade the right to haul timber\u201d across Wallen\u2019s land. The court held further, however, that Meade could haul timber over the right-of-way by paying Wallen $1,050.00 in a lump sum, a figure the court established on the basis of the price Meade had paid a neighboring property owner for a right-of-way to haul timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The trial court apparently found the agreement \u201ctoo vague\u201d with respect to Meade\u2019s right to haul timber because the compensation stated in the contract was \u201cper Ton\u201d and the court supposed that timber cannot be priced by the ton but only by the thousand feet. If this was the basis of the court\u2019s finding, the court was in error. The court erred further in establishing a new and different compensation for Meade\u2019s right to haul timber across Wallen\u2019s property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">It is the function of the court to construe the contract made by the parties, not to make a contract for them. The question for the court is what did the parties agree to as evidenced by their contract. The guiding light in the construction of [the] contract is the intention of the parties as expressed by them in the words they have used, and courts are bound to say that the parties intended what the written instrument plainly declares.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Magann Corp. </em>v. <em>Electrical Works, </em>203 Va. 259, 264, 123 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1962) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Here, in clear and unambiguous language, the parties expressed their intention that Meade would have the right to haul coal and timber across Wallen\u2019s property by paying Wallen $0.15 per ton for either commodity. While it may be unusual to price timber by the ton, there is nothing in law or in logic to prevent parties from adopting this method as the basis of an arrangement between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The present record demonstrates that a given amount of timber can be converted easily into tons. Indeed, Meade showed that he had hauled 520.416 tons of lumber and 399.40 tons of logs across Wallen\u2019s property. At $0.15 per ton, Meade calculated that he owed Wallen a total of $137.97, and Meade testified he had paid Wallen this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">We will modify the trial court\u2019s decree by deleting the provision requiring Meade to pay Wallen $1,050.00 for the right to haul timber and by substituting therefor a provision enjoining Wallen from interfering with Meade\u2019s right under the contract of August 26, 1977, to haul timber across Wallen\u2019s property. We will remand the cause for a determination of the damages, if any, suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>fered by Meade as a result of Wallen\u2019s interference with the use of Meade\u2019s right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
