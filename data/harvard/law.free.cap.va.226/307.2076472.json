Foster care plans for each child were filed in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Alexandria before the termination petitions were filed. The District Court terminated Todaro\u2019s parental rights, and she appealed the decision to the Circuit Court, where a trial <em>de novo </em>was conducted. However, the foster care plans were not refiled in the Circuit Court. Todaro contends a refiling was statutorily mandated and, absent a refiling, the evidence before the Circuit Court was insufficient as a matter of law to support its judgment. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283 provides in part that \u201c[n]o petition seeking termination of residual parental rights shall be accepted by the court prior to the filing of a foster care plan, pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-281, which documents termination of residual parental rights as being in. the best interests of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-281 requires the Department of Social Services to file the plan with the \u201cjuvenile and domestic relations district court\u201d and provides that certain parts of the plan \u201cshall be sent by the court to the attorney for the child, the child\u2019s parents . . . and such other persons as appear to the court to have a proper interest in the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Thus, it is clear that \u201cthe court\u201d referred to in \u00a7 16.1-283 is the juvenile and domestic relations district court. Although the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to the circuit court requires a trial <em>de </em>novo, a refiling of the plan in the circuit court, while perhaps advisable, is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The foster care plans were available to the Circuit Court and to all interested parties. Moreover, the trial court found \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d for terminating Todaro\u2019s parental rights, and we conclude that its finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
