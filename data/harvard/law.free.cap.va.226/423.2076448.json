William Yaconiello had an automobile policy with USAA which purported to cover reasonable medical expenses incurred by the \u201cnamed insured and each relative\u201d who \u201csustains bodily injury, caused by accident . . . through being struck by an automobile or by a trailer of any type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Gerard Yaconiello was a relative of the named insured, residing in the same household, and thus was entitled to the benefits of the coverage. On August 21, 1977, while the policy was in effect, Gerard was riding a bicycle in Virginia Beach and was struck by a motorcycle, causing him to incur medical expenses. Gerard\u2019s claim was refused by USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">Gerard sued USAA in the general district court. USAA removed the case to the circuit court and defended on the ground that the coverage extended only to injuries arising from being struck by an \u201cautomobile\u201d or by a \u201ctrailer,\u201d and that neither term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>was sufficiently broad to include a motorcycle. The court ruled on the stipulated facts that the policy covered Gerard\u2019s medical expenses. USAA appeals the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Code \u00a7 46.1-1(15) defines \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d: \u201cEvery vehicle as herein defined which is self-propelled or designed for self-propulsion . . . .\u201d Thus, the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is broad enough to include a motorcycle, but by the overwhelming weight of authority \u201cautomobile\u201d is not. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 38 A.L.R. 2d 867 (1954); 1C J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 573 (1981).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Our inquiry, however, must extend beyond the terms of the policy itself. At the time of Gerard\u2019s accident, Code \u00a7 38.1-380.1 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Upon request of its insured, every insurer licensed in this state issuing or delivering any policy or contract of bodily injury liability insurance . . . shall provide, on payment of premium established by law for such coverage, as a minimum coverage (1) to the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse and relatives of the named insured . . . through being struck by a <em>motor vehicle </em>. . . [a] 11 reasonable and necessary expenses for medical. . . services . . . [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Code \u00a7 38.1-343 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">Validity of noncomplying forms.\u2014Any insurance policy, rider or endorsement hereafter issued and otherwise valid, which contains any condition or provision not in compliance with the requirements of this title, shall not be rendered invalid thereby, but shall be construed and applied in accordance with such conditions and provisions as would have been applied had such policy, rider or endorsement been in full compliance with this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Thus, if the terms of the policy are inconsistent with statutory provisions, the statutory provisions supersede the inconsistent pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>icy terms. Here, we must construe and apply the policy as if it contained the statutorily mandated term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d rather than the language USAA actually used. <em>See Drewry </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual, </em>204 Va. 231, 236, 129 S.E.2d 681, 684 (1963); <em>State Farm Mutual </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>203 Va. 440, 443, 125 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1962); <em>Scholz </em>v. <em>Standard, Etc., Co., </em>145 Va. 694, 704, 134 S.E. 728, 731 (1926); <em>Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>385 F. Supp. 852 (E. D. Va. 1974). As stated above, \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d carries a statutory definition sufficiently broad to include a motorcycle. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling and will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-10\"> \u201cAutomobile\u201d was given a broader definition at the beginning of the automobile era. It had much the same meaning as \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d now has. <em>Cf. Stanley </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>143 Va. 187, 195, 129 S.E. 379, 382 (1925).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
