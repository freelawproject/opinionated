Stevens, a $704,000 verdict against Ford Motor Company. The trial court set aside the verdict on the ground that Stevens, as a matter of law, was guilty of assumption of the risk. Stevens appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">By assignments of cross-error, Ford contends: (1) Stevens\u2019 sole remedy is under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.1-1, <em>et seq., </em>and (2) alternatively, as a matter of law, it was not negligent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Because the jury returned its verdict for Stevens, under well-established principles, we will view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to him. Stevens, a truck driver for Spector Freight Lines, regularly delivered automobile parts to Ford\u2019s automobile assembly plant in Norfolk. He had been engaged in this occupation for a number of years and was familiar with Ford\u2019s operation. When making deliveries, Stevens was required to back his truck to a loading dock where Ford employees, using forklifts, unloaded the parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">At each door of a dock, Ford maintained and operated automatic dock levelers (also known as \u201cdock plates\u201d), which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ramps connecting a truck\u2019s bed to the dock. The levelers enable a forklift to travel from truck to dock as it removes cargo, although the truck bed and dock may not be at the same level.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A leveler is designed so that, when a truck backs toward the dock, the leveler is activated, causing it first to rise and then to release downward upon the truck\u2019s bed. Although the levelers should operate automatically, they frequently malfunctioned. When this occurred, the dock doors were not closed; instead, the levelers were raised manually, either by a forklift or by a \u201cstrong-arm.\u201d A strongarm resembles a large \u201ccrowbar on wheels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">On May 10, 1978, Stevens arrived at the Ford plant with a truckload of parts. A Ford employee directed him to a particular dock door. Stevens knew that the leveler at that door had malfunctioned the previous day, and he asked the employee if it had been repaired. The employee said, \u201cyes, but it [doesn\u2019t] make any difference, there [is] a forklift driver back there to handle the plate ... if it [isn\u2019t] working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">When Stevens arrived at the door, he observed the leveler was inoperative. He asked John Sanderlin, a Ford forklift operator, to raise the leveler with his forklift. Instead of using his forklift, Sanderlin instructed a man, whose identity remains unknown, to raise the leveler.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Stevens testified that the unknown man was carrying a clipboard containing papers and was \u201cchecking in\u201d engines at the plant. He also stated that the man was not employed by Spector Freight Lines. Sanderlin testified that the man was not a Ford employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The unknown man tried to raise the leveler with a strongarm, which ultimately became wedged between the leveler and the truck\u2019s bed. At that time, Stevens again sought Sanderlin\u2019s assistance with a forklift. Instead of using the forklift, Sanderlin alighted from it and assisted Stevens and the other man in trying to pull the strongarm free. This endeavor proved futile, and Sanderlin returned to his forklift, telling Stevens, \u201cI haven\u2019t got time to mess with it. You help him get that out . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">At this time, the leveler was elevated by the strongarm, and the blades of a forklift readily could have been inserted under the leveler to release the strongarm. Nevertheless, Sanderlin did not assist with his forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Consequently, Stevens proposed to raise the leveler and release the strongarm by using two \u201cfour by four\u201d pieces of wood, one as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>a lever, the other as a fulcrum. Before Stevens began, he said to the other man, \u201cDon\u2019t touch the strongarm. Don\u2019t move it. Don\u2019t do anything until I tell you to.\u201d The man indicated he would obey Stevens\u2019 admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As Stevens was placing the pieces of wood, the strongarm suddenly flew through the air, hitting the top of the truck. The piece of wood Stevens was holding was thrown out from under the plate, causing the dock plate to fall on his foot. The unknown man exclaimed, \u201cOh, my God. I just twisted it and it flew out.\u201d As Stevens was being assisted from the truck, he noticed that, in falling, the leveler had moved in the direction of the truck\u2019s bed approximately three to four inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Because Stevens received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer, Spector Freight Lines, the threshold question is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bars him from maintaining this tort action. We conclude it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-40 provides that the rights and remedies granted by the Act \u201cshall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee\u201d to recover for an injury received during the course of employment. Code \u00a7 65.1-41, however, permits the employee to maintain an action against a third-party tortfeasor, provided the tortfeasor is an \u201cother party.\u201d Ford is an \u201cother party\u201d if, at the time of the accident, Stevens and his employer were not performing work that was part of Ford\u2019s trade, business or occupation. <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Walmont, </em>210 Va. 98, 99, 168 S.E.2d 107, 108 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">To support its contention that Stevens\u2019 sole remedy is under the Act, Ford relies upon <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Onorati, </em>221 Va. 143, 267 S.E.2d 154 (1980). Its reliance is misplaced. In <em>Stout, </em>unloading the cargo was part of the defendant\u2019s business, and, unlike the present case, the plaintiffs decedent and his employer were under a duty to assist in the unloading. Therefore, at the time of the accident, the plaintiffs decedent was engaged in the defendant\u2019s trade, business or occupation and was not an \u201cother party\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-41. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 267 S.E.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The present case is strikingly similar to <em>Shook Company </em>v. <em>Barksdale, </em>206 Va. 45, 141 S.E.2d 738 (1965). Barksdale was employed by Bolt, a sawmill operator. Barksdale delivered lumber to Shook Company which manufactured lumber products. Shook Company was responsible for unloading the lumber; neither Bolt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>nor Barksdale had any duty to unload. At the request of a Shook employee, Barksdale assisted in the operation of a forklift used to remove the lumber from Bolt\u2019s truck and was injured. Barksdale, as Bolt\u2019s employee, received an award under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and Shook Company contended that the award barred his tort action. In rejecting Shook\u2019s contention, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">It was not a part of the trade, business or occupation of Bolt to unload the truck. When Barksdale undertook to help he was not engaging in the trade, business or occupation of Bolt and defendants did not thereby become engaged in the business of Bolt, but were clearly \u201cother parties,\u201d strangers to the business of Bolt, against whom Barksdale\u2019s right of action was preserved by \u00a7 65-38 [now Code \u00a7 65.1-41].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 48, 141 S.E.2d at 741. Likewise, in the instant case, unloading the cargo was the sole responsibility of Ford, and because Stevens was not engaged in Ford\u2019s trade, business or occupation he can maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In its other assignment of cross-error, Ford contends, as a matter of law, it was not guilty of negligence. Stevens, on the other hand, advances several theories of negligence which he argues were properly submitted to the jury. One theory is that the unidentified man was a negligent Ford employee, whose negligence is imputed to his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">If reasonable men could infer from the facts proved that the man was a Ford employee, the question is one for the jury\u2019s determination. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Breit, </em>226 Va. 102, 104, 306 S.E.2d 877, 878 (1983); <em>Southern States Coop. </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>223 Va. 650, 657, 292 S.E.2d 331, 335 (1982); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Lovvorn, </em>199 Va. 688, 692-93, 101 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1958). The evidence established that Ford employed \u201ccheckers\u201d who generally worked in the area where this man was seen working. The man was checking freight bills on a clipboard against serial numbers on engines received by Ford. When Sanderlin, a Ford employee, ordered him to.assist Stevens with the leveler, the man laid his clipboard on a desk, secured a strongarm, and inserted it under the leveler. From these facts, the jury reasonably could infer that the man was a Ford employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Ordinarily, negligence is a jury issue. Its determination requires the sifting and evaluation of facts, which are matters exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sively within the province of a jury. Negligence becomes a question for a court \u201conly when reasonable men should not differ as to the conclusion to be reached from the facts and where one, and only one, conclusion, as a matter of law, is warranted.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>203 Va. 357, 361, 124 S.E.2d 18, 21-22 (1962). <em>See also GEICO </em>v. <em>Gallop &amp; James, </em>224 Va. 720, 724, 299 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In the present case, the unknown man disobeyed Stevens\u2019 clear and unequivocal directions and without any warning \u201ctwisted\u201d the strongarm. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that this was not a negligent act. The trial court, therefore, properly submitted the issue to the jury. Because the employee was acting in the course of his employment, his negligence is imputed to Ford. <em>Naccash </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>223 Va. 406, 419, 290 S.E.2d 825, 833 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Finally, we consider Stevens\u2019 sole assignment of error: that the trial court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that Stevens assumed the risk. Assumption of the risk, like negligence and contributory negligence, is ordinarily a jury issue and becomes one for the court only when reasonable men should not differ as to the conclusion to be reached from the evidence. <em>Amusement Slides </em>v. <em>Lehmann, </em>217 Va. 815, 819, 232 S.E.2d 803, 805 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The essence of assumption of the risk is \u201cventurousness in voluntarily incurring a risk the nature and extent of which are fully appreciated.\u201d <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Winesett, </em>225 Va. 460, 471, 303 S.E.2d 868, 875 (1983). <em>See also Kings Markets </em>v. <em>Yeatts, </em>226 Va. 174, 181, 307 S.E.2d 249, 254 (1983); <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Robertson, Adm\u2019r, </em>207 Va. 633, 637, 151 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1966). \u201cKnowledge of the risk involved is essential to its assumption.\u201d <em>Budzinski </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>213 Va. 107, 110, 189 S.E.2d 372, 375 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The trial court granted an instruction, tendered by Ford, which told the jury that Stevens could not recover if the jury found that he \u201cfully understood the nature and extent of a known danger, and if he voluntarily exposed himself to it . . . .\u201d By its verdict, the jury rejected assumption of the risk. We must determine, therefore, whether the evidence supports only the conclusion that Stevens fully appreciated the nature and extent of the risk, or whether reasonable men could differ thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The crucial evidence concerning assumption of the risk is what occurred immediately before Stevens\u2019 injury. After Sanderlin refused to use his forklift to extricate the wedged strongarm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>he again instructed Stevens to assist the unidentified man. Stevens secured the two pieces of wood and planned to use them to pry the leveler and free the strongarm. He was aware that the efforts of three men failed to budge the strongarm. Nevertheless, before acting, he gave the other man clear instructions not to touch the strongarm until Stevens told him to do so, and the man indicated he would obey Stevens\u2019 directives. The man\u2019s unanticipated disobedience precipitated Stevens\u2019 injury, and we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Stevens fully appreciated the nature and extent of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We hold that reasonable men could reach different conclusions from the evidence respecting the issue of assumption of the risk and that the trial court erred in setting aside the verdict and entering judgment for Ford. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and judgment entered in favor of Stevens in accordance with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-14\"> Although Ford briefed other assignments of cross-error, these were neither discussed nor expressly reserved at oral argument. Therefore, consistent with established procedure, we have not considered them. <em>See, e.g., Bd. of Sup. </em>v. <em>Safeco, </em>226 Va. 329, 339, 310 S.E.2d 445, 451(1983); <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Cooley, 220 </em>Va. 749, 753 n., 263 S.E.2d 49, 52 n.
