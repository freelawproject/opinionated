Whitten alleged that the building was insured pursuant to an oral contract of insurance with defendant, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm). However, State Farm denied the existence of such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">On appeal, the dispositive issue is whether the plaintiff proved the existence of an oral contract of insurance. At trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Whitten and judgment was entered thereon. In our view, however, plaintiff failed to prove all the necessary elements of a contract of insurance. Therefore, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The jury was instructed as follows regarding proof of an oral contract of insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">An oral contract of insurance is enforceable when the necessary elements have been proven. The necessary elements of an oral contract of insurance are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(1) The names of the parties to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">(2) The subject of the insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">(3) The risks insured against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">(4) The time at which the insurance takes effect and the length of time it is to continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-16\">(5) A statement of the premium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-17\">(6) The conditions pertaining to the insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-18\">This instruction tracks the language of Code \u00a7 38.1-333 which states, in the language of command, what <em>shall </em>be specified in an insurance policy or contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In order to establish an oral contract of insurance each element listed above must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Conklin, </em>218 Va. 59, 65, 235 S.E.2d 450, 454 (1977); <em>Walker Agcy. &amp; Aetna Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>215 Va. 535, 211 S.E.2d 88 (1975). Here, there was a failure of proof with respect to certain of the requisite elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Two witnesses testified at trial on behalf of Whitten. Both were principals in the business. Since their testimony with respect to the issue of contract formation is not lengthy we will consider it in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">William C. Slaughter testified that he discussed the policy with Yates, State Farm\u2019s agent. He told Yates that Whitten wanted \u201cfull coverage,\u201d that money was not a problem, and that all necessary riders should be placed on the policy. However, there was no mention of the nature of the riders. Further, with regard to a premium, Slaughter testified that Yates did not know the amount of the premium but said it would be billed later. That is the extent of Slaughter\u2019s testimony as it relates to the issue of contract formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Slaughter\u2019s business associate, James L. Brewster, testified that Yates was told that Whitten \u201cwanted coverage on the building and coverage on liability in case somebody were to get hurt.\u201d He said he told Yates that Whitten \u201cwanted something that would cover everything; something like [Brewster] had on [his] homeowners [sic] policy.\u201d Brewster admitted there was no discussion about \u201cany exclusions from any coverage.\u201d When asked whether there were any discussions about \u201cany specific coverage that [he] wanted to insure against,\u201d Brewster answered as follows: \u201cWe didn\u2019t say we wanted this, this and this. We just said we wanted full coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Brewster was next asked whether there was any discussion about a particular type of policy. He replied as follows: \u201cNo. We just simply asked for the coverage on the building and on liability, anybody getting hurt.\u201d He admitted that Yates did not show him a policy nor did Yates show him anything to indicate that he would be \u201ccovered for certain things and not covered for others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Brewster went on to testify that \u201criders or extra things\u201d on the policy were discussed, but he gave no specifics in this regard. He recalled Slaughter\u2019s saying \u201cPut more riders on there, if you want to.\u201d But there was no testimony regarding the nature of the riders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Finally, Brewster testified that the coverage was to begin immediately and last for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We need not go through each of the requisite elements of an oral contract to determine which were proved because it is clear from the foregoing testimony that, at the least, there was insufficient proof of the following three elements: (1) a statement of the premiums, (2) the conditions pertaining to the insurance, and (3) the risks insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Since the foregoing analysis disposes of the appeal, we need not address any other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
