The question is presented against the following background:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">On August 2, 1974, Dixie K. Davies was injured when the vehicle she was driving collided with an automobile operated by Patricia Ann Turner. At the time, Turner was an insured under a policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), containing the usual cooperation clause, and Davies was an insured under a policy issued by Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), with standard provisions for uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Davies filed a personal injury action against Turner, who delivered the suit papers to State Farm. When the case came on for trial, Turner failed to appear, and State Farm defended the action under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of Davies for $10,725.00. Thereafter, the judgment remaining unpaid, Davies brought this declaratory judgment proceeding to determine which of the two insurance companies was liable to her. State Farm disclaimed liability on the ground that Turner\u2019s failure to appear at trial constituted a material and prejudicial breach of the cooperation clause of the State Farm policy. GEICO defended on the basis that State Farm\u2019s disclaimer of liability was ineffective and, hence, that Turner was not an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">After a hearing, the trial court ruled that State Farm had not been prejudiced by Turner\u2019s failure to appear at trial. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of Davies against State Farm and dismissed GEICO. Because we believe these actions were erroneous, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Under the terms of State Farm\u2019s policy, Turner was required to \u201ccooperate with the company and to . . . attend hearings and trials and assist in securing and giving evidence and obtaining the attendance of witnesses.\u201d Pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.1-381 (al), however, an insurance carrier cannot escape liability on the ground of noncooperation unless the failure to cooperate \u201cprejudices the insurer in the defense of an action for damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The parties stipulated below that Turner failed to cooperate as required and that State Farm had not waived its right to rely upon the defense of noncooperation. The only issue for determination, therefore, the parties agreed, was whether Turner\u2019s failure to cooperate prejudiced State Farm in the defense of Davies\u2019 personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">On this issue, the trial court properly held that State Farm had the burden of proving prejudice. <em>See Shipp </em>v. <em>Connecticut Indem. Co., </em>194. Va. 249, 258, 72 S.E.2d 343, 348 (1952). The court found, however, that the \u201cevidence of liability [in the personal injury action] was rather overwhelming and it would stretch the imagination to believe that a different result would have been obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">GEICO argues that the importance of this finding of fact \u201ccannot be overemphasized\u201d and that the finding may not be set aside since it is supported by credible evidence. The difficulty with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>GEICO\u2019s argument is that the so-called \u201cfinding of fact\u201d contains a built-in rule of law imposing upon State Farm the burden of proving that Turner\u2019s appearance and testimony at trial <em>would </em>have produced a different result. We believe this was an improper burden, and we think one of our prior decisions demonstrates the error in the trial court\u2019s holding. For this reason, we need not consider the several out-of-state decisions cited by GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>199 Va. 908, 103 S.E.2d 210 (1958), Traynham, an insured under a policy issued by Employers Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, was involved in an accident with Cooper. Traynham notified the insurance company of the accident and gave it a signed statement concerning the details of the incident. Thereafter, Traynham disappeared and failed to cooperate further with the company. Cooper obtained a judgment against Traynham in a personal injury action which the company defended under a reservation of rights. When Cooper brought an action on the policy, the company defended on the ground of Traynham\u2019s noncooperation. Affirming the trial court\u2019s finding in favor of the company, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">[Traynham] did not assist in any manner in the preparation for trial nor did he appear at the trial. These facts and circumstances constituted a wilful lack of cooperation with the company and such lack of cooperation was substantial and material and was prejudicial to [the company]. His failure to assist in the preparation for trial and to attend the trial unquestionably prejudiced his case, especially in view of the fact that his report of the accident . . . indicated a defense to the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 915, 103 S.E.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">GEICO dismisses <em>Cooper </em>on the ground that the language concerning prejudice quoted above \u201cis unquestionably dictum.\u201d Prejudice was not an issue in <em>Cooper, </em>GEICO says, because the case predated a 1966 amendment adding to Code \u00a7 38.1-381 new subsection (al), which included the prejudice requirement, and, as this court was careful to point out, it was not necessary at the time of <em>Cooper </em>for the insurer \u201cto show prejudice in order to prevail in the defense of non-cooperation.\u201d 199 Va. at 915-16, 103 S.E.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>It is true, of course, that subsection (a1) had not been added to Code \u00a7 38.1-381 at the time <em>Cooper </em>was decided. And we did make clear in <em>Cooper </em>that a showing of prejudice was not essential at that time to the establishment of a noncooperation defense, the insurer\u2019s burden then consisting of proof that a breach was material. 199 Va. at 914, 915, 102 S.E.2d at 214, 215. But it does not follow that the language concerning prejudice in the above-quoted excerpt is dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We noted in <em>Cooper </em>that the issue in the case was whether the evidence showed that Traynham willfully failed to comply with the terms of the policy \u201cin some substantial and material respect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913, 103 S.E.2d at 214. And, quoting from <em>Shipp, </em>we said that \u201c \u2018the absence of prejudice ... is a circumstance to be considered on the question of . . . materiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 914, 103 S.E.2d at 214. Then, rationalizing conversely, we found that Traynham\u2019s failure to cooperate was material because prejudicial to the insurer in the defense of the personal injury action. Hence, the language concerning prejudice was essential to the rationale of the <em>Cooper </em>decision and was not dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">GEICO argues that in view of the 1966 amendment to Code \u00a7 38.1-381, <em>Cooper </em>would be decided differently today. We disagree. So far as its impact upon <em>Cooper </em>is concerned, what the 1966 amendment accomplished was to require a showing of prejudice as the dispositive factor in a failure-to-cooperate case, rather than as a mere circumstance to be considered in determining materiality. <em>See State Farm </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>221 Va. 592, 597-98, 272 S.E.2d 196, 199 (1980). But prejudice is prejudice, whether found as a dispositive factor or as a circumstance demonstrating materiality; therefore, the precedential value of <em>Cooper </em>is unaffected by the 1966 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">GEICO maintains, however, that <em>Cooper </em>is not entitled to weight because this Court did not discuss what constitutes prejudice in the noncooperation context. We should disregard <em>Cooper, </em>GEICO says, and also eschew State Farm\u2019s invitation to follow a rule that would make \u201cthe absence of an insured from trial prejudice <em>per se.\u201d </em>Instead, GEICO submits, we should affirm the judgment below, thus sanctioning the rule followed by the trial court requiring an insured to prove prejudice by showing that the insured\u2019s appearance at trial would have produced a different result. Alternatively, GEICO asserts, we should adopt a rule requiring the insurer to show \u201csubstantial likelihood that the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>fact would have found in the insured\u2019s favor\u201d or, at a minimum, a rule requiring the insurer to show \u201csome likelihood that the result would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Admittedly, <em>Cooper </em>does not discuss the nature of the evidence that is required to establish prejudice. It is clear from the opinion, however, that where the insured\u2019s willful absence from trial deprives the insurer of evidence sufficient to establish a defense to the original claim, then prejudice results. And we believe it is implicit that evidence necessary to establish a defense means evidence of sufficient quality and weight to take the issue of the insured\u2019s conduct to the jury and to support a verdict in his or her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">It follows that we favor neither a <em>per se </em>rule that would permit an insurer to show merely that its insured failed to appear at trial nor a rule that would require an insurer to show that, had its insured appeared, the result would have been in his or her favor. Instead, we believe that the proper rule lies midway between these two extremes and emanates from the rationale of <em>Cooper, </em>in an action on the policy, when the insurer shows that the insured\u2019s willful failure to appear at the original trial deprived the insurer of evidence which would have made a jury issue of the insured\u2019s liability and supported a verdict in his or her favor, the insurer has established a reasonable likelihood the result would have been favorable to the insured and has carried its burden of proving prejudice under Code \u00a7 38.1-381 (a1).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">To determine whether State Farm carried its burden of proving prejudice, we turn now to the evidence adduced in the present proceeding. This evidence, most of which was stipulated, shows that the accident in question occurred on a rainy afternoon in early August, 1974, at the intersection of City Park Avenue and Park Manor Road in the City of Portsmouth. A traffic island is located on Park Manor Road at the intersection, and traffic turning left from City Park Avenue onto Park Manor Road passes to the left of the island. Davies, who had been proceeding northward on City Park Avenue, was in the process of turning left onto Park Manor Road. Turner was travelling eastward on Park Manor Road intending to turn right onto City Park Avenue..The two vehicles collided left side to left side.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Turner reported the accident to State Farm and signed an \u201cAutomobile Claim Report\u201d setting forth her version of the incident, which indicated she had a defense. State Farm made a prompt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and full investigation. As part of the investigation, a State Farm claims representative interviewed Turner some four months after the accident. Repeating her version of the accident, Turner stated in the interview that she was approaching the intersection about five miles per hour when Davies, travelling around fifteen miles per hour, \u201cturned too short\u201d onto Park Manor Road and proceeded toward Turner on Davies\u2019 wrong side of the road. Turner pulled to her right \u201cin the dirt off of the road\u201d but was hit on her left front fender by Davies, and the impact \u201cspun [Turner\u2019s] car around.\u201d When police officers arrived, they did not issue any summons or indicate who was at fault in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Jimmy Smith, Turner\u2019s brother, was a passenger in her car at the time of the accident. He was also interviewed by the State Farm claims representative, and he corroborated Turner\u2019s version of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Following the filing of Davies\u2019 personal injury action on August 2, 1976, Turner was served with process, and she turned the suit papers over to State Farm. George Gray, an attorney, was designated by State Farm to defend the action and he filed defensive pleadings on Turner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Trial of the personal injury action was set for February 22, 1977. Gray notified Turner of the trial date and requested that she contact him to arrange a pretrial interview. She telephoned his office to make an appointment but, following this call, she moved from her local address and never again contacted Gray or anyone else connected with State Farm. Because of her absence, the case was continued several times during a period of more than two years. Despite \u201cevery reasonable effort\u201d made by State Farm, she could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Jimmy Smith did cooperate with State Farm in the early stages of the case, and he indicated to Gray he would give testimony favorable to Turner. In late 1978, however, after Smith had joined the Army and left the state, Gray attempted to take his deposition, but Smith did not appear at the scheduled time. Gray talked with him on the phone later, and he was \u201can entirely different person.\u201d He told Gray that he remembered \u201clittle, if anything,\u201d about the accident and that he did not wish to be deposed. Gray made no further attempt to depose Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The personal injury action was finally heard on August 3, 1979, in the absence of both Turner and her brother. The testimony presented' at trial was stipulated into the present record. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ing to Davies\u2019 version of the accident, as she was making her left turn from City Park Avenue onto Park Manor Road, she saw Turner approaching in the middle of Park Manor Road at a speed of thirty-five miles per hour in a twenty-five mile zone. Davies moved to her right and had come to a stop partially on the traffic island when the left side of her vehicle was struck by the left side of Turner\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Park Ranger Caviness was the first police officer to arrive on the scene. He observed both vehicles on Davies\u2019 side of the road, with a portion of Davies\u2019 vehicle on the traffic island. Davies\u2019 husband, who was also a police officer, and Officer Burke later arrived on the scene. They corroborated Caviness\u2019 statements concerning the positions of the vehicles. All three police officers and Mrs. Davies heard Turner admit fault for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">There was no evidence presented in the personal injury trial supporting Turner\u2019s version of the accident. Specifically, there was no testimony that Davies \u201ccut the corner short,\u201d that Turner turned to her right in an attempt to avoid the accident, or that the impact occurred on Turner\u2019s side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Testifying in the present proceeding as a witness for State Farm, Gray said Turner and her brother were \u201cthe only [possible] witnesses . . . who [could] provide a defense in the case.\u201d Gray said further that the statements Turner and her brother made in their interviews with State Farm\u2019s claims representative \u201cindicated, to [Gray], that [he] did have a defense . . . which [he] could classify as substantial\u201d; by \u201csubstantial defense,\u201d he meant \u201cevidence which can be presented to a jury which, if believed, would result in a verdict for [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Gray testified further that when Turner and her brother failed to appear at the personal injury trial, he \u201clost every chance of any defense on the issue of liability\u201d; he was unable through cross-examination or otherwise to develop any \u201cevidence or testimony [he] could put on to defend.\u201d Gray conceded he had advised State Farm some time prior to the personal injury trial that there was \u201capparent liability\u201d in the case. Gray insisted, however, that this advice to State Farm did not \u201cmean that [he had] backed oif from what [he thought was] a substantial defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">We believe the evidence in this case compels the conclusion that had Turner appeared at the personal injury trial and testified as State Farm had the right to assume she would testify, that is, by reciting the same version of the accident she gave in her interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>with State Farm\u2019s claims representative, then a jury issue of her liability would have been established. A jury issue exists \u201c \u2018 [i] f there is conflict of the testimony on a material point, or if reasonably fair-minded [persons] may differ as to the conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent on the weight to be given the testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Neff &amp; Son, </em>183 Va. 56, 62, 31 S.E.2d 265, 268 (1944) (quoting M. Burks, <em>Pleading and Practice </em>543 (3d ed. 1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While these are alternative criteria and all three exist in the present case, we need only point out that, had Turner repeated at the personal injury trial her version of the accident, her testimony would have been in direct conflict with Davies\u2019 evidence. Turner\u2019s version was not inherently incredible, and the question then would have become one of credibility for the jury. Had the jury accepted Turner\u2019s version and returned a verdict in her favor, the verdict would have been supported by evidence. Yet, by willfully failing to attend and testify at the personal injury trial and by failing to assist in securing her brother\u2019s testimony, Turner deprived State Farm of the very evidence necessary to make a jury issue of her liability. These failures, concededly in breach of the cooperation clause, clearly prejudiced State Farm in its defense of the personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed. The parties have stipulated that if it is determined Turner\u2019s breach of the cooperation clause prejudiced State Farm in the defense of the personal injury action, \u201cthen [GEICO] owes [Davies] the amount of the said previous judgment, plus interest and the Court costs of this [declaratory judgment] action.\u201d Pursuant to this stipulation, we will dismiss State Farm and enter final judgment in favor of Davies against GEICO in the amounts indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
