The affidavits showed a difference of recollection by counsel as to some understanding between them, but there was no allegation of any agreement as to the return; but appellant claimed that his failure to get a copy of the stenographer\u2019s notes of testimony had been the cause of his delay in preparing his exceptions and having them incorporated into the return.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4E\">November 30, 1888.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ai_6\"><em>W.
