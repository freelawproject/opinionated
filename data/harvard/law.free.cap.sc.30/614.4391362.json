Upon hearing the return at such term, Judge Aldrich, the presiding judge, on May 22, made the stay of proceedings permanent, and enjoined the plaintiff'and trial justice from interfering with defendant\u2019s possession until \u201cthe possession is decided by this court.\u201d From this order there was no appeal. At Sumter (in the same Circuit), on June 7, on motion, after notice of thirteen days, Judge Aldrich revoked his order passed in open court at Clarendon. At' his home in Barnwell, in another Circuit, on June 19, Judge Aldrich, on motion, without notice, revoked his order of June 7, saying that it had been \u201csigned under a misapprehension of the facts of the case,\u201d and he \u201creinstated and declared in full force\u201d the order of May 22.
