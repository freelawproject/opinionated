C., 493) as held that defendants should not \u201cbe charged with the uncollected balances upon the notes of Byrd and Richards.\u201d The plaintiffs \u25a0contended that the court meant to hold the defendants responsible on those notes to the extent of their commissions. But the Circuit Judge (Hudson) construed the opinion to mean \u201cthat these notes must be entirely eliminated from the statement of accounts as made up by the special referee.\u201d On appeal, this construction of the former opinion was approved and held to be correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
