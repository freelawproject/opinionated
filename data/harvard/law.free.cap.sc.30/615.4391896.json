Plaintiff notified defendant\u2019s attorneys that he would take the testimony of three witnesses (naming them) on May 12, 1888, before P., a notary public, at his oifice in Richmond, Ya. Defendant\u2019s attorneys endorsed thereon: \u201cWe consent to the taking of the within depositions on May 12, 1888.\u201d A certificate that the depositions were taken at the time and place mentioned and were duly sworn to and subscribed, was signed by P.'as notary and his seal affixed. <em>Held,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">1. The failure to serve interrogatories did not render the depositions inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">2.
