It was \u201cfurther agreed that if plaintiff should become dissatisfied with the measurement of the lumber,\u201d that the quantity should be ascertained by the regular lumberman\u2019s rule, specifying it. A &amp; B, without plaintiff\u2019s assent, assigned this contract to a new firm composed of L and R. Plaintiff brought action against L &amp; R, alleging the partnership and that defendants were indebted to her in the sum of $1,433 \u201cfor timber and lumber cut and removed from plaintiff\u2019s land.\u201d Defendants, not objecting to the form of the action, denied the indebtedness, and alleged the contract with A &amp; B, its assignment to L &amp; R, and full payment thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">At the trial, plaintiff proved the quantity of timber cut as ascertained by the specified lumberman\u2019s rule, and also the value of timber on like lands near by. Defendants proved receipts by plaintiff of March 22, 1886, \u201con account of timber cut to date,\u201d of June 8, \u201cfor all timber cut to June 1,\u201d of July 24, \u201cin full for timber cut during the month of June, as per statement rendered, E. &amp; O. E.\u201d <em>Held,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">1. That plaintiff could sue L &amp; R for the value of the timber cut by them, without regard to her contract with' A &amp; B, another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">2. That the receipts in evidence did not show an account stated nor estop plaintiff from showing the real amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">3. To establish her case, it was competent for plaintiff to show the quantity of timber removed by the lumberman\u2019s rule, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>is a measurement of the butts and tops on the cleared land, the timber itself being removed and inaccessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">4. The application of the lumberman\u2019s rule was not limited, by the contract, to such timber only as should be removed after notice given of dissatisfaction, but was authorized as to all the timber cut from the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">5. The value of other similar property under similar conditions, was relevant to the issues here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Judgment (Fraser, J.) affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
