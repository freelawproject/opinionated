The lease'provided that possession of the premises should be \u201cgiven on May 1st, or sooner, if alterations thereto are completed. \u201d Defendant, at the time of the execution of the lease, executed the following sealed agreement, which was indorsed on the lease: \u201cIn consideration of the letting of the premises within mentioned to the within-named Kantrowitz &amp; Epstein, and the sum of one dollar to me paid by the said parties of the first part, I, Simon Epstein, do hereby covenant and agree to and with the parties of the first part above named, and their legal representatives, that if default shall at any time be made by the said Kantrowitz &amp; Epstein in the payment of the rent and performance of the covenants contained in the within lease on their part to be paid and performed, that I will well and truly pay the said rent, or any arrears thereof, that may remain due unto the said parties of the first part, and also all damages that may arise in consequence of the non-performance of said covenants, or either of them, without requiring notice of any such default from the said parties of the first part.\u201d Defendant pleaded a tender, on May 2d, of the rent for that month, and demand of possession of the premises, which was refused. Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that plaintiffs were inposses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>sion after May 1st, engaged in completing the repairs.

There was, therefore, no breach of covenant on his part. The rent became due and payable under the lease, and was not paid. A tender was made; but, to be available, it must be kept good at all times. The debt is not paid by the tender. There was nothing in the case which required its submission to the jury. The direction in favor of the plaintiff was right, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b82-6\">Pitshke, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYG\">(concurring.) I concur in the decision reached by my brethren. The lease is a grant of the premises for a period, and the rent is annexed thereto as an incident. While in the <em>quasi </em>equitable action for \u201cuse and occupation\u201d a tenant is not answerable unless he has had some beneficial enjoyment of the property, the action of covenant upon a sealed lease for rent does not depend upon occupation or enjoyment of the premises being gained by the lessee. <em>Gilhooly </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>4 N. Y. 217, 219; <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Harteau, </em>56 N. Y. 398,401. And this is so, though, at the day fixed, tenant demands the possession, and landlord refuses to deliver up possession; for the lessee\u2019s remedy, in a proper case, would only be a counter-claim or cross-suit upon landlord\u2019s covenants, express or implied, to give due possession, to reconstruct the premises, and the like. <em>Etheridge </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>12 Wend. 529; <em>Vanderpoel </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Abb. Dec. 464,\u2014Davies, J., holding: \u201cThe omission of a landlord to perform covenants on his part <em>[i. e., </em>in refusing to place or let tenant into possession of that which, by the agreement of the parties, he ought to have enjoyed] is no bar to such lessor\u2019s claim for rent. \u201d See, also, <em>Edgerton </em>v. <em>Page, </em>20 N. Y. 285, and <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>8 N. Y. 115, 118, that the \u201crent\u201d must be paid, and tenant can only insist on cross-damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The tender before suit is no defense, as the answer fails to plead payment into court. <em>Becker </em>v <em>Boon, </em>61 N. Y. 317. The surety\u2019s undertaking was absolute to pay in case of lessee\u2019s default, and without requiring notice; the rent was payable monthly in advance; and consequently, for above reasons, the judgment against defendant as surety was right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
