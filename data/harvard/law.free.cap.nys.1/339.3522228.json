Plaintiff was a servant in the employ of the driver of the carriage which was run over. The box and freight cars of defendant were standing on a side track, and, as plaintiff claimed, obscured the view of the main track until almost upon it; and testified that she did not know she was approaching a track; that she was holding a baby asleep in her arms at the time. The court charged the jury that plaintiff was bound to show due care on her part, and negligence on that of defendant; and that, if plaintiff knew she was approaching a track, she had no right to assume the driver would be careful, but must watch out for herself; but-, if she did not know it, she was only bound to use such care as one with her knowledge would ordinarily exercise under the circumstances; and it was for the jury to decide whether plaintiff was negligent, and whether defendant took such precautions as were necessary to warn travelers approaching the track, so that they could hear or see them if they had listened or looked. The jury found a verdict of $6,000 for plaintiff. The court overruled a motion for new trial, and defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b352-9\">Before Sedgwick, O.
