Lugar, Clara Y. Le Gendre, and William C. Le Gendre against Fannie J. Byrnes, Rudolph F. Rabe, and George H. Goodridge, as executors of Maria Mulock, deceased, to set aside a deed from the testatrix to the defendant Fannie J. Byrnes; the executors being made defendants because of their refusal to bring the action. The plaintiffs are two of the daughters and a grandson of the testatrix, and devisees and legatees under her will; the defendant Byrnes being also one of her daughters. The complaint, after setting out the will of Mrs. Mulock, and the relationship of the several parties to her, alleged a scheme by means of which the defendant Byrnes, during the life-time of her mother, acquired, piece by piece, nearly all her property, to the exclusion of the other daughters, and prays for the cancellation of one of those deeds, conveying to the defendant certain property in the city of New York. The defendant Byrnes appeals from an order refusing to strike from the complaint the allegations as to the amount and nature of Mrs. Muloek\u2019s property before Mrs. Byrnes acquired an undue influence over her, and those relating to the transfer of that property, other than that conveyed by the deed in this suit sought to be set aside.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b274-13\">Argued before Yan Brunt, P.

It is only in those cases in which harm or injustice will be done to the defendant by the retention of the allegations that such a motion should be granted. The case at bar does not present any such reason, and the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
