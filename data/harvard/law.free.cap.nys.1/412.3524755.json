Arnold and Satterlee Arnold, in reference to the manufacture and sale of certain machines for making knit goods, and to the transfer and assignment of certain rights under their patents relating to the same. The plaintiff claims that the agreement is substantially expressed in an instrument in writing, which was prepared for execution, but never was actually signed. This paper is set out at length in the appeal-book; and an examination of its contents reveals what we deem to be an insuperable difficulty in the plaintiff\u2019s case. It is impossible to deduce from this unsigned instrument the terms of a contract sufficiently clear and definite to enable a court to enforce the specific performance thereof. The first article declares that Anna M. Arnold grants to Julius Kayser the exclusive right, under her patents, to make, use, or sell knit or woven fabric gloves and mitts, having cut edges, and not to exceed a. certain weight per yard. A blank occurs where the weight agreed upon was evidently in tended to be inserted. Further on, in the fifth article, it is declared that <em>the </em>machines and attachments to be furnished to the plaintiff shall be used by him only in the manufacture of knit or woven fabric gloves and mitts having cut edges, and not exceeding a weight per yard which is also-left in blank. The sixth article, which relates to penalties, provides that, if the plaintiff uses the machines or attachments otherwise than as he is licensed to do by the provisions of the first article, the license and agreement may be revoked, at the option of Anna M. Arnold, and shall forthwith become void. It is obvious that both of the parties intending to execute this instrument meant that the rights which were conveyed and acquired should be restricti'd to the manufacture of goods the weight of which per yard should not exceed a certain maximum to be therein specified. The blanks in the proposed contract were left to be filled by figures which the parties had agreed upon, or should subsequently agree upon. The omission to fill those blanks might not be material now, if there were any evidence in the case from which the court could ascertain what figures both parties actually had in mind. Unfortunately, however, the record is utterly barren of proof on this subject; and, under these circumstances, the instrument in question does not disclose a sufficiently definite contract to be capable of enforcement. The judgment, so far as it dismisses the complaint, should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">But we do not think any costs or additional allowance should have been. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff behaved fairly and honorably, and paid out twenty-five hundred dollars in the course of the enterprise, which he has not received back. The defendants Arnold, after giving him distinctly to understand that they proposed to sell him the machines, and convey to him the rights to manufacture under their patents, preferred to deal with the plaintiff\u2019s rivals in business, and made a sale to the defendants Jennings. They may have been legally entitled to do this; but their course in the whole transaction, as contrasted with that of the plaintiff, was not such as to justify a court of equity in imposing costs upon him as a consequence of his very natural effort to compel them to recognize his claim. The judgment appealed from will be modified by striking out the costs, and, as modified, will be affirmed, without costs. The order granting an additional allowance will be reversed, also without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Van Brunt, P.

Rep. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">A court of equity will not decree specific performance of a contract unless the thing agreed to be done is definite and certain in its terms and in itself; and the party asking for performance must make out, by clear and satisfactory proof, the existence of the contractas he alleges it.

The agreement was signed by the wife only, and the husband failed to pay the money mentioned in the agreement at the time specified, and died without paying any part thereof. His administrator sought to enforce a specific performance of the agreement. Held, that specific performance could not be enforced against the wife, as the contract was not mutual, and left it optional with the husband to pay the money. Stembridge v.

Accordingly, the latter telegraphed to complainant for further instructions; and defendant gave a third party written authority to close the contract for him on the terms he had named. After receiving an answer to his telegram, complainant\u2019s agent did not see defendant again, but agreed orally with defendant\u2019s agent that they would meet later, and arrange the exchange. Before they did so, defendant revoked his agent\u2019s authority, and refused to make the exchange. <em>Held, </em>that specific performance of the exchange would not be decreed, the minds of the parties not having met.
