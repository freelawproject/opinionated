There was ice on the walk from three to five inches thick, and had been for a greater part of the winter. The plaintiff slipped and fell. She does not attribute her fall to any peculiar formation of the ice. \u25a0She testified it \u201cwas very icy; very bad ice there.\u201d \u201cI saw it was an awful bad place. I mean by bad place, icy place. \u201d Rich, a witness for plaintiff, testified: \u201cI did not see anything peculiar about the ice. It was rather smoother than common.\u201d Wright testified that the walk was in \u201ca very bad condition; very icy; the ice was very uneven.\u201d Harrigan, a son of plaintiff, testified that the walk was \u201ccovered with ice, rough, and very rough ice at that. \u201d Peters testified the walk was \u201cicy and slippery. I can\u2019t remember anything peculiar about the formation of the ice; nothing different from other parts of the village; nothing particular there. \u201d Mary Ford was walking with plaintiff when she fell. She took no particular notice of the condition of the ice; \u201cnothing more than it was very slippery there, and very icy.\u201d Mary Condon was also next to plaintiff when she fell. \u201cIt was very icy there. There was a very little snow on the ice. \u201d The gutter along the walk was not open, and was filled with ice. Testimony was given to the effect that Mason, who kept the store which opened upon this walk, usually kept the walk swept, and sprinkled with ashes or saw-dust when it was slippery. Ho attempt was made to cut off or remove the ice. Rich, a witness for the plaintiff, and a clerk in Mason\u2019s store, testified: \u201cThere is ice there all the time in the winter. The sidewalk is such that it cannot be kept off. Whenever new ice formed, I put on ashes.\u201d Peters, one of the witnesses for plaintiff, testified \u201cthat all the streets were very slippery that Sunday. We were amused all day by seeing people slip and slide.\u201d Sibley, a witness for the defense, testified that \u201cthe streets were slippery all over town this Sunday, caused by the sleet of the night before.\u201d Gaffney, a witness for the defense, testified that he attended the \u201cwake\u201d on Saturday night of the person whose funeral the plaintiff attended on Sunday, and that at 12:45 Saturday night, when he left the wake, there was a sleet-storm. Myers, a witness for the defense, referring to a diary which he kept, testified that it \u201c was very cold and very slip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>pery\u201d on that Sunday; that it rained on the Friday previous. There is no attempt to contradict by one witness any statement made by any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The court charged the jury that, if the slipperiness of the walk which caused the plaintiff's fall was caused from the storm of the night before, the plaintiff could not recover. If caused by the rain of Friday, and the subsequent cold, it was a question for the jury whether the village had notice of the condition of the walk; that the court could not say, as a matter of law, that, after the lapse of 48 hours, the village ought not to have found it out, and removed it. It seems to us that the uncontradicted evidence in this case shows that this walk was covered with sleet by the storm of Saturday night, and that its ex-trem\u00e9 slipperiness was owing to that cause; and therefore, within <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>City of Yonkers, 105 </em>N. Y. 202, 11 N. E. Rep. 642, the defendant was not liable. The walk is not shown to have previously been left in such a condition, from want of ashes, salt, or sawdust, or from irregularity of surface, as to have contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s fall. The evidence does not justify a finding that the sidewalk had been, previous to the Sunday upon which the plaintiff fell, in the slippery condition in which it was on that day, but tends to show that it had been kept reasonably safe and convenient for the public travel. The testimony is undisputed that the streets all over the village were unusually slippery on that Sunday, and there is no evidence that the same condition existed upon the days immediately preceding.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We conclude to reverse the judgment, and grant a new trial; but, as the error is on the part of the jury, we conclude to require the defendant to pay the costs of the trial below, and of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
