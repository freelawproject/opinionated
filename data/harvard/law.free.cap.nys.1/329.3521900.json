Appeal from a judgment entered upon the verdict of a jury \u25a0on April 14, 1888, and from an order entered April 17,1888, denying defendants\u2019 motion upon the\" minutes to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. Tried before Pitshke, J., and a jury. Action brought to recover damages \u2022 alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff on November 22, 1886, while at work on the pier of Red Star Steam-Ship Company, in Jersey City, N. J. The \u25a0 complaint alleges that the plaintiff, while at work, \u201cwas struck on the head by some heavy missile, negligently and carelessly dropped or thrown by said \u25a0defendant, their agents, servants, or employes. \u201d Answer. General denial. Upon the trial it was admitted upon the record \u201cthat there was no question .in the case as to the personal negligence of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b341-12\">Argued before Browne, Ehrlich, and McGown, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-13\"><em>Ellison &amp; Gill, </em>for appellants. <em>Frederick E. Anderson, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b341-14\">McGown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">In order to entitle the plaintiff to recover herein, it was in\u25a0cumbent upon him to <em>show\u2014First, </em>that the plaintiff had sustained the injuries complained of through the negligent or wrongful acts of defendants\u2019 \u25a0employes while acting within the scope of their employment; <em>second, </em>that the persons who caused the injuries were at the time in defendants\u2019 employ. The \u25a0defendants\u2019 counsel requested the trial justice to charge \u201cthat, if there were \u25a0other persons than the servants of the defendants, upon the work at the time, and it is not shown affirmatively that it was the defendants\u2019 servants who caused the injury, and it may have been the act of other persons there at the time, that they will find for the defendants.\u201d This the justice declined to charge, and to which the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. I think the exception was well taken, and that the charge should have been made as requested. There was some evidence before the jury that there were other persons present on the pier besides the two workmen who are charged with having caused the injury complained of, and, if such was a fact, it was right and proper that the \u2022question should have been submitted to the jury, for'them to find, by their \u25a0verdict, whether the injuries were caused by the two workmen of the defend\u00edan ts, or whether they were caused by any other persons then present, not in \u25a0defendants\u2019 employ. As I think the exception above referred to well taken, I do not deem it necessary to consider the other questions raised by appellant\u2019s .attorney upon the appeal. A new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Browne and Ehrlich, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
