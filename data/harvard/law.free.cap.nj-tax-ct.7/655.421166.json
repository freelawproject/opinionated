It is contended that the court erred in utilizing the \u201crounded up\u201d average ratio of assessed to true value, as promulgated by the Director, Division of Taxation, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:1-35.1, rather than the \u201cactual\u201d average ratio, in determining whether any appellant was entitled to discrimination relief. A further contention is that there was no evidentiary support for the court\u2019s use of a 13% mortgage interest rate for purposes of its cash equivalency analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">We have carefully reviewed the record and are in accord with the conclusions of Judge Crabtree as set forth in his published opinion reported in 6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>406 (Tax Ct.1984) and his letter opinion dated May 4, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number> We are satisfied that there was sufficient credible evidence justifying the judge\u2019s utilization of a mortgage interest rate of 13% for purposes of the cash-equivalency market value analyses. Also, that the \u201crounded up\u201d school aid ratio as originally promulgated by the Director, Division of Taxation, was properly relied upon by the court inasmuch as such figure had been used by the parties during the trial and the validity of such rounding up had not been preserved as an issue in the pretrial order. <em>R. </em>4:25-1; <em>Rothman Realty Corp. v. Berick, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>590, 598, 376 A.2d 902 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
