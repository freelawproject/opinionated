Judge Andrew granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Andrew in his reported opinion of July 27, 1984 at 7 <em>N.J. Tax </em>224 (Tax Ct.1984). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-13, 14(a); <em>R. </em>8:2(a); <em>R. </em>8:4-l(b). We add only that the State action of which plaintiff complains occurs annually and is therefore now subject to review if challenged by a timely Tax Court complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
