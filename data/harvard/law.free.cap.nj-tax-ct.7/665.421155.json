THE NON-EXCLUSIVE CHARACTER OF CHAPTER 123 ENTITLED PLAINTIFF TO <em>KENTS </em>TYPE RELIEF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-26\">We affirm for the reasons stated in Judge Crabtree\u2019s 19-page written opinion of March 21, 1984 6 N.J.Tax 363, and his three-page written opinion of Mayl6,1984 on plaintiff\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>to reconsider. Despite the prodigious efforts of appellant\u2019s counsel we are convinced that the judge decided the issues based on substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Plaintiff-appellant carries a heavy burden in this challenge; it must show that the trial court\u2019s findings are without substantial support in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 485-486, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>G &amp; S Company v. Eatontown Bor., </em>6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>218 (App.Div.1982). Our court has noted that \u201c[sjince the judges assigned to the New Jersey Tax Court have special expertise, we will not disturb their findings unless they are plainly arbitrary or there is a lack of substantial evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. We do not read <em>Murnick v. Asbury Park, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>452, 471 A.2d 1196 (1984), as compelling a reopening of the record in the trial court. Our Supreme Court there said that as to the doctrine of finality \u201ctax appeals are no different from any other case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 471 A. 2d 1196. The taxpayer here did avoid itself of the opportunity of challenging the ratio before the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
