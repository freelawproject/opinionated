It was agreed that \u201cthe liability question was identical\u201d in all the actions. The sole issue is whether the judge rightly ruled that the evidence would not warrant a finding that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 case was this: Washington Street is a main thoroughfare. There is a \u201cstop and enter\u201d sign on Eddy Street for vehicles entering Washington Street from Eddy Street. There was no evidence that it was a blind corner. There was a curve in Washington Street as the defendant came toward Eddy Street. It was a frosty night. One of the plaintiffs warned the defendant about driving carefully before they entered the automobile. Some of the guests cautioned him just before the accident occurred. The defendant drove between forty and forty-five miles an hour. He did not slow down at intersecting streets, each of which had a \u201cstop and enter\u201d sign. As he got almost to the intersection with Eddy Street he saw another automobile \u201cshoot out of Eddy Street.\u201d It was in the area of intersection at that time. It did not slow down or stop at the intersection, but came out of Eddy Street on the left hand side of the center of the road as it was going. It was only a few feet away when the defendant saw it. The defendant turned his automobile \u201csharp right to pass behind this car,\u201d coming close to the curb on Eddy Street. His automobile tipped up on two wheels. To avoid turning over he swung \u201csharp left\u201d to the farther side of Eddy Street, struck the curb, and ten feet beyond struck and bent an iron electric light pole. His automobile turned over on its right side. If he had not \u201cturned to the right to pass behind this car he would have gone right through it.\u201d The place of the accident was well lighted. The lights on the automobile coming out of Eddy Street were lighted. There was \u201cpractically no traffic.\u201d There were no visible marks to indicate that the defendant put on his brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The case presented is that of a street corner accident in which either or both of the drivers could be found to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>been negligent, but we find in it no evidence tending to show that aggravated degree of culpability necessary to make out proof of gross negligence. The ruling was right. <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Mass. 149. <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>284 Mass. 208. <em>Desroches </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>285 Mass. 495, and cases cited. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Springfield Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., ante, </em>170.
