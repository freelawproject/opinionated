Moors, ante, </em>518, just decided, is an action to recover an assessment upon a stockholder in the Bank of United States. The declaration set out the facts and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>levy of an assessment as shown in the opinion in that case. The defendant demurred to the declaration, and also filed a \u201cplea in abatement,\u201d setting up (1) that the remedy should be in equity, (2) that the proceeding should have been brought in the Supreme Judicial Court instead of the Superior Court, and (3) that the liability can be enforced only by a receiver appointed in this Commonwealth. The demurrer and the \u201c plea\u201d were sustained, and the case was reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">The points that the remedy should be in equity, and that the liability can be enforced only by a receiver appointed in this Commonwealth, are disposed of by <em>Superintendent of Banks of New York </em>v. <em>Moors, ante, </em>518. There is nothing in the point that the proceeding should have been brought in the Supreme Judicial Court under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 167, \u00a7 24. That section relates to the liability of stockholders in domestic banks, not to contract obligations arising elsewhere. <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>244 Mass. 128. The declaration set out a good cause of action. <em>Superintendent of Banks of New York </em>v. <em>Moors, ante, </em>518.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer and plea reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
