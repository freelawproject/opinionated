It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove performance of these conditions on her part and likewise to allege such performance in her declaration. <em>Newton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Rubber Works </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>171 Mass. 352. <em>Marsch </em>v. <em>Southern New England Railroad, </em>230 Mass. 483, 490. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Warriner, </em>237 Mass. 36. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 7, Twelfth. There is no positive averment of the payment of the $100, although it is alleged that the defendant executed a paper acknowledging the receipt of that sum. There is no averment at all of any payment of a rental. There is no averment that the plaintiff continued with the negotiations with the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation. It does appear, however, that after the defendant had delayed his foreclosure sale about six months, \u201cthe operation of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation was temporarily suspended because of an exhaustion of the funds made available to it\u201d; that after a further delay of about three months the defendant foreclosed by sale; and that after the sale an officer of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation notified the attorney for the defendant \u201cthat the corporation was ready to proceed with the plaintiff\u2019s application.\u201d All this is by no means equivalent to an allegation that after making the contract the plaintiff continued with the original negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A reference in the declaration to postponement of the sale from time to time \u201cby oral agreement of the parties\u201d does not change the nature of the original agreement declared upon, nor do away with the necessity for alleging performance of conditions precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">For these reasons the demurrer was properly sustained. We need not discuss other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
