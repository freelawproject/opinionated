The same explosion resulted in the case of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Beacon Oil Co. </em>281 Mass. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">In the case at bar, an action of tort for alleged negligence, there was no evidence of specific negligence, and the only question is whether the rule <em>res ipso loquitur </em>applies. If it does, the burden of proof of negligence remains on the plaintiff <em>(Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Boston, Revere Beach &amp; Lynn Railroad, </em>256 Mass. 217, 218; <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>272 Mass. 346, 352, 353), and the tribunal of fact is never required to conclude that there was negligence, by dint of technical presumption <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>285 Mass. 192) or by any force of the occurrence as <em>prima facie </em>evidence within the definition of that expression in <em>Haun </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>LeGrand, </em>268 Mass. 582, and <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587. The rule <em>res ipso loquitur </em>merely permits the tribunal of fact, if it sees fit, in the absence of a finding of the specific cause of the occurrence <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>213 Mass. 392, 395, <em>et seq.; Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>272 Mass. 346, 352, 353), to infer from the occurrence itself that it would not have happened unless in some respect the defendant had been negligent. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>164 Mass. 42, 47. <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>216 Mass. 12, 17, 18. <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>272 Mass. 346, 351. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Erving, </em>228 U. S. 233. <em>Glowacki </em>v. <em>North Western Ohio Railway &amp; Power Co. </em>116 Ohio St. 451; <em>S. C. </em>53 Am. L. R. 1486, and note. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Tibbetts, </em>131 Maine, 318, 322. Compare <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">The plant was enclosed by a fence, and was not open to the public. This exclusiveness of control satisfies one requirement of the rule. <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>202 Mass. 491, 499. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Colonial Air Transport, Inc. </em>278 Mass. 420, 425. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, ante, </em>152. The process employed by the defendant was patented, had been in use since 1920, and in one hundred sixty-seven plants throughout the world had resulted in no other explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In 1890 it was held in New York that the rule <em>res ipso loquitur </em>could not be applied to an explosion in an oil refinery. <em>Cosulich </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, </em>122 N. Y. 118. Conceivably progress in the art might have made indicative of negligence a similar explosion in 1928. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Colonial Air Transport, Inc. </em>278 Mass. 420, 426. But in order to make applicable the rule <em>res ipso loquitur, </em>the tribunal of fact must be able to find, either by expert evidence (as in <em>James </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>204 Mass. 158, 162), or by its own common knowledge <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>164 Mass. 42, 47; <em>Minihan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 367, 373; <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>216 Mass. 255, 257; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Colonial Air Transport, Inc. </em>278 Mass. 420, 426), that the mere occurrence of the accident shows negligence as a cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>In the case at bar there was no such expert evidence. We think, notwithstanding <em>Gilroy </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>107 N. J. L. 170, that common knowledge would not warrant a finding of negligence from the mere fact of the explosion. The ruling in favor of the defendant was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant on the finding.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
