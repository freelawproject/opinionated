L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 25, for the reasons that she \u201clives more than thirty-miles from the place of trial\u201d and that she \u201cis so ill . . . or infirm as to make it probable that he [she] will not be able to attend at the trial.\u201d The objection to the .deposition was that the defendant, although allowed to file written cross interrogatories, was not given notice of the time of taking and therefore had no opportunity to cross-exam-inc orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The procedure adopted would have been appropriate to the taking of a deposition without the Commonwealth. A commission was issued, addressed to any justice of the peace or notary public <em>(Tucker </em>v. <em>Utley, </em>168 Mass. 415, 416), to which were annexed written interrogatories and cross interrogatories, to be answered by the deponent in the absence of the parties. It is only where the \u201ccourt otherwise orders,\u201d that a deposition without the Commonwealth is taken in the presence of both parties upon oral questions. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, 43. Rules 37 and 38 of the Superior Court (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">But no such commission issues for the taking of a deposition within the Commonwealth. After application to a justice of the peace or notary public, a notice issues and is served upon the adverse party (St. 1932, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, amending G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 29), requiring him to appear and \u201cpropose interrogatories\u201d at a time and place appointed for taking the deposition. St. 1932, c. 71, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 26. After being sworn, the deponent \u201cshall then be examined by the justice or notary, and the parties if they think fit, and his testimony shall be taken in writing.\u201d St. 1932, c. 71, \u00a7 3, amending G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 30. \u201cThe party producing the deponent shall be allowed first to examine him, either upon verbal or written interrogatories, on all the points which he considers material; the adverse party may then examine him in like manner, after which either party may propose further interrogatories.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The use in the present case of a form of taking deposi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tians which was not adapted to the situation, deprived the defendant of his seasonably asserted right of oral cross-examination. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>131 Mass. 88, 90.
