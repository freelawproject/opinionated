Holding that the post-conviction review statute does apply and is exclusive, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of this action brought by appellant under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Fernald was convicted of murder on May 27, 1966, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Maine State Prison. <em>See State v. Fernald, </em>Me., 248 A.2d 754 (1968) (direct appeal from murder conviction). The Governor on March 6, 1974, commuted Fernald\u2019s sentence from life to \u201celeven years, eleven months to life.\u201d The effect of the commutation was to advance the date on which Fernald became eligible for parole, and he was paroled on June 6, 1974. Three and a half years later, on February 16, 1978, he was convicted of robbery and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to concurrent terms of twenty years and ten years. <em>See State v. Fernald, </em>Me., 381 A.2d 282 (1978) (State\u2019s interlocutory appeal from pretrial order). In consequence of that conviction, Fernald\u2019s parole was revoked and he resumed serving the sentence imposed on his conviction for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">In 1981 Fernald initiated correspondence with the Parole Board asking that he be discharged from the original sentence. The Parole Board determined that Fernald was not eligible for discharge. Fernald persisted, and the Board sent him a letter dated September 23, 1981, informing him that future correspondence from him would not be answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-6\">[Pjlease be assured that any future correspondence to the Division of Probation and Parole or the Parole Board concerning your legal status with respect to these sentences will not be answered as it is clear that your questions and concerns have been adequately addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">Fernald then brought in Superior Court (Knox County) the petition now before us on appeal, styled \u201cpetition for judicial review of final agency action (5 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 11001).\u201d The Board moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the petition should have been brought under the post-conviction review statute. After a hearing, the court granted the Board\u2019s motion. The court entered the following notation on the docket:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-10\">Motion to dismiss: After hearing, Motion Granted. The Petitioner\u2019s exclusive remedy is Post Conviction Review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">Fernald appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">On the merits of Fernald\u2019s claim, the Parole Board takes the position that Fer-nald is serving a life sentence for his 1966 murder conviction and must serve ten years of parole successfully before he can be discharged from the sentence. Fernald argues that, as a result of the commutation, his sentence is a \u201cminimum-maximum\u201d sentence and the ten-year requirement does not apply. Fernald also disagrees with the Parole Board\u2019s assertion that his concurrent sentences for the 1978 convictions cannot begin until after the sentence for the 1966 murder conviction has been completed. On this appeal, we do not reach those contentions because the Superior Court was correct in dismissing Fernald\u2019s petition on the ground that judicial review of the Board\u2019s action or refusal to act was available only under the post-conviction review statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">Initially we must note that the Superior Court did not make a proper entry on the docket to dispose of the case. The entry must be in the form of an order directing a specific disposition of the matter in issue. \u201cMotion granted\u201d is ordinarily not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>sufficient to meet that requirement. <em>See State v. Baker, </em>Me., 390 A.2d 1086, 1088-89 (1978). Strictly speaking, an appeal taken without a proper docket entry is premature and should be dismissed. <em>See Breau v. Breau, </em>Me., 418 A.2d 193 (1980). In this case, however, the court\u2019s intent to dismiss the action is obvious; principles of judicial economy counsel that the deficiency in form should not delay the Law Court\u2019s consideration of this appeal. Accordingly, we simply direct that the docket entry be modified to read \u201caction dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">The post-conviction review statute by its terms is a mechanism for \u201creview of .. . criminal judgments and of post-sentencing proceedings occurring during the course of sentences.\u201d 15 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2122 (Supp. 1981). Section 2121(2) defines \u201cpost-sentencing proceeding\u201d as \u201ca court proceeding or administrative action occurring during the course of and pursuant to the operation of a sentence which affects whether there is incarceration or its length, including revocation of parole or entrustment of a juvenile, failure to grant parole or an error of law in the computation of a sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">On the face of these definitions, the Parole Board\u2019s refusal to discharge Fernald from his sentence under the 1966 conviction plainly is a \u201cpost-sentencing proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the post-conviction review statute. It is an \u201cadministrative action occurring during the course of and pursuant to the operation of a sentence which affects whether there is incarceration or its length.\u201d Further, it appears that Fernald is alleging that the Parole Board committed \u201can error of law in the computation of a sentence\u201d: namely, treating Fer-nald\u2019s sentence under the 1966 conviction as a life sentence rather than a \u201cminimum-maximum\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">If one gives the word \u201csentence\u201d its plain and ordinary meaning, it is beyond doubt that the post-conviction review statute provides Fernald with a way of getting judicial review of the Parole Board\u2019s action or inaction. Fernald, however, raises a problem with applying the customary rule of construction that statutory language will be given its plain and ordinary meaning, <em>see Paradis v. Webber Hospital, </em>Me., 409 A.2d 672, 675 (1979). As used in the post-conviction review statute, section 2121(3) defines \u201csentence\u201d as \u201cmeanpng] a sentence pursuant to Title 17-A, section 1152, or a juvenile disposition entered pursuant to section 3314.\u201d Title 17-A, the Maine Criminal Code, became effective May 1, 1976. Fernald\u2019s sentence for murder was imposed in 1966 pursuant, of course, not to section 1152, but rather to pre-Code law. He therefore argues that the post-conviction review statute does not apply to his sentence and other means may and indeed must be used to secure judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">We disagree. Any statute must be construed as a whole in order to effectuate the legislative intent. <em>In re Belgrade Shores, Inc., </em>Me., 359 A.2d 59, 61 (1976); <em>Rackliff v. Inhabitants of Greenbush, </em>93 Me. 99, 104, 44 A. 375, 376 (1899). Although the definition of \u201csentence\u201d in section 2121(3) standing alone appears to be restrictive, other language in the post-conviction review statute makes it clear that the statute was intended to apply to sentences imposed prior to the effective date of the Criminal Code. The very definition of \u201cpost-sentencing proceeding\u201d includes \u201crevocation of parole or ... failure to grant parole.\u201d Since the Criminal Code abolished the institution of parole except as applied to prisoners sentenced prior to the Code\u2019s effective date, the reference to parole proceedings in section 2121(2) has one obvious meaning: the post-conviction review statute is intended to apply to proceedings involving pre-Code sentences such as Fernald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">Strong support for this proposition is provided by 15 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2122, which contains a broad statement of the purpose of the post-conviction review statute. The purpose is to \u201cprovide a comprehensive and, except for direct appeals from a criminal judgment, the exclusive method of review of those criminal judgments and of post-sentencing proceedings occurring during the course of sentences.\u201d Section 2122, enacted as part of a complete revision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>post-conviction procedures to be effective July 3, 1980, goes on to state that the post-conviction review statute replaces \u201cremedies available pursuant to post-conviction habeas corpus, ... coram nobis, writ of error, declaratory judgment and any other previous common law or statutory method of review, except appeal of a judgment of conviction or juvenile adjudication and remedies which are incidental to proceedings in the trial court.\u201d The plain purpose of the post-conviction review statute is to provide a single, unified system of post-conviction relief, replacing the procedural complexities of the past. <em>Cf. Doyon v. State, </em>158 Me. 190, 198-99, 181 A.2d 586, 590, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 849, 83 S.Ct. 85, 9 L.Ed.2d 84 (1962) (remarking on prisoners\u2019 complaint that they were caught on the \u201cpost-conviction merry-go-round\u201d). That purpose is fully served only by applying the provisions of the post-conviction review statute to sentences imposed both before and after the effective date of the Criminal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">Having decided that issue, we can easily dispose of Fernald\u2019s contention that he has an alternative mode of relief under the judicial review provision of the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, 5 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 11001 (1979 &amp; Supp.1981). We have already noted that 15 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2122 expressly provides that the post-conviction review statute shall be the exclusive mode of review of the matters that it covers. This provision brings this case within the exception clauses of sections 11001 and 8003 of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The entry is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Judgment of Superior Court modified to read \u201cAction dismissed.\u201d As so modified, judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1287-7\">All concurring.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">. 15 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2121 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1981), enacted as chapter 305-A of title 15 by P.L.1979, ch. 701, \u00a7 15, to be effective July 3, 1980, and amended in respects not here relevant by P.L. 1981, ch. 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1285-14\">.
