Code, \u00a7 11500 et seq.) and the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\"><em>The First Action </em>(No. C 101761)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">On October 3, 1974, in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, the Socialist Workers 1974 California Campaign Committee and others<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Edmund G. Brown, Jr., Secretary of State, and Evelle J. Younger, Attorney General. Plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint alleged: Elections Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>sections 11518, subdivisions (e) and (f), 11562, 11563, 11564 and 11580<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> together require public disclosure of the names, residence addresses and business addresses of all individuals who make contributions of $100 or more to campaign committees or candidates, and all individuals to whom expenditures of $100 or more are made by campaign committees and candidates, and prohibit anonymous contributions of $100 or more; said statutes deprive plaintiffs and their contributors, supporters and adherents of their rights of associational privacy and anonymity guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, 10, 13 and 23, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>California Constitution. Plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctions enjoining defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from enforcing against plaintiffs the challenged sections of the Elections Code. Plaintiffs also sought a judgment declaring that such sections are unconstitutional on their faces and as applied to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">On October 24, 1974, following a hearing on order to show cause, the trial court (Judge Lucas) denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction. On October 29, 1974, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal (Civ. No. 45943) from the order denying a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On October 30, 1974, each of the defendants filed a cross-complaint against plaintiff campaign committees seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering cross-defendants to comply with the challenged sections of the Elections Code. On December 6, 1974, a hearing was held pursuant to an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. On December 10th, the trial court (Judge Lucas) issued a preliminary injunction which ordered that cross-defendants, during the pendency of the action, file campaign statements regarding the November 1974 election in full compliance with the requirements of the Waxman-Dymally Campaign Disclosure Act (Elec. Code, \u00a7 11500 et seq.), \u201cincluding but not limited to the requirement of such law that the names and other identifying information be provided for persons who make contributions and loans and who receive expenditures.\u201d The preliminary injunction further provided; cross-defendants could omit from the campaign statements any such information which they claimed was constitutionally protected, if the omitted information was filed with the trial court under seal; the information so filed with the court was to be kept confidential until final determination of the action, \u201cwhereupon if defendants and cross-complainants do not prevail, the information filed with this Court under seal shall be immediately destroyed without said seal being broken.\u201d Cross-defendants appeal (Civ. No. 46314) from the order granting the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Meanwhile, on October 17, 1974, Common Cause and Michael Walsh filed a petition for leave to intervene as defendants. The petition alleged: Common Cause is a nonprofit District of Columbia corporation composed of 330,000 members throughout the United States; over 64,000 of such members are residents of California; Michael Walsh is the California chairman of Common Cause; Common Cause was organized to work for the improvement of political and governmental institutions and processes on federal, state and local levels in the United States; therefore, Common Cause and its members have a \u201cdirect interest\u201d in laws relating to the reporting and public disclosure by political committees which make contributions and expenditures for the purpose of influencing the election of candidates for office in California. On October 17th, an ex parte order was made granting Common Cause and Walsh leave to intervene as parties defendant. Interveners filed an answer to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Plaintiffs moved to vacate the order granting intervention, and to strike the answer in intervention, on the ground that interveners lacked the requisite direct interest in the outcome of the litigation. On December 6, 1974, the trial court (Judge Pacht) granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Common Cause and Walsh appeal (Civ. No. 46314) from the order of December 6th which vacated the order granting leave to intervene and struck the answer in intervention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><em>The Second Action </em>(No. C 115029)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On February 19, 1975, in Los Angeles County superior court, Central-East Los Angeles Socialist Workers\u2019 Campaign Committee and others<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> commenced an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Burt Pines, Los Angeles City Attorney. The verified complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>challenged the constitutionality of Government Code, sections 84210, subdivisions (g) and (h), 84301, 84302, 84303, 84304, 84200 and 81008,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the same grounds that formed the basis of the challenge to the Elections Code sections in action No. C 101761. Plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining defendant<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from enforcing against plaintiffs the enumerated sections of the Government Code. Plaintiffs also sought a judgment declaring that such sections are unconstitutional on their faces and as applied to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. Following a hearing, the trial court (Judge Dowds) denied the motion. Plaintiffs appeal (Civ. No. 46258) from the order denying their motion for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">I. <em>Appeals from Orders Denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Applications for Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The granting or denial of a preliminary injunction is within the discretion of the trial court, and its order may be reversed on appeal only if an abuse of discretion is shown. (People v. <em>Black's Food Store </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 59, 61 [105 P.2d 361]; <em>Santa Cruz F. B. Assn. </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1894) 104 Cal. 306, 308 [37 P. 1034]; <em>Gosney </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 921, 924 [89 Cal.Rptr. 390]; <em>Harbor Chevrolet Corp. </em>v. <em>Machinists Local Union 1484 </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 380, 384 [343 P.2d 640].)  \u201c \u2018The granting or denial of a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy. It merely determines that the court, balancing the respective equities of the parties, concludes that, pending a trial on the merits, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>should or that he should not be restrained from exercising the rights claimed by him.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kendall </em>v. <em>Foulks </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 171, 175 [179 P. 886]; <em>Miller &amp; Lux </em>v. <em>Madera Canal etc. Co. </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 59, 62-63 [99 P. 502].) In reaching that conclusion, the court considers whether a greater injury will result to the defendant (and to third persons) from granting the injunction or to the plaintiff from refusing it. <em>(Santa Cruz F. B. Assn. </em>v. <em>Grant, supra, </em>104 Cal. at p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaints for injunctive relief allege: members and supporters of the Socialist Workers Party have been, and continue to be, subjected to \u201cgovernmental and private\u201d harassment, and reprisal; fear of such consequences has deterred several persons from joining the party, and from rendering financial assistance or services to the party; therefore, the challenged public disclosure requirements of the Elections Code and the Government Code deprive plaintiffs and their contributors and supporters of their rights of \u201cassociational privacy and anonymity\u201d guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and by parallel provisions of the California Constitution. In support of their respective applications for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs submitted a great many declarations. These showed that some of the members and supporters of the Socialist Workers Party have lost jobs and housing, and have been the targets of physical violence, because of their association with the party. It also appears from the declarations that some persons have been reluctant to contribute financially to the party because they fear that public disclosure of their contributions may subject them to economic or physical reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The right to engage in political expression and association is guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>(N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 449, 460 [2 L.Ed.2d 1488, 1498, 78 S.Ct. 1163]; <em>Sweezy </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 234, 250 [1 L.Ed.2d 1311, 1325, 77 S.Ct. 1203].) But such right is not absolute; it is \u201csubject to reasonable restriction for reasons of compelling state interest.\u201d <em>(Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo </em>(D.C. Cir. 1975) 519 F.2d 821, 868, app. pending, see: 423 U.S. 820 [46 L.Ed.2d 36, 96 S.Ct. 32].) The dual purpose of both the Waxman-Dymally Campaign Disclosure Act and the Political Reform Act of 1974 is to inform the electorate and to prevent the corruption of the political process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   The achievement of these objectives promotes a com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>polling state interest. (See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, supra, </em>519 F.2d at p. 867; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 509, 524 [96 Cal.Rptr. 584, 487 P.2d 1224]; <em>Canon </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 446, 452-453 [39 Cal.Rptr. 228, 393 P.2d 428].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In balancing the injury to plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights which would result from denial of a preliminary injunction, as against the injury to the people of California which would result from the granting of the injunction, the trial court properly could have concluded (and doubtless did conclude) that the latter injury would be the' greater.  \u201c[W]here an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest for whose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though the <em>postponement may be burdensome to plaintiff. . . . \u2018Courts of </em>equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yakus </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1944) 321 U.S. 414, 440-441 [88 L.Ed. 834, 857-858, 64 S.Ct. 660].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Upon appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction, the scope of inquiry is limited to determining whether or not the trial court has abused its discretion (see <em>Froomer </em>v. <em>Drollinger </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 787, 788-789 [7 Cal.Rptr. 268]), and the burden is upon the appellant to make a clear showing of abuse of that discretion. (O'Shea v. <em>Tile Layers Union </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 373, 377-378 [318 P.2d 102].) On the present appeals, plaintiffs make no such showing; they argue only the merits of the controversy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We cannot, at this stage of the litigation, determine the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. (See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1875) 50 Cal. 344, 345; <em>State Bd. of Barber Examiners </em>v. <em>Star </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 736, 739-740 [87 Cal.Rptr. 450]; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Allied Dairymen, Inc. </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 112, 121 [25 Cal.Rptr. 595].) We conclude only that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary injunctions. Such conclusion is no intimation of what the judgment should be following a trial on the merits. <em>(Patterson </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>Supervisors, supra, </em>50 Cal. at p. 345; <em>French Art Cleaners </em>v. <em>St. Bd. etc. Cleaners </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 890, 897 [206 P.2d 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">II. <em>Appealfrom Order Granting Cross-complainants\u2019 Applications for Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Cross-defendants contend the trial court was without jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because it was issued after cross-defendants had perfected their appeal from the order denying their application for a preliminary injunction. This contention is based upon Code of Civil Procedure, section 916, which provides in part: \u201c(a) ... the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">By its order denying plaintiffs/cross-defendants\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction, the trial court refused to enjoin defendants/cross-complainants from enforcing the Waxman-Dymally Campaign Disclosure Act against cross-defendants during the pendency of the action. The preliminary injunction, which was issued after perfection of the appeal from that order, required cross-defendants to comply with the act. The preliminary injunction thus had the effect of enforcing the order denying a preliminary injunction.  It follows that the order granting the preliminary injunction is void (see <em>California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 859, 862, fn. 3 [109 Cal.Rptr. 297, 512 P.2d 1201]; <em>Dallman </em>v. <em>Dallman </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 815, 817-818 [331 P.2d 245]), and must be reversed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-20\">Cross-complainants point to the rule that an appeal from a collateral matter, such as an order denying a preliminary injunction, does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to try the cause on its merits. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Bybee </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 564, 571 [141 P.2d 32]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) Appeal, \u00a7 6, p. 4024.) However, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction here to issue the preliminary injunction cannot be sustained under that rule. As previously stated, an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy. <em>(Bomberger </em>v. <em>McKelvey </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>607, 612 [220 P.2d 729]; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Allied Dairymen, Inc., supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at p. 121.) Its purpose is to preserve the status quo until the merits of the action can be determined. (Continental <em>Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 512, 528 [67 Cal.Rptr. 761, 439 P.2d 889]; <em>Wind </em>v. <em>Herbert </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 276, 283 [8 Cal.Rptr. 817].) Instead of preserving the status quo, the preliminary injunction compelled to alter their position from that of noncompliance with the act to one of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">III. <em>Appeal from Order Denying Intervention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Code of Civil Procedure, section 387 provides in part: \u201cAt any time before trial, any person, who has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, may intervene in the action or proceeding.\u201d  The right to intervene thus granted is not absolute; intervention properly is permitted only if the petitioner shows facts which satisfy the requirements of the statute. <em>(Hausmann </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 611, 614 [29 Cal.Rptr. 75]; <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 511, 515 [345 P.2d 25]; <em>Faus </em>v. <em>Pacific Elec. Ry. Co. </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 352, 355-356 [285 P.2d 1017].) The \u201cinterest\u201d mentioned in section 387 which entitles a person to intervene must be \u201cdirect and not consequential\u201d <em>(Isaacs </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1898) 121 Cal. 257, 261 [53 P. 793, 1101]); it must be of such direct and immediate character that the intervener will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment that may be rendered. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>California Water &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 104, 109 [187 P.2d 393]; <em>Jersey Maid Milk Products Co. </em>v. <em>Brock </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 661, 663 [91 P.2d 599]; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1914) 168 Cal. 727, 734 [145 P. 101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-25\">The petition in intervention, filed by Common Cause and Michael Walsh in superior court action No. C 101761, fails to show that they possess the requisite direct interest in the subject matter of plaintiffs\u2019 action to enjoin enforcement of the Waxman-Dymally Campaign Disclosure Act against plaintiffs. As stated in <em>Jersey Maid Milk Products Co. </em>v. <em>Brock, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at page 664: \u201cAny judgment rendered in said action will have no direct effect whatever upon any person other than the parties to said action. If the judgment should be in favor of the plaintiffs the defendant will be restrained from enforcing said acts against the plaintiffs but against no other person. If it should be in favor of the defendant, then the latter would be free from any legal restraint to enforce said judgment against the plaintiffs. This judgment would in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>way be binding upon the interveners as long as they are not parties to said action, and they will be as free to pursue their business after the rendition of said judgment, as they were before. They, therefore, would not gain or lose by the direct operation of the judgment. ... as the judgment so rendered would have no binding effect upon the as it would upon the parties to this proceeding, and would in no way directly affect them, their interest is not a direct but a mere consequential interest in the matter in litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Plaintiffs Socialist Workers 1974 California Campaign Committee, et al., also sought a judgment declaring that the challenged provisions of the act are unconstitutional on their faces and as applied to plaintiffs. Regarding the validity of the act on its face, petitioners stand in the same position as that of all of the people of California; therefore, petitioners have only an indirect and inconsequential interest (see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>California Water &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 109) in a declaration of the facial validity or invalidity of the act. Likewise, under the reasoning of the <em>Jersey Maid </em>case, petitioners would not be directly affected by a judgment declaring that the act is, or is not, constitutional as applied to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Each of the orders denying a preliminary injunction is affirmed. The order which vacated the order granting leave to intervene, and struck the answer in intervention, is affirmed. The order granting a preliminaiy injunction is reversed. Each party is to bear its own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Kingsley, Acting P. J., and Jefferson (Bernard), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">On January 9, 1976, the judgment was modified to read as printed above. The petitions of all the plaintiffs and appellants and of the defendants, cross-complainants and respondents for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied March 3, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The other plaintiffs were: Berkeley-Oakland Socialist Workers Campaign 1974, East Los Angeles Socialist Workers 1974 Campaign Committee, West Los Angeles Socialist Workers 1974 Campaign Committee, San Diego Socialist Workers 1974 Campaign Committee, San Francisco Socialist Workers 1974 Campaign Committee, Olga and Jane Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The complaint alleged: plaintiff committees were organized to support candidates nominated by the Socialist Workers Party for election to federal and state offices throughout California; the committees receive contributions and make expenditures on behalf of such candidates; plaintiff Rodriguez is the candidate of the Socialist Workers Party for Governor of California in the statewide election to be held November 5, 1974; plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of California who wishes to contribute more than $100 to plaintiff Socialist Workers 1974 California Campaign Committee; she declines to do so because her contribution may not be made anonymously.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-4\">These sections of the Elections Code read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">11518: \u201c\u2018Campaign statement\u2019 means an itemized report signed under penalty of perjury which is prepared on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, and which provides the following information: ...
