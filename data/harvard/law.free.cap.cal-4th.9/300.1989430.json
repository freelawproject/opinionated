Code, \u00a7 246)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a felony \u201cinherently dangerous to human life\u201d for purposes of the second degree felony-murder doctrine, and, if so, whether that doctrine nonetheless is inapplicable in the present case under the so-called \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine applied in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323] and its progeny. For the reasons explained hereafter, we conclude that this offense, for such purposes, is a felony inherently dangerous to human life and does not \u201cmerge\u201d with a resulting homicide so as to preclude application of the felony-murder doctrine. Because the Court of Appeal reached a similar conclusion, we affirm the judgment of that court upholding defendant\u2019s conviction of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On September 19, 1991, defendant Michael Hansen, together with Rudolfo Andrade and Alexander Maycott, planned to purchase $40 worth of methamphetamine. With that purpose, defendant, accompanied by his girlfriend Kimberly Geldon and Maycott, drove in defendant\u2019s Camaro to an apartment duplex located in the City of San Diego. Upon arriving at the duplex, defendant pounded on the door of the upstairs apartment where Christina Almenar resided with her two children. When he received no response, defendant proceeded to return to his automobile and was approached by Michael Behaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Behaves resided in the downstairs apartment with Martha Almenar (Christina\u2019s sister) and Martha\u2019s two children, Diane Rosalez, thirteen years of age, and Louie Miranda, five years of age. At the time, Diane and Louie were outside with Behaves helping him with yard work. In response to a question from Behaves, defendant said he was looking for Christina. When Behaves stated he had not seen her, defendant asked whether Behaves would be able to obtain some crystal methamphetamine (speed). After making a telephone call, Behaves informed defendant that he would be able to do so. Defendant said he would attempt to purchase the drug elsewhere but, if unsuccessful, would return.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Defendant and his companions departed but returned approximately 20 minutes later. Defendant, accompanied by Behaves, Maycott, and Geldon, then drove a short distance to another apartment complex. Defendant parked his vehicle, gave Behaves two $20 bills, and told Behaves he would wait while Behaves obtained the methamphetamine. Behaves said he would be back shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">When Behaves failed to return, defendant and his companions proceeded to Behaves\u2019s apartment. Defendant knocked on the door and the windows. Diane and Louie were inside the apartment alone but did not respond. Their mother, Martha, had left the apartment to meet Behaves, who had telephoned her after eluding defendant. After meeting Behaves at a hardware store, Martha telephoned her children from a public telephone booth. Diane answered and told her mother that the \u201cguys in the Camaro\u201d had returned, pounded on the door, and then had left.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Meanwhile, defendant, Maycott, and Geldon returned to the location where Andrade was waiting for them, acquiring en route a handgun from an acquaintance. The three men then decided to return to Behaves\u2019s apartment with the objective either of recovering their money or physically assaulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Behaves. At approximately 7:30 p.m., defendant approached the apartment building in his automobile with the lights turned off, and then from the vehicle fired the handgun repeatedly at the dwelling. At the time, Diane was inside the apartment, in the living room with her brother. The kitchen and living room lights were on. Diane was struck fatally in the head by one of the bullets fired by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">On the basis of information furnished by witnesses to the shooting, the police were able to trace to defendant the vehicle from which the shots had been fired. On September 20, at approximately 3 a.m., police officers arrested defendant at the room of a motel where he was staying. Searching the trunk of his Camaro, the police discovered a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun and an empty ammunition clip for the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Five bullet holes were found at the scene of the homicide inside the apartment. It later was determined that shell casings and three bullets recovered at that location had been fired from the handgun found inside the trunk of defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">That same morning, at 7 a.m., defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1965) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) and waived them. He then confessed to having fired several shots from a handgun aimed at the apartment building. He stated that he had been v/aiting for someone whom he believed \u201ctook off with forty bucks\u201d belonging to him, that he was shooting at \u201c[j]ust the house,\u201d and that he would not have engaged in this conduct had he known \u201cthose kids were in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">At trial, as part of the defense case, defendant testified that on the day of the shooting he had consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol and some crystal methamphetamine. He further testified that, when he initially returned to Behaves\u2019s apartment, he had observed the lights were on, but after knocking on the door and receiving no response, he believed no one was inside. He denied any recollection of actually having fired the shots at the apartment, although he remembered hearing \u201cfour or five loud noises,\u201d and denied having intended to harm anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">A neurologist and a neuropsychologist testified that defendant suffered from a mild prefrontal lobe injury that, in conjunction with the use of alcohol and drugs, could result in sudden, unplanned, and impulsive actions. A toxicologist testified regarding defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level and its possible effects, based upon defendant\u2019s report as to the amount of alcohol he had consumed prior to the shooting. (His testimony did not refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>possible effect of defendant\u2019s use of crystal methamphetamine, as testified to by defendant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on several theories of murder, including second degree felony murder as an unlawful killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life, and further instructed that the felony of shooting at an inhabited dwelling is inherently dangerous to human life. The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of second degree murder (without specifying the theory upon which the conviction was based), and found true the allegation that he personally used a firearm during the commission of that offense (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). The jury also found defendant guilty of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling. At sentencing, the trial court imposed a term of imprisonment of 15 years to life for the second degree murder conviction, plus a consecutive term of 4 years for the personal-use-of-a-firearm enhancement. The court also imposed a term of five years for the offense of shooting at an inhabited dwelling, but stayed the sentence for that offense pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On appeal, defendant asserted, among other contentions, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on second degree felony murder based upon the underlying felony of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling, because the latter offense merged with the resulting homicide within the meaning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522. Defendant relied upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Wesley </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-910 [89 Cal.Rptr. 377], a decision holding that the offense proscribed by section 246 was an integral part of the resulting homicide and therefore could not support a second degree felony-murder conviction. Defendant also asserted as error the imposition of the firearm-use enhancement. Concluding the underlying felony proscribed by section 246 did not merge with the homicide, the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction of second degree murder but struck the section 12022.5 firearm-use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.  (\u00a7 187, subd. (a).) Second degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice, but without the additional elements (i.e., willfulness, premeditation, and deliberation) that would support a conviction of first degree murder. (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nieto Benitez </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 91, 102 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 864, 840 P.2d 969].)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Malice may be express or implied. (\u00a7 188.) It is express \u201cwhen there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fellow creature.\u201d (\u00a7 188.) It is implied \u201cwhen no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (\u00a7 188.) We have held that implied malice has both a physical and a mental component, the physical component being the performance of \u201c \u2018an act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life,\u2019 \u201d and the mental component being the requirement that the defendant \u201c \u2018 knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 615, 626 [262 Cal.Rptr. 195, 778 P.2d 549]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 300 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The felony-murder rule imputes the requisite malice for a minder conviction to those who commit a homicide during the perpetration of a felony inherently dangerous to human life. \u201cUnder well-settled principles of criminal liability a person who kills\u2014whether or not he is engaged in an independent felony at the time\u2014is guilty of murder <em>if he acts with malice aforethought. </em>The felony-murder doctrine, whose ostensible purpose is to deter those engaged in felonies from killing negligently or accidentally, operates to posit the existence of that crucial mental state\u2014and thereby to render irrelevant evidence of actual malice or the lack thereof\u2014when the killer is engaged in a felony whose inherent danger to human life renders logical an imputation of malice on the part of all who commit it.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Satchell </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 28, 43 [98 Cal.Rptr. 33, 489 P.2d 1361, 50 A.L.R.3d 383], cited by <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal. 3d 615, 626.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The felony-murder rule applies to both first and second degree murder. Application of the first degree felony-murder rule is invoked by the perpetration of one of the felonies enumerated in section 189. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772, 795 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892], the court restricted the felonies that could support a conviction of second degree murder, based upon a felony-murder theory, to those felonies that are \u201cinherently dangerous to human life.\u201d We have explained that the justification for the imputation of implied malice under these circumstances is that, \u201cwhen society has declared certain inherently dangerous conduct to be felonious, a defendant should not be allowed to excuse himself by saying he was unaware of the danger to life . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 626.) We also have reasoned, that, \u2018\u201c[i]f the felony is not inherently dangerous, it is highly improbable that the potential felon will be deterred; he will not anticipate that any injury or death might arise solely from the fact that he will commit the felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824, 829 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894].) Thus, under the latter circumstances the commission of the felony could not serve logically as the basis for imputation of malice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 86, 93-94 [137 Cal.Rptr. 1, 560 P.2d 1180].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In determining whether a felony is inherently dangerous, the court looks to the elements of the felony <em>in the abstract, </em>\u201cnot the \u2018particular\u2019 facts of the case,\u201d i.e., not to the defendant\u2019s specific conduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 452, 458, fn. 5 [47 Cal.Rptr. 7, 406 P.2d 647].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Past decisions of this court have explained further the concept of an inherently dangerous felony. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 824, 833, we held that an inherently dangerous felony is one which, \u201cby its very nature, . . . cannot be committed without creating a substantial risk that someone will be killed . . . .\u201d And, most recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 615, we specified that, \u201cfor purposes of the second degree felony-murder doctrine, an \u2018inherently dangerous felony\u2019 is an offense carrying \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Felonies that have been found inherently dangerous to human life, in the abstract\u2014thus supporting application of the second degree felony-murder rule\u2014include furnishing a poisonous substance (methyl alcohol) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattison </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 177 [93 Cal.Rptr. 185, 481 P.2d 193]), reckless or malicious possession of a destructive device <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 620, 646 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 343]), and kidnapping for ransom <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1225 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382]).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The initial question presented in the case before us is whether the underlying felony involved\u2014willful discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling\u2014is an inherently dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule. The offense in question is defined in section 246, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who shall maliciously and willfully discharge a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house ... is guilty of a felony ... .[\u00b6] As used in this section, \u2018inhabited\u2019 means currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we shall explain, we conclude that this felony, considered in the abstract, involves a high probability that death will result and therefore is an inherently dangerous felony under the governing principles set forth above, for purposes of the second degree felony-murder doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Although our court has not had occasion previously to render a direct holding on the question whether the offense proscribed by section 246 is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>inherently dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder doctrine, the reasoning and language of one of our prior decisions\u2014 <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 28\u2014provide a rather clear indication of this court\u2019s view on this issue. In <em>Satchell, </em>the court held the felony of possession of a concealable firearm by a felon (\u00a7 12021), considered in the abstract, was not inherently dangerous to human life and therefore would not support an instruction on second degree felony murder. The court concluded that \u201cmere passive possession\u201d of a firearm, even by a felon, could not properly supply the element of malice in a murder prosecution. (6 Cal.3d at p. 42.) The court went on to say, however, that if passive possession ripened into a felonious act in which danger to human life was inherent, the purposes of the felony-murder rule would be served by its application, because \u201cit is the deterrence of such acts by felons which the rule is designed to accomplish.\u201d (6 Cal.3d at p. 43.) The court noted that a \u201cready example\u201d of such a felony was the act proscribed by section 246, discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling. (6 Cal.3d at p. 43, fii. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Although the pertinent language in <em>Satchell </em>clearly was dictum, the reasoning underlying this language remains sound following our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 615. The discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house\u2014by definition, a dwelling \u201ccurrently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not\u201d (\u00a7 246)\u2014is a felony whose commission inherently involves a danger to human life. An inhabited dwelling house is one in which persons reside <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1005, 1018 [232 Cal.Rptr. 132, 728 P.2d 202]) and where occupants \u201care generally <em>in </em>or <em>around </em>the premises.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1303 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 259], italics in original.) In firing a gun at such a structure, there always will exist a significant likelihood that an occupant may be present. Although it is true that a defendant may be guilty of this felony even if, at the time of the shooting, the residents of the inhabited dwelling happen to be absent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1018), the offense nonetheless is one that, viewed in the abstract\u2014as shooting at a structure that currently is used for dwelling purposes\u2014poses a great risk or \u201chigh probability\u201d of death within the meaning of <em>Patterson. </em>The nature of the other acts proscribed by section 246 reinforces the conclusion that the Legislature viewed the offense of discharging a firearm at an <em>inhabited dwelling </em>as posing a risk of death comparable to that involved in shooting at an <em>occupied </em>building or motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Furthermore, application of the second degree felony-murder rule to a homicide resulting from a violation of section 246 directly would serve the fundamental rationale of the felony-murder rule\u2014the deterrence of negligent or accidental killings in the course of the commission of dangerous felonies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The tragic death of innocent and often random victims, both young and old, as the result of the discharge of firearms, has become an alarmingly common occurrence in our society\u2014a phenomenon of enormous concern to the public. By providing notice to persons inclined to willfully discharge a firearm at an inhabited dwelling\u2014even to those individuals who would do so merely to frighten or intimidate the occupants, or to \u201cleave their calling card\u201d\u2014that such persons will be guilty of murder should their conduct result in the all-too-likely fatal injury of another, the felony-murder rule may serve to deter this type of reprehensible conduct, which has created a climate of fear for significant numbers of Californians even in the privacy of their own homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling is an \u201cinherently dangerous felony\u201d for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Defendant contends that, even if the section 246 felony of discharging a firearm is inherently dangerous to human life, the commission of that felony in the present case \u201cmerged\u201d with the resulting homicide, within the meaning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, thereby precluding application of the second degree felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">As we shall explain, defendant\u2019s contention rests upon an unduly expansive view of the scope of the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine applied in <em>Ireland. </em>Prior to our decision in <em>Ireland, </em>the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine had been developed in other jurisdictions as a shorthand explanation for the conclusion that the felony-murder rule should not be applied in circumstances where the only underlying (or \u201cpredicate\u201d) felony committed by the defendant was <em>assault. </em>The name of the doctrine derived from the characterization of the assault as an offense that \u201cmerged\u201d with the resulting homicide. In explaining the basis for the merger doctrine, courts and legal commentators reasoned that, because a homicide generally results from the commission of an assault, every felonious assault ending in death automatically would be elevated to murder in the event a felonious assault could serve as the predicate felony for purposes of the felony-murder doctrine. Consequently, application of the felony-murder rule to felonious assaults would usurp most of the law of homicide, relieve the prosecution in the great majority of homicide cases of the burden of having to prove malice in order to obtain a murder conviction, and thereby frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent to punish certain felonious assaults resulting in death (those committed with malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as murder) more harshly than other felonious assaults <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that happened to result in death (those committed without malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as manslaughter). (See Note, <em>The Doctrine of Merger in Felony-Murder and Misdemeanor-Manslaughter </em>(1960) 35 St. Johns L. Rev. 109, 117; see also Crump &amp; Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine </em>(1985) 8 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y. 359, 379; Note, <em>Application of the Merger Doctrine to the Felony Murder Rule in Texas: The Merger Muddle </em>(1990) 42 Baylor L. Rev. 535; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1927) 246 N.Y. 100 [158 N.E. 35, 36-37] (opn. of Cardozo, C. J.).) One commentator explains that the merger rule applied to assaults is supported by the policy of preserving some meaningful domain in which the Legislature\u2019s careful gradation of homicide offenses can be implemented. (Crump &amp; Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine, op. cit. supra, </em>8 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y. 359, 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, we adopted the merger rule in a case involving the underlying felony of assault with a deadly weapon, where the defendant had shot and killed his wife. The jury was instructed that it could return a second degree felony-murder verdict based upon the underlying felony of assault with a deadly weapon, and the defendant was convicted of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On appeal, this court reversed, reasoning that \u201c[t]o allow such use of the felony-murder rule would effectively preclude the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought in all cases wherein homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious assault\u2014a category which includes the great majority of all homicides. This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law.\u201d (70 Cal.2d at p. 539.) The court therefore concluded that the offense of assault with a deadly weapon, which was \u201can integral part of\u2019 and \u201cincluded <em>in fact\" </em>within the homicide, could not support a second degree felony-murder instruction. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Subsequent decisions have applied the <em>Ireland </em>rule to other felonies involving assault or assault with a deadly weapon. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 798 [201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678 P.2d 886] [felony child abuse of the assaultive category]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 431, 440 [82 Cal.Rptr. 494, 462 P.2d 22] [burglary with intent to commit the felony of assault with a deadly weapon]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Landry </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1428, 1437-1439 [261 Cal.Rptr. 254] [assault with a deadly weapon].)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Our court, however, has not extended the <em>Ireland </em>doctrine beyond the context of assault, even under circumstances in which the underlying felony plausibly could be characterized as \u201can integral part of\u2019 and \u201cincluded in fact within\u201d the resulting homicide. The decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison, supra, 4 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Cal.3d 177, provides an apt example. In that case, the defendant and the victim both were inmates of a correctional institution. The defendant worked as a technician in the medical laboratory. He previously had offered to sell alcohol to inmates, leading the victim, an alcoholic, to seek alcohol from him. The defendant supplied the victim with methyl alcohol, resulting in the victim\u2019s death by methyl alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">At trial, the court instructed on felony murder based upon the felony of mixing poison with a beverage, an offense proscribed by the then current version of section 347 (\u201c \u2018Every person who wilfully mingles any poison with any food, drink or medicine, with intent that the same shall be taken by any human being to his injury, is guilty of a felony.\u2019 \u201d) (4 Cal.3d at p. 184.) The defendant was convicted of second degree murder. On appeal, contending that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury on felony murder, the defendant maintained that, on the facts of his case, the underlying felony (\u00a7 347) was \u201can integral part of\u2019 and \u201cincluded in fact within\u201d the resulting murder, precluding application of the felony-murder rule. (4 Cal.3d at p. 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In <em>Mattison, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 177, in rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention and affirming his second degree murder conviction, we found that the predicate felony (\u00a7 347) presented an \u201centirely different situation from the one that confronted us in <em>Ireland,\u201d </em>where the underlying felony was assault with a deadly weapon. (4 Cal.3d at p. 185.) We concluded that the merger rule was inapplicable because, in furnishing the methyl alcohol to the victim, the defendant exhibited a <em>collateral and independent felonious design </em>that was separate from the resulting homicide. Adopting the rule and reasoning articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 57 [89 Cal.Rptr. 697], we held that where the underlying felony is committed with a design collateral to, or independent of, an intent to cause injury that would result in death, \u201c[g]iving a felony-murder instruction in such a situation serves rather than subverts the purpose of the rule.\u201d (4 Cal.3d at p. 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d 57, upon which <em>Mattison </em>explicitly relied, provides additional guidance concerning the rationale of our decision in <em>Mattison. </em>In <em>Taylor, </em>the victim died as a result of an overdose of heroin, which had been furnished to her by the defendant. The defendant was convicted of second degree murder, and the question presented was whether application of the felony-murder rule constituted error under <em>Ireland. </em>The Court of Appeal in <em>Taylor </em>first acknowledged the confusion that arose from the circumstance that, although <em>Ireland </em>involved an assault with a deadly weapon (a felony to which the merger rule traditionally has been applied), the broad language of <em>Ireland </em>could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>interpreted as extending that rule to all felonies that constitute \u201can integral part of the homicide,\u201d potentially encompassing all felonies closely related to a homicide (and therefore possibly every felony inherently dangerous to human life). <em>(Id., </em>at p. 60.) To clarify the ambiguity created by <em>Ireland, </em>the Court of Appeal in <em>Taylor </em>sought to pinpoint the precise rationale of the rule in <em>Ireland, </em>in the process reviewing the New York decisions, cited by the court in <em>Ireland, </em>that had applied the merger doctrine. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">After analyzing New York decisional law, and concluding that <em>Ireland\u2019s </em>\u201cintegral part of the homicide\u201d language did not constitute the crucial test in determining the existence of merger, the court in <em>Taylor </em>held that a felony does not merge with a homicide where the act causing death was committed with a collateral and independent felonious design separate from the intent to inflict the injury that caused death. (11 Cal.App.3d at pp. 61, 63.) The court explained its reasoning as follows: when the Legislature has prescribed that an assault resulting in death constitutes second degree murder <em>if the felon acts with malice, </em>it would subvert the legislative intent for a court to apply the felony-murder rule automatically to elevate <em>all </em>felonious assaults resulting in death to second degree murder <em>even where the felon does not act with malice. </em>In other words, if the felony-murder rule were applied to felonious assaults, all such assaults ending in death would constitute murder, effectively eliminating the requirement of malice\u2014a result clearly contrary to legislative intent. The court in <em>Taylor </em>further explained, however, that when the underlying or predicate felony is not assault, but rather is a felony such as the furnishing of heroin involved in <em>Taylor, </em>application of the felony-murder rule would <em>not </em>subvert the legislative intent, because \u201cthis is simply not a situation where the Legislature has demanded a showing of actual malice, as distinguished from malice implied in law by way of the felony-murder rule.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 63, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We agree with <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of the scope of the <em>Ireland </em>rule and its rejection of the premise that <em>Ireland\u2019s </em>\u201cintegral part of the homicide\u201d language constitutes the crucial test in determining the existence of merger. Such a test would be inconsistent with the underlying rule that only felonies \u201cinherently dangerous to human life\u201d are sufficiently indicative of a defendant\u2019s culpable mens rea to warrant application of the felony-murder rule. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 28, 43.) The more dangerous the felony, the more likely it is that a death may result directly from the commission of the felony, but resort to the \u201cintegral part of the homicide\u201d language would preclude application of the felony-murder rule for those felonies that are most likely to result in death and that are, consequently, the felonies as to which the felony-murder doctrine is most likely to act as a deterrent (because the perpetrator could foresee the great likelihood that death may result, negligently or accidentally).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>We decline, however, to adopt as the critical test determinative of merger in all cases the following language that appears in <em>Taylor, </em>quoting a decision of a New York court: that the rationale for the merger doctrine does not encompass a felony \u201c \u2018committed with a collateral and independent felonious design.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at p. 63; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 375, 387 [99 Cal.Rptr. 1, 491 P.2d 793].) Under such a test, a felon who acts with a purpose other than specifically to inflict injury upon someone\u2014for example, with the intent to sell narcotics for financial gain, or to discharge a firearm at a building solely to intimidate the occupants\u2014is subject to greater criminal liability for an act resulting in death than a person who actually intends to injure the person of the victim. Rather than rely upon a somewhat artificial test that may lead to an anomalous result, we focus upon the principles and rationale underlying the foregoing language in <em>Taylor, </em>namely, that with respect to certain inherently dangerous felonies, their use as the predicate felony supporting application of the felony-murder rule will not elevate all felonious assaults to murder or otherwise subvert the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the present case, as in <em>Mattison </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>application of the second degree felony-murder rule would not result in the subversion of legislative intent. Most homicides do not result from violations of section 246, and thus, unlike the situation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, application of the felony-murder doctrine in the present context will not have the effect of \u201cpreclud[ing] the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought ... [in] the great majority of all homicides.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 539.) Similarly, application of the felony-murder doctrine in the case before us would not frustrate the Legislature\u2019s deliberate calibration of punishment for assaultive conduct resulting in death, based upon the presence or absence of malice aforethought. As in <em>Taylor, </em>this is not a situation in which the Legislature has demanded a showing of actual malice (apart from the statutory requirement that the firearm be discharged \u201cmaliciously and willfully\u201d) in order to support a second degree murder conviction. Indeed, as discussed above, application of the felony-murder rule, when a violation of section 246 results in the death of a person, clearly is consistent with the traditionally recognized purpose of the second degree felony-murder doctrine\u2014namely the deterrence of negligent or accidental killings that occur in the course of the commission of dangerous felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals recently applied similar reasoning in upholding a murder conviction that occurred after a jury was instructed on felony murder based upon underlying felonious conduct involving the discharge of a firearm into an occupied dwelling. <em>(Aguirre </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1987) 732 S.W.2d 320, 324-325 [opn. on rehg.].) The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>viewed the defendant\u2019s conduct of \u201cattempting to blow open a door with a shotgun\u201d as an offense that did not \u201cmerge\u201d with the resulting homicide. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In rendering our decision in the present case, we disapprove of the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wesley, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 902, in which the Court of Appeal, in construing <em>Ireland, </em>concluded that the felony proscribed by section 246 merged with a resulting homicide because the felony was in fact \u201can integral part\u201d and a necessary element of the homicide. (10 Cal.App.3d at p. 907.) As is apparent from our earlier discussion in the present opinion, the appellate court\u2019s reliance in <em>Wesley </em>upon this particular language, as providing the crucial test in determining the existence of merger, was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house does not \u201cmerge\u201d with a resulting homicide within the meaning of the <em>Ireland </em>doctrine, and therefore that this offense will support a conviction of second degree felony murder. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on a second degree felony-murder theory based upon the underlying felony of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Court of Appeal struck the four-year term of imprisonment imposed for the firearm-use enhancement (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)) on the ground that use of a firearm is an element of second degree felony murder when such murder is based upon the underlying felony of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7 246). The Court of Appeal reasoned that, although the jury returned a general verdict convicting defendant of second degree murder (without specifying the theory relied upon), the jury \u201c found true all elements] necessary for a conviction of murder based on the felony-murder,\u201d and firearm use was an essential element of the underlying felony of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The People contend the Court of Appeal erred in striking the firearm-use enhancement, because firearm use is not an essential component of the crime of second degree murder considered in the abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">We agree. The Court of Appeal erred in its construction of the limitation upon the application of the firearm-use enhancement, set forth in section 12022.5, subdivision (a), which at the time of sentencing provided in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny person who personally uses a firearm in the commission . . . of a felony shall, upon conviction of that felony ... be punished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>by an additional term of imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or five years, unless use of a firearm <em>is an element of the offense of which he or she was </em>convicted.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The phrase \u201celement of the offense\u201d signifies an essential component of the legal definition of the crime, <em>considered in the abstract. (People </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1151, 1156 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 894]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zamora </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1627, 1636 [282 Cal.Rptr. 100].) In the present case, the crime of which defendant was convicted was second degree murder. That offense, considered in the abstract, does not include use of a firearm as an element. Second degree murder may be committed in a myriad of ways, some that involve use of a firearm, and others, such as stabbing, poisoning, or strangling, that do not involve use of this type of weapon. Under section 12022.5, subdivision (a), the enhancement applies unless \u201cuse of a firearm is an element of the offense,\u201d and not merely the means by which the offense was committed or the factual predicate of a theory upon which the conviction was based. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1156; <em>People </em>v. <em>Quesada </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 533, 540 [169 Cal.Rptr. 881] [\u201cThe crime of manslaughter may be committed in many ways without a firearm; the fact that this particular crime was committed with use of a firearm does not make such use an \u2018essential element\u2019 of the offense.\u201d].) In decreeing that murder committed by use of a firearm should be punished more severely than murder committed without resort to such a weapon, the Legislature has not exempted those convictions in which the murder conviction rests upon the felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">For these reasons, the trial court did not err in imposing an additional four-year term of imprisonment for the firearm-use enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed to the extent that it strikes the firearm-use enhancement, and in all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Lucas, C.

I write separately to express my understanding of the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, as articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323] <em>(Ireland) </em>and succeeding decisions, and as applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I join the majority in rejecting the premise <em>Ireland\u2019s </em>\u201cintegral part of the homicide\u201d language is decisive of the merger issue in this case. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 314.) In my view, however, <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 177 [93 Cal.Rptr. 185, 481 P.2d 193] <em>(Mattison), </em>adopting the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 57 [89 Cal.Rptr. 697] <em>(Taylor), </em>sets forth the operative test. Those cases require us to determine whether the underlying felony was committed with a \u201ccollateral and independent felonious design.\u201d <em>(Mattison, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 185; <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at p. 61.) Unlike the majority, I see no reason not to follow those decisions. I do not share the majority\u2019s concern that application of the <em>Mattison </em>and <em>Taylor </em>rule leads to the anomalous result of punishing one who does not intend to injure more harshly than one who does. One who commits a felony inherently dangerous to human life with the intent to inflict injury is, in all probability, guilty of second degree murder under the implied malice theory. It follows there likely will be no disparity in the respective criminal liability of the two offenders; thus, the anomaly the majority fears is more apparent than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The evidence in this case supports the conclusion defendant entertained a collateral and independent felonious design under <em>Mattison </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>namely to intimidate Behaves by firing shots into his house.

This sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>enhancement must be set aside as without legal predicate because defendant\u2019s second degree murder conviction, on which it depends, must itself be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Murder is defined by statute as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.\u201d (Pen.

(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 807.) It \u201ccan hardly be much of a deterrent to a defendant who has decided\u201d to so act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at p. 63.) By contrast, when a felony is undertaken with a different purpose, the rule is allowed to operate because its objective can be reached. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, 6 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 387-388 [to such effect under the first degree felony-murder rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">At trial, the superior court instructed the jury on the crime of murder. As pertinent here, it stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u201cEvery person who unlawfully kills a human being . . . during the commission or attempted commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life is guilty of the crime of murder ....</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u201cIn order to prove such crime, each of the following elements must be proved: 1. A human being was killed, 2. The killing was unlawful, and 3. The killing . . . occurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life. Shooting at an inhabited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dwelling is a felony inherently dangerous to human life.\u201d (Paragraphing omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u201cThe unlawful killing of a human being, whether intentional, unintentional or accidental, which occurs during the commission or attempted commission of the crime of shooting at an inhabited dwelling is murder of the second degree . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">After six days of deliberations\u2014almost as much time as was devoted to evidence, arguments, and instructions\u2014the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">By instructing the jury on second degree felony murder based on discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, the superior court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The applicability of the second degree felony-murder rule, under the governing law, depends on an affirmative answer to this threshold question: is discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, considered in the abstract, a felony inherently dangerous to human life? The answer, however, is <em>negative. </em>By its very terms, Penal Code section 246 declares that, \u201c[a]s used in this section, \u2018inhabited\u2019 means currently being used for dwelling purposes, <em>whether occupied or not.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Further, as noted above, \u201cinherently dangerous to human life\u201d has been defined to mean carrying \u201c \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 627 (lead opn. of Kennard, J.); accord, <em>id. </em>at p. 640 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 641 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Panelli, J.).) Logic dictates that discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house cannot carry \u201c \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result\u201d when Penal Code section 246 expressly does <em>not </em>require the presence of any occupant. Experience provides confirmation: to judge from reported appellate decisions, the prohibited conduct has resulted in death only in rare instances. Although such conduct has been called \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d <em>(In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 431 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921]), it cannot be said to carry \u201c \u2018a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d Surely, if the dwelling is not occupied at the time of the shooting, the \u201cprobability\u201d of death is not \u201chigh\u201d\u2014it is <em>zero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Moreover, even if discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, considered in the abstract, were in fact a felony inherently dangerous to human life, the applicability of the second degree felony-murder rule would depend on a negative answer to this further question under the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine: On the evidence adduced at trial, was defendant\u2019s discharge of a firearm at the inhabited dwelling house in question an \u201cintegral part\u201d of, and \u201cincluded <em>in fact\u201d </em>within, the resulting homicide? The answer, however, is <em>affirmative. </em>Such was the case in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wesley </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-908 [89 Cal.Rptr. 377], a decision we impliedly approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at page 805. Such is the case here. The record reveals that defendant was engaged in \u201ca single course of conduct with a single purpose,\u201d viz., to commit \u201cthe very assault which resulted in death . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 387.) Whatever his precise motivation, he unquestionably decided to, and actually did, undertake an ultimately fatal assault, in the sense of a willful act \u201clikely to result in . . . physical force\u201d against another. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 218.) The record also reveals that he certainly did not exhibit any \u201cindependent felonious purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 387, italics omitted; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It follows from the foregoing that the superior court erred by instructing on second degree felony murder based on discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The majority are to the contrary. Their analysis, however, proves inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">To the threshold question, \u201cIs discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, considered in the abstract, a felony inherently dangerous to human life?,\u201d the majority answer, \u201cYes.\u201d They are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In large part, the majority rely on the \u201creasoning\u201d and \u201clanguage\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 310) of <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 28. There, we stated in dictum that a \u201cready example\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 43, fii. 22) of a felony \u201cin which danger to human life is inherent\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 43) was discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The \u201clanguage\u201d of the <em>Satchell </em>dictum provides little support. At the time <em>Satchell </em>was decided more than 20 years ago, Penal Code section 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>delineated a felony that came closer to being inherently dangerous to human life than it does today. The provision did not yet declare that \u201c \u2018inhabited\u2019 means currently being used for dwelling purposes, <em>whether occupied or not\" </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 246, as amended by Stats. 1977, ch. 690, \u00a7 1, p. 2220, italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, at the time <em>Satchell </em>was decided, the definition of \u201cinherently dangerous to human life\u201d was less demanding than it is now, being satisfied, in words later used in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at page 833, by nothing more than a \u201csubstantial risk that someone will be killed . . . .\u2019\u2019It had not yet become more stringent, requiring \u201c \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 627 (lead opn. of Kennard, J.); accord, <em>id. </em>at p. 640 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 641 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Panelli, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The \u201creasoning\u201d of the <em>Satchell </em>dictum provides even less support. It is predicated on the view that the purpose of the second degree felony-murder rule is simply to deter persons engaged in felonies from committing those offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Satchell, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 43 [stating that \u201cit is the deterrence of such acts by felons which the rule is designed to accomplish\u201d].) That view is simply erroneous. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 807 [holding that the objective \u201cis not to deter the underlying felony\u201d].) The purpose of the rule is, rather, to deter persons engaged in felonies from killing negligently or accidentally. <em>(Ibid.) </em>That <em>Satchell </em>avoids this error elsewhere in its discussion (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 34 [holding that the objective is \u201cto deter those engaged in felonies from killing negligently or accidentally\u201d]) does not remove the taint from the words in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In addition to relying on the \u201creasoning\u201d and \u201clanguage\u201d of the <em>Satchell </em>dictum, the majority seek to fabricate a ground of their own. They do not meet with success.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The majority first assert: \u201cThe discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house\u2014by definition, a dwelling \u2018currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether occupied or not\u2019 [citation]\u2014is a felony whose commission inherently involves a danger to human life. An inhabited dwelling house is one in which persons reside [citation] and where occupants \u2018are generally <em>in </em>or <em>around </em>the premises.\u2019 [Citation, italics in original.] In firing a gun at such a structure, there always will exist a significant likelihood that an occupant may be present. Although it is true that a defendant may be guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of this felony even if, at the time of the shooting, the residents of the inhabited dwelling happen to be absent [citation], the offense nonetheless is one that, viewed in the abstract\u2014as shooting at a structure that currently is used for dwelling purposes\u2014poses a great risk or \u2018high probability\u2019 of death . . . (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The statement that \u201cthere always will exist a significant likelihood that an occupant may be present\u201d (italics added) is supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">But the implication that \u201cthere will always exist a significant likelihood that an occupant may be killed\u2019 is not. At any given time, all occupants may be absent from the dwelling. School, work, shopping, leisure pursuits, and other activities may demand attendance outside, often for the greater part of the day. Even if an occupant is present, he may be in a part of the dwelling away from the shooting. The resident is necessarily smaller than the residence. Usually, <em>thousands of times so. </em>For example, an average adult man may stand in 1 square foot of floor space and take up 6 cubic feet of a room; by contrast, even a modest house may cover as many as <em>1,500 </em>square feet and, with 8-foot ceilings, fill as much as <em>12,000 </em>cubic feet. But even if an occupant happens to be near the shooting, the dwelling itself provides significant protection. To be sure, the exterior is commonly windowed. In most houses, however, structural soundness requires, and building codes demand, that load-bearing walls of wood or masonry backed by studs and sheetrock predominantly compose the shell. Although such walls may be penetrated by certain types of ammunition with sufficient velocity to injure a person within, they stop or at least slow all the rest. When they do so, they constitute a fortification.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Moreover, even if \u201cthe offense . . . pose[d] a great risk ... of death,\u201d it would not matter. The prohibited conduct might be deemed \u201cinherently dangerous to human life\u201d under the former, less demanding definition, which was satisfied by nothing more than a \u201csubstantial risk that someone will be killed. . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burroughs, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 833.) But it would not qualify under the present, more stringent definition, which requires \u201c \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 627 (lead opn. of Kennard, J.); accord, <em>id. </em>at p. 640 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 641 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Panelli, J.).) The implication that a \u201cgreat risk ... of death\u201d is a \u201c \u2018high probability\u2019 of death\u201d is dead wrong. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 628-629 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Lucas, C.J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The majority then assert: \u201c[Application of the second degree felony-murder rule to a homicide resulting from a violation of [Penal Code] section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>246 directly would serve the fundamental rationale of the felony-murder rule\u2014the deterrence of negligent or accidental killings in the course of the commission of dangerous felonies.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 310.) Are we then to conclude that the rule would lead a person who is minded to discharge a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house\u2014\u201cmaliciously and willfully,\u201d as Penal Code section 246 requires\u2014to blaze away with due caution and circumspection? To ask the question is to provide its answer. As stated above, the rule \u201ccan hardly be much of a deterrent to a defendant who has decided\u201d to undertake an assault <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at p. 63), in the sense of a willful act \u201clikely to result in . . . physical force\u201d against another <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 218). That Penal Code section 246 does not bear the label of \u201cassault\u201d is not dispositive. It embraces its substance. Because it does, it appears in the Penal Code in the chapter entitled \u201cAssault and Battery.\u201d (Pen. Code, pt. 1, tit. 8, ch. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Next, to the question under the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, \u201cOn the evidence adduced at trial, was defendant\u2019s discharge of a firearm at the inhabited dwelling house in question an \u2018integral part\u2019 of, and \u2018included <em>in fact\u2019 </em>within, the resulting homicide?,\u201d the majority answer, \u201cNo.\u201d Again, they are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In part, the majority would avoid the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine by limiting it to \u201ccircumstances where the only underlying . . . felony committed by the defendant was assault.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 311, italics in original.) Even if this limitation is sound\u2014and apparently it is not (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sears </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 180, 185-189 [84 Cal.Rptr. 711, 465 P.2d 847]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 439-442)\u2014it would not yield the result desired. That is because the only underlying felony committed by defendant here was in fact <em>assault, </em>in the sense of a willful act \u201clikely to result in . . . physical force\u201d against another. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Additionally, the majority would avoid the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine by applying it purportedly in accordance with <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 177, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d 57. They recognize that <em>Mattison </em>and <em>Taylor </em>each held the doctrine unavailable because the evidence adduced at trial therein revealed an \u201cindependent felonious purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 387, italics omitted; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 805; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at p. 63 [speaking of \u201c \u2018collateral and independent felonious design\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 185 [quoting <em>Taylor].) </em>But they seem not to recognize that, as explained, the evidence adduced at trial <em>in this case </em>reveals no such \u201cindependent felonious purpose,\u201d but only an intent to commit an assault, in the sense indicated above. On second glance, perhaps they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>recognize the fact. Why else do they shrink back from fully embracing <em>Mattison </em>and <em>Taylorl</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Further, the majority attempt to avoid the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine by invoking <em>Aguirre </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1987) 732 S.W.2d 320 (in bank). <em>Aguirre </em>is distinguishable. In that case, the felony underlying the resulting homicide was \u201ccriminal mischief,\u201d a \u201cproperty offense,\u201d which comprised an \u201cattempt] to blow open a door with a shotgun\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 325); it was undertaken with the \u201cindependent felonious purpose\u201d\u2014in our phrase\u2014to effect an unlawful entrance into a residence. In this case, by contrast, the felony underlying the resulting homicide was discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, a crime against the person (Pen. Code, pt. 1, tit. 8); it was undertaken simply to effect the ultimately fatal assault, in the sense indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Unable to avoid the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, the majority come close to rendering it void. They reason that the doctrine is not available in this case because \u201c[m]ost homicides do not result\u201d from discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 315.) It follows that the doctrine would not be available <em>in any case </em>because most homicides do not result from any one felony. Such an outcome is untenable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The superior court\u2019s error in instructing the jury on second degree felony murder based on discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">When a legally erroneous theory of conviction is presented to the jury, reversal is required unless, on the record made at trial, the reviewing court can determine that the conviction actually, if not solely, rests on a legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>proper theory. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1128-1129 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 365 P.2d 45]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 808 [concluding that reversal of a second degree murder conviction is required unless the People can \u201cshow that no juror relied on the erroneous instruction\u201d on second degree felony murder \u201cas the sole basis for finding [the] defendant guilty\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In this case, a legally erroneous theory of conviction of murder in the second degree was indeed presented to the jury. That theory was second degree felony murder. It was legally erroneous because, as explained above, the rule was not applicable here under the governing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Further, on the record made at trial, we cannot determine whether defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree actually, if not solely, rests on a legally proper theory. Rather, the only determination that we can and indeed must make in this regard is that the conviction rests on the legally <em>erroneous </em>theory of second degree felony murder. The fact is established by the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on second degree murder and discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house\u2014which, under the evidence adduced and the instructions given, necessarily add up to second degree felony murder. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Berryman </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1048, 1086 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 867, 864 P.2d 40] [arriving at a similar conclusion on a similar record].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree must therefore be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">For the reasons stated above, I would: (1) affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of discharging a firearm at an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>inhabited dwelling house; (2) reverse its judgment affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree; and (3) affirm its judgment setting aside the firearm-use sentence enhancement, which is dependent on the latter conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em> People </em>v. <em>Landry </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1428, 1434-1437 [261 Cal.Rptr. 254], is to the contrary.

It might be argued that, whereas the statutory crime of second degree murder includes malice aforethought as an element (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd.

In California, however, \u201cthere are no common law crimes.\u201d <em>(In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612, 624 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017]; see Pen.

A jury convicted defendant of second degree murder after the trial court gave an instruction defining second degree felony murder and instructed the jury that discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of Penal Code section 246 was an \u201cinherently dangerous felony\u201d that could serve as the predicate felony for second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The majority concludes, and I agree, that the offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling is indeed an inherently dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule, because under the standard articulated in my lead opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 615, 627 [262 Cal.Rptr. 195, 778 P.2d 549], it is \u201can offense carrying \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d This court has never held that for a felony to pose a <em>high probability of death, </em>death must result from the commission of the felony in a majority, or even in a great percentage, of instances. Nor is it necessary in this case to define the outer limits of that term. The drive-by shootings that now plague our cities frequently result in the death of someone inside a residence. Even with no one present in the targeted house, the act of shooting at an inhabited house or apartment creates a substantial or serious risk of death to occupants of neighboring houses or to passersby. For these reasons, I agree with the majority that this offense is an inherently dangerous felony for purposes of the second degree felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">I disagree with the majority, however, when it concludes that the felony of discharging a weapon at an inhabited dwelling is one that does not \u201cmerge\u201d with the resulting homicide within the meaning of our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323]. Under <em>Ireland, </em>which has been the law of this state for more than 25 years, a conviction for second degree felony murder cannot rest on a felony assault \u201cthat is an integral part of the homicide\u201d and that, based on the prosecution\u2019s evidence, is \u201cincluded <em>in fact\u201d </em>within the resulting homicide. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 539, original italics.) Later decisions have added that a defendant\u2019s commission of a felony will support a felony murder conviction only if the defendant entertained some \u201cindependent felonious purpose\u201d beyond mere assault. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 375, 387 [99 Cal.Rptr. 1, 491 P.2d 793]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 57, 63 [89 Cal.Rptr. 697], cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>with approval in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 177, 185 [93 Cal.Rptr. 185, 481 P.2d 193].) Here, the prosecution\u2019s evidence did not show that defendant had any independent felonious purpose for discharging the firearm at the Echaves residence. That conduct satisfies this court\u2019s definition of an assault. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 218 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704].) As Justice Mosk observes, it was \u201ca willful act \u2018likely to result in . . . physical force\u2019 against another.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 326].) As such, in this case the underlying felony of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house \u201cmerges\u201d with the resulting homicide and cannot support the second degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Although from the facts of this case a jury could find that the defendant harbored malice and accordingly could base a second degree murder conviction on an implied malice theory (rather than a felony-murder theory), I agree with Justice Mosk that defendant\u2019s second degree felony-murder conviction must be reversed because the record does not reveal whether the jury ever made the findings necessary to support a second degree murder conviction premised on implied malice. I would remand this case to give the prosecution the opportunity to retry the murder charge on a theory of implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 23, 1995. Mosk, J., and Kennard, J. were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
