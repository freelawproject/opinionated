Sassounian seeking to vacate a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The judgment under challenge was rendered after jury trial in a capital prosecution that received widespread publicity, within California and without. The subject of the proceeding was the killing of Kemal Arikan, the Consul General of the Republic of Turkey at Los Angeles and a Turkish national, which took place in the Westwood area of that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">At the guilt phase, there was no substantial dispute that Arikan was the victim of assassination. It was his custom to leave his residence about 9:30 a.m. in a white Ford LTD with consular corps license plates, passing along nearby Comstock Street to its intersection with Wilshire Boulevard, and then on to his office at the Turkish consulate. On Thursday, January 28, 1982, he followed his custom. Around the time he left his residence, two men took up positions at the Wilshire-Comstock intersection, one on the southwest comer and the other on the southeast; they stood very close to the thoroughfare, staring eye to eye across Comstock Street, which had a traffic signal that remained red unless activated by a vehicle detector or a pedestrian cross-button. Not long thereafter, Arikan approached the intersection in his automobile. Straightway, the two men descended on him and his vehicle; the man formerly on the intersection\u2019s southwest comer moved toward the driver side, with a 9-millimeter pistol in one of his hands; the man formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>on the intersection\u2019s southeast comer moved toward the passenger side, with a .45-caliber pistol apparently in his left hand; they made no attempt whatsoever to seize Arikan or to take any of his possessions; rather, they opened fire at close range and proceeded to empty their magazines, striking Arikan several times in the head and chest; they immediately ran from the scene, tossed away their weapons, and fled in a gray Chevrolet Nova bearing California license plate No. 534 TER. Within minutes, Arikan died of his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Although there was no substantial dispute that Arikan was the victim of assassination, there <em>was </em>substantial dispute whether petitioner was one of his assassins.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The prosecution called various witnesses who told a tale to the following effect. Petitioner is of Armenian heritage. On the date of the Arikan assassination, he was 19 years of age and had lived in the United States about 5 years, having emigrated with his family from Beirut as a result of the Lebanese civil war. Apparently, he was not personally acquainted with Arikan. According to one of his brothers, as recounted by a police officer, he \u201chad bad feelings towards the Turkish people for the things that they had done [to Armenians] in the past,\u201d and he held the view that \u201cTurks are animals.\" He was identified by eyewitnesses as standing on the southeast comer of the Wilshire-Comstock intersection before the assassination and as fleeing from the scene afterward. One of his friends, Krikor Saliba, who was also of Armenian heritage, was identified by eyewitnesses as standing on the southwest comer of the intersection before the assassination and as fleeing from the scene afterward. Petitioner was the registered owner of the gray Chevrolet Nova bearing California license plate No. 534 TER, which was used for flight, and did not allow anyone else to drive the vehicle. On his arrest within hours of the assassination, he bore on his left hand material that was later found to be consistent with gunshot residue. Saliba was not apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The prosecution also called Jeffrey Scott Busch. Busch testified that petitioner had assertedly made a full confession to him one day, of a sudden, while they were both inmates in the Los Angeles County jail, apparently as Busch was peddling cigarettes\u2014Busch working as a trusty with relative freedom of movement around the jail, petitioner waiting to be transported to court, the 2 conversing between 10 and 20 minutes, for the first and only time, through what Busch said was the open-barred door of the cell in which petitioner was being held on the so-called \u201ccourt line.\u201d At its core, the \u201cconfession\" related that petitioner participated in the Arikan assassination together with, according to Busch, <em>two </em>partners; it also related that petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>acted with an anti-Turkish motive. Busch\u2019s testimony was directly corroborated, in part, as to the fact of the \u201cconfession\u201d by another inmate, who said he heard petitioner mention \u201cmurder\u201d to Busch. It was circumstantially corroborated, in part, as to the substance of the \u201cconfession\u201d by one of the eyewitnesses at the Wilshire-Comstock intersection, who said the man on the southwest comer kept looking toward a hotel along Arikan\u2019s customary route\u2014which in the prosecution\u2019s view suggested the participation of a third person, in addition to petitioner and Saliba, as a spotter on the hotel\u2019s roof. Busch generally denied that he had \u201cprepared\u201d his testimony with the help of others, including the authorities and fellow inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Without taking the stand himself, petitioner put forth a defense of alibi and mistaken identity. In addition, he attacked Busch\u2019s testimony as fabricated. To that end, he subjected Busch to extensive impeachment and also exploited the similarly extensive impeachment to which the prosecution had already subjected Busch in anticipation. He made the following points, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As to the fact of the \u201cconfession,\u201d Busch was apparently dubious on the circumstances. There was at least some question whether he was in fact a trusty; whether he could have been walking on the \u201ccourt line,\u201d selling cigarettes, and talking to other inmates, all in violation of regulations, under the very eyes of the jailers; whether he would have been allowed to engage petitioner in conversation, extended or otherwise, inasmuch as petitioner was in \u201ckeep-away\u201d custody in a high-profile murder case; whether he would have been given a confession by petitioner, who had never met him previously and was surrounded by jailers; and whether he could have taken a confession from petitioner, who was apparently in a cell with a door that was solid and closed, and not open-barred as he had stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As to the substance of the \u201cconfession,\u201d Busch was wrong on several matters. He incorrectly identified the location of the Arikan assassination as the Avenue of the Stars in Century City\u2014which happened to be near the former Turkish consulate, the address of which might have been obtained from an out-of-date telephone directory. He incorrectly identified the weapons used by the assassins as 9-millimeter pistols; as noted, they included a .45-caliber pistol, which petitioner himself wielded. He incorrectly identified the two partners he said acted with petitioner as bearing Armenian surnames similar to \u201cTejer\u00edan\u201d and \u201cYeghoian\u201d; these surnames belonged to certain persons, unconnected to the assassination, who happened to be former acquaintances of a fellow jailhouse informant\u2014a man who disclosed at trial that he had schemed to fabricate testimony against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In addition, Busch admitted that he had been convicted more than once of the felony of burglaiy; that he was then in prison; that he had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>acted as a jailhouse informant; that he had obtained information relating to the Arikan assassination from another inmate; that he did not immediately reveal petitioner\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d to the authorities and, when he did do so, did not reveal all its details; that he had been unable to identify petitioner in a photographic show-up; and that he had solicited\u2014but claimed he had not received and did not expect\u2014benefits and/or promises of benefits from the authorities (in the form of protection, change of identity, relocation, money, favorable disposition of criminal matters, etc.) in exchange for his testimony against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Finally, Busch was confronted from the witness stand by other past and present inmates, who stated that his testimony was false and described how he engineered its fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The jury returned a verdict finding petitioner guilty of the first degree murder of Arikan. At the same time, it found true a national-origin special-circumstance allegation\u2014specifically, that petitioner intentionally killed Arikan because he was Turkish\u2014which enhanced punishment to either death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">At the penalty phase, the prosecution presented no evidence in aggravation, resting on what had been introduced at the guilt phase. For his part, again without taking the stand himself, petitioner presented evidence in mitigation, comprising testimony by his mother, an aunt, and a psychiatrist concerning his troubled background and his good character.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The jury returned a verdict fixing the punishment for petitioner at life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In a reported decision, the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Seven affirmed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sassounian </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 361 [226 Cal.Rptr. 880].) On guilt, the <em>Sassounian </em>court was unanimous. But on punishment, specifically, the national-origin special-circumstance finding and the dependent sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, it was not. Apparently as a result of overhearing certain comments at a bench conference, some jurors received information they understood to concern a telephone call to the Turkish consulate threatening, or claiming responsibility for, the Arikan assassination. In this, two justices found juror misconduct but no prejudice. One justice found both, and would have reversed as to punishment. The court, however, was at one in rejecting a claim of insufficiency of the evidence against the national-origin special-circumstance finding\u2014a point that was based on an assertion that Busch\u2019s testimony was \u201cinherently incredible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 408; see <em>id. </em>at p. 423 (conc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>&amp; dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) It did not itself purport to credit Busch\u2019s testimony, but merely could not conclude that it was \u201ceither physically impossible or demonstrably false without resort to inferences or deductions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 409; see <em>id. </em>at p. 423 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) We denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Subsequently, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, asking it to vacate its earlier judgment, based, in part, on a declaration by Busch recanting his testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court ordered the Director of Corrections to show cause why petitioner should not be granted the relief he sought. The Director of Corrections filed a return, based, in part, on a declaration by Busch recanting his recantation. Petitioner next filed a traverse. The Director of Corrections then filed a \u201cresponse.\u201d The court proceeded to deny the petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Thereupon, petitioner filed in this court the petition for writ of habeas corpus out of which the present proceeding has arisen. This petition is substantially the same as that earlier filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. After consideration, we ordered the Director of Corrections to show cause before the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, why petitioner should not be granted the relief he sought <em>as to punishment </em>only\u2014specifically, the national-origin special-circumstance finding and the dependent sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole\u2014on one or both of the following claims: (1) contrary to Penal Code section 1473, false evidence that was substantially material or probative on that issue had been introduced against him at trial, viz., Busch\u2019s testimony; and (2) in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the prosecution had not disclosed evidence that was favorable to him and material on that issue, viz., evidence impeaching Busch, including benefits and/or promises of benefits from the authorities in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the proceeding was assigned to Division Seven. The Director of Corrections filed a return. Petitioner then filed a traverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ordered the matter submitted. It subsequently vacated the submission. Thereupon, it appointed a referee to conduct an evidentiary hearing in order to find whether Busch\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>was credible in light of his later recantation and his still-later recantation of his recantation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the evidentiary hearing, the referee found in the affirmative; but he also made various other \u201cdeterminations\u201d that were inflammatory or immaterial or both. In an unreported decision, the court proceeded to deny the petition on the merits. Two justices concluded that petitioner had failed to carry his burden of proof on either the false evidence or the prosecutorial nondisclosure claim, determining, inter alia, that the referee\u2019s finding on the credibility of Busch\u2019s testimony was supported by substantial evidence. One justice dissented\u2014the same who had concurred and dissented on petitioner\u2019s appeal\u2014stating that he had \u201cserious reservations about whether the referee . . . adequately performed the mission he was assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We granted review, and now affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The substantive law that governs this proceeding may be briefly stated, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a prisoner may seek relief in habeas corpus on the ground that the prosecution did not disclose evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The prosecution has a duty under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause to disclose evidence to a criminal defendant. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 667, 674-678 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 488-492, 105 S.Ct. 3375] [hereafter sometimes <em>Bagley].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">But such evidence must be both favorable to the defendant and material on either guilt or punishment. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 674 [87 L.Ed.2d at pp. 488-489].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Evidence is \u201cfavorable\u201d if it either helps the defendant or hurts the prosecution, as by impeaching one of its witnesses. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 676 [87 L.Ed.2d at p. 490].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had [it] been disclosed to the defense, the result. . . would have been different.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 682 [87 L.Ed.2d at p. 494] (lead opn. by Blackmun, J.), relying on <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 694 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 697-698 104 S.Ct. 2052] [dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment]; accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. 667, 685 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 496] (cone. opn. of White, J.).) The requisite \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to \u201cundermine[] confidence in the outcome\u201d on the part of the reviewing court. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 491-492]; accord, <em>id. </em>at p. 682 [87 L.Ed.2d at p. 494] (lead opn. by Blackmun, J.), relying on <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, 466 </em>U.S. at p. 694 [80 L.Ed.2d at pp. 697-698] [dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment]; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. 667, 685 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 496] (cone. opn. of White, J.).) It is a probability assessed by considering the evidence in question under the totality of the relevant circumstances and not in isolation or in the abstract. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 685 [87 L.Ed.2d at p. 496] (cone. opn. of White, J.).) Further, it is a probability that is, as it were, \u201cobjective,\u201d based on an \u201cassumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision,\u201d and not dependent on the \u201cidiosyncracies of the particular decisionmaker,\u201d including the \u201cpossibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, \u2018nullification,\u2019 and the like.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, 466 </em>U.S. at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>695 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 698] [dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Thus, to merit relief on this basis, the prisoner must show both the favorableness and the materiality of any evidence not disclosed by the prosecution, as defined above. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at pp. 674-678 [87 L.Ed.2d at pp. 488-492],)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In addition, under Penal Code section 1473, a prisoner may seek relief in habeas corpus on, among other grounds, that \u201c[fjalse evidence that is substantially material or probative on the issue of guilt or punishment was introduced against [him] at any hearing or trial relating to his incarceration . . . (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">False evidence is \u201csubstantially material or probative\u201d if it is \u201cof such significance that it may have affected the outcome,\u201d in the sense that <em>\u201cwith reasonable probability </em>it <em>could have </em>affected the outcome . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Wright </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 788, 814 [144 Cal.Rptr. 535], italics added (per Kaufman, J.).) In other words, false evidence passes the indicated threshold if there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, had it not been introduced, the result would have been different. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The requisite \u201creasonable probability,\u201d we believe, is such as undermines the reviewing court\u2019s confidence in the outcome. (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 678 [87 L.Ed.2d at pp. 490-491] [dealing with prosecutorial nondisclosure of evidence in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause].) It is dependent on the totality of the relevant circumstances. <em>(In re Wright, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at p. 817.) It is also, we believe, determined objectively. (Cf. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 695 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 698] [dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Thus, to merit relief on this basis, the prisoner must show that any false evidence introduced against him was substantially material or probative, as defined above. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (b)(1); see also <em>In re Wright, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at pp. 807-821 [construing and applying Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (b)(1)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Like the substantive law, the procedural law that is applicable here may be concisely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In a proceeding in habeas corpus, the petitioner bears the \u201cburden ... of alleging ... the facts on which he relies in support of his claim [or claims] for relief . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Lawler </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 190, 195 [151 Cal.Rptr. 833, 588 P.2d 1257].) He also \u201cbears the burden of proving [those] facts . . . by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Cal.3d 171, 243 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839] (conc. opn. of Grodin, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In issuing an order to show cause in such a proceeding, a court makes \u201can implicit preliminary determination\u201d as to claims <em>within the order </em>that the petitioner has carried his burden of allegation, that is, that he \u201chas made a sufficient prima facie statement of specific facts which, if established, entitle him to . . . relief . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 875, fn. 4 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1].) That determination, it must be emphasized, is truly \u201cpreliminary\": it is only initial and tentative, and not final and binding. In issuing the order to show cause, the court also makes \u201can implicit determination\" as to claims <em>outside the order </em>that the petitioner has failed to carry his burden of allegation, that is, that he has \u201cfailed to make a prima facie case . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 119, fn. 37 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127].) That determination is not preliminary. It may, of course, be changed. But unless changed, it stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">On review, our question is, was the Court of Appeal correct in denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus? For the reasons that follow, our answer is, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In issuing our order to show cause, we had preliminarily determined that petitioner had carried his burden of allegation as to two claims and two claims alone. The first was the introduction at trial of false evidence that was substantially material or probative <em>on </em>punishment\u2014specifically, the national-origin special-circumstance finding and the dependent sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole\u2014viz., Busch\u2019s testimony. The second was the nondisclosure by the prosecution of evidence that was favorable to him and material <em>on that issue, </em>viz., evidence impeaching Busch, including benefits and/or promises of benefits from the authorities in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">In part we adhere to this preliminary determination, but in part we do not. We are now of the opinion that petitioner has failed to carry his burden of allegation as to <em>any </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Specifically, we believe that petitioner has failed to carry his burden of alleging that the introduction at trial of false evidence that was substantially material or probative on the national-origin special-circumstance finding. He stumbles on <em>substantial materiality or probativeness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Considered in itself, Busch\u2019s testimony is hard to assign a weight. To be sure, it related petitioner\u2019s \u201cconfession,\u201d which provided the only direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>evidence that he intentionally killed Arikan because he was Turkish. Without question, a confession can \u201coperate[] as a kind of evidentiary bombshell which shatters the defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 716, 731 [44 Cal.Rptr. 193, 401 P.2d 665], overruled on another ground, <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 509-510, fn. 17 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037]; accord, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 296 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 322, 111 S.Ct. 1246] (opn. of White, J., for the court); <em>id. </em>at p. 313 [113 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-334] (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) It is undoubtedly in recognition of this fact that Busch was characterized as a \u201cvery strong\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d witness by the trial court. Nevertheless, whatever effect his testimony might have had depends on whether the jury found it believable. Whether it did is open to question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Certainly, Busch was extensively impeached. (See, <em>ante, </em>at p. 540.)

It may be explained, most reasonably, by reference to the extensiveness of the evidence and the complexity of the law; to the manifest significance of the determinations that the jury was called on to make; to the sympathy that many, if not all, of the jurors apparently had for petitioner as a young man; to an aiding-and-abetting instruction that was inapplicable on the facts but \u201cmay well have caused some confusion\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sassounian, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d at p. 403); and to the difficulty one juror evidently had in understanding the instructions.

He focuses too narrowly on a single item of evidence apparently because it is \u201cdirect.\u201d At the same time, he overlooks the other evidence apparently because it is \u201ccircumstantial.\u201d Specifically, unlike the <em>Sassounian </em>court\u2019s concurring and dissenting justice, we do not find an indication that the evidence supporting the national-origin special-circumstance finding was \u201cextremely close,\u201d in any relevant sense, in the fact that during the penalty phase the juror who evidently had difficulty understanding the instructions asked to change her vote on the finding. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Sassounian, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d at p. 423 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).)
