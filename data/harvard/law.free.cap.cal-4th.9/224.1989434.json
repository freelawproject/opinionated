Because under the Fourth Amendment the lawfulness of a temporary detention depends not on any one circumstance viewed in isolation, but upon the totality of the circumstances known to the detaining officer, we decline to establish a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule that flight without more provides cause to detain. We recognize, however, that flight in response to the appearance of a uniformed officer or a marked patrol car ordinarily is behavior that police may legitimately regard as suspicious, and therefore also can be a key factor in establishing reasonable cause to detain in a particular case. Applying these conclusions to the facts here, we uphold the temporary detention at issue as lawful, and we reverse the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Defendant Carlos Souza, who was charged with possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351), moved to suppress the prosecution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>evidence against him, contending it was the fruit of a warrantless search after an unlawful detention (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">At the hearing on the suppression motion, Watsonville Police Officer Lance Stackhouse testified that at approximately 3 a.m. on July 27,1991, he was in uniform and patrolling a residential area of Watsonville in a marked police car. He described the neighborhood as a \u201ca high crime area\u201d known for burglary and drug activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Near the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and Hammer, in the exact area where he had recently made two arrests, including one for burglary, Officer Stackhouse noticed two people, a man and a woman, standing near a blue Ford automobile parked at the curb. The area was almost completely dark as the streetlights were out of order. The man (later identified as defendant) appeared to be talking to someone in the parked car. Suspecting an auto burglary in progress, the officer stopped his car behind the Ford and activated the patrol car\u2019s spotlight, shining it into the Ford. Immediately, two people in the front seat of the Ford bent down toward the floorboard, and defendant took off running. Officer Stackhouse stopped defendant and conducted a cursory search for weapons. During the \u201cpat-down,\u201d a plastic baggie containing 14.5 grams of cocaine fell out of defendant\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine, concluding that Officer Stackhouse had reasonable cause to detain defendant. Dispositive to the court\u2019s ruling was defendant\u2019s flight from the approaching police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351); he was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation conditioned on serving one hundred eighty days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (m).) The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of conviction, concluding that Officer Stackhouse lacked reasonable cause to suspect defendant of criminal activity, thus rendering his subsequent detention unlawful and the cocaine found in the patdown search inadmissible as evidence in defendant\u2019s criminal trial. The Court of Appeal directed the trial court to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea and to grant defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The Court of Appeal gave no weight to Officer Stackhouse\u2019s description of the neighborhood as \u201ca high crime area\u201d because, in the court\u2019s words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201cStackhouse did not testify that any specific type of criminal activity relevant to this detention regularly occurred in this area.\u201d In contrast to the trial court, the Court of Appeal placed little significance on defendant\u2019s flight. Rather, the Court of Appeal concluded that all of the facts known to the officer, including defendant\u2019s flight, \u201cdid not support an objectively reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the court cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 473 [198 Cal.Rptr. 538, 674 P.2d 240]. There, this court invalidated a detention based on the defendant\u2019s flight from a parking lot when police entered the lot, which was known as a site for drug transactions. The <em>Aldridge </em>court stated that a detention involving flight was valid only when flight was an additional factor to confirm other evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review, to consider the continuing validity of <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 473, and to decide whether a person\u2019s flight upon encountering a police officer is in itself sufficient to justify an investigative detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits seizures of persons, including brief investigative stops, when they are \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 19 &amp; fn. 16 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 904-905, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 675, 682 [84 L.Ed.2d 605, 613, 105 S.Ct. 1568].) Our state Constitution has a similar provision. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13.) A seizure occurs whenever a police officer \u201cby means of physical force or show of authority\u201d restrains the liberty of a person to walk away. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, fh. 16 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 904-905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">At issue in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, was the constitutionality of a police procedure commonly known as a \u201cfrisk\u201d or \u201cpat-down\u201d in which police officers conducting an investigation search a suspect for concealed weapons. Describing the procedure as \u201ca serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person,\u201d the United States Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that it was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d if the police officer could \u201cpoint to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u201d would warrant the intrusion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 17, 20-21 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 903-904, 905-906].) Because the \u201cintrusion upon the sanctity of the person\u201d consists not only of the patdown itself but also of the temporary detention during which the patdown occurs, to justify frisking or patting down a person during an on-the-street stop, \u201cthe officer must first have constitutional grounds to insist on an encounter, to make a <em>forcible </em>stop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 32 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 912] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.), original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>When are facts known to a police officer constitutionally sufficient to justify a forcible stop? On a number of occasions since its landmark decision in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, the high court has reiterated that a police officer\u2019s seizure of a person need not in all cases be justified by probable cause to arrest for a crime. <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 491, 498 [75 L.Ed.2d 229, 236-237, 103 S.Ct. 1319].) Probable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officer \u201c \u2018 \u201cwarrant a [person] of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d an offense has been or is being committed [by the person to be arrested].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 200, 208, fn. 9 [60 L.Ed.2d 824, 883, 99 S.Ct. 2248], quoting <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1925) 267 U.S. 132, 162 [69 L.Ed. 543, 555, 45 S.Ct. 280, 39 A.L.R. 790].) By contrast, the temporary detention of a person for the purpose of investigating possible criminal activity may, because it is less intrusive than an arrest, be based on \u201csome objective manifestation\u201d that criminal activity is afoot and that the person to be stopped is engaged in that activity. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1981) 449 U.S. 411, 417 &amp; fn. 2 [66 L.Ed.2d 621, 628, 101 S.Ct. 690]; see also <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957] [in which this court articulated a two-part test: (1) that some activity relating to crime has taken place, is occurring, or is about to occur; and (2) that the person to be detained is involved in that activity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, supra, </em>449 U.S. 411, the high court stressed the importance of taking into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d in determining the propriety of an investigative stop or temporary detention: \u201cCourts have used a variety of terms to capture the elusive concept of what cause is sufficient to authorize police to stop a person. Terms like \u2018articulable reasons\u2019 and \u2018founded suspicion\u2019 are not self-defining; they fall short of providing clear guidance dispositive of the myriad factual situations that arise. But the essence of all that has been written is that the totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture\u2014must be taken into account. Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 417-418 [66 L.Ed.2d at pp. 628-629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 1, 7 [104 L.Ed.2d 1, 10, 109 S.Ct. 1581], the high court reiterated its view that the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d necessary to justify a brief, investigative detention is a level of suspicion that is \u201cobviously less demanding than that for probable cause\u201d and can be established by \u201cconsiderably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Thereafter, in <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 325, 330 [110 L.Ed.2d 301, 308-309, 110 S.Ct. 2412], the United States Supreme Court characterized \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d as a standard less demanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>than probable cause \u201cnot only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">From these decisions by the United States Supreme Court we distill this principle: A detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that, considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective manifestation that the person detained may be involved in criminal activity. With this standard in mind, we examine our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 473, the defendant, who stood in a group of people gathered in a liquor store\u2019s parking lot, ran when a police car entered the lot at 10:15 p.m. This conduct by the defendant, coupled with the fact that the parking lot was a place where drug activities were common and people were frequently armed, prompted the officers to stop the defendant for questioning. One of the officers had made over 200 arrests in the area and knew that a few hours earlier other officers had made 3 narcotics arrests in the parking lot. Based on this evidence, the trial court ruled that the police had reasonable cause to detain the defendant. This court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The <em>Aldridge </em>court began its analysis with the observation that the police officers had indisputably seized the defendant, and that therefore it was necessary to decide whether the seizure was \u201creasonable\u201d when tested against the requirements of our state Constitution. (35 Cal.3d at pp. 477-478, citing Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13.) In doing so, this court examined three factors that might provide objective justification for the detention: the incident took place at night, in an area where drug transactions were common, and the defendant apparently sought to evade the police. (35 Cal.3d at p. 478.) We concluded that these factors \u201c[wjhether considered separately or together\u201d did not justify the detention. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The first two factors we dismissed summarily, finding nothing unusual or suspicious about a person\u2019s presence in a liquor store parking lot at 10:15 p.m., or in a \u201c \u2018high crime area.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>With respect to the third factor, the defendant\u2019s flight from police, we stated: \u201cFinally, the suggestion that an apparent effort to avoid a police officer may justify a detention has been refuted in numerous decisions of this court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bower </em>[(1979) 24 Cal.3d 638, 647-648 (156 Cal.Rptr. 856, 597 P.2d 115)].) <em>Under different circumstances, such flight might imply a consciousness of guilt, and combined with other objective factors could justify an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>investigative stop. </em>Here, however, [the officer] admittedly intended to follow his routine practice to make an indiscriminate investigative detention of all persons on the lot. The record reveals that defendant had previously been detained and interviewed by [the officer] on [the] lot, and it can safely be assumed that he knew what was in store for him if he were to remain. Defendant had every right to avoid such persistent harassment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 479, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The Attorney General contends that the quoted passage misstates Fourth Amendment law in two respects: (1) the possibility of an innocent explanation for a person\u2019s flight from a police officer does not negate the suspicion inherent in the flight; and (2) flight need not be \u201ccombined with other objective factors\u201d to justify a detention. According to the Attorney General, flight from the police satisfies both requirements of the \u201creasonable cause\u201d test that this court established in <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 893: it suggests criminal activity and the fleeing person\u2019s involvement in that activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Because the Attorney General has framed the issue of flight against the backdrop of our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 473, we first consider whether <em>Aldridge </em>is pertinent authority here. It is not, as we shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In the June 1982 Primary Election, California voters enacted Proposition 8, an initiative containing a Truth-in-Evidence provision (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d)), which, for crimes committed after its enactment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 257-263 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149]), permitted exclusion of relevant but unlawfully obtained evidence only if the exclusion was required by the United States Constitution <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 885-890 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]). Our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 473, although issued 18 months after Proposition 8\u2019s enactment, addressed a detention for criminal conduct predating Proposition 8. Although we mentioned Fourth Amendment precedent in <em>Aldridge, </em>we did so only in laying out the general rules of detention law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 477-478.) But in discussing the legality of the defendant\u2019s detention, <em>Aldridge </em>made no mention of the federal Constitution or of Fourth Amendment precedent. Rather, after its summary of general principles on detentions, citing federal as well as California cases, <em>Aldridge </em>at page 478 phrased the issue this way: \u201cIt thus becomes necessary to test [the police officer\u2019s] actions against the requirements of article I, section 13, of the California Constitution.\u201d Because the <em>Aldridge </em>holding rested solely on California constitutional grounds, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>not pertinent authority for determining the propriety of the temporary detention in this post-Proposition 8 case; the issue, as we just explained, must be resolved under the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In the section that follows, we consider whether the Fourth Amendment permits treating flight from a police officer as a suspicious circumstance even though there may be some innocent explanation for the flight, and whether flight must be combined with other objective factors to warrant a temporary detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The Attorney General asserts that the possibility of an innocent explanation for a person\u2019s flight from a police officer does not mean that the flight is irrelevant in determining reasonable cause to detain. We agree. In <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 893, we accepted this principle when we disapproved dictum in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 423, 427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12], that if \u201cevents are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events is unlawful.\u201d The <em>Irwin </em>dictum, we explained, \u201ccannot be squared with the rule that a reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity will justify a temporary stop or detention.\u201d Rather, when circumstances are \u201c \u2018consistent with criminal activity,\u2019 they permit\u2014even demand\u2014an investigation . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.) A different result is not warranted merely because circumstances known to an officer may also be \u201c \u2018consistent with lawful activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we said: \u201cThe possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of [police] investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Does our conclusion in <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888\u2014that conduct consistent with criminal behavior supports reasonable cause to detain even if the conduct is also consistent with innocent behavior\u2014apply when the conduct in question is a person\u2019s flight from police? In contending that it does not, defendant points to a statement in our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bower </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 638, 648 [156 Cal.Rptr. 856, 597 P.2d 115] suggesting that a person\u2019s flight from police will <em>not </em>support a detention because everyone is at liberty to avoid contact with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">In <em>Bower, </em>police detained a White man when they saw him at approximately 8:30 in the evening walking with several Black people toward the parking lot of a public housing project in a predominantly Black area. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the two officers testified that during the three and one-half years he had patrolled the area he had \u201c \u2018never observed a white person in the projects or around the projects on foot in the hours of darkness ... for innocent purpose.\u2019 \u201d (24 Cal.3d at p. 642.) Suspecting criminal behavior in this instance, the officers approached the group, which quickly dispersed, with the defendant leaving in \u201ca \u2018very quick walk, almost a run\u2019 \u201d in a direction away from the housing project. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 643.) Addressing the possible significance of the defendant\u2019s flight, we first observed that an individual is free to avoid contact with a police officer, and then explained that \u201c[t]o hold that the mere exercise of this liberty justifies a detention would be tantamount to holding that an officer may insist upon an encounter without adequate cause.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 648.) Four years later, the United States Supreme Court came to a similar conclusion in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">At issue in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>was an airport search of two suitcases belonging to a nervous young man who had paid cash for an airline ticket from Miami to New York City under an assumed name and who was approached by two narcotics officers who believed that the man\u2019s characteristics fit a \u201cdrug courier profile.\u201d In the course of the opinion, the high court considered whether approaching the traveler for questioning was a seizure, concluding it was not. (460 U.S. at p. 493, fn. 2 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 233].) As the court explained, \u201claw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen, or by offering in evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 497 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 236].) The court pointed out, however, that a person approached by police for questioning <em>\u201cneed not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. </em>[Citations.] He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; and his refusal to listen or answer does not, <em>without more, </em>furnish those grounds.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 498 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 237], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. 491, 498 [75 L.Ed.2d 229, 236-237], that a person approached by police for questioning may decline to answer the questions and \u201cmay go on his way,\u201d does not imply that the <em>manner </em>in which a person avoids police contact cannot be considered by police officers in the field or by courts assessing reasonable cause for briefly detaining the person. There is an appreciable difference between declining to answer a police officer\u2019s questions during a street encounter and fleeing at the first sight of a uniformed police officer. Because the latter shows not only unwillingness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>partake in questioning but also unwillingness to be observed and possibly identified, it is a much stronger indicator of consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We conclude that even though a person\u2019s flight from approaching police officers may stem from an innocent desire to avoid police contact, flight from police is a proper consideration\u2014and indeed can be a key factor\u2014in determining whether in a particular case the police have sufficient cause to detain.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The Attorney General also contends that flight upon encountering a uniformed police officer or a marked patrol car is alone sufficient to justify a detention, and urges us to adopt a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule. As we pointed out earlier, however, the United States Supreme Court has stressed that, in determining whether a detention meets Fourth Amendment standards, courts must consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, supra, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417 &amp; fn. 2 [66 L.Ed.2d 621, 628].) Therefore, adoption of a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule would run counter to the high court\u2019s express admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In arguing that a person\u2019s flight from approaching police provides, by itself, sufficient cause to detain, the Attorney General points out that the criminal law has long viewed a suspect\u2019s flight from authority as a strong indicator of guilt. In support, he cites <em>Alberty </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1896) 162 U.S. 499, 510 [40 L.Ed. 1051,1056,16 S.Ct. 864], and <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1896) 164 U.S. 492, 499 [41 L.Ed. 528, 530, 17 S.Ct. 154], in which the high court nearly a century ago held that flight tends to prove guilt and therefore is a circumstance that is proper for jury consideration. This view, the Attorney General notes, is reflected in a standard jury instruction that tells California juries in criminal cases that a person\u2019s flight immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of a crime, while standing alone is insufficient to establish guilt, may be considered in determining guilt or innocence. (CALJIC No. 2.52; see also \u00a7 1127c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The Attorney General argues that to permit courts and juries to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant\u2019s flight after the commission of a crime or after being accused of a crime \u201cbut to deny such reliance to law enforcement officers would be curious indeed.\u201d Not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The authorities the Attorney General cites allow an inference of guilt from flight only in those instances in which there is other indication of criminality, such as evidence that the defendant fled from a crime scene or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>being accused of a crime. To put it succinctly, these authorities rely on \u201cflight plus.\u201d Thus, they are of no help in determining whether flight alone indicates criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The Attorney General cites a number of cases from other jurisdictions that, according to the Attorney General, have held that flight alone, without other indicia of criminal activity, will justify an investigative stop by police. A close examination of these cases reveals that most do not so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In five of the seven cases cited, flight from police was only one of several factors that the reviewing court relied on in upholding the temporary detention. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane </em>(6th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 895 [flight by several occupants of an apartment house known for drug trafficking together with anonymous tip of drug dealing justified detention]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stinnett </em>(1988) 104 Nev. 398 [760 P.2d 124] [known drug dealer huddling with three others in an area known for street sales of narcotics fled when he spotted police]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haye </em>(4th Cir. 1987) 825 F.2d 32 [two men arriving on a flight from Miami and exhibiting characteristics of the \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d ran when approached by local police and Drug Enforcement Administration agents who held up their law enforcement badges]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(6th Cir. 1977) 561 F.2d 663 [when Drug Enforcement Administration agent in the Cleveland Airport identified himself to arriving passenger who exhibited drug courier characteristics, the passenger assaulted the agent with his briefcase, then ran into a nearby construction site where he withdrew a white bag from his coat and stuffed it into the sewer]; <em>City of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn </em>(1975) 306 Minn. 337 [237 N.W.2d 365] [officers pursued the defendant\u2019s car after they mistook him for his brother whose license had been suspended; as the defendant fled, the officers thought they saw a .45-caliber automatic pistol in his hand].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As defendant points out, only two of the seven cases that the Attorney General cites have held that flight from police is, by itself, sufficient to provide reasonable cause to detain. (See <em>Platt </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ind. 1992) 589 N.E.2d 222; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 155 Wis.2d 77 [454 N.W.2d 763].) Of those two, one <em>(Platt) </em>simply accepted the reasoning of the other <em>(Anderson). </em>An analysis of these two cases follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>454 N.W.2d 763, police received complaints that the defendant was parking his car in private business stalls behind his residence. Two officers in a squad car recognized the defendant\u2019s car as it pulled into an alley abutting the business stalls. Upon spotting the squad car, the defendant drove off, attaining a speed of 30 miles per hour. The officers stopped him and in the ensuing search of his car found a revolver and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>knives. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 764-765.) The Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld the stop, reasoning that it was justified by the defendant\u2019s evasive behavior alone. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 768.) Expressing the view that \u201c[fjlight at the sight of police is undeniably suspicious behavior,\u201d the Wisconsin court concluded that a reasonable officer \u201ccannot ignore the inference that criminal activity may well be afoot.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 766.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Platt </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>589 N.E.2d 222, the Indiana Supreme Court (with one justice dissenting) upheld the detention of a motorist who sped away when sheriff\u2019s deputies pulled up behind his parked car. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 225.) The Indiana court rested its holding on the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>454 N.W.2d 763. After first observing that \u201c[f]light at the sight of police is undeniably suspicious behavior,\u201d the Indiana Supreme Court concluded that detaining the fleeing person was justified to permit the sheriff\u2019s deputies to resolve the ambiguity created by the defendant\u2019s flight. <em>(Platt </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>589 N.E.2d. at p. 226.) The court added that it \u201c[would] not proscribe such a reasonable response to an inherently suspicious activity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We find neither case persuasive authority for adopting the Attorney General\u2019s suggested \u201cbright-line\u201d rule that a person\u2019s evasion of police by running away or by driving away is, regardless of the surrounding circumstances, sufficient to draw an inference of criminal activity on the part of the fleeing person. To do so would run afoul of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s express admonition that courts take into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture\u201d in assessing whether the particularized and objective facts known to police provided cause to detain. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, supra, </em>449 U.S. at p. 417 [66 L.Ed.2d at p. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u201cThe idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present before a stop is permissible.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, supra, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 [66 L.Ed.2d 621, 629].) The first is that the assessment must be based on all of the circumstances, including objective observations, information from police reports, and \u201cconsideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>From these data, the court said, a trained police officer could draw inferences \u201cthat might well elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cThe second element contained in the idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion is the concept that the process just described must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, supra, </em>449 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>at p. 418 [66 L.Ed.2d at p. 629].) Stated another way, there must be \u201csome objective manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 417 [66 L.Ed.2d at pp. 628-629], fn. omitted.) This two-part assessment, as required by the United States Supreme Court, does not lend itself successfully to creating the \u201cbright-line\u201d rule the Attorney General seeks here.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Indeed, recently the high court itself has eschewed the adoption of \u201cbright-line\u201d rules in detention cases. As the court observed in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 567, 572 [100 L.Ed.2d 565, 571, 108 S.Ct. 1975]: \u201cBoth petitioner and respondent, it seems to us, in their attempts to fashion a bright-line rule applicable to all investigatory pursuits, have failed to heed this Court\u2019s clear direction that any assessment as to whether police conduct amounts to a seizure implicating the Fourth Amendment must take into account \u2018 \u201call of the circumstances surrounding the incident\u201d \u2019 in each individual case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">More recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>490 U.S. 1, the high court granted certiorari in a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that raised \u201cserious implications for the enforcement of the federal narcotics laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 7 [104 L.Ed.2d at p. 10].) By a divided vote, the Ninth Circuit had reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, holding that the agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration who had detained and then searched the defendant in the Honolulu airport lacked a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to justify the stop based on the following facts: The defendant, traveling under a false name, had paid $2,100 in cash from a roll of $20 bills for two round-trip tickets from Honolulu to Miami, a city known to be a source for illicit drugs. There were other suspicious circumstances. The defendant spent only 48 hours in Miami even though the round-trip flight between Honolulu and Miami takes some 20 hours. And he appeared nervous and checked none of his luggage during the trip. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 3, 6 [104 L.Ed.2d at pp. 7-8, 9-10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The United States Supreme Court observed that the Ninth Circuit majority had divided these facts into two categories: \u201cIn the first category, the majority placed facts describing \u2018ongoing criminal activity,\u2019 such as the use of an alias, or evasive movement through an airport; the majority believed that at least one such factor was always needed to support a finding of reasonable suspicion. [Citation.] In the second category, it placed facts describing \u2018personal characteristics\u2019 of drug couriers, such as the cash payment for tickets, a short trip to a major source city for drugs, nervousness, type of attire, and unchecked luggage. [Citation.] The majority believed that such characteristics \u2018shared by drug couriers and the public at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>large,\u2019 were only relevant if there was evidence of ongoing criminal behavior and the Government offered \u2018[ejmpirical documentation\u2019 that the combination of facts at issue did not describe the behavior of \u2018significant numbers of innocent persons.\u2019 [Citation.] Applying this two-part test to the facts of this case, the majority found that there was no evidence of ongoing criminal behavior, and thus that the agents\u2019 stop was impermissible.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 6 [104 L.Ed.2d at p. 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit in <em>Sokolow, </em>stating: \u201cWe think the Court of Appeals\u2019 effort to refine and elaborate the requirements of \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 in this case creates unnecessary difficulty in dealing with one of the relatively simple concepts embodied in the Fourth Amendment. In evaluating the validity of a stop such as this, we must consider \u2018the totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7-8 [104 L.Ed.2d 1, 10].) Describing the appellate court\u2019s approach as inappropriately drawing a \u201csharp line\u201d between indistinguishable types of evidence, the high court stressed that \u201c \u2018there could, of course, be circumstances in which wholly lawful conduct might justify the suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 8, 9 [104 L.Ed.2d at p. 11], quoting <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 438, 441 [65 L.Ed.2d 890, 894-895, 100 S.Ct. 2752].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As these two decisions of the United States Supreme Court illustrate, fashioning a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule applicable to all investigatory stops would violate the high court\u2019s directive that police officers on the street, and the courts that evaluate the officers\u2019 conduct, consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole picture\u201d to determine whether a particular intrusion by police was justified. Any temporary detention includes factors that, considered together, may suggest either criminal or innocent behavior to trained police officers. No single fact\u2014for instance, flight from approaching police\u2014can be indicative in <em>all </em>detention cases of involvement in criminal conduct. Time, locality, lighting conditions, and an area\u2019s reputation for criminal activity all give meaning to a particular act of flight, and may or may not suggest to a trained officer that the fleeing person is involved in criminal activity. Consequently, a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule applicable to all investigatory stops, as the Attorney General asks us to adopt, would be improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">We now consider whether in this case all the facts known to Officer Stackhouse justified his temporary detention of defendant when the latter fled upon encountering the patrol car. In assessing the sufficiency of these facts, we heed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that the evidence relied on by police officers to justify the seizure of a person \u201cmust be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. Cortez, <em>supra, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 [66 L.Ed.2d 621, 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">At approximately 3 a.m., Officer Stackhouse was on patrol in a residential area he described as a \u201chigh crime area.\u201d In almost complete darkness, two people stood near a parked car. One of the two (defendant) leaned toward the car as if talking to someone inside. When Officer Stackhouse directed his patrol car\u2019s spotlight into the car\u2019s interior, two people in the front seat immediately bent down toward the floorboard, and defendant took off running. From these circumstances\u2014the area\u2019s reputation for criminal activity, the presence of two people near a parked car very late at night and in total darkness, and evasive conduct not only by defendant but by the two occupants of the parked car\u2014Officer Stackhouse reasonably suspected that criminal activity was afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">An area\u2019s reputation for criminal activity is an appropriate consideration in assessing whether an investigative detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682-683, fn. 3 [84 L.Ed.2d 605, 613]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nonnette </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 659, 668 [271 Cal.Rptr. 329] [distinguishing federal standards applicable after Proposition 8 from the traditional skepticism of the \u201chigh crime factor\u201d expressed in decisions applying the California Constitution]; see also <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Rickus </em>(3d Cir. 1984) 737 F.2d 360, 365.) As the Court of Appeal aptly observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Holloway </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 150, 155 [221 Cal.Rptr. 394], \u201cit may be fairly said that our entire nation is a high crime area,\u201d particularly with respect to drug-related crimes. Unfortunately, this sad state of affairs has seen little improvement in the intervening decade since <em>Holloway </em>was decided. As <em>Holloway </em>noted, mere presence in a high-crime area is not, standing alone, \u201csufficient to justify interference with an otherwise innocent-appearing citizen. . . . Nevertheless, it would be the height of naivete not to recognize that the frequency and intensity of these sorry conditions are greater in certain quarters than in others. Consequently, we must allow those we hire to maintain our peace as well as to apprehend criminals after the fact, to give appropriate consideration to their surroundings and to draw rational inferences therefrom, unless we are prepared to insist that they cease to exercise their senses and their reasoning abilities the moment they venture forth on patrol.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The time of night is another pertinent factor in assessing the. validity of a detention. Here, the incident occurred at 3 a.m. As the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Holloway, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 150, 155 observed, \u201cThree a.m., ... is both a late and an unusual hour for anyone to be in attendance at an outdoor social gathering . . . .\u201d At that late hour defendant and his companion were standing in almost total darkness on a sidewalk next to a car parked in a residential area. These facts led Officer Stackhouse to suspect that an auto burglary might be progress. That suspicion was reasonable. According to the United States Department of Justice, more than 70 percent of thefts involving motor vehicles take place between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., and the majority of these occur after midnight. (Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics (1991) p. 263.) Frequently, these thefts take place \u201cjust outside victims\u2019 homes.\u201d (Clark &amp; Harris, <em>Auto Theft and Its Prevention, </em>in 16 Crime and Justice, A Review of Research (Tonry, edit. 1992) p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">When in the course of investigating what he thought to be an auto burglary in progress, Officer Stackhouse directed his patrol car\u2019s spotlight toward the parked Ford, the car\u2019s occupants immediately bent down, and defendant fled. These evasive actions added support to the officer\u2019s suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, and that defendant was involved in that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">On similar facts, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts recently upheld a detention. <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses </em>(1990) 408 Mass. 136 [557 N.E.2d 14].) In that case, the defendant was an occupant of a Mercury automobile that, at 5:45 p.m., was idling at a curb near four men, two of whom appeared to be looking into the car. When Boston police officers in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>marked cruiser approached the Mercury, the men on the sidewalk ran into a nearby housing project, and the defendant \u201cducked\u201d under the car\u2019s dashboard. The Massachusetts court found these facts sufficient to justify the officers\u2019 suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct, most likely a drug transaction. <em>(Id., </em>557 N.E.2d at pp. 15, 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In summary, in this case the presence on the sidewalk at 3 a.m. of two people who appeared to be talking to the occupants of a car parked in total darkness in an area that Officer Stackhouse described as a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d coupled with the evasive conduct by the occupants and defendant\u2019s sudden flight when Officer Stackhouse directed his patrol car\u2019s spotlight toward the group, justified a brief, investigative detention to enable the officer to resolve the ambiguity in the situation and to find out whether the activity was in fact legal or illegal. <em>(In re Tony </em>C., <em>supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.) In concluding to the contrary, the Court of Appeal erred. The court accorded no significance whatsoever to defendant\u2019s flight from police, failing to evaluate it against the backdrop of all of the facts known to the officer and failing to apply the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test that the United States Supreme Court has enunciated in assessing the validity of a temporary detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Lucas, C. J. Arabian, J., Baxter, J., George, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> Unless otherwise indicated, further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\"> In making this argument, the Attorney General explains that by the term \u201cflight\u201d he means running in apparent response to the presence of a police officer. The facts of this case satisfy this definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> In Ms brief, the Attorney General refers to a comment that appears in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D. </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 621, 623, footnote 1 [113 L.Ed.2d 690, 695-696, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1549]. In <em>Hodari, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that no seizure implicating the Fourth Amendment occurs when police chase a fleeing suspect who does not yield. In that case, the Attorney General had conceded that the police lacked the necessary reasonable suspicion to justify a seizure, and that therefore if the high court decided that by chasing Hodari the police had seized Mm, there would have to be suppression of the rock of crack cocaine Hodari tossed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>during the chase and the drug dealing paraphernalia found on him. Addressing that concession, the opinion authored by Justice Scalia and joined by six other members of the Court stated at page 623 in footnote 1: \u201cCalifornia conceded below that Officer Pertoso did not have the \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 required to justify stopping Hodari, see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). That it would be unreasonable to stop, for brief inquiry, young men who scatter in panic upon the mere sighting of the police is not self-evident, and arguably contradicts proverbial common sense. See Proverbs 28:1 (\u2018The wicked flee when no man pursueth\u2019). We do not decide that point here, but rely entirely on the State\u2019s concession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We do not view this comment as an abandonment by the United States Supreme Court of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d evaluation for reasonable cause to detain that the court has embraced in previous cases. Rather, the high court\u2019s comment must be read in light of the other facts known to the officers in that case and recognizable to them as a drug sale in progress: four or five youths huddled around a car parked at the curb in an Oakland area known for drug dealing scattered in panic at the approach of police officers, and the car then took off at a high rate of speed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b278-7\">MOSK, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AUo\">I agree with the result and much of the reasoning of the majority. I write separately to express disagreement on one particular point.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The majority wisely decline to adopt a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule that flight alone justifies a temporary detention by the police. Instead, they endorse a totality-of-the-circumstances test, in which flight can be considered among other factors in determining whether the police possessed \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to initiate a temporary detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">But the majority seem to retreat from this fact-specific inquiry into reasonable suspicion when they state categorically: \u201cThere is an appreciable difference between declining to answer a police officer\u2019s questions during a street encounter and fleeing at the first sight of a uniformed police officer. Because the latter shows not only unwillingness to partake in questioning but also unwillingness to be observed and possibly identified, it is a much stronger indicator of consciousness of guilt.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 234-235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>I believe this point is considerably overstated. As the majority concede, an individual may have quite innocent motives for avoiding the police. This avoidance may sometimes take the form of quick, rather than slow, flight\u2014of running rather than walking\u2014particularly when the police are known to pursue those who decline to allow themselves to be voluntarily detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">An example of such potentially innocent flight may be found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aldridge </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 473 [198 Cal.Rptr. 538, 674 P.2d 240] <em>(Aldridge). </em>However one may read <em>Aldridge's </em>reliance on state rather than federal constitutional grounds, our opinion in that case is wholly consistent with the totality-of-the-circumstances approach the majority adopt today. In <em>Aldridge, </em>the officer in question testified to his practice of routinely detaining every person he found in a particular liquor store parking lot, the site of frequent drug transactions. On the night of defendant\u2019s arrest, the officer and his partner saw defendant and some other men first walk, then run, away from them as they approached in a marked patrol car. This flight eventually led to defendant\u2019s detention and to the discovery of a stolen weapon on his person. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In holding the detention to be unlawful, we stressed the contextual nature of the inquiry: \u201cUnder different circumstances, such flight might imply a consciousness of guilt, and combined with other objective factors could justify an investigative stop. Here, however, [the police officer] admittedly intended to follow his routine practice to make an indiscriminate investigative detention of all persons on the lot. The record reveals that defendant had previously been detained and interviewed by [the officer] on Dr. J\u2019s lot, and it can be safely assumed that he knew what was in store for him if he were to remain. Defendant had every right to avoid such persistent harassment.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\"><em>Aldridge </em>illustrates the unfortunate reality that some individuals in our society, often members of minority groups, improperly view the police more as sources of harassment than of protection. These individuals may innocently flee at the first sight of police in order to avoid an encounter that their experience has taught them might be troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Although this case and <em>Aldridge </em>reach opposite results, they do so not because of doctrinal disagreement, but because of factual dissimilarities. There is an important difference between observing a group of men in a liquor store parking lot at 10:15 p.m., as was the case in <em>Aldridge </em>(35 Cal.3d at p. 476), and observing a gathering on a residential street at 3 a.m., as in this case. While the former situation is \u201cneither unusual nor suspicious\u201d <em>(id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>at p. 478), the latter may be both. Significant also is the fact that in this case, unlike <em>Aldridge, </em>no pattern of police harassment has been established.
