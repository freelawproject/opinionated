We granted the petitions for review of Santa Ana and the People to consider whether the ordinance is valid on its face and whether either of the actions involved in the consolidated appeal stated an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">We conclude only a facial challenge was perfected in the lower courts and that the Santa Ana ordinance is valid on its face. It does not impermissibly restrict the right to travel, does not permit punishment for status, and is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, the only constitutional claims pursued by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">We shall, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">In October 1992, Santa Ana added article VIII, section 10-400 et seq. (the ordinance) to its municipal code. The declared purpose of the ordinance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>to maintain public streets and other public areas in the city in a clean and accessible condition. Camping and storage of personal property in those areas, the ordinance recited, interfered with the rights of others to use those areas for the purposes for which they were intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-6\">\u201cSec. 10-402. Unlawful Camping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia in the following areas, except as otherwise provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-8\">\u201c(a) any street;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-9\">\u201c(b) any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-10\">\u201cSec. 10-403. Storage of Personal Property in Public Places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to store personal property, including camp facilities and camp paraphernalia, in the following areas, except as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-12\">\u201c(a) any park;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-13\">\u201c(b) any street;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-14\">\u201c(c) any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-15\">Plaintiffs in these consolidated actions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are: (1) homeless persons and taxpayers who appealed from a superior court order which struck \u201cto live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>temporarily in a camp facility or outdoors\u201d from the ordinance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but otherwise denied their petition for writ of mandate by which they sought to bar enforcement of the ordinance (Tobe),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) persons who, having been charged with violating the ordinance, demurred unsuccessfully to the complaints and thereafter sought mandate to compel the respondent municipal court to sustain their demurrers (Zuckemick).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Plaintiffs offered evidence to demonstrate that the ordinance was the culmination of a four-year effort by Santa Ana to expel homeless persons. There was evidence that in 1988 a policy was developed to show \u201cvagrants\u201d that they were not welcome in the city. To force them out, they were to be continually moved from locations they frequented by a task force from the city\u2019s police and recreation and parks departments; early park closing times were to be posted and strictly enforced; sleeping bags and accessories were to be disposed of; and abandoned shopping carts were to be confiscated. Providers of free food were to be monitored; sprinklers in the Center Park were to be turned on often; and violations of the city code by businesses and social service agencies in that area were to be strictly enforced. This effort led to a lawsuit which the city settled in April 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Santa Ana then launched an August 15, 1990, sweep of the civic center area arresting and holding violators for offenses which included blocking passageways, drinking in public, urinating in public, jaywalking, destroying vegetation, riding bicycles on the sidewalk, glue sniffing, removing trash from a bin, and violating the fire code. Some conduct involved nothing more than dropping a match, leaf, or piece of paper, or jaywalking. The arrestees were handcuffed and taken to an athletic field where they were booked, chained to benches, marked with numbers, and held for up to six hours, after which they were released at a different location. Homeless persons among the arrestees claimed they were the victims of discriminatory enforcement. The municipal court found that they had been singled out for arrest for offenses that rarely, if ever, were the basis for even a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">In October 1990, Santa Ana settled a civil action for injunctive relief, agreeing to refrain from discriminating on the basis of homelessness, from taking action to drive the homeless out of the city, and from conducting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>future sweeps and mass arrests. That case, which was to be dismissed in 1995, was still pending when the camping ordinance was passed in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Evidence in the form of declarations regarding the number of homeless and facilities for them was also offered. In 1993 there were from 10,000 to 12,000 homeless persons in Orange County and 975 permanent beds available to them. When National Guard armories opened in cold weather, there were 125 additional beds in Santa Ana and another 125 in Fullerton. On any given night, however, the number of shelter beds available was more than 2,500 less than the need.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">The Court of Appeal majority, relying in part on this evidence, concluded that the purpose of the ordinance\u2014to displace the homeless\u2014was apparent. On that basis, it held that the ordinance infringed on the right to travel, authorized cruel and unusual punishment by criminalizing status, and was vague and overbroad. The city contends that the ordinance is constitutional on its face. We agree. We also conclude that, if the Tobe petition sought to mount an as applied challenge to the ordinance, it failed to perfect that type of challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Preliminary Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">A. <em>Facial or As Applied Challenge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\"> Plaintiffs argue that they have mounted an as applied challenge to the ordinance as well as a facial challenge. While they may have intended both, we conclude that no as applied challenge to the ordinance was perfected. The procedural posture of the Zuckemick action precludes an as applied challenge, which may not be made on demurrer to a complaint which does not describe the allegedly unlawful conduct or the circumstances in which it occurred. The Tobe plaintiffs did not clearly allege such a challenge or seek relief from specific allegedly impermissible applications of the ordinance. Moreover, assuming that an as applied attack on the ordinance was stated, the plaintiffs did not establish that the ordinance has been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner either to themselves or to others in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">Because the Court of Appeal appears to have based its decision in part on reasoning that would be appropriate to a constitutional challenge based on a claim that, as applied to particular defendants, the Santa Ana ordinance was invalid, we must first consider the nature of the challenge made by these petitioners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>A facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual. <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 860, 865 [94 Cal.Rptr. 777, 484 P.2d 945].) \u201c \u2018To support \u00e1 determination of facial unconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, petitioners cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular <em>application </em>of the statute .... Rather, petitioners must demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Dept, of Education </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 251, 267 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 825 P.2d 438], quoting <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180-181 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">An as applied challenge may seek (1) relief from a specific application of a facially valid statute or ordinance to an individual or class of individuals who are under allegedly impermissible present restraint or disability as a result of the manner or circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied, or (2) an injunction against future application of the statute or ordinance in the allegedly impermissible manner it is shown to have been applied in the past. It contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right. (See, e.g., <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 601, 615-616 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 841-843, 93 S.Ct. 2908]; <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 672 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345]; <em>In re Marriage of Siller </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 36, 49 [231 Cal.Rptr. 757].)  When a criminal defendant claims that a facially valid statute or ordinance has been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner to the defendant, the court evaluates the propriety of the application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether to relieve the defendant of the sanction. <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 404 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">If a plaintiff seeks to enjoin future, allegedly impermissible, types of applications of a facially valid statute or ordinance, the plaintiff must demonstrate that such application is occurring or has occurred in the past. In <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Kendrick </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 589 [101 L.Ed.2d 520, 108 S.Ct. 2562], for instance, the court first distinguished the nature of facial and as applied challenges to a statute which authorized federal grants to organizations for services related to premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy. The plaintiffs had standing as taxpayers to raise an establishment clause challenge to the statute and to its application. The Supreme Court held that the as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>applied challenge could be resolved only by considering how the statute was being administered. Plaintiffs had to show that specific grants were impermissible because the grants went to \u201c \u2018pervasively sectarian\u2019 religious institutions\u201d or had been used to fund \u201c \u2018specifically religious activities].\u2019 \u201d (487 U.S. at p. 621 [101 L.Ed.2d at pp. 548-549].) The matter was remanded because the district court had not identified the particular grantees or the particular aspects of their programs for which constitutionally improper expenditures had been made. Finally, the court held, a remedy should be fashioned to withdraw federal agency approval of such grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">When a criminal defendant seeks relief from a present application of a criminal statute or ordinance on constitutional grounds, it is not the administrative agency\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d of the statute that is determinative, however. Whether the particular application of a statute declaring conduct criminal is constitutionally permissible can be determined only after the circumstances of its application have been established by conviction or otherwise. (See, e.g., <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 286 [124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44].) Only then is an as applied challenge ripe. To obtain mandate or other relief from penalties imposed under a past application of the law, the defendant must presently be suffering some adverse impact of the law which the court has the power to redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">If instead it is contended that an otherwise valid statute has been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner in the past and the plaintiff seeks an injunction against future application of the statute in that manner, the plaintiff must show a pattern of impermissible enforcement. (See, e.g., <em>Van Atta </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 424 [166 Cal.Rptr. 149, 613 P.2d 210]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222]; <em>Wirin </em>v. <em>Horrall </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 497 [193 P.2d 470]; cf. <em>Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1101 [232 Cal.Rptr. 814, 729 P.2d 80].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">In most cases a plaintiff seeking this relief, either by a petition for writ of mandamus or complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, must have a sufficient beneficial interest to have standing to prosecute the action, and there must be a present impermissible application of the challenged statute or ordinance which the court can remedy.  \u201c[Code of Civil Procedure] [s]ection 1086 expresses the controlling statutory requirements for standing for mandate; \u2018The writ must be issued in all cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law. It must be issued upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested.\u2019 The requirement that a petitioner be \u2018beneficially interested\u2019 has been generally interpreted to mean that one may obtain the writ only if the person has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.\u201d <em>(Carsten </em>v. <em>Psychology Examining Com. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 793, 796 [166 Cal.Rptr. 844, 614 P.2d 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">We need not decide if the Tobe plaintiffs have such a beneficial interest even though two have never been cited under the ordinance and one is not a homeless person, because as taxpayers they have standing under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a to restrain illegal expenditure or waste of city funds on <em>future </em>enforcement of an unconstitutional ordinance or an impermissible means of enforcement of a facially valid ordinance. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 757, 764.) We must determine, therefore, whether the petitions at issue in this case stated and have perfected an as applied challenge to the Santa Ana ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">1. <em>The Tobe petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">The first of these actions (Tobe) has been prosecuted as a petition for writ of mandate by two homeless residents of Santa Ana, each of whom intends to remain in the city, and neither of whom can find affordable housing. The third plaintiff is a resident of Santa Ana. All are taxpayers. Respondents are Santa Ana, its mayor, its city manager, and its police chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Plaintiffs allege that they have been convicted in the past for violating the ordinance and expect to be arrested in the future for sleeping in public and conducting other ordinary and necessary daily activities in public areas. The allegations of the petition do not describe the circumstances of the past arrests and the petition does not allege or describe either the arrests or convictions of other persons that are claimed to have been unconstitutional applications of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">The petition alleges that respondents\u2019 \u201cpattern of arresting, detaining, harassing and incarcerating involuntarily homeless persons such as petitioners, for sleeping and engaging in other ordinary and essential activities of daily life\u201d violates the rights of homeless persons. The only allegations that describe the pattern of enforcement that is claimed to be constitutionally impermissible are ones which state that respondents have caused plaintiffs and other homeless persons to risk arrest and/or detention without probable cause and other \u201cabuses, indignities and punishment\u201d for their homeless status and presence in Santa Ana. Although the petition alleges in conclusory language that a pattern of constitutionally impermissible enforcement of the ordinance existed, plaintiffs never identified the particular applications of the law to be enjoined. The only relief sought in the petition is a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>mandate enjoining <em>any </em>enforcement of the ordinance by respondents. That relief is the kind of relief sought in a facial attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Moreover, no alternative writ was issued and no evidentiary hearing was held. Plaintiffs did not create a factual record on which an injunction limited to improper applications of the ordinance could have been fashioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Thus, notwithstanding the contrary conclusion of the dissent, the allegations of the petition did not clearly state an as applied challenge to the ordinance and the petition did not seek relief from constitutionally impermissible applications or methods of enforcing the ordinance. The petition sought to enjoin <em>any </em>application of the ordinance to <em>any </em>person in <em>any </em>circumstance. And, contrary to the view of the dissent, which relies on \u201cconcessions\u201d of the parties and the reporter\u2019s transcript, rather than the actual judgment of the court, the superior court did not rule on the petition as one encompassing an as applied challenge. The order of that court which directed issuance of a peremptory writ invalidating one sentence of the ordinance as vague, did not identify or dispose of any such challenge. Instead, the court found only that \u201cenforcement of Santa Ana Ordinance NS-2160 . . . does not violate the rights of homeless persons to freedom of movement\u201d and that \u201cpetitioners\u2019 challenges to the constitutionality of the remaining portions of Santa Ana Ordinance NS-2160 are without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">The petition sought to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance on the ground that it was invalid because it violated the rights of the homeless. The court ruled that enforcement did not violate those rights. The court made no findings related to a pattern of enforcement of the ordinance and the judgment makes no mention of the manner in which the ordinance has been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">Moreover, even assuming that plaintiffs attempted to allege and prosecute an as applied challenge, and that the superior court did entertain plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they had mounted an as applied challenge to the ordinance, the superior court did not err in failing to rule on an as applied challenge as plaintiffs did not perfect a basis for ruling on such, a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">The only documents in the record that describe the manner in which the ordinance has been applied are declarations submitted six months after the petition was filed in conjunction with the superior court\u2019s hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for issuance of a peremptory writ. Some of the declarations were by persons other than plaintiffs who stated that they had been arrested or cited for violation of the ordinance. None of those declared that he or she had ever been convicted and had a sentence imposed for violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>ordinance. None stated facts to support a conclusion that citations were given solely for the purpose of harassment and were not prosecuted thereafter, and none stated facts to support either the claim that the ordinance had been enforced discriminatorily against the homeless or the claim that a pattern of constitutionally impermissible enforcement existed. The declarations, which were the only evidence offered in the case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reflected only that persons who were homeless engaged in conduct that violated the ordinance and were arrested or cited for so doing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The declarations described the conduct which led to citations only from the perspective of the person cited. They left unclear whether it may have appeared to the officer who issued the citation that the individual was using or storing camp paraphernalia, or living temporarily, on public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Moreover, assuming that persons whose violation of the ordinance is involuntary may offer a due-process-based necessity defense, the declarations did not demonstrate an impermissible pattern of enforcement against such persons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Two of the declarants were plaintiffs. One was not homeless. The other conceded, contrary to the allegations of the petition, that he had never been cited under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Only one of the remaining seven declarants explained why he had not been able to find lawful shelter on the night he was cited for violation of the ordinance. That declarant was unable to get on the bus to the armory shelter on the night he was cited. His declaration, like those of most of the other declarants, did not indicate that he had applied for public assistance that might have made it possible to find housing. Among the reasons given by the other declarants for \u201ccamping\u201d on public property at the time they were cited were that the civic center area was \u201csafer,\u201d that the declarant had been turned away from a shelter a few weeks earlier and had not returned, that the civic center was convenient to food and there was safety in numbers, that the declarant had missed the bus to the armory, that shelters were so noisy and overcrowded that the declarant could not sleep there, and that the declarant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>did not like the armory because there was too much noise and he liked to be by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">While one of the declarants claimed to be schizophrenic, and stated that she had applied for and was awaiting Social Security assistance, she did not state whether she had sought public assistance from the county or that she had been turned away by a homeless shelter on the night she was cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Assuming that plaintiffs attempted to mount an as applied challenge to the ordinance on this basis, therefore, they simply did not demonstrate that the ordinance had been enforced in a constitutionally impermissible manner against homeless persons who had no alternative but to \u201ccamp\u201d on public property in Santa Ana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">As discussed above, an as applied challenge assumes that the statute or ordinance violated is valid and asserts that the manner of enforcement against a particular individual or individuals or the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance is applied is unconstitutional. All of the declarants who had been cited under the ordinance described conduct in which they had engaged and that conduct appears to have violated the ordinance. None describes an impermissible means of enforcement of the ordinance or enforcement in circumstances that violated the constitutional rights the petition claimed had been violated. None demonstrated that the circumstances in which he or she was cited affected the declarant\u2019s right to travel. None states facts to support a conclusion that any punishment, let alone cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment, had been imposed. Since no constitutionally impermissible pattern, or even single instance, of constitutionally impermissible enforcement was shown, no injunction against such enforcement could be issued and none was sought by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">Because the Tobe plaintiffs sought only to enjoin <em>any </em>enforcement of the ordinance and did not demonstrate a pattern of unconstitutional enforcement, the petition must be considered as one which presented only a facial challenge to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">2. <em>The Zuckernick petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">The second action (Zuckernick) has been prosecuted as a petition for writ of mandate to compel the municipal court in which petitioners are charged with violation of the ordinance to sustain their demurrers to the complaints and to dismiss the charges. The petition was filed in the Court of Appeal after the municipal court overruled the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>The Zuckemick petition arises out of an order overruling a demurrer to a criminal complaint.  A demurrer to a criminal complaint lies only to challenge the sufficiency of the pleading and raises only issues of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McConnell </em>(1890) 82 Cal. 620 [23 P. 40]; <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 925, 929 [64 Cal.Rptr. 500]; see also, 4 Witkin, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7 2127, p. 2498.)

If an indictment, that the grand jury by which it was found had no legal authority to inquire into the offense charged, or, if an information or complaint that the court has no jurisdiction of the offense charged therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-6\">\u201c2. That it does not substantially conform to the provisions of Sections 950 and 952, and also Section 951 in case of an indictment or information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-7\">\u201c3. That more than one offense is charged, except as provided in Section 954;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-8\">\u201c4. That the facts stated do not constitute a public offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-9\">\u201c5. That it contains matter which, if true, would constitute a legal justification or excuse of the offense charged, or other legal bar to the prosecution.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">The Zuckemick petitioners demurred to the complaints on the ground that they did not conform to the provisions of Penal Code sections 950 and 952;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the facts alleged did not constitute a public offense; that the complaints contained matters constituting a legal justification or excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>or other legal bar to the prosecution; and that the offense charged was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and violated the right to travel. The demurrer recited in addition that it was \u201cbased upon the fact that the ordinances and penal statutes allegedly violated are unconstitutionally over-broad and vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the California Constitution; unconstitutionally infringe on the defendant\u2019s right to travel and freedom of travel |&gt;zc].\u201d Elsewhere the demurrer also asserted that the ordinance violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the state constitutional prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">None of the complaints in the Zuckemick proceedings included any allegations identifying the defendant as an involuntarily homeless person whose violation of the ordinance was involuntary and/or occurred at a time when shelter beds were unavailable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the petition for writ of mandate included allegations regarding Santa Ana\u2019s past efforts to rid the city of its homeless population, those allegations, even if true, were irrelevant to the legal sufficiency of the complaints. <em>(Harman </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 150, 166 [101 Cal.Rptr. 880, 496 P.2d 1248]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 382, 391 [158 Cal.Rptr. 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">The Zuckemick demurrers and petition for writ of mandate necessarily constituted only a facial attack on the ordinance since the defendants could not, on a demurrer to the accusatory pleading, offer evidence that as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>to their individual circumstances the ordinance was invalid. (See <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 860, 865.) Those allegations are also irrelevant in determining the facial validity of the ordinance insofar as petitioners alleged that it violated their right to travel and constituted cruel and unusual punishment for status, since they do not establish that there were no circumstances in which the ordinance could be constitutionally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Therefore, while we are not insensitive to the importance of the larger issues petitioners and amici curiae<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> seek to raise in these actions, or to the disturbing nature of the evidence which persuaded the Court of Appeal to base its decision on what it believed to be the impact of the ordinance on homeless persons, the only question properly before the municipal and superior courts and the Court of Appeal for decision was the facial validity of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">We emphasize that the procedural posture of a case is not simply a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d The procedural posture of a case is crucial to determining the proper scope of appellate review. (See, e.g., <em>Sebago, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Alameda </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1372, 1379 [259 Cal.Rptr. 918].) The procedural posture of a case also determines the ability of the parties to exercise their right to present relevant evidence and to the creation of a full record adequate to enable the reviewing court to make a reasoned decision on the questions before it. When an appellate court fails to limit the scope of review to issues properly presented in the trial court, it denies litigants their right to have appellate questions decided on the basis of a full record which exposes all of the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">The importance of these considerations is most clearly demonstrated in the Zuckemick matter. There the People had no opportunity to present evidence regarding the circumstances in which the petitioners had been arrested, as the only issue before the municipal court in ruling on the demurrer was the sufficiency of the complaints. That court properly ruled that the complaints were sufficient. How then can a reviewing court find error in that ruling on the basis of evidence unrelated to the sufficiency of the complaint which the People had no opportunity to rebut in the municipal court?</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>In the Tobe matter, notwithstanding the declarations that were submitted by the plaintiffs, there was no evidence that the ordinance had been applied to any person in a constitutionally impermissible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">This court\u2019s consideration will, therefore, be limited to the facial validity of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">B. <em>Motive of Legislators.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">The Court of Appeal also considered the evidence of Santa Ana\u2019s past attempts to remove homeless persons from the city significant evidence of the purpose for which the ordinance was adopted. It then considered that purpose in assessing the validity of the ordinance.  While the intent or purpose of the legislative body must be considered in construing an ambiguous statute or ordinance (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420]), the motive of the legislative body is generally irrelevant to the validity of the statute or ordinance. <em>(Birkenfeld </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 129, 145 [130 Cal.Rptr. 465, 550 P.2d 1001]; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 898, 913 [120 Cal.Rptr. 707, 534 P.2d 403]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 721, 726-727 [119 Cal.Rptr. 631, 532 P.2d 495]; <em>Sunny Slope Water Co. </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 87, 99 [33 P.2d 672]; <em>In re Sumida </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 388, 390 [170 P. 823]; <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 616, 617 [147 P. 259]; <em>Odd Fellows\u2019 Cem. Assn. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1903) 140 Cal. 226, 235-236 [73 P. 987]; <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1903) 139 Cal. 179, 184 [72 P. 970], revd. on other grounds (1904) 195 U.S. 223 [49 L.Ed. 169, 25 S.Ct. 18]; <em>People </em>v. <em>County of Glenn </em>(1893) 100 Cal. 419, 423 [35 P. 302].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">The Court of Appeal relied in part on <em>Pottinger </em>v. <em>City of Miami </em>(S.D. Fla. 1992) 810 F.Supp. 1551, 1581, for its assumption that consideration of the motives of the Santa Ana City Council may be considered in assessing the validity of the ordinance. That is not the rule in this state, but even were it so, <em>Pottinger </em>was not a challenge to the facial validity of the Miami <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>ordinance in question there. Moreover, the district court\u2019s conclusion that the ordinance was invalid as applied was not based on the motives of the legislators in enacting the ordinance. The court considered internal memoranda and evidence of arrest records as evidence of the purpose underlying <em>enforcement </em>of the ordinance against homeless persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">Absent a basis for believing that the ordinance would not have been adopted if the public areas of Santa Ana had been appropriated for living accommodation by any group other than the homeless, or that it was the intent of that body that the ordinance be enforced only against homeless persons (see, e.g., <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 861 [92 Cal.Rptr. 153, 479 P.2d 353]), the ordinance is not subject to attack on the basis that the city council may have hoped that its impact would be to discourage homeless persons from moving to Santa Ana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">We cannot assume, as does the dissent, that the sole purpose of the Santa Ana ordinance was to force the homeless out of the city. The city had agreed to discontinue such attempts when it settled the prior litigation. The record confirms that the city faced a problem common to many urban areas, the occupation of public parks and other public facilities by homeless persons. Were we to adopt the approach suggested by the dissent, any facially valid ordinance enacted by a city that had once acted in a legally impermissible manner to achieve a permissible objective could be found invalid on the basis that its past conduct established that the ordinance was not enacted for a permissible purpose. Absent evidence other than the enactment of a facially valid ordinance, we cannot make that assumption here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">The dissent relies on <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 861, as supporting invalidation of a facially valid ordinance on the ground that it is motivated by impermissible legislative intent. The Santa Ana ordinance and the circumstances of its adoption are distinguishable from the Carmel ordinance at issue in <em>Parr, </em>however. There, the city had not entered into a court-approved settlement in which it stipulated that it would not engage in discriminatory enforcement of the law against \u201cundesirables,\u201d and, unlike the Santa Ana ordinance, the Carmel ordinance banned a customary use of the city park\u2014sitting or lying on the lawn. A \u201cDeclaration of Urgency\u201d which accompanied the Carmel ordinance stated that its purpose was to regulate the use of public property, parks, and beaches by transient visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The Carmel ordinance was challenged as facially invalid on grounds that it discriminated against undesirable and unsanitary persons, referring to them as \u201chippies\u201d and \u201ctransients.\u201d In <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 861, we rejected the People\u2019s argument that only the operative language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>the ordinance should be considered because the declaration of purpose suggested that the operative sections were intended to be limited in their application to the group it described. On that basis we concluded that the Carmel ordinance had a discriminatory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The ordinance, by contrast, bans use of public property in the city for purposes for which it was not designed. At the time it was adopted the city had agreed not to engage in discriminatory law enforcement. And no declaration of purpose comparable to that which accompanied the Carmel ordinance was made. The declared purpose of the ordinance did not suggest that it was to be enforced solely against the homeless. We cannot, for those reasons, join the assumption of the dissent that the purpose of the ordinance is simply to drive the homeless out of Santa Ana.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">C. <em>Facial Challenges on Vagueness Grounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">The Court of Appeal granted relief to the Zuckemick petitioners without regard to either the limitations on a demurrer to a criminal complaint or vagueness challenges by criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">\u201cThe mle is well established . . . that one will not be heard to attack a statute on grounds that are not shown to be applicable to himself and that a court will not consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute and will not consider the question of constitutionality with reference to hypothetical situations.\u201d <em>(In re Cregler, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 308, 313.) If the statute clearly applies to a criminal defendant\u2019s conduct, the defendant may not challenge it on grounds of vagueness. <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 733, 756 [41 L.Ed.2d 439, 457-458, 94 S.Ct. 2547]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 692, 696 [278 Cal.Rptr. 140].) However, in some cases, a defendant may make a facial challenge to the statute, if he argues that the statute improperly prohibits a \u201c \u2018substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\u2019 \u201d whether or not its application to his own conduct may be constitutional. <em>(Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352, 358-359, fn. 8 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909-910, 103 S.Ct. 1855].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">The Zuckemick petitioners argued in support of their demurrers that the ordinance failed to give fair and adequate notice of prohibited conduct, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>vague enforcement standards which encourage arbitrary and discriminatory arrests and convictions, and reached constitutionally protected conduct. The vagueness aspect of their challenge to the ordinance is governed by the rule stated in <em>In re Cregler, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 308, 313. The last ground, an overbreadth, not a vagueness, argument, is governed by <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>461 U.S. 352, 358-359, fn. 8 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909-910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">The Zuckemick petitioners\u2019 vagueness challenge was addressed to the terms \u201ccamp,\u201d \u201ccamp facilities,\u201d and \u201ccamp paraphernalia,\u201d as defined in the ordinance, and the term \u201ctemporary shelter,\u201d which is not defined. The definitions in the ordinance include terms which those petitioners do not claim are vague and which may apply to petitioner\u2019s conduct. Thus the People may seek to establish violation of the ordinance on the basis that one or more of the petitioners pitched or used a tent on a public street or parking lot. Because the Zuckemick challenge to the ordinance was brought by demurrer and the nature of their conduct has not been determined, those petitioners cannot show at this stage of the proceedings that the ordinance did not clearly apply to their conduct. To that extent, therefore, the vagueness challenge of the Zuckemick petitioners is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">The Tobe plaintiffs are not persons presently charged with violating the ordinance, however. Their actions do not seek to avoid prosecution for criminal acts. They are suing as taxpayers to restrain expenditure of public funds on the enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional ordinance. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a.) The restrictions applicable to vagueness challenges by criminal defendants do not apply to their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">With these considerations in mind, we now turn to the constitutional bases for the decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">Facial Validity of the Santa Ana Ordinance</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-9\">A. <em>Right to Travel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">Although no provision of the federal Constitution expressly recognizes a right to travel among and between the states, that right is recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>as a fundamental aspect of the federal union of states. \u201cFor all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed, we are one people, with one common country. We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.\u201d <em>(Passenger Cases </em>(1849) 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283, 492 [12 L.Ed. 702, 791] (dis. opn. of Taney, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">In the <em>Passenger Cases, supra, </em>48 U.S. 283, the court struck down taxes imposed by the States of New York and Massachusetts on aliens who entered the state from other states and countries by ship. The basis for the decision, as found in the opinions of the individual justices, was that the tax invaded the power of Congress over foreign and interstate commerce. The opinion of Chief Justice Taney, in which he disagreed with the majority on the commerce clause issue, also addressed the tax as applied to citizens of the United States arriving from other states. That tax he believed to be impermissible. Some later decisions of the court trace recognition of the constitutional right of unburdened interstate travel to that opinion. (See, e.g., <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 630 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 612-613, 89 S.Ct. 1322].) And, relying on the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice in the <em>Passenger Cases, </em>the court struck down a tax on egress from the State of Nevada in <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Nevada </em>(1867) 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 [18 L.Ed. 745], holding that the right of interstate travel was a right of national citizenship which was essential if a citizen were to be able to pass freely through another state to reach the national or a regional seat of the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">Other cases find the source of the right in the privileges and immunities clause. In <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1868) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168 [19 L.Ed. 357], the court rejected a challenge predicated on the privileges and immunities clause made by a corporation to a tax imposed by the State of Virginia on out-of-state insurance companies. In so doing, it recognized interstate travel as a right guaranteed to citizens. \u201cIt was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question to place the citizens of each State upon the same footing with citizens of other States, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those States are concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alienage in other States; it inhibits discriminating legislation against them by other States; <em>it gives them the right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them, </em>it insures to them in other States the same freedom possessed by the citizens of those States in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and in the pursuit of happiness; and it secures to them in other States the equal protection of their laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 180 [19 L.Ed at p. 360], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">In the <em>Slaughter-House Cases </em>(1872) 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 [21 L.Ed. 394], the court equated the rights protected by the privileges and immunities</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>clause to those in the corresponding provision of the Articles of Confederation which provided that the inhabitants of each state were to have \u201c \u2018the privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States; and the people of each State shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other State (83 U.S. at p. 75 [21 L.Ed. at p. 408].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">The privileges and immunities clause was also the source of the right of interstate travel as an incident of national citizenship recognized by the court in <em>Twining </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1908) 211 U.S. 78, 97 [53 L.Ed. 97,105, 29 S.Ct. 14] and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1920) 254 U.S. 281, 293 [65 L.Ed. 270, 273, 41 S.Ct. 133]. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fears </em>(1900) 179 U.S. 270, 274 [45 L.Ed. 186, 188-189, 21 S.Ct. 128], the right was held to be one protected by the Fourteenth Amendment as well as other provisions of the Constitution. \u201cUndoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Again, in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 116, 127 [2 L.Ed.2d 1204,1211, 78 S.Ct. 1113], freedom to travel was recognized as \u201can important aspect of the citizen\u2019s \u2018liberty.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 160, 177, 183 [86 L.Ed. 119, 127, 62 S.Ct. 164] (conc, opns. of Douglas, J. and Jackson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The right to travel, or right of migration, now is seen as an aspect of personal liberty which, when united with the right to travel, requires \u201cthat all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.\u201d <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. 618, 629 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 612]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guest </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 745, 757-758 [16 L.Ed.2d 239, 248-250, 86 S.Ct. 1170].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">In a line of cases originating with <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. 618, the court has considered the right to travel in the context of equal protection challenges to state laws creating durational residency requirements as a condition to the exercise of a fundamental right or receipt of a state benefit. In those cases the court has held that a law which <em>directly </em>burdens the fundamental right of migration or interstate travel is constitutionally impermissible. Therefore a state may not create classifications which, by imposing burdens or restrictions on newer residents which do not apply to all residents, deter or penalize, migration of persons who exercise their right to travel to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">In <em>Shapiro, </em>where public assistance was denied residents who had lived in the state for less than one year, the court held that durational residence as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>condition of receiving public assistance constituted invidious discrimination between residents, and that if a law had no other purpose than chilling the exercise of a constitutional right such as that of migration of needy persons into the state the law was impermissible. <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. 618, 627, 631 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 613].) Further, \u201cany classification which serves to penalize the exercise of [the right of migration], unless shown to be necessary to promote a <em>compelling </em>governmental interest, is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 634 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 615].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Next, durational residence requirements for voting were struck down by the court in <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 330 [31 L.Ed.2d 274, 92 S.Ct. 995]. Again the question arose as an equal protection issue. The court held that the state must have a compelling reason for the requirement because it denied residents the right to vote, a fundamental political right, and because the law \u201cclassifies] . . . residents on the basis of recent travel, penalizing those persons . . . who have gone from one jurisdiction to another during the qualifying period. Thus, the durational residence requirement directly impinges on the exercise of a second fundamental personal right, the right to travel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 338 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 281-282].) The court emphasized the imposition of a \u201cdirect\u201d burden on travel: \u201cObviously, durational residence laws single out the class of bona fide state and county residents who have recently exercised this constitutionally protected right, and penalize such travelers directly.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It also took care to point out, as it had in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. 618, 638, fn. 21 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 617]), that a law which did not penalize residents on the basis of recent travel would not be vulnerable to a similar challenge. The court explained: \u201cWhere, for example, an interstate migrant loses his driver\u2019s license because the new State has a higher age requirement, a different constitutional question is presented. For in such a case, the new State\u2019s age requirement is not a <em>penalty </em>imposed solely because the newcomer is a new resident; instead, all residents, old and new, must be of a prescribed age to drive.\u201d (405 U.S. at p. 342, fn. 12 [31 L.Ed.2d at p. 284].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">The court\u2019s focus on whether the law directly burdened, by penalizing, interstate travel continued in <em>Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Maricopa County </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 250 [39 L.Ed.2d 306, 94 S.Ct. 1076], in which a durational residence requirement for indigent, nonemergency medical care at county expense was challenged. The court held that the restriction denied newcomers equal protection, impinged on the right to travel by denying basic necessities of life, and penalized interstate migration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 261-262 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 316-317]; see also <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Arizona State Bd. of Dental Examiners </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 673 F.2d 272, 277 [licensing requirement that did not disadvantage newcomers vis-\u00e1-vis previous residents did not penalize exercise of right to travel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>In each of these cases the court had before it a law which denied residents a fundamental constitutional right (voting) or a governmental benefit (public assistance, medical care) on the basis of the duration of their residence. The law created two classes of residents. In <em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 55 [72 L.Ed.2d 672, 102 S.Ct. 2309], where the right to share in oil revenues was based on the duration of residence in Alaska, the court noted that the right to travel analysis in those cases, which did not create an actual barrier to travel, was simply a type of equal protection analysis. \u201cIn addition to protecting persons against the erection of actual barriers to interstate movement, the right to travel, when applied to residency requirements, protects new residents of a state from being disadvantaged because of their recent migration or from otherwise being treated differently from longer term residents. In reality, right to travel analysis refers to little more than a particular application of equal protection analysis. Right to travel cases have examined, in equal protection terms, state distinctions between newcomers and longer term residents.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 60, fn. 6 [72 L.Ed.2d at pp. 677-678].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The right of intrastate travel has been recognized as a basic human right protected by article I, sections 7 and 24 of the California Constitution. <em>(In re White </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 141 [158 Cal.Rptr. 562].) There the court concluded that a condition of probation which barred a defendant convicted of prostitution from designated areas in the City of Fresno should be modified to avoid an overly restrictive impact on the defendant\u2019s right to travel. The court held that \u201cthe right to intrastate travel (which includes intramunicipal travel) is a basic human right protected by the United States and California Constitutions as a whole. Such a right is implicit in the concept of a democratic society and is one of the attributes of personal liberty under common law. (See 1 Blackstone, Commentaries 134; U.S. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 2 and the 5th, 9th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a) and art. I, \u00a7 24 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 148.) In <em>White, </em>as in the early United States Supreme Court cases, the court addressed a direct burden on travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has ever held, however, that the incidental impact on travel of a law having a purpose other than restriction of the right to travel, and which does not discriminate among classes of persons by penalizing the exercise by some of the right to travel, is constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">By contrast, in a decision clearly relevant here, a zoning law which restricted occupancy to family units or nonfamily units of no more than two persons was upheld by the Supreme Court, notwithstanding any incidental impact on a person\u2019s preference to move to that area, because the law was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>not aimed at transients and involved no fundamental right. <em>(Village of Belle Terre </em>v. <em>Boraas </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 1, 7 [39 L.Ed.2d 797, 803, 94 S.Ct. 1536].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Courts of this state have taken a broader view of the right of intrastate travel, but have found violations only when a direct restriction of the right to travel occurred. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 55, 61-62 [115 Cal.Rptr. 247, 524 P.2d 375].) In <em>In re White, supra, </em>the petitioner had been barred directly from traveling to specified areas. In <em>In re Marriage of Fingert </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1575 [271 Cal.Rptr. 389], a parent had been ordered to move to another county as a condition of continued custody of a child. Indirect or incidental burdens on travel resulting from otherwise lawful governmental action have not been recognized as impermissible infringements of the right to travel and, when subjected to an equal protection analysis, strict scrutiny is not required. If there is any rational relationship between the purpose of the statute or ordinance and a legitimate government objective, the law must be upheld. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 55, 61-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">This court has also rejected an argument that any legislation that burdens the right to travel must be subjected to strict scrutiny and sustained only if a compelling need is demonstrated. In <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038], an initiative ordinance which banned issuance of new building permits until support facilities were available was challenged as an impermissible burden on the right to travel. We rejected the argument because the impact of the ordinance was only an indirect burden on the right to travel. The ordinance did not penalize travel and resettlement, although an incidental impact was to make it more difficult to establish residence in the place of one\u2019s choosing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 602-603; see also <em>R.H. Macy &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Contra Costa County </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 352, 367-369 [276 Cal.Rptr. 530].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">We do not question the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that a local ordinance which forbids sleeping on public streets or in public parks and other public places may have the effect of deterring travel by persons who are unable to afford or obtain other accommodations in the location to which they travel.  Assuming that there may be some state actions short of imposing a direct barrier to migration or denying benefits to a newly arrived resident which violate the right to travel, the ordinance does not do so. It is a nondiscriminatory ordinance which forbids use of the public streets, parks, and property by residents and nonresidents alike for purposes other than those for which the property was designed. It is not constitutionally invalid because it may have an incidental impact on the right of some persons to interstate or intrastate travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>As we have pointed out above, to succeed in a facial challenge to the validity of a statute or ordinance the plaintiff must establish that \u201c \u2018the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Dept, of Education, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 251, 267, quoting <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 168, 180-181.)  All presumptions favor the validity of a statute. The court may not declare it invalid unless it is clearly so. <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 814-815 [258 Cal.Rptr. 161, 771 P.2d 1247].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Since the Santa Ana ordinance does not on its face reflect a discriminatory purpose, and is one which the city has the power to enact, its validity must be sustained unless it cannot be applied without trenching upon constitutionally protected rights. The provisions of the Santa Ana ordinance do not inevitably conflict with the right to travel. The ordinance is capable of constitutional application. The ordinance prohibits \u201cany person\u201d from camping and/or storing personal possessions on public streets and other public property. It has no impact, incidental or otherwise, on the right to travel except insofar as a person, homeless or not, might be discouraged from traveling to Santa Ana because camping on public property is banned. An ordinance that bans camping and storing personal possessions on public property does not directly impede the right to travel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th Supp. 5, 13 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 179].) Even assuming that the ordinance may constitute an incidental impediment to some individuals\u2019 ability to travel to Santa Ana, since it is manifest that the ordinance is capable of applications which do not offend the Constitution in the manner suggested by petitioners and the Court of Appeal, the ordinance must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">Our conclusion that the Santa Ana ordinance does not impermissibly infringe on the right of the homeless, or others, to travel, finds support in the decision of the United States District Court in <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 846 F.Supp. 843. The plaintiffs, on behalf of a class of homeless individuals, sought a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation of a program of enforcement (the Matrix Program) of state and municipal laws which were commonly violated by the homeless residents of the city. Among the laws to be enforced were those banning \u201ccamping\u201d or \u201clodging\u201d in public parks and obstructing sidewalks. It was claimed, inter alia, that the Matrix Program infringed on the right to travel. The court rejected that argument and refused to require the city to show a compelling state interest to justify any impact the program might have on the right of the class members to travel. It noted that the program was not facially discriminatory as it did not distinguish between persons who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>residents of the city and those who were not. In so doing, the court suggested that the opinion of the Court of Appeal in this case was among those which constituted extensions of the right to travel that appeared to be \u201cunwarranted under the governing Supreme Court precedent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 860.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">The right to travel does not, as the Court of Appeal reasoned in this case, endow citizens with a \u201cright to live or stay where one will.\u201d While an individual may travel where he will and remain in a chosen location, that constitutional guaranty does not confer immunity against local trespass laws and does not create a right to remain without regard to the ownership of the property on which he chooses to live or stay, be it public or privately owned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Moreover, lest we be understood to imply that an as applied challenge to the ordinance might succeed on the right to travel ground alone, we caution that, with few exceptions,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the creation or recognition of a constitutional right does not impose on a state or governmental subdivision the obligation to provide its citizens with the means to enjoy that right. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>McRae </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 297, 317-318 [65 L.Ed.2d 784, 804-806, 100 S.Ct. 2671]; <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Roe </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 464, 471-474 [53 L.Ed.2d 484, 492-495, 97 S.Ct. 2376].)  Santa Ana has no constitutional obligation to make accommodations on or in public property available to the transient homeless to facilitate their exercise of the right to travel. <em>(Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 56, 74 [31 L.Ed.2d 36, 50-51, 92 S.Ct. 862].) Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 288 [82 L.Ed.2d 221, 104 S.Ct. 3065], for the proposition that Santa Ana is obliged to provide areas in which camping is permitted on public property is misplaced. The issue in <em>Clark </em>was whether the refusal of the National Park Service to permit demonstrators who wished to call attention to the plight of the homeless to sleep in Lafayette Park and on the Mall in the nation\u2019s capital violated the First Amendment rights of the demonstrators. The court held that it did not, as other areas were available for the purpose. <em>Clark </em>dealt with an affirmative right\u2014that of free speech \u2014which could be restricted in public fora only by reasonable, content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 293 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 293-294].) The court expressly recognized the authority of the National Park Service \u201cto promulgate rules and regulations for the use of the parks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>accordance with the purposes for which they were established.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (468 U.S. at p. 289 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 224].) Petitioners in this case make no claim that the right they seek, to camp on public property in Santa Ana, is expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. There is no comparable constitutional mandate that sites on public property be made available for camping to facilitate a homeless person\u2019s right to travel, just as there is no right to use public property for camping or storing personal belongings.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Santa Ana ordinance impermissibly infringes on the right of the homeless to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">B. <em>Punishment for Status.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">The Court of Appeal invalidated the ordinance for the additional reason that it imposed punishment for the \u201cinvoluntary status of being homeless.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On that basis the court held the ordinance was invalid because such punishment violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, and the ban on cruel or unusual punishment of article I, section, 17 of the California Constitution. We disagree with that construction of the ordinance and of the activity for which punishment is authorized. The ordinance permits punishment for proscribed conduct, not punishment for status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">The holding of the Court of Appeal is not limited to the face of the ordinance, and goes beyond even the evidence submitted by petitioners. Neither the language of the ordinance nor that evidence supports a conclusion that a person may be convicted and punished under the ordinance solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>on the basis that he or she has no fixed place of abode. No authority is cited for the proposition that an ordinance which prohibits camping on public property punishes the involuntary status of being homeless or, as the Court of Appeal also concluded, is punishment for poverty. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660 [8 L.Ed.2d 758, 82 S.Ct. 1417], on which the court relied, dealt with a statute which criminalized the status of being addicted to narcotics. The court made it clear, however, that punishing the conduct of using or possessing narcotics, even by an addict, is not impermissible punishment for status. (370 U.S. at pp. 664, 666 [8 L.Ed.2d at pp. 761-763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">A plurality of the high court reaffirmed the <em>Robinson </em>holding in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 514 [20 L.Ed.2d 1254, 88 S.Ct. 2145], where it rejected a claim that punishment of an alcoholic for being drunk in public was constitutionally impermissible. \u201cThe entire thrust of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law terms, has committed some <em>actus reus. </em>It thus does not deal with the question of whether certain conduct cannot constitutionally be punished because it is, in some sense, \u2018involuntary\u2019 or \u2018occasioned by a compulsion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 1268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">As the district court observed in <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>846 F.Supp. 843, 857, the Supreme Court has not held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishment of acts derivative of a person\u2019s status. Indeed, the district court questioned whether \u201chomelessness\u201d is a status at all within the meaning of the high court\u2019s decisions. \u201cAs an analytical matter, more fundamentally, homelessness is not readily classified as a \u2018status.\u2019 Rather, as expressed for the plurality in <em>Powell </em>by Justice Marshall, there is a \u2018substantial definitional distinction between a \u201cstatus\u201d . . . and a \u201ccondition\u201d . . . .\u2019 392 U.S. at 533, 88 S.Ct. at 2155. While the concept of status might elude perfect definition, certain factors assist in its determination, such as the involuntariness of the acquisition of that quality (including the presence or not of that characteristic at birth), <em>see Robinson, </em>370 U.S. at 665-69 &amp; [fn.] 9, 82 S.Ct. at 1420-21 &amp; [fn.] 9, and the degree to which an individual has control over that characteristic.\u201d (846 F.Supp. at p. 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">The declarations submitted by petitioners in this action demonstrate the analytical difficulty to which the <em>Joyce </em>court referred. Assuming arguendo the accuracy of the declarants\u2019 descriptions of the circumstances in which they were cited under the ordinance, it is far from clear that none had alternatives to either the condition of being homeless or the conduct that led to homelessness and to the citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>The Court of Appeal erred, therefore, in concluding that the ordinance is invalid because it permits punishment for the status of being indigent or homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">C. <em>Vagueness and Overbreadth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">The Court of Appeal concluded that the ordinance was vague and over-broad. It based its vagueness conclusion on the nonexclusive list of examples of camping \u201cparaphernalia\u201d and \u201cfacilities\u201d in the definitions of those terms. Those definitions were so unspecific, the court reasoned, that they invited arbitrary enforcement of the ordinance in the unfettered discretion of the police. The overbreadth conclusion was based on reasoning that the ordinance could be applied to constitutionally protected conduct. In that respect the court held that the verb \u201cstore\u201d was overbroad as it could be applied to innocent conduct such as leaving beach towels unattended at public pools and wet umbrellas in library foyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b-AFN\">\n<em>Vagueness.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">The Tobe respondents and the People, real party in interest in the Zuckemick matter, argue that the Court of Appeal failed to apply the tests enunciated by the United States Supreme Court and this court in applying the vagueness doctrine. It has isolated particular terms rather than considering them in context. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">A penal statute must define the offense with sufficient precision that \u201cordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>(Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909]; see also <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 156, 162 [31 L.Ed.2d 110, 115-116, 92 S.Ct. 839]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 612, 617 [98 L.Ed. 989, 996, 74 S.Ct. 808]; <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 88, 97-98 [84 L.Ed. 1093, 1099-1100, 60 S.Ct. 736].) \u201cThe constitutional interest implicated in questions of statutory vagueness is that no person be deprived of \u2018life, liberty, or property without due process of law,\u2019 as assured by both the federal Constitution (U.S. Const., Amends. V, XIV) and the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7).\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 853 P.2d 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">To satisfy the constitutional command, a statute must meet two basic requirements: (1) The statute must be sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed; and (2) the statute must provide sufficiently definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>discriminatory enforcement. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 561, 567; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 112, 141 [253 Cal.Rptr. 1, 763 P.2d 852]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Caswell) </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 381, 389-390 [250 Cal.Rptr. 515, 758 P.2d 1046].) Only a reasonable degree of certainty is required, however. (46 Cal.3d at p. 391.) The analysis begins with \u201cthe strong presumption that legislative enactments \u2018must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears. [Citations.] A statute should be sufficiently certain so that a person may know what is prohibited thereby and what may be done without violating its provisions, but it cannot be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. The terms which the Court of Appeal considered vague are not so when the purpose clause of the ordinance is considered and the terms are read in that context as they should be. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 561, 569; see also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, supra, </em>468 U.S. 288, 290-291 [82 L.Ed.2d 221, 224-226]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Musser </em>(D.C. Cir. 1989) 873 F.2d 1513 [277 App.D.C. 256]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(D.C. Cir. 1988) 864 F.2d 188, 197-198 [274 App.D.C. 385]; <em>ACORN </em>v. <em>City of Tulsa, Okl. </em>(10th Cir. 1987) 835 F.2d 735, 744-745.) Contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeal, we see no possibility that any law enforcement agent would believe that a picnic in a public park constituted \u201ccamping\u201d within the meaning of the ordinance or would believe that leaving a towel on a beach or an umbrella in a library constituted storage of property in violation of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The stated purpose of the ordinance is to make public streets and other areas readily accessible to the public and to prevent use of public property \u201cfor camping purposes or storage of personal property\u201d which \u201cinterferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended.\u201d No reasonable person would believe that a picnic in an area designated for picnics would constitute camping in violation of the ordinance. The ordinance defines camping as occupation of camp facilities, living temporarily in a camp facility or outdoors, or using camp paraphernalia. The Court of Appeal\u2019s strained interpretation of \u201cliving,\u201d reasoning that we all use public facilities for \u201cliving\u201d since all of our activities are part of living, ignores the context of the ordinance which prohibits living not in the sense of existing, but dwelling or residing on public property. Picnicking is not living on public property. It does not involve occupation of \u201ctents, huts, or temporary shelters\u201d \u201cpitched\u201d on public property or residing on public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Nor is the term \u201cstore\u201d vague. Accumulating or putting aside items, placing them for safekeeping, or leaving them in public parks, on public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>streets, or in a public parking lot or other public area is prohibited by the ordinance. When read in light of the express purpose of the ordinance \u2014 to avoid interfering with use of those areas for the purposes for which they are intended \u2014 it is clear that leaving a towel on a beach, an umbrella in the public library, or a student backpack in a school, or using picnic supplies in a park in which picnics are permitted is not a violation of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Unlike the Court of Appeal, we do not believe that <em>People </em>v. <em>Mannon </em>(1989) 217 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [265 Cal.Rptr. 616], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10 [222 Cal.Rptr. 736], which upheld application of similar ordinances, were wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">In <em>Mannon </em>the appellate department rejected a claim that the defendants were not \u201ccamping\u201d within the definition of a Santa Barbara city ordinance. The court reasoned: \u201cThere is nothing ambiguous about the meaning of the word \u2018camp.\u2019 The definition is \u2018to pitch or occupy a camp . . . to live temporarily in a camp or outdoors.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Intern. Diet. (1965) p. 322.) The illustrations of the word \u2018camp\u2019 utilized in the municipal code do not vary the traditional meaning of that word, they merely supplement it. The illustrations are consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word, i.e., living temporarily in the outdoors. ... [A] reasonable person would understand \u2018camp\u2019 to mean to temporarily live or occupy an area in the outdoors, and would not be deceived or mislead by the undertaking of further explanation in the municipal code.\u201d (217 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 4-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">The ordinance is not vague. It gives adequate notice of the conduct it prohibits. It does not invite arbitrary or capricious enforcement. The superior court properly rejected that basis of the Tobe plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the ordinance. The Court of Appeal erred in reversing that judgment on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">2. <em>Overbreadth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">The Court of Appeal reasoned that the ordinance was broader than necessary since it banned camping on all public property. There is no such limitation on the exercise of the police power, however, unless an ordinance is vulnerable on equal protection grounds or directly impinges on a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">If the overbreadth argument is a claim that the ordinance exceeds the police power of that city, it must also fail. There is no fundamental right to camp on public property; persons who do so are not a suspect classification; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>and neither of the petitions claims that the ordinance is invidiously discriminatory on its face. The Legislature has expressly recognized the power of a city \u201cto regulate conduct upon a street, sidewalk, or other public place or on or in a place open to the public\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647c) and has specifically authorized local ordinances governing the use of municipal parks. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5193.) Adoption of the ordinance was clearly within the police power of the city, which may \u201cmake and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u201d (Cal.

As the more than 90 cities and the California State Association of Counties that have filed an amicus curiae brief in this court have observed, a city not only has the power to keep its streets and other public property open and available for the purpose to which they are dedicated, it has a duty to do so. <em>(San Francisco Street Artists Guild </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 667, 674 [112 Cal.Rptr. 502].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The Court of Appeal also failed to recognize that a facial challenge to a law on grounds that it is overbroad and vague is an assertion that the law is invalid in all respects and cannot have <em>any </em>valid application <em>(Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 489, 494, fn. 5 [71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369, 102 S.Ct. 1186]), or a claim that the law sweeps in a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The concepts of vagueness and overbreadth are related, in the sense that if a law threatens the exercise of a constitutionally protected right a more stringent vagueness test applies. <em>(Id. </em>atp. 499 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 372]; <em>Kolenderv.

There is no impermissible restriction on the right to travel. There is no right to use of public property for living accommodations or for storage of personal possessions except insofar as the government permits such use by ordinance or regulation. Therefore, the ordinance is not overbroad, and is not facially invalid in that respect. It is capable of constitutional application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Since the ordinance is not unconstitutionally overbroad, and the facial vagueness challenge must fail, the Court of Appeal erred in ordering dismissal of the complaints in the Zuckemick prosecution and enjoining enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Lucas, C.

The arguments of many amici curiae regarding the apparently intractable problem of homelessness and the impact of the Santa Ana ordinance on various groups of homeless persons (e.g., teenagers, families with children, and the mentally ill) should be addressed to the Legislature and the Orange County Board of Supervisors, not the judiciary. Neither the criminal justice system nor the judiciary is equipped to resolve chronic social problems, but criminalizing conduct that is a product of those problems is not for that reason constitutionally impermissible.

The Court of Appeal nonetheless assumed that the adoption of a facially neutral ordinance prohibiting camping and storing personal possessions on public property was a renewed effort to do so and a violation of the settlement agreement. Had it been a violation of the settlement agreement, however, the Tobe plaintiffs\u2019 appropriate recourse would have been through an action to enforce the settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1131-10\"> We also decline to join the conclusion of the dissent that enactment of an ordinance like that adopted by Santa Ana, whose purpose is to preserve public property for its intended use, is constitutionally impermissible because it may lead to the adoption of similar ordinances in other cities with the result that the homeless are everywhere excluded from living on public property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1131-11\"> Because we conclude that the ordinance is not overbroad, we need not decide whether the overbreadth doctrine is applicable outside the area of freedoms protected by the First Amendment.

I write separately to clarify a point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">The concurring opinion of Justice Werdegar states that the majority \u201cevidently reject[s] on its merits, the claim that a homeless person may not constitutionally be punished for publicly engaging in harmless activities necessary to life, such as sleeping.\u201d (Cone. opn. of Werdegar, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1111.) Because that issue is not properly before us in this facial challenge to the ordinance, the majority does not address it, and it expressly says so: \u201c[Tjhe Court of Appeal did not distinguish between involuntarily being homeless, and involuntarily engaging in conduct that violated the ordinance. The court assumed that an involuntarily homeless person who involuntarily camps on public property may be convicted or punished under the ordinance. That question, which the Court of Appeal and the dissent address, and which might be raised in an \u2018as applied\u2019 challenge to the ordinance, is not before us because plaintiffs offered no evidence that the ordinance was being applied in that manner. We express no opinion on the proper construction of the ordinance, in particular on whether the conduct it prohibits must be \u2018willful,\u2019 or on whether or in what circumstances a necessity defense is available.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1104, fn. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\">Thus, the majority does <em>not </em>decide whether a person who by reason of necessity falls asleep in a public park may constitutionally be successfully prosecuted. Moreover, the majority does not address, much less reject on its merits, a claim that there are no constitutional limits on punishing conduct regardless of the circumstances. Nor does it determine whether or not homelessness is a \u201cstatus\u201d as that term is described in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660 [8 L.Ed.2d 758, 82 S.Ct. 1417], and in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 514 [20 L.Ed.2d 1254, 88 S.Ct. 2145]. What the majority does decide is the issue before it: that the challenged <em>camping </em>ordinance does not on its face constitute prohibited punishment based on status. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1104-1106.)</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1146-10\">WERDEGAR, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AKq\">I concur in the result and much of the reasoning of the majority. Specifically, I agree the procedural history of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>cases (Tobe and Zuckemick) dictates they be treated as purely facial challenges to the ordinance, and that the ordinance survives such a challenge. I write separately because in the process of rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the ordinance as cruel or unusual punishment, the majority enters into the merits of an as applied attack, an issue not properly before us. I would leave the question to another day, when we are presented with a case that requires its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">To succeed, a <em>facial </em>attack on the anticamping ordinance as cruel and unusual punishment (U.S. Const., 8th Amend.) or as cruel or unusual punishment (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17) would require showing punishment under the ordinance, in <em>all its possible applications, </em>is cruel, unusual or both. Plaintiffs have not seriously advanced that proposition, and it could be rejected in few words. Clearly, <em>some </em>acts of camping in public places\u2014 pitching a tent in the middle of a street, for example\u2014may constitutionally be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">The majority unnecessarily goes far beyond that reasoning, however, to consider, and evidently reject on its merits, the claim a homeless person may not constitutionally be punished for publicly engaging in harmless activities necessary to life, such as sleeping. Apparently the majority would reject this claim for two reasons; first, because, in its view, <em>conduct </em>may always be constitutionally punished no matter how inseparable it is, causally or logically, from a person\u2019s status or condition (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1104-1105); and second, because it questions whether homelessness is a \u201cstatus\u201d at all within the meaning of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660 [8 L.Ed.2d 758, 82 S.Ct. 1417] (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Not surprisingly, since it has disavowed the intent to consider the merits of an as applied challenge, the majority treats these issues cursorily. In so doing, it fails to consider the legal arguments actually made, or the authorities cited, by petitioners and their allied amici curiae. This portion of the majority opinion is pure dictum and should be read as such.</p>\n<author id=\"b1147-8\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR8\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">By addressing only the facial challenges to the Santa Ana ordinance now before us and looking only to its neutral language, the majority sidestep the pressing and difficult issues raised in this case. In the process, they erect new procedural barriers that will make future as applied challenges to the ordinance costly and protracted, while shielding the ordinance from meaningful review. Unlike the majority, I decline to ignore the purpose and effect of the ordinance, whether it is assessed on its face or as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>The City of Santa Ana (hereafter the City or Santa Ana) enacted the challenged ordinance as the latest offensive in its five-year campaign to banish the homeless. Under its broad provisions, a person who \u201ccamps\u201d in any public area or \u201cstores\u201d any personal property in any public area is subject to citation and arrest for a criminal offense punishable by six months in jail. (Santa Ana Ord. No. NS-2160, adding art. VIII, \u00a7 10-400 et seq. to Santa Ana Mun. Code (hereafter the ordinance), \u00a7\u00a7 10-402, 10-403.) It has been enforced against homeless persons whose sole \u201ccrime\u201d was to cover themselves with a blanket and rest in a public area. Homeless persons with no alternative but to temporarily leave their personal belongings in public places are also subject to repeated citation and arrest for violation of the ordinance\u2019s prohibition against \u201cstoring\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">The City has conceded that the purpose of the ordinance is to address the \u201cproblem\u201d of the homeless living in its parks and other public areas. The ordinance has, moreover, been enforced in a manner that specifically targets the homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">For those reasons, I conclude that the ordinance is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the homeless residents of Santa Ana. Although a city may reasonably control the use of its parks and other public areas, it cannot constitutionally enact and enforce an ordinance so sweeping that it literally prevents indigent homeless citizens from residing within its boundaries if they are unable to afford housing and unable to find a space in the limited shelters made available to them. The City cannot solve its \u201chomeless problem\u201d simply by exiling large numbers of its homeless citizens to neighboring localities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Although not unconstitutionally vague, the ordinance fails under our decision in <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 861 [92 Cal.Rptr. 153, 479 P.2d 353] (hereafter <em>Parr), </em>because it violates the guaranty of equal protection under both the United States Constitution (14th Amend.) and the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a)). It also impermissibly impairs the fundamental right of the homeless, under both the United States and California Constitutions, to travel freely within the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">I. <em>Facial and As Applied Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">The majority conclude that this action raises only facial claims. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>a. <em>Pleadings and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">The Tobe plaintiffs expressly pleaded both facial and as applied claims in their petition for writ of mandate. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also submitted factual evidence to support both the as applied and facial claims, including expert declarations and declarations by individual plaintiffs and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">In opposing the writ, the City expressly acknowledged and addressed the Tobe plaintiffs\u2019 as applied claims. Thus, it conceded in its memorandum in opposition to the petition that \u201cthe present case involves a constitutional attack on a municipal ordinance, <em>both as applied and as written, </em>which, inter alia, prohibits camping on public property.\u201d (Italics added.) The City also conceded that \u201cpetitioners contend that the ordinance, <em>as applied to them, </em>abridges their right to travel\u201d and that \u201cpetitioners contend that the Ordinance, <em>as applied </em>to homeless persons, punishes the status and condition of homelessness.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">At the hearing on their petition in the trial court, plaintiffs again expressly argued that the ordinance violated the Eighth Amendment and abridged the right to travel both on its face <em>and as </em>applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court repeatedly acknowledged that the claims included both facial and as applied challenges. Thus it stressed that the \u201cthrust of this case\u201d was the contention that the ordinance \u201cis designed and enacted <em>and implemented </em>as an effort to address a perceived problem by the authorities of the City of Santa Ana that regards the people who have been classified genetically as, quote, \u2018homeless,\u2019 end quote.\u201d (Italics added.) The court expressly observed that the claims based on the right to travel and on the Eighth Amendment involved the <em>\u201capplication </em>of the statute,\u201d and it expressly considered how the ordinance <em>\u201cin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number><em>application </em>. . . has a tendency to impact certain classes of people more than others.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">The trial court properly addressed the vagueness and overbreadth claims solely as facial challenges; they were brought as such. By contrast, however, in rejecting the right to travel and Eighth Amendment claims the court did not indicate that it was limiting itself to a facial analysis or that it was precluded from considering the factual evidence submitted by plaintiffs. Indeed, as the City has repeatedly conceded, the court expressly considered and rejected plaintiffs\u2019 as applied arguments, together with the portions of the evidence that plaintiffs brought to its attention in support of those arguments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The City did not submit evidence or attempt to dispute or rebut the evidence submitted by plaintiffs, much of it derived from the City\u2019s own records. At oral argument before this court the City conceded that it was not precluded in the trial court from presenting evidence or disputing the declarations submitted by plaintiffs; it had the opportunity to present and rebut evidence but chose not to do so. As the record clearly shows, the City\u2019s strategy was to argue that the ordinance, both facially and as applied, was a valid exercise of its police power. It therefore regarded the evidence submitted by plaintiffs as essentially irrelevant. I have no trouble concluding that the City\u2019s strategy in this regard resulted in a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">In its order directing issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate, the trial court ruled that <em>\u201cenforcement </em>of Santa Ana Ordinance NS-2160 . . . does not violate the rights of <em>homeless persons </em>to freedom of movement. . . . The Court further finds that petitioners\u2019 challenges to the constitutionality of the remaining portions of Santa Ana Ordinance NS-2160 are without merit. The Court finds that with the exception of the second clause of Santa Ana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Municipal Code \u00a7 10-401(a), Santa Ana Ordinance NS-2160 is constitutionally valid.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Nothing quoted in the order demonstrates that the trial court intended to, or did, address only the facial claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the contrary, the order appears on its face to reject both facial <em>and </em>as applied claims: the court expressly and specifically refers to \u201cenforcement\u201d of the ordinance and to its constitutionality vis-\u00e1-vis the \u201crights of homeless persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The majority nonetheless conclude\u2014despite the order, the transcript of the hearing, and the concessions of the parties\u2014that no as applied challenge to the ordinance was \u201cperfected.\u201d But they point to no deficiency in the pleadings. Instead, they merely note that \u201cplaintiffs never identified the particular applications of the law to be enjoined,\u201d and the \u201conly relief sought in the petition is a writ of mandate enjoining <em>any </em>enforcement of the ordinance by respondents.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 1086-1087.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The City made no objection on that ground, nor is there any indication in the record that the trial court declined to address the as applied claims on that basis. Certainly, had the trial court found merit in the as applied claims, it could readily have fashioned appropriate relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>b. <em>Justiciability and Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Plaintiffs include persons who have been cited under the ordinance and who, because they are homeless, are likely to be cited again. They thus have a direct personal stake in the outcome of this action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">In addition, plaintiffs address their as applied claims broadly to the unlawful implementation of the ordinance against <em>all </em>homeless persons. Plaintiffs thus have sufficient interest as citizens of Santa Ana, under our \u201cpublic right/public duty\u201d doctrine, to bring claims on behalf of other homeless persons who have, as a group, been targeted by the ordinance. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 144-145 [172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256]; <em>Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 439 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>111 </em>P.2d 610].) The case \u201cposes a question which is of broad public interest, is likely to recur, and should receive uniform resolution throughout the state.\u201d <em>(Ramirez </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 199, 203 [107 Cal.Rptr. 137, 507 P.2d 1345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Our courts have repeatedly applied the \u201cpublic right/public duty\u201d exception to the general rule that ordinarily a writ of mandate will issue only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>persons who are \u201cbeneficially interested.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) Thus in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 126, recipients of welfare benefits petitioned for writ of mandate challenging the compliance of a regulation with the Social Security Act. We held that \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhere the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the relator need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, since it is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in question enforced . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 144; accord, <em>Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 439.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Furthermore, plaintiffs show a sufficient beneficial interest as citizens who seek to restrain the illegal expenditure or waste of city funds to implement an ordinance in an unconstitutional manner. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a; <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 267-269 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206] [an action to restrain county or city officials from continuing to enforce provisions of an unconstitutional law presents a true case or controversy, regardless of whether the plaintiff and the defendant each have a special, personal interest in the outcome of the action]; <em>Van Atta </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 424, 450, fn. 28 [166 Cal.Rptr. 149, 613 P.2d 210] [an action that \u201cmeets the criteria of section 526a satisfies case or controversy requirements\u201d]; <em>Ames </em>v. <em>City of Hermosa Beach </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 146,150 [93 CaLRptr. 786].) As we have emphasized, \u201cit has never been the rule in this state that parties in [taxpayer suits] must have a personal interest in the litigation. . . . \u2018[N]o showing of special damage to the particular taxpayer has been held necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 269-270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">Because the City has used, and continues to use, taxpayer funds to cite and prosecute persons who store belongings or sleep in public places in violation of an ordinance challenged as unconstitutional, these citizen-plaintiffs have a sufficient interest to confer standing. Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 as applied claims challenging the implementation of the ordinance against homeless persons present \u201ca true case or controversy.\u201d <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess, supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">The majority also conclude that an as applied claim challenging a criminal statute is justiciable only after \u201cthe circumstances of its application have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>been established by conviction or otherwise.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1085.) But in analogous cases we have not required conviction as a prerequisite to standing. Thus in <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 286 [124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44], we concluded that the defendants, members of a particular union, could obtain discovery to determine whether various penal statutes were being discriminatorily enforced against them in violation of equal protection. The defendants had been charged with, but not yet convicted of, violations of the statutes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 291, fn. 2.) Indeed, we implicitly acknowledged that the defense of discriminatory enforcement did not reach the question of guilt or innocence: \u201cBecause the particular defendant, unlike similarly situated individuals, suffers prosecution simply as the subject of invidious discrimination, such defendant is very much the direct victim of the discriminatory enforcement practice. Under these circumstances, discriminatory prosecution becomes a compelling ground for dismissal of the criminal charge* since prosecution would not have been pursued except for the discriminatory design of the prosecuting authorities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">The majority also plainly imply that an as applied challenge must necessarily be restricted to a case-by-case showing by each individual who is convicted under the ordinance that he or she was \u201ctruly homeless\u201d and that the ordinance was improperly applied in each case. Such a requirement\u2014 which is tantamount to requiring an individual trial of a \u201cnecessity\u201d defense for each person cited under the ordinance\u2014is unwarranted. (See, e.g., <em>Ramirez </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 199 [holding that challenged provisions were unconstitutional as applied to all ex-felons]; <em>Van Atta </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 433, 452-453 [holding that San Francisco\u2019s manner of applying statutes for pretrial release of criminal defendants violated due process].) It would needlessly subject large numbers of homeless persons to the criminal justice system for wholly innocuous conduct and overwhelm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>our already strained judicial resources, while effectively insulating the ordinance from meaningful review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">Significantly, federal courts recently addressing similar challenges to \u201canti-camping\u201d measures have consistently done so by examining ordinances as applied to the homeless in general, <em>not </em>on a case-by-case basis, and have not required conviction to establish standing. (See <em>Pottinger </em>v. <em>City of Miami, supra, </em>810 F.Supp. at p. 1554 [challenging manner in which city \u201capplies these laws to homeless individuals\u201d]; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>846 F.Supp. at p. 846 [challenging ordinance \u201conly insofar as it specifically penalizes certain \u2018life sustaining activities\u2019 engaged in by the homeless\u201d]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Dallas </em>(N.D.Tex. 1994) 860 F.Supp. 344, 346 [addressing constitutionality of city ordinances \u201cenacted, enforced, or both, allegedly to remove homeless persons from public view\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">In sum, there is ample authority to conclude that these plaintiffs have standing and state justiciable claims, both facial and as applied. Most of the plaintiffs have been cited and fined for violations of the ordinance, and most are taxpayers. Moreover, because Santa Ana has effectively criminalized sleeping and storing personal property in any public places, plaintiffs and other homeless persons in Santa Ana\u2014who have no legal alternative but to sleep and store personal property in public short of leaving the city altogether\u2014will necessarily be subject to future citation and/or arrest. The as applied claims are therefore properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">II. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">In my view the ordinance violates equal protection under the rule of our decision in <em>Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 861, because it intentionally discriminates against homeless persons who have no alternative but to sleep and store their property in public areas of the City.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>a. <em>Scope of Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">As amici curiae for the City concede, \u201cNeither we nor the Court can or should avoid that [sz'c] this case involves questions about the homeless, although the text of the Ordinance is neutral and does not single out the homeless in any manner.\" Although I believe we can construe the ordinance both facially and as applied, in either case we must look beyond the neutral face of the measure to its underlying purpose and its impact on particular groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">There is ample precedent for doing so. In <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 628 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 611-612, 89 S.Ct. 1322], the Supreme Court examined the legislative history of the statutes there challenged and found \u201cweighty evidence that exclusion from the jurisdiction of the poor who need or may need relief was the specific object of these provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">In <em>Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 861, we addressed a challenge to a facially neutral ordinance enacted by the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea that was similarly aimed at \u201can extraordinary influx of undesirable and unsanitary visitors to the City, sometimes known as \u2018hippies.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 863.) We determined that despite the neutral terms of the ordinance, we were required to look beyond its literal language to determine its purpose. We stressed that \u201c \u2018[a] state enactment cannot be construed for purposes of constitutional analysis without concern for its immediate objective [citations] and for its ultimate effect [citations].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">Among other precedents, we cited Justice Stephen J. Field\u2019s perceptive opinion in <em>Ho Ah Kow </em>v. <em>Nunan </em>(D.Cal. 1879) 12 F. Cas. 252 (No. 6,546), which invalidated a facially neutral San Francisco ordinance requiring every male entering the county jail to have his hair cut to a uniform length of one inch. Under the ordinance a Chinese man convicted of a misdemeanor violation was subjected to loss of his traditional queue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">Justice Field based his ruling on a conclusion that the purpose and effect of the ordinance\u2014although not expressed on the face of the provision\u2014was</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>to punish the then racially unpopular Chinese: \u201cThe class character of this legislation is none the less manifest because of the general terms in which it is expressed.\u201d <em>(Ho Ah Row </em>v. <em>Nunan, supra, </em>12 F. Cas. at p. 255.) He referred to statements of supervisors in debate on the passage of the ordinance for the purpose of ascertaining the \u201cgeneral object of the legislation proposed, and the mischiefs sought to be remedied.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>He added, \u201cWhen we take our seats on the bench we are not struck with blindness, and forbidden to know as judges what we see as men; and where an ordinance, though general in its terms, only operates upon a special race, sect or class, it being universally understood that it is to be enforced only against that race, sect or class, we may justly conclude that it was the intention of the body adopting it that it should only have such operation, and treat it accordingly.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Guided by Justice Field, we declined in <em>Parr </em>to \u201cblind ourselves to official pronouncements of hostile and discriminatory purpose solely because the ordinance employs facially neutral language.\u201d (3 Cal.3d at p. 865.) We examined the purpose expressed by the Carmel City Council in enacting the measure and concluded that \u201c[t]he irrefragable implication is that the Carmel City Council sought, through Municipal Code section 697.02, to rid the city of die blight it perceived to be created by the presence of the hippies.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">In construing the Carmel ordinance we also examined its probable impact: \u201cThose officials responsible for the enforcement of the law are put on notice that the public property in the city is in imminent danger because of the influx of a particular class against which the ordinance is unmistakably directed. The inevitable effect must be discriminatory enforcement consistent with the discriminatory purpose expressed by the council. . . .\u201d <em>(Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 868.) On these grounds we held that the ordinance violated equal protection by stigmatizing a particular group. In the present case as well, we are obligated to look behind the neutral facade of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">b. <em>Purpose and Effect of the Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">As in <em>Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 861, although the ordinance is neutral on its face we need not go far afield to determine the purpose that the City sought to achieve. Over the past four years, Santa Ana has engaged in what the Court of Appeal aptly called a \u201ccrusade against the homeless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">In a memorandum titled \u201cVagrants,\u201d dated June 16, 1988, the City\u2019s executive director of the recreation and community services agency informed the City Park Superintendent: \u201cA task force has been formed in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>effort to deal with the vagrants. The City Council has developed a policy that the vagrants are no longer welcome in the City of Santa Ana. ... In essence, the mission of this program will be to move all vagrants and their paraphernalia out of Santa Ana by continually removing them from the places that they are frequenting in the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">The City\u2019s vagrancy task force developed and implemented a plan that included discouraging food providers\u2014such as the Orange County Rescue Mission and the Salvation Army\u2014from feeding the homeless, turning on sprinklers in public parks, and confiscating and destroying the personal property of homeless residents. After a legal challenge to that plan the City agreed to a settlement in April 1990 that included posting maintenance hours, ceasing to conduct maintenance \u201csweeps\u201d in public areas, and providing for storage and retrieval of confiscated property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">Only a few months later, however, in August 1990, the Santa Ana police mounted \u201cOperation Civic Center,\u201d described in an internal memorandum as follows: \u201cEddie West Field [an open-air football stadium adjacent to the Civic Center] was used as the command post because it supplied a secured area where we could house multiple arrestees. In addition, it also allowed access to restroom facilities and water for the persons arrested. Four Police Service Officers were assigned to the command post to process all arrestees. This included photographing, fingerprinting, documentation and running record and warrant checks. Two officers were also assigned to the command post for care and custody of the arrestees. Five 2-man observer teams were assigned throughout the plaza area looking for criminal activity. Each of the five 2-man teams was completely concealed and was able to observe the violations from a safe and secure location. Five 2-man arrest teams were called, into the plaza area by the observers and the arrest teams took the violators into custody. The violators were then transported to the command post at Eddie West Field where they were processed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">There were 28 arrests for littering, 2 for drinking in public, 7 for urinating in public, 18 for jaywalking, 2 for destroying vegetation, 2 for riding bicycles on a sidewalk, 1 for glue sniffing, 1 for removing trash from a bin, and 2 for an obscure violation of the City\u2019s fire code. Two persons who proved they had homes were released. The homeless arrestees were handcuffed, transported to an athletic field for booking, chained to benches for up to six hours, and identified with numbers written on their arms with markers. At the conclusion of the detention, the police loaded the homeless into vans, drove them to the edge of the Central Command Area of the Santa Ana Police Department, and dropped them off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">The homeless brought a further civil action against the City for injunctive relief, asserting they were victims of discriminatory law enforcement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>trial court agreed, ruling that the homeless were a cognizable class who had been singled out for arrest for offenses that rarely, if ever, even drew citations in Santa Ana. The trial court concluded: \u201cIn short, this Court finds that the Santa Ana Police Department deliberately and intentionally implemented a program which targeted those persons living in the Civic Center, the homeless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">In October 1990 the City apparently settled the action. It agreed that \u201cit shall be [] the policy of [the City of Santa Ana] to refrain from discriminating against individuals on the basis of their homelessness\u201d and it shall not \u201ctake individual or concerted action to drive homeless individuals from Santa Ana.\u201d The stipulation was made an order of the court, but no judgment has been entered. The case is to be dismissed during this year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The ordinance before us reflects the same purpose as Santa Ana\u2019s previous official policies: to drive \u201cvagrants\u201d out of Santa Ana. There can be no doubt that it was enacted to resolve what the City refers to in its brief as \u201cthe homeless problem.\u201d As that brief explains: \u201cThe City is directly impacted by the homeless problem because homeless persons attempt to live on property it owns or controls, thereby causing the myriad of public health and police related concerns which the City must combat in the face of constantly diminishing financial resources.\u201d The City again expressly conceded at oral argument that the purpose of the ordinance was to address the problem of homeless persons \u201ccamping\u201d in public areas, including the parking lot across from city hall.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Even if the City had not so candidly admitted its purpose, however, the inevitable effect of the ordinance is to target the homeless. Because there are beds in local shelters for only about one in ten homeless persons in Santa Ana, an ordinance outlawing \u201ccamping\u201d in all public areas effectively accomplishes the purpose of driving out the homeless, despite its neutral wording. Although the City and amici curiae observe that the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>would also apply to the mayor and the Girl Scouts, it is unlikely that any significant number of Santa Ana residents or visitors other than the homeless would choose to sleep, protected only by a blanket, in a public parking lot or to store personal property in the open.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">We concluded in <em>Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at page 870, that \u201cwe cannot be oblivious to the transparent, indeed the avowed, purpose and the inevitable effect of the ordinance in question: to discriminate against an ill-defined social caste whose members are deemed pariahs by the city fathers. This court has been consistently vigilant to protect racial groups from the effects of official prejudice, and we can be no less concerned because the human beings currently in disfavor are identifiable by dress and attitudes rather than by color.\u201d That vigilance is even more important now. Today\u2019s pariahs are no longer the relatively carefree \u201chippies,\u201d many of whom chose that lifestyle, but persons who are homeless largely by necessity and who face far greater restrictions under this ordinance than merely keeping off the grass.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">A century ago Anatole France exposed the cruel hypocrisy of such \u201cneutral\u201d laws against the indigent: \u201cThe law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\u201d (France, Le Lys Rouge (1894) ch. 7.) Even under a facial analysis we cannot blind ourselves to the evident intent of the Santa Ana ordinance. Recognizing that intent, I would hold that the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>impermissibly discriminates against the homeless and thereby violates equal protection.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">III. <em>Right to Travel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">The ordinance also impermissibly penalizes the fundamental right of indigent homeless persons to travel to or remain in Santa Ana, by denying them the basic necessities of sleeping and storing personal belongings in any public areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">a. <em>Constitutional Freedom to Travel and Abide</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">Both the United States Supreme Court and the courts of California have expressly recognized a fundamental constitutional right to travel, \u201ca basic human right protected by the United States and California Constitutions as a whole.\u201d <em>(In re White </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 141, 148 [158 Cal.Rptr. 562]; see, e.g., <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 629 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 612].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A law implicates the right to travel when it either penalizes travel or is intended to impede travel. <em>(Attorney General of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Soto-Lopez, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 903 [90 L.Ed.2d pp. 905-906] [\u201cA state law implicates the right to travel when it actually deters such travel [citations], when impeding travel is its primary objective [citations], or when it \u2018 \u201cuses any classification which serves to penalize the exercise of that right.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected statutes designed to exclude the indigent. Thus in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 160, 174 [86 L.Ed. 119, 125-126, 62 S.Ct. 164], the court struck down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>a California statute that prohibited the transportation of indigent nonresidents into California. The court explained that a community may not \u201cgain a momentary respite from the pressure of events by the simple expedient of shutting its gates to the outside world.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 173 [86 L.Ed. at p. 125].) Similarly, in <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at page 629 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 612], the court held that the right to travel was triggered by any attempt to \u201cfence out\u201d indigents. (See also <em>Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra, </em>415 U.S. 250 [indigents\u2019 right to travel and settle in Arizona was impermissibly penalized by durational residency requirements for nonemergency medical care for indigents at county expense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The right to travel includes the right to <em>stay </em>as well as the right to go. (See, e.g., <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 116, 126 [2 L.Ed.2d 1204, 1210, 78 S.Ct. 1113] [\u201cFreedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values.\u201d]; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 330, 338 [31 L.Ed.2d 274, 281-282, 92 S.Ct. 995] [right to travel ensures \u201cfreedom to enter <em>and abide\u201d], </em>italics added; <em>Attorney General of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Soto-Lopez, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 903 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 905-906] [right encompasses burdens on freedom to enter and abide in states]; <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 156 [31 L.Ed.2d 110, 92 S.Ct. 839] [vagrancy ordinance offends freedom of movement].)

In California we have expressly recognized that the constitutional right to freedom of movement necessarily embraces intrastate travel. \u201c[T]he right to intrastate travel (which includes intramunicipal travel) is a basic human right protected by the United States and California Constitutions.\u201d <em>(In re White, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 148; see also <em>In re Marriage of Fingert </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1575, 1581 [271 Cal.Rptr. 389] [court order requiring parent to relocate or lose custody violates right to intrastate travel]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bauer, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at p. 944 [requiring defendant to obtain official approval of choice of residence as a condition of probation impinges on right to intrastate travel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">The right to intrastate travel in this state is protected without regard to federal decisions on the issue, because the rights guaranteed by the California Constitution \u201c \u2018are not dependent upon those guaranteed by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re White, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 148.) Nonetheless, I would approve the holding in <em>White, </em>concluding that the United States Constitution ensures the right to intrastate, as well as interstate, travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court has not expressly addressed the right to intrastate travel, it has strongly suggested that such a broad reading of the right to travel is appropriate. Thus in <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352, 358 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909-910, 103 S.Ct. 1855], the court emphasized that a law prohibiting wandering the streets at night without identification implicated \u201cconsideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement.\u201d (See also <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>405 U.S. at p. 164 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 116-117] [\u201c \u2018wandering or strolling\u2019 \u201d are \u201chistorically part of the amenities of life as we have known them\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">The Circuit Courts of Appeal have repeatedly concluded that the right encompasses intrastate travel. (See, e.g., <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Casavilla </em>(2d Cir. 1990) 903 F.2d 171,174; <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>City of York, PA. </em>(3d Cir. 1990) 899 F.2d 255, 268 [\u201cthe right to move freely about one\u2019s neighborhood or town ... is indeed \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 and \u2018deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history\u2019 \u201d]; <em>King </em>v. <em>New Rochelle Municipal Housing Authority </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 442 F.2d 646, 648-649 [right to travel includes intrastate travel].) As the Second Circuit recognized in <em>King, </em>\u201cIt would be me\u00e1ningless to describe the right to travel <em>between </em>states as a fundamental precept of personal liberty and not acknowledge a correlative constitutional right to travel <em>within </em>a state.\u201d (442 F.2d at p. 648, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">c. <em>Impact of the Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">The majority conclud\u00e9 that the ordinance does not inevitably conflict with the right to travel because it \u201chas no impact, incidental or otherwise, on the right to travel <em>except </em>insofar as a person, homeless or not, might be discouraged from traveling to Santa Ana because camping on public property is banned.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1102, italics added.) But homeless persons are not simply \u201cdiscouraged\u201d from traveling to Santa Ana. They are effectively <em>prevented </em>from doing so, because the ordinance forbids them to sleep or store their personal belongings in any public area in the City. By criminalizing their unavoidable but innocuous conduct of sleeping and storing their personal effects, the ordinance has an immediate impact on the right of the homeless to enter or remain in Santa Ana.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">I therefore disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the effect of the ordinance on the homeless is merely \u201cincidental.\u201d Criminalizing the harmless act of sleeping in a public place\u2014when the vast majority of homeless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>persons in Santa Ana have no legal alternative other than to \u201cget out of town by sundown\u201d\u2014forbids a \u201cnecessity of life\u201d and thereby effectively penalizes migration. (See <em>Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra, </em>415 U.S. at pp. 258-259 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 314-316] [laws penalize travel when they deny a person a \u201cnecessity of life\u201d such as nonemergency medical care for indigents at the county\u2019s expense].) Arresting or citing the homeless for sleeping in public also burdens their freedom of movement, because they must either forgo sleep or leave the City altogether to avoid criminal penalty. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary purpose for enforcing the ordinance against the homeless was to drive them out of public areas.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">The indirect effects of the ordinance may prove even more invidious. As one amicus curiae, a former mayor, points out, ordinances like Santa Ana\u2019s encourage an unhealthy and ultimately futile competition among cities to impose comparable restrictions in order to avoid becoming a refuge for homeless persons driven out by other cities. The case at bar provides a striking example of this domino effect: in response to the Santa Ana ordinance, surrounding communities quickly enacted similar measures to protect themselves from an influx of Santa Ana\u2019s homeless.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To carry this effect to its logical conclusion, if all communities followed suit the homeless could effectively be excluded from the entire State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">In striking down a California law that aimed to exclude the indigent of an earlier era, the Supreme Court observed: \u201cin the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo: \u2018The Constitution was framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less parochial in range. It was framed upon the theory that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] ...[I]n not inconsiderable measure the relief of the needy has become the common responsibility and concern of the whole nation.\u201d <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>314 U.S. at pp. 173-174 [86 L.Ed.2d 124].) The same principle requires us to invalidate the Santa Ana ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">d. <em>Strict Scrutiny</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Because the ordinance impairs the right to travel of plaintiffs and other homeless persons, it is subject to strict scrutiny. (See <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, supra, </em>405 U.S. at pp. 339-342 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 282-284]; <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 634 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 615]; <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 761; <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252, 276, fn. 22 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779, 20 A.L.R.4th 1118].) The applicable test, therefore, is whether the ordinance is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. (See <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 202, 216-217 [72 L.Ed.2d 786, 798-799, 102 S.Ct. 2382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">The ordinance does not survive under that standard. As stated above, its true underlying purpose\u2014to drive the homeless out of Santa Ana\u2014is not a legitimate governmental interest. But even the more benign, if euphemistic, purpose expressed on the face of the ordinance fails under strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">The ordinance provides: \u201cThe public streets and areas within the City [of Santa Ana] should be readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended [sic]. The purpose of this article is to maintain public streets and areas within the city [of Santa Ana] in a clean and accessible condition.\u201d (Ord., \u00a7 10-400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">The interests advanced by the City are, in essence, improving the aesthetic appearance of its public areas and maintaining facilities for general public use. These concerns are legitimate and, indeed, \u201csubstantial.\u201d (See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 288, 296 [82 L.Ed.2d 221, 228-229, 104 S.Ct. 3065] [governmental interest in maintaining park was \u201csubstantial\u201d].) But they are certainly not compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">Even if the City\u2019s asserted purposes were deemed compelling, moreover, the ordinance would nonetheless fail because it is not narrowly tailored to accomplish its objectives. Santa Ana could certainly maintain public areas in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>\u201ca clean and accessible condition\u201d through less restrictive means than citing and arresting homeless persons\u2014under a provision that includes a penalty of six months in jail\u2014for sleeping or storing their personal belongings in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">As a federal court explained in holding a similar ordinance unconstitutional: \u201cProvision of alternative shelter and services would be the ideal means of accomplishing the same goals. However, in the absence of available shelter space or funds for services, the parks and streets could be cleaned and maintained without arresting the homeless. For example, the City could ask homeless individuals to relocate temporarily to another public area while maintenance crews work on a particular site. It could also establish regular times for each park to be cleaned so that homeless individuals would know not to be in a certain park on a particular day. Instead of arresting homeless individuals for being in the park after hours, the City could allow them to stay in a designated area in exchange for maintaining that area. Similarly, promotion of tourism and business and the development of the downtown area could be accomplished without arresting the homeless for inoffensive conduct.\u201d <em>(Pottinger </em>v. <em>City of Miami, supra, </em>810 F.Supp. at p. 1582; see also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, supra, </em>468 U.S. 288 [ban on sleeping in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on expression]; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>846 F.Supp. 843 [prohibition against sleeping in certain public places at certain times].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">The majority urge that the City has no affirmative constitutional obligation to provide accommodations for the \u201ctransient homeless\u201d on or in public property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That does not mean, however, that if the City declines to provide shelters for the homeless it may effectively banish them from all public areas. As long as the homeless have no other place where they may legally sleep and store their personal property in Santa Ana, the City cannot constitutionally prevent them from doing so in public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">The majority cite with approval a recent district court decision denying preliminary injunctive relief against implementation of the Matrix Program, a San Francisco ordinance addressing the \u201chomeless problem.\u201d <em>(Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>846 F.Supp. 843.) Their reliance on <em>Joyce </em>is misplaced because the ordinances are crucially dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>Unlike Santa Ana\u2019s ordinance, the Matrix Program did not involve a total ban on sleeping or storing property in public areas. Indeed, San Francisco police officers were instructed that \u201c \u2018[t]he mere lying or sleeping on or in a bedroll in and of itself does not constitute a violation\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>([Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>846 F.Supp. at p. 861.) Nor did San Francisco attempt to drive the homeless from the city; instead, it provided counseling and referral to local social service programs and attempted to provide temporary housing for the homeless. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 847-848.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The history of Santa Ana\u2019s efforts in dealing with the homeless, in sharp contrast, included an official policy of actively <em>discouraging </em>existing charitable services for the homeless, including the Salvation Army food program, and a task force directed to drive \u201cvagrants\u201d out of town. In enforcing the ordinance, Santa Ana police officers applied an official policy of citing individuals who were sleeping under blankets.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">The City is not required, of course, to open <em>all </em>its public spaces at <em>all </em>hours to the homeless or to tolerate dangerous or unhealthful conduct. For example, it may enforce existing ordinances against such \u201ccamping\u201d behavior as the erection of semipermanent structures, outdoor cooking, and public defecation and urination. It may also enforce existing laws against public drunkenness, drug use, vandalism, assault, theft, and similar misconduct. It may not, however, penalize individuals who have committed only the offense of being without shelter. Sleeping outdoors under a blanket is neither dangerous nor unhealthful to anyone other than the homeless persons who do so as a matter of necessity. Similarly, if the City does not choose to provide storage places for the personal property of the homeless, it may not criminalize their discreet \u201cstorage\u201d of personal belongings in public areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>As the Court of Appeal aptly concluded, \u201cThe camping ordinance is a butcher knife where a scalpel is required. . . . The city may preclude the erection of structures in public places and it might ban \u2018camping\u2019 in select locations with a properly drafted ordinance, but it may not preclude people who have no place to go from simply living in Santa Ana. And that is what this ordinance is all about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">For all these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1148-9\"> Because I believe the ordinance is invalid on these grounds, I find it unnecessary to reach the issue whether the ordinance also punishes the homeless on the basis of their status in violation of the Eighth Amendment or article I, section 17, of the California Constitution. (But see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660, 665-667 [8 L.Ed.2d 758, 762-763, 82 S.Ct. 1417]; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 514, 551 [20 L.Ed.2d 1254, 1278, 88 S.Ct. 2145] (conc. opn. of White, J.); <em>id. </em>at pp. 567, 570 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1286-1287, 1288] (dis. opn. of Portas, J.); <em>Pottinger </em>v. <em>City of Miami </em>(S.D.Fla. 1992) 810 F.Supp. 1551, 1561-1565 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>[city\u2019s practice of arresting homeless persons for such activities as sleeping, standing, and congregating in public places violated the Eighth Amendment].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1149-9\"> Thus the petition alleged that the City had a \u201ccustom, practice, and policy of harassing, arresting, and otherwise interfering with petitioners and other homeless individuals for engaging in ordinary and essential activities of daily life in the public areas where petitioners are forced to live.\u201d Plaintiffs specifically pleaded, inter alia, that respondents \u201cabused their discretion in enacting and <em>selectively enforcing Ordinance NS-2160 against homeless persons </em>in violation of their right to equal protection in that the ordinance abridges the fundamental right of the homeless to travel and to freedom of movement.\u201d (Italics added.) The petition expressly challenged particular applications of the ordinance, including the practice of arresting homeless persons for sleeping and possessing property in public areas. In their prayer for relief plaintiffs requested issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the City to refrain from enforcing the ordinance, i.e., the equivalent of an injunction against <em>future application </em>of the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1149-10\"> Thus counsel for plaintiffs argued: \u201cIf the court were to conclude that the Ordinance on its face does not abridge the right to travel then I would submit to the court by way of our declarations and exhibits. . . that in fact <em>as applied </em>this ordinance abridges the right to travel of petitioners and homeless residents of the City of Santa Ana.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1150-7\"> Again, during oral argument before this court the City was pressed on the question whether plaintiffs raised as applied claims; it candidly admitted that plaintiffs challenged the ordinance both facially and as applied and that the Court of Appeal properly addressed the as applied claims. In supplemental briefing, the City once more conceded that plaintiffs raised both facial and as applied claims in the writ petition, that both parties addressed facial and as applied claims in their memoranda, and that they \u201cargued <em>both aspects </em>of the right to travel/equal protection issue\u201d at the hearing in the trial court. (Italics added.) As the City also conceded: \u201cIt is clear from a review of the reporter\u2019s transcript of the April 8, 1993 hearing that Judge Smith upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, <em>both as written and as applied. </em>In rejecting appellants\u2019 .\u2018as applied\u2019 attack, Judge Smith rejected appellants\u2019 supporting evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) These frank concessions by the City, which it documented with specific citations to the record, squarely refute the majority\u2019s conclusions that the allegations of the petition did not clearly state an as applied challenge and that the trial court did not rule on the petition as one encompassing an as applied challenge. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1087.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1151-7\"> The majority purport to rely only on the \u201cactual judgment of the court\u201d and not on the concessions of parties and the reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing on the writ. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1087.) The judgment, however, does not refer to the grounds of the ruling. It provides in its entirety: \u201cIt Is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that: [\u00b6] 1. Judgment is entered for petitioners granting the Peremptory Writ of Mandate. [\u00b6] 2. The Court reserves jurisdiction over the issues of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Any motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs shall be filed in this Department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1151-8\"> Although the majority observe that \u201cthe petition alleges in conclusory language that a pattern of unconstitutionally impermissible enforcement of the ordinance existed\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1086), there can be no doubt that under California\u2019s liberal pleading rules the petition was adequately pleaded: it gave notice of the claims and clearly alleged a pattern of constitutionally impermissible enforcement. The undisputed declarations in support of the petition show with specificity that the ordinance was repeatedly enforced against persons who were homeless. The prayer seeks relief as follows: \u201cThat a peremptory writ of mandate issue pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 compelling respondents to refrain from enforcement of Santa Ana Municipal Code Section NS02160 . . . [S]uch other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\u201d The majority fail to identify any requirement of the Code of Civil Procedure or local rules that plaintiffs further delineate the relief sought on their as applied claims. Indeed, it is a rule of long standing that when an answer is filed a court may grant any relief consistent with the issues raised. (See, e.g., <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 349, 367-368 [342 P.2d 447].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1151-9\"> For example, the court could have required that the City enforce the provisions of the ordinance prohibiting sleeping or storing personal property only against those persons who are <em>not </em>homeless. An ordinance that prevented only those <em>with </em>homes from \u201ccamping\u201d in public areas might be constitutional; it would, of course, be of limited practical utility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1152-7\"> The majority question whether plaintiffs are \u201ctruly\u201d\u2014or even sufficiently\u2014homeless, concluding that the declarations they submitted did not establish that the conduct for which they were cited was \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d I am satisfied that the undisputed sworn statements of plaintiffs and others cited under the ordinance that they lack the present means to house themselves are sufficient to establish standing and to demonstrate a pattern of enforcement of the ordinance against homeless persons. We need not inquire into the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of all the acts or decisions that might have led to their current plight. As many of the briefs and expert submissions point out, the question whether the homeless, particularly the large proportion of homeless who are mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol, are \u201cvoluntarily\u201d living in the streets is complex. Even when services or welfare benefits are available, it may be beyond the resources of many homeless persons to avail themselves of such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">In any event, in light of the shortage of services and beds for the homeless, including the mentally ill and unaccompanied children, the question of \u201cvoluntariness\u201d is almost academic. The undisputed fact is that Santa Ana has only 332 beds for a population of approximately 3,000 homeless. The vast majority of homeless in Santa Ana do not have the alternative of sleeping in a bed, off the streets.

In <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 846 F.Supp. 843, 853, the district court expressly rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that a claim under the Eighth Amendment could be made only by a party convicted of a criminal offense. As <em>Joyce </em>emphasized, that proposition was refuted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 651, 666-668 [51 L.Ed.2d 711, 726-728, 97 S.Ct. 1401], which expressly provided that in addition to proscribing certain types of punishments to those convicted of crimes, the amendment \u201cimposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal.\u201d Like <em>Joyce, </em>this case alleges discrimination on the basis of the status of homelessness\u2014i.e., it challenges the ordinance under the substantive provisions of the Eighth Amendment. Moreover, \u201cfines . . . traditionally have been associated with the criminal process\u201d and subjected to the limitations imposed by the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>430 U.S. at p. 664 [51 L.Ed.2d at pp. 725-726].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1155-8\"> We have recognized that mandamus review is appropriate where, as here, important issues would be effectively removed from judicial review if standing is not conferred.

In this case, similarly, the targets of the ordinance are unlikely to have the financial resources to test the City\u2019s authority on a case-by-case basis. Because the City may cite, arrest, and detain homeless residents repeatedly without \u201cactually convicting\u201d them in a full-blown judicial proceeding, even under the majority\u2019s construction it would be justiciable as an issue \u201cevading review.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1155-9\"> The majority incorrectly assert that plaintiffs did not pursue an equal protection theory.

They nonetheless note that a deputy district attorney \u201cexpressed his opinion at oral argument\u201d that a necessity defense \u201cmight\u201d be available to \u201ctruly homeless\u201d persons. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1088 fn. 8.) Because of that \u201copinion\u201d the majority refuse to conclude that the City intends to enforce the ordinance against persons who have no alternative to \u201ccamping\u201d or storing \u201ccamp paraphernalia\u201d on public property. Nothing in the ordinance provides an exception for homeless persons, however, and the district attorney\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d does not purport to bind the City or even to express the <em>City\u2019s </em>intent in implementing the ordinance. Moreover, even if a necessity defense were available, it would not prevent the City from repeatedly citing and arresting homeless persons and subjecting them to an endless round of costly and complex judicial proceedings. Thus the effect of the ordinance would continue to be to drive the homeless from Santa Ana, as it is clearly intended to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1160-6\"> (See Waldron, <em>Homelessness &amp; the Issue of Freedom </em>(1991) 39 UCLA L.Rev. 295, 313 [Anticamping ordinances \u201chave and are known and even intended to have a specific effect on the homeless which is different from the effect they have on the rest of us. . . .

But their discussion of <em>Parr </em>is merely dictum, because they decline to acknowledge or address the equal protection claims on the merits. It is also unpersuasive. The Carmel ordinance made it unlawful to \u201c[c]limb any tree; or walk, stand or sit upon monuments, vases, fountains, railings, fences, planted areas, or upon any other property <em>not designed or customarily used for such purposes, </em>or to sit on any sidewalks or steps, or to lie or sit on any lawns.\u201d <em>(Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 862, italics added.) Thus, <em>Parr </em>did not turn on the issue of the \u201ccustomary\u201d use of the public areas in Carmel, but, as here, on whether a city could prohibit innocuous behavior for the constitutionally impermissible purpose of driving a disfavored group from its bounds. The majority also argue unpersuasively that we must ignore the obvious purpose of the Santa Ana ordinance because, two years previously, Santa Ana had agreed to discontinue attempts to force the homeless to leave. Their approach permits the City to continue to discriminate against the homeless so long as it does not expressly articulate an impermissible purpose. We have explicitly rejected the notion that the mere appearance of neutrality can be used to shield discriminatory legislation. <em>(Parr, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 870; see also <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 529 [50 Cal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825], affd. <em>sub nom.
