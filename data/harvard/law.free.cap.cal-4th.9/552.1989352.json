Const., art. VI, \u00a7 18, subd. (c) [hereafter section 18(c)]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 919(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The bases for the Commission\u2019s censure recommendation are that, between 1988 and 1992, petitioner engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving (1) inappropriate and offensive comments concerning the physical attributes and clothing of female members of the court staff; (2) inappropriate and offensive remarks concerning the intimate relationships of court attach\u00e9s or attorneys with their spouses; and (3) other inappropriate and offensive remarks in the presence of court staff. In addition, the Commission found that (4) petitioner singled out women working under his supervision for inappropriate and nonconsensual touching, or attempted touching, although such conduct was \u201cunusual and episodic,\u201d occurred over a lengthy period, was relatively infrequent, and did not constitute a pattern of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The Commission\u2019s report itemizes 18 separate acts of misconduct, involving 9 complaining witnesses. It further found, however, that since 1992 petitioner appears to have ceased this misconduct, that he is a skilled, able, and hardworking judge whose courtroom conduct is beyond reproach, that he has contributed extensively to the legal community, and that he has donated substantial time and effort to the local community as well. Nonetheless, as indicated, the Commission concluded that petitioner\u2019s prior conduct constituted \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute,\u201d for which he should be publicly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>censured. As will appear, we agree with the Commission\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Section 18(c) provides in pertinent part that, \u201cOn recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Performance the Supreme Court may . . . censure or remove a judge for action occurring not more than 6 years prior to the commencement of the judge\u2019s current term that constitutes willful misconduct in office, persistent failure or inability to perform the judge\u2019s duties, habitual intemperance in the use of intoxicants or drugs, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In this review proceeding, we make an independent evaluation of the evidence before the Commission to determine whether the charges against petitioner are supported by clear and convincing evidence. Thereafter, we must determine whether the conduct that is the subject of the proceeding constitutes a basis for censure or removal, and, if so, the appropriate action. (See <em>Mardikian </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 473, 476-477 [220 Cal.Rptr. 833, 709 P.2d 852]; <em>Gubler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 27, 35 [207 Cal.Rptr. 171, 688 P.2d 551]; <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 615, 622 [175 Cal.Rptr. 420, 630 P.2d 954]; <em>Spruance </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 778, 784, fn. 5 [119 Cal.Rptr. 841, 532 P.2d 1209]; <em>Geiler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 270, 275-276 [110 Cal.Rptr. 201, 515 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">As we recently observed, \u201cThe provision that prejudicial conduct [under \u00a7 18(c)] must be that which \u2018brings the judicial office into disrepute\u2019 . . . does \u2018not require notoriety, but only that the conduct be \u201cdamaging to the esteem for the judiciary held by members of the public who observed such conduct.\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Kennick </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 297, 314 [267 Cal.Rptr. 293, 787 P.2d 591, 87 A.L.R.4th 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Petitioner acknowledges that his conduct has damaged public esteem for the judiciary, for his petition for review recites that he \u201cdeeply regrets the dishonor brought to the bench by this matter.\u201d Petitioner nonetheless contests the Commission\u2019s findings. Although he readily admits that his conduct \u201cwarrants appropriate discipline,\u201d he contends that \u201ccensure should not be imposed for acts he did not do . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Rather than file a brief specifically addressing the Commission\u2019s findings and conclusions, petitioner has simply incorporated his earlier objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the similar (but not identical) findings of the special masters appointed by this court pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 907. As a result, many of petitioner\u2019s objections are not pertinent to the Commission\u2019s actual findings, and will not be discussed here. For example, although the petition complains of material in a footnote to the special masters\u2019 report, the Commission\u2019s own \u201cFindings and Conclusions\u201d expressly recite that the Commission did not consider the foregoing material in reaching its conclusions and recommended censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">As will appear, rather than assert errors of law or other irregularities in the proceedings below, petitioner\u2019s objections are directed almost exclusively to the credibility of the various witnesses against him, and accordingly raise matters difficult to reevaluate on the basis of a cold record, (lb) As we have often stated, although we must make an independent evaluation of the record, we nonetheless give special weight to the masters\u2019 findings that reflect their evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses who testified before them. <em>(Kennick </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 314-315; <em>Gubler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 34, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The Commission adopted, with only minor modifications, the report of the special masters appointed by this court. Because this case involves public censure rather than outright removal of a judge, we need not explore in detail the extensive factual matrix underlying each of the Commission\u2019s findings. Instead, we only summarize the gist of petitioner\u2019s misconduct in the four areas specified by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">1. <em>Remarks Concerning Physical Attributes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Commission found that, on several occasions, petitioner made offensive remarks to female court reporters or clerks concerning their buttocks, breasts, or legs. (E.g., petitioner told a court reporter, \u201cYour butt looks good in that dress.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">2. <em>Remarks Concerning Intimate Relationships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The Commission found that, on several occasions, petitioner made offensive remarks to female court attach\u00e9s or attorneys regarding their intimate relationships with their spouses. (E.g., petitioner told another court reporter, after she turned away from his attempt to console her, \u201cI certainly hope you\u2019re not that frigid at home with your husband.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">3. <em>Other Remarks in Presence of Court Staff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">The Commission found that, on several occasions, petitioner made other offensive and crude remarks in the presence of court staff. (E.g., petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>in discussing a janitor, jokingly told a female court reporter that, \u201cThe only thing he\u2019s ever done to me is go down on me a couple of times.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">4. <em>Inappropriate, Nonconsensual Touchings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The Commission found that, on a few isolated occasions, petitioner singled out women working under his supervision for inappropriate and nonconsensual touching, or attempted touching. (E.g., he slapped or patted a court reporter and a court trainee on their buttocks.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Petitioner\u2019s objections to the Commission\u2019s findings in the foregoing four separate areas of misconduct relate to the asserted lack of credibility of the complaining witnesses. Petitioner cites at length the testimony of other court employees stating that no inappropriate remarks or touchings were made in <em>their </em>presence. But such testimony obviously would not necessarily rebut the extensive evidence from numerous complaining witnesses that misconduct deserving of censure indeed occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Petitioner cites further testimony suggesting that the complaining witnesses should be disbelieved because they either (1) had motives to fabricate their testimony, (2) misinterpreted petitioner\u2019s innocent words or deeds, or (3) unduly delayed reporting their complaints about petitioner\u2019s conduct. Again, all such matters were more properly addressed to the special masters in the course of their assessment of the credibility of the complaining witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201cGenerally we give weight to the findings and conclusions of both commission and master. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wenger </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 622.) Because of the difficulties inherent in attempting to pass on the credibility of testimony when only the written record is before us, we give special weight to the special masters\u2019 resolution of fact issues that turn on the credibility of testimony taken in their presence. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 623; <em>Kennick </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 314-315; <em>Geiler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at pp. 275-276.) Additionally, although the Commission heard no testimony, \u201cits own expertise and unanimity . . . suggest that deference be accorded to its inferences and conclusions.\u201d <em>(Wenger </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Our own independent review of the record, coupled with the due deference and special weight we give, respectively, to the findings of the Commission and special masters, affords ample bases for concluding that the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>that petitioner\u2019s conduct is the proper basis for public censure. Petitioner\u2019s misconduct was such as to \u201cbring [] the judicial office into disrepute\u201d (\u00a7 18(c)), being conduct \u201c \u2018 \u201cdamaging to the esteem for the judiciary held by members of the public who observed such conduct.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Kennick </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, supra </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">This opinion will serve as an appropriate censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">On March 2, 1995, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\"> Before Lucas, C.
