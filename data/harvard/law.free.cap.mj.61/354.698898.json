The adjudged sentence included a dishonorable discharge, confinement for a period of fifteen years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction in pay grade to E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">The convening authority approved the sentence, suspended execution of the adjudged forfeitures, and waived execution of automatic forfeitures for a period of six months under Article 58b, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 858b (2000), with provision for payment of the suspended and waived forfeitures to Appel-lee\u2019s wife for the benefit of his wife and son.

The court determined that the error was prejudicial, applying a presumption of prejudice under the circumstances of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 941-42. In addition, the court addressed the issues of factual and legal sufficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 935-36. For the reasons set forth below, we answer the certified and granted issues in the negative, and affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">I. INSTRUCTIONAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">A. THE RULE GOVERNING INSTRUCTIONS WHEN AN ACCUSED DOES NOT TESTIFY AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The <em>Manual for Courts-Martial </em>contains an express rule governing the right of the defense to request or preclude an instruction when the accused does not testify at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A29\">When the accused does not testify at trial, defense counsel may request that the members of the court be instructed to disregard that fact and not to draw any adverse inference from it. Defense counsel may request that the members not be so instructed. Defense counsel\u2019s election shall be binding upon the military judge except that the military judge may give the instruction when the instruction is necessary in the interests of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 301(g), <em>included in Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) (2002 <em>MCM), </em>pt. III. Under the rule, the accused in a court-martial has the absolute right to this protective instruction upon request by defense counsel. If the defense counsel requests that the members not receive such an instruction, that request is \u201cbinding\u201d upon the military judge, subject only to the military judge\u2019s determination that the instruction is \u201cnecessary in the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">M.R.E. 301(g) was promulgated in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978). <em>See </em>2002 <em>MCM </em>Analysis of the Military Rules of Evidence A22-7 [hereinafter Drafter\u2019s Analysis]. The Drafter\u2019s Analysis offers the following observation concerning <em>Lakeside:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">Although the Supreme Court has held that it is not unconstitutional for a judge to instruct a jury over the objection of the accused to disregard the accused\u2019s silence, it has also stated: \u201cIt may be wise for a trial judge not to give such a cautionary instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Drafter\u2019s Analysis at A22-7 (quoting <em>Lakeside, </em>435 U.S. at 340-41, 98 S.Ct. 1091). The Drafter\u2019s Analysis then explains the rationale for including the rule in the <em>MCM:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">Rule 301(g) recognizes that the decision to ask for a cautionary instruction is one of great tactical importance for the defense and generally leaves that decision solely within the hands of the defense. Although the military judge may give the instruction when it is necessary in the interests of justice, the intent of the Committee is to leave the decision in the hands of the defense in all but the most unusual cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Drafter\u2019s Analysis at A22-7. The rule reflects the President\u2019s authority to grant members of the armed forces rights more protective than those required by the Constitution. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>35 M.J. 35, 39 (C.M.A.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">B. PROCEEDINGS AT TRIAL AND ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">At the close of the case on the merits, the military judge conducted a session under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839 (2000), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>discuss proposed instructions with counsel. The military judge stated that he intended to give \u201c[t]he instruction on the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d He then quoted the proposed instruction: \u201cThe accused has an absolute right to remain silent. You are not to draw any inference adverse to the accused.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the proposed instruction, which led to the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afr-dedup-0\">MJ: You object to it? Well, I will have to consider that. That is a standard instruction. Normally it is given and its intent\u2014 my intent is to protect the accused from any adverse feelings by the members. I know it calls attention to it, and that is probably your objection to it. I understand. Do you want to be heard further? ADC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">MJ: Let me think about that one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">After a short recess, the military judge reconvened the Article 89(a) session and returned to the proposed instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">MJ: There were two issues outstanding, one was whether I would give the instruction on the accused\u2019s silence. I feel that that is necessary to give unless the defense has case law to cite for the proposition that I shouldn\u2019t give it even though the defense objects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">ADC: You feel it\u2019s necessary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">MJ: I do feel it\u2019s necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">ADC: We would object to giving them that instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">MJ: Do you have any case law to support the proposition it\u2019s not to be given over defense objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">ADC: No, sir. Other courts have argued in the military \u2014 have objected\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-13\">MJ: No case law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">ADC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">MJ: I just think it\u2019s important to tell the members that so they don\u2019t go back and ask the question about why the accused didn\u2019t testify. That\u2019s my thought \u2014 and also instruct them that they are not to hold that against the accused in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">ADC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">After another brief recess, the military judge noted for the record that the defense had made a request during the recess concerning the sequence of the proposed instruction. The military judge stated that the defense had requested, and he had agreed, to not give the disputed instruction as the last instruction, but instead to give it before instructing the members on findings by exceptions. The trial counsel did not object to the proposed sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-20\">Despite this assurance, the disputed instruction was the last instruction provided to the members by the military judge. When the members then left the courtroom for a brief recess prior to closing arguments, the military judge recognized his misstep regarding the sequence of instructions: \u201cCounsel, I apologize. It was an oversight on my part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-21\">After announcement of the findings, defense counsel moved for a mistrial citing several issues, including the content and timing of the disputed instruction. The military judge denied the motion, adding: \u201cThere was error, my error, that I had agreed to give the accused\u2019s silence instruction other than the last instruction in my substantive instructions. However, I don\u2019t think that that was an error of such a grave nature to warrant the extraordinary remedy of a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">In the Court of Criminal Appeals, Appellee contended that the military judge had erred in giving the failure-to-testify instruction over his objection. The court, in an en bane decision, concluded that the military judge erred, and that the error was prejudicial. <em>Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 942. One judge concluded that the military judge erred in giving instruction over defense objection, but that the error was not prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 943 \u2014 44 (Rit-ter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Another judge concluded that there was no error. <em>Id. </em>at 945-47 (Villemez, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">C. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-24\">1. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-25\">We consider allegations of error involving mandatory instructions under a de novo standard of review. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>50 M.J. 451, 455 (C.A.A.F.1999). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We review issues concerning non-mandatory instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Damatta-Olivera, </em>37 M.J. 474, 478 (C.M.A.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The court below noted that because M.R.E. 301(g) requires a balancing of both mandatory and non-mandatory components, the standard of review should take into account the specific attributes of the rule. <em>Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 939. The court noted that when there is a defense objection to the instruction, a military judge is bound by the defense election unless the judge performs a balancing test that weighs the defense concerns against the case-specific interests of justice. <em>Id. </em>In that context, the court concluded the most appropriate analogy could be found in the standard for reviewing a military judge\u2019s application of the balancing test under M.R.E. 403 (exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time). <em>See Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 939 (citing <em>United States v. Manns, </em>54 M.J. 164, 166 (C.A.A.F.2000)). Applying that standard, the court offered the following approach to the standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">[W]hen a military judge gives a fail-to-testify instruction over defense objection after having identified the case-specific \u201cinterests of justice\u201d that support his decision and articulating his analysis of those interests relative to the defense election, then he should be accorded great deference under a standard of review of abuse of discretion. If he identifies the interests of justice in question but does not articulate his balancing of those interests with the defense election, he is accorded less deference. If he does not identify interests of justice at all, the standard of review is <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 939. The court also observed that a military judge\u2019s decision to override the otherwise binding election of the defense must be based on something more than a generalized \u201cfear that the members would hold the appellant\u2019s silence against him\u201d because \u201csuch a fear could be argued in every case of silence of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939-40. The court then noted that the military judge did not identify the specific interests of justice at stake in the present case. In that context, the court concluded that the decision was subject to de novo review. We agree with the court below that the standard of review for issues under M.R.E. 403 provides an appropriate analogy. We adopt the framework articulated by the court, both in terms of the general approach to the standard of review, and the application of that approach to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">2. <em>Review of military judge\u2019s decision to override the defense election</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The court below reviewed the record and concluded that the military judge did not consider any case-specific interests of justice before overriding the defense election. <em>Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 939. The court concluded: \u201cBased on our review of the record, we find that the only reason the military judge gave the instruction was his fear that the members would hold the appellant\u2019s silence against him, unless specifically instructed not to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">The military judge\u2019s failure to articulate any \u201cinterests of justice,\u201d other than the standard fear of member misuse of the appellant\u2019s silence, indicates that such \u201cinterests of justice\u201d simply did not exist. The standard fear that members might hold an accused\u2019s silence against him has already been accounted for by the President and resolved by giving the election to the defense team, where we think it rightfully belongs. In the words of the Analysis to Mil.R.Evid. 301(g), we do not think that this is one of those \u201cmost unusual cases\u201d that warranted giving the instruction over defense objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The Government\u2019s brief offers a number of theories as to why the military judge might have concluded that his evaluation of the interests of justice should prevail over the defense election in the present case, including the seriousness of the charges of sexual misconduct; the similar factual scenario surrounding each of the charges; the testimony of the alleged victims identifying Appellee as the perpetrator and as the only other witness to the events; and the likelihood that the members would expect rebuttal testimony from a person of his status as married enlisted person with eighteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of service. None of these theories identifies anything unusual that would differentiate this court-martial from other cases involving mid-level noncommissioned officers charged with sexual misconduct in which the defense might prefer not to have the accused\u2019s silence specifically called to the attention of the members. The Government\u2019s brief merely notes factors that, in any particular case, might weigh in defense counsel\u2019s exercise of tactical or strategic judgment about how best to conduct the defense. The President, in Rule for Courts-Martial 310(g) has determined that this decision should be left to the defense except in an unusual case. A generalized fear that the panel will misuse an accused\u2019s silence, by itself, does not provide a basis for concluding that the circumstances of a ease are so unusual as to warrant rejection of a defense objection to the instruction. We have conducted our own de novo review of the record to determine whether there were any unusual circumstances in the present ease so obvious that it was not necessary for the military judge to articulate reasons for providing the instruction over defense objection. We agree with the observations of the court below that such circumstances \u201csimply did not exist\u201d in the specific factual setting of the present case. <em>See Forbes, </em>59 M.J. at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">3. <em>The assessment of prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The court below also addressed the standard for determining when an erroneous decision to override a defense election was prejudicial. The defense, focusing on the impact on the individual\u2019s self-incrimination rights under the Fifth Amendment, suggested that the Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless, while the Government contended that the accused was responsible for demonstrating material prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 940. The court rejected the defense standard because the Supreme Court in <em>Lakeside </em>already had treated the issue as noneonstitutional, and it also rejected the Government\u2019s approach on the grounds that the \u201cplain language of the rule, coupled with the strong language in the Analysis\u201d made it inappropriate to place any burden on Appel-lee to show prejudice from a violation of this uniquely \u201cdefense-friendly\u201d rule. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Taking a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between these positions, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">[W]hen a military judge commits error by giving this instruction over defense objection in the absence of articulated case-specific interests of justice, a presumption of prejudice results. The Government then bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence why the appellant was not prejudiced by the instruction. Admittedly, this may be a difficult burden for the Government to bear. But, this court did not write the Rule, and on the issue of an appropriate test for prejudice, we feel compelled to take our cues from the President\u2019s language that so clearly favors the military accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In deciding that the Government did not carry its burden of rebutting the presumption of prejudice, the court emphasized two considerations. First, with respect to the Government\u2019s reliance on the strength of the prosecution case, the court noted that the prosecution\u2019s evidence, while strong, was not dispositive of the factual and legal issues of guilt. Even in the face of a formidable prosecution case, the members could have found reasonable doubt on one or more of the charges in light of the defense\u2019s twenty-two witnesses, two stipulations of expected testimony, a stipulation of fact, and several other exhibits. The court also pointed out that the defense offered serious and repeated objections to the instruction, then attempted to ensure that it was not the last instruction, and finally moved for a mistrial. The court concluded that these efforts demonstrate that, in the present case, it was \u201cmanifest that, for the defense team, the instruction was a potential show-stopper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">The test for prejudice articulated by the court below represents a well-reasoned approach in light of the specific requirements of M.R.E. 301(g). We adopt this approach, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>agree with the lower court\u2019s application of the test to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">II. THE DISCUSSION OF LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Under Article 66(e), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c), the Court of Criminal Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afa\">may affirm only such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record, it may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c)(2000). Article 66(c) charges the Court of Criminal Appeals with reviewing both the legal correctness of the trial-level proceedings and the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of guilty, as well as the appropriateness of the approved sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In its opinion in the present case, the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed the state of the evidence prior to discussing the instructional issue. After discussing Article 66(c) and applicable precedent, the court offered the following brief assessment as to factual sufficiency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">We conclude that a reasonable factfinder could properly have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant committed each of the offenses of which he stands convicted. Moreover, after careful consideration, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant committed each of those same offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\"><em>Forbes, </em>59 M. J. at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Appellee contends that the lower court erred by evaluating the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence of guilt in light of its subsequent resolution of the appeal on the instructional issue. We disagree. While there may be good reasons in a particular case for an intermediate appellate court to focus only on ease-dispositive issues, the court is not precluded from offering alternative holdings. In the present case, for example, the court below might have wanted this Court to know that it had performed its responsibility under Article 66(c) to weigh the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence in the event we were to disagree with its decision on the instructional issue. In the present case, by affirming the decision of the court below on the instructional issue, our decision will result in setting aside the findings and sentence. Once the findings are set aside, the views of the court below on the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to those findings are irrelevant to any further proceeding. If, after a rehearing, there is a conviction that is reviewed by the court below, the court will be obligated to conduct a de novo review under Article 66(c) based upon the record of the rehearing, not the record of the proceedings which resulted in the findings being set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The certified questions and the granted issue are answered in the negative. The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals setting aside the findings and the sentence is affirmed. A rehearing may be ordered in accordance with decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b492-14\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">I respectfully dissent from (1) the extensive rulemaking by the majority, and (2) the majority\u2019s failure to analyze the harmless error rule in the context of this case. Article 59(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice, (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a) (2000). I agree with Judge Learned Hand that \u201c[i]t would be strange indeed to conclude that this cautionary instruction violates the very constitutional provision it is intended to protect.\u201d <em>Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 339, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Dissatisfied with Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 301(g), the majority today amends that rule. Among today\u2019s innovations to M.R.E. 301(g) are: (1) a new \u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d for violations of the rule, (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>requirement that military judges identify \u201ccase-specific\u201d interests of justice \u2014 other than \u201cthe generalized fear that the panel\u201d would hold the appellant\u2019s silence against him; (3) a special test, borrowed by \u201canalogy\u201d to M.R.E. 403, balancing these interests of justice with \u201cthe defense election;\u201d and (4) an elaborate tripartite standard of review, including a new \u201cmiddle ground\u201d that applies when condition (2) above is satisfied, but (3) is not. Seldom has this Court engaged in so much rulemaking in a single case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The Supreme Court has described the \u201cconstitutional foundation\u201d underlying the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">[T]the respect a government \u2014 state or federal \u2014 must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens. To maintain a \u201cfair state-individual balance,\u201d to require the government \u201cto shoulder the entire load,\u201d ... to respect the inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 460, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">In the military justice system, Article 31, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831, serves the same purpose: Congress intended that article \u201cto secure to persons subject to the Code the same rights secured to those of the civilian community under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States -no more and no less.\u201d <em>United States v.

(MCM), Analysis of the Military Rules of Evidence A22-5 [hereinafter Drafter\u2019s Analysis].</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">Clearly, this case does not present such threats as were envisioned by the drafters of the Fifth Amendment or the Military Rules of Evidence. The Government has not sought by any expedient to compel Appel-lee/Cross-Appellant\u2019s (Appellee\u2019s) testimony, nor in any sense required him to create inculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the contrary, the military judge with obvious deliberation determined that it was <em>necessary </em>to instruct the panel (albeit against Appellee\u2019s wishes) in order to safeguard his constitutional rights. Where a judge gives a correct instruction, upon determining that the interests of justice so require, it is error to find prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">Furthermore, because the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial </em>nowhere requires military judges to jump through the hoops erected by the majority\u2019s opinion, I would resolve this case by looking to the plain wording of M.R.E. 301(g) and the test for prejudice in Article 59(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">\n<em>Constitutional Concerns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">Appellant\u2019s allegation of constitutional error is correctly resolved by reference to <em>Lakeside. </em>In that decision, the Supreme Court sided with the federal courts that had \u201cgenerally held that giving the protective instruction over the defendant\u2019s objection is not a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336 n. 3, 98 S.Ct. 1091. While <em>Lakeside </em>expressly addressed only the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, I agree with the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that the court implicitly rejected any due process argument by declining to address it. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>States v. Forbes, </em>59 M.J. 934, 940-41 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Without the looming threat of constitutional error, the states have been free to adopt different approaches to the present issue. Notably, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts recently joined what it concluded was a trend towards <em>allowing </em>judges to give the instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection: \u201c \u2018Most courts ... [view] the giving of such an instruction over objection as <em>not prejudicial error.\u2019 </em>Our [prior contrary] rule is one that has been soundly criticized ... and <em>\u2018carries the doctrine of self-incrimination to an absurdity.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Rivera, </em>441 Mass. 358, 805 N.E.2d 942, 952-53 (2004) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Evocative of the Drafter\u2019s Analysis of Rule 301(g), the <em>Rivera </em>court held, \u201cjudges should not give the instruction when asked not to do so. We are merely saying that it is [no longer] per se reversible error to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 953 n. 9</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>Military Rule of Evidence 301(g)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Like the individual states, the military system has its own rule. Ours was prescribed by the President in the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, </em>and establishes both the affirmative duty and discretionary authority of trial judges to instruct on an accused\u2019s right not to testify. Specifically, before a military judge may instruct over a defense objection, M.R.E. 301(g) requires either (1) a necessity \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d or (2) a \u201cmost unusual\u201d case. Drafter\u2019s Analysis at A22-7. Against these bare requirements, the CCA\u2019s ornamentation of the rule \u2014 of which the majority is so enamored \u2014 puts us in the shoes of legislators and is unfaithful to its text. The text of Rule 301(g) (i.e., the <em>pre-Forbes </em>version appearing in the <em>MCM) </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">When the accused does not testify at trial, defense counsel may request that the members of the court be instructed to disregard that fact and not to draw any adverse inference from it. Defense counsel may request that the members not be so instructed. Defense counsel\u2019s election shall be binding upon the military judge except that <em>the military judge may give the instruction when the instruction is necessary in the interests of justice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">M.R.E. 301(g) (emphasis added). The Drafter\u2019s Analysis notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[C]ounsel for the defense may determine that this very instruction may emphasize the accused\u2019s silence, creating a prejudicial effect. Although the Supreme Court has held that <em>it is not unconstitutional for a judge to instruct a jury over the objection of the accused </em>to disregard the accused\u2019s silence, it has also stated: \u201cIt may be wise for a trial judge not to give such a cautionary instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection.\u201d Rule 301(g) recognizes that the decision to ask for a cautionary instruction is one of great tactical importance for the defense and generally leaves that decision solely within the hands of the defense. Although <em>the military judge may give the instruction when it is necessary in the interests of justice, </em>the intent of the Committee is to leave the decision in the hands of the defense in all but the most unusual cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Drafter\u2019s Analysis at A22-7. (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">\n<em>Case-Specific Interests of Justice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Plainly (and I must therefore assume deliberately) absent from the text of M.R.E. 301(g) and the Drafter\u2019s Analysis is the majority\u2019s new requirement that a military judge make \u201cease-specific\u201d factual findings on the record. Until such a requirement is placed in M.R.E. 301(g) by someone with the authority to do so, it has no place in an opinion of this Court. Indeed, when the President has desired to impose such a requirement, he has done so expressly. For example, Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 905(d), M.R.E. 304(d)(4), M.R.E. 311(d)(4), and M.R.E. 321(f) each provides, \u201cWhere factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the military judge shall state the essential findings on the record.\u201d With those rules, a failure to make factual findings is error, not because this Court wishes it so, but because the rules make it so. In the present case, the military judge satisfied M.R.E. 301(g) by twice stating on the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>that he thought the instruction on Appellee\u2019s silence was \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">MJ: I feel that it is necessary to give [the instruction] unless the defense has case law to cite for the proposition that I shouldn\u2019t give it even though the defense objects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">ADC: You feel it\u2019s necessary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">MJ: I do feel it\u2019s necessary____ I just</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">think it\u2019s important to tell the members that so they don\u2019t go back and ask the question about why the accused didn\u2019t testify. That\u2019s my thought \u2014 and also instruct them that they are not to hold that against the accused in any way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">This is all M.R.E. 301(g) requires, and it is not for this Court to second-guess the circumstances of trial, or the apparent necessity of a cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s ex-post facto rule-making on this point affects an end run around the longstanding principle that military judges \u2014 not appellate courts \u2014 are better placed to perceive and respond to the exigencies of trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ovando-Moran, </em>48 M.J. 300, 304 (C.A.A.F.1998) (\u201cThe military judge was in the best position to evaluate [the member\u2019s] responses [during voir dire] and determine whether he was capable of following the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d). Here, Appellee faced very serious charges of rape, sodomy, adultery, and obstruction of justice (\u201csexual misconduct\u201d in the view of the majority) in connection with three young female recruits who were less than half his age. That the military judge was concerned that prejudice would result from Appellee\u2019s decision not to testify is clear on the record. The military judge\u2019s hesitancy about not giving the instruction (he recessed twice before ruling) was palpable, and evinces a thoughtful decision. I am not prepared to substitute my judgment for that of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Apart from lacking a legitimate basis in the rule, the majority\u2019s requirement for \u201ccase specific interests of justice\u201d draws an untenable distinction between what I understand to be \u201cgeneralized\u201d interests of justice (i.e., interests rooted in the \u201cstandard\u201d fear \u201cthat the members would hold the appellant\u2019s silence against him,\u201d) and specialized or \u201cunusual\u201d interests of justice (presumably rooted in some other brand of fear). The majority regards interests of the second sort as more legitimate and more deserving of a fail-to-testify instruction. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>61 M.J. at 358-59. This distinction, however, fails to perceive what I think the military judge perceived: that the circumstances of Appellee\u2019s trial required an effective defense strategy or, that failing, the protective vigilance of a trial judge. I assume the trial judge was aware that this Court has not been reluctant to impose a duty on military judges to ensure the protection of individual rights. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>60 M.J. 261 (C.A.A.F.2004) (when the only member to a sanity board convened under R.C.M. 706 appears to change his mind, the military judge abuses his discretion in not ordering any further inquiry into the accused\u2019s mental responsibility); <em>United States v. Grigoruk, </em>52 MJ. 312 (C.A.A.F.2000) (Obligation placed on trial judge. When the defense fails to call Dr. Underwager, an approved defense expert, the military judge must make an inquiry on the record or an inquiry must be ordered through a hearing under <em>United States v. Dubay, </em>17 C.M.A. 147, 37 C.M.R. 411 (1967)); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>49 M.J. 98 (C.A.A.F.1998) (holding that there was error by the defense in failing to call reconstruction expert who had previously been hired by the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">\n<em>Harmless Nonconstitutional Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">Assuming, arguendo, that giving the cautionary instruction was somehow error, this case, in any event, would present only \u201ca violation of a Manual provision promulgated by the President to ensure a military accused a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Rush, </em>54 M.J. 313, 315 (C.A.A.F.2001) (employing Article 59(a) after failing to find constitutional error). Thus, Appellee can succeed only by demonstrating that the error substantially influenced the findings, or if this Court is otherwise \u201cleft in grave doubt\u201d as to his convictions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Armstrong, </em>53 M.J. 76, 81 (C.A.A.F.2000) (citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>States v. Adams, </em>44 M.J. 251, 252 (C.A.A.F.1996)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Article 59(a) applies to all nonconstitutional errors, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s exemption by fiat for \u201cdefense-friendly\u201d rules. 61 M.J. at 359. Regardless of whether the CCA\u2019s new test for prejudice is \u201cwell-reasoned,\u201d it has no basis in the <em>MCM, </em>and the majority errs in adopting it today. Employing the appropriate test for prejudice, the record in this case satisfies me that the conviction below may stand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Particularly detrimental to Appellee\u2019s allegations of prejudice are the members\u2019 prior exposure in voir dire to the instruction later complained of, and the strength of the Government\u2019s case. Against the backdrop of the comprehensive reasonable doubt instructions given at the end of the trial, Appellee has not established any material prejudice to his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>Voir Dire Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The cautionary instruction, as given at the end of trial, was not novel to the members\u2019 ears, but mirrored a prior instruction given to them during voir dire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The instruction complained of reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">The accused has an absolute right to remain silent. You will not draw any inference adverse to the accused by the fact that he did not testify as a witness. The fact that the accused has not testified must be disregarded by you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">During voir dire, and without objection from the defense, the military judge had earlier alerted the members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aq8-dedup-0\">You may expect or desire the accused to testify. The accused has an absolute right not to testify. The fact that an accused may elect not to testify in his own behalf may not be considered adverse to the accused in any way .... Is there any court member who cannot follow this instruction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">The military judge recorded a negative response from all members. Thus, where the members indicated they could follow the law as given to them by the military judge, I find no reason to conclude otherwise. <em>See United States v. Thompkins, </em>58 M.J. 43, 47 (C.A.A.F.2003) (\u201cabsent evidence to the contrary, court members are presumed to comply with the military judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d); <em>Lakeside, </em>435 U.S. at 340 n. 10-11, 98 S.Ct. 1091 (characterizing as \u201cdubious,\u201d \u201cdoubtful,\u201d and \u201cspeculative\u201d the suggestion that a jury would disregard such an inference instruction); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. 338 (C.A.A.F.1997) (military panels are often called \u201cblue ribbon\u201d panels due to the quality of the members). The risk that second instruction prejudicially \u201cemphasized\u201d Appel-lee\u2019s silence is therefore inconsequential.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">\n<em>The Strength of Government\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">The final indicium of harmlessness in this ease is the strength of the evidence against Appellee. Four complaining witnesses\u2014 each about half Appellee\u2019s age \u2014 testified against him. Two witnesses providing strikingly similar testimony about Appellant\u2019s mo-dus operandi of driving to remote areas with female Navy recruits before assaulting them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defense case was weak by comparison: Appellant\u2019s strategy at trial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>limited to impeaching the credibility of the alleged victims, whose testimony otherwise went unchallenged. In light of the imbalance on the merits, any error by the military judge was unlikely to have substantially influenced the findings, and was therefore harmless under Article 59(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">While I agree with Judge Learned Hand that when an accused asserts his privilege against self-incrimination, it may sometimes be \u201cbetter ... for the trial judge to say nothing about it,\u201d I likewise agree with Judge Hand that, \u201cto say that when he does, it is error, carries the doctrine of self-incrimination to an absurdity.\u201d 435 U.S. at 341 n. 12, 98 S.Ct. 1091 (quoting <em>Becher v. United States, </em>5 F.2d 45, 49 (2d Cir.1924)). For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\">. Nor is it reasonable to conclude that the prospect of a cautionary instruction would itself \"compel\u201d an accused to self-incriminate at trial. <em>See Bordenkircher v.
