In accordance with his plea, he was convicted of wrongful use of marijuana. Contrary to his pleas, he was convicted of two specifications of wrongful use of ecstasy (MDMA) and two specifications of distribution of ecstasy. All of the offenses were in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a (2000). The adjudged and approved sentence included a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 150 days, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, E-l. The United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. 59 M.J. 712 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2004). We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-21\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-22\">WHETHER THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS PREJUDICIALLY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE DID NOT ABUSE HIS DISCRETION IN APPLYING R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) TO DEFENSE SENTENCING EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-23\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-24\">WHETHER THE EVIDENCE WAS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT APPELLANT\u2019S CONVICTION TO SPECIFICATIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE CHARGE WHERE THE EVIDENCE DID NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SUBSTANCE USED AND DISTRIBUTED WAS ILLEGAL.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-25\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1001(b)(5)(D) does not apply to defense sentencing evidence and that the error was prejudicial on sentencing. With respect to the findings, we hold that the evidence is legally sufficient. For ease of presentation, we will discuss the issues in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-26\">FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-27\">In August 2000, Airman First Class Di-locker, Senior Airman Gardner and Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>lant, also an E-4, were sent on a temporary-duty assignment to the Ascension Islands during which Diloeker and Gardner shared a room. One evening, Dilocker found Appellant and Gardner drinking beer in the room and decided to join them. During the course of conversation, Gardner stated that she had never used any kind of drugs before. Appellant responded, \u201cWell, if you could do something that wasn\u2019t illegal and you wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for it, would you do it?\u201d Gardner replied, \u201cYeah, possibly.\u201d Appellant left the room and returned about ten minutes later with a pill. According to Gardner, who at the time of trial considered herself Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Appellant said, \u201cOkay, this here is ecstasy, but it is herbal. It is not illegal.\u201d Appellant split the pill in two and they each ingested a half. Dilocker, who had also left the room earlier, returned and heard one of the two say that they had just taken a half pill of ecstasy. At trial, Dilocker testified that she never heard either of the other two refer to the pill as \u201cherbal\u201d ecstasy at any point during the evening. After ingesting the pill, Gardner began to feel a tingling in her fingers and related this to Dilocker. According to Gardner, the sensation lasted two to three hours. This misconduct came to light during a subsequent investigation by Office of Special Investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The specifications at issue alleged use and distribution of MDMA while Appellant was in the Ascension Islands. He contends on appeal that the evidence is legally insufficient to support a conviction on these two offenses. According to Appellant, the evidence not only fails to support a finding that he intended to use and distribute MDMA, a controlled substance, but it also fails to prove that what he actually used and distributed was an illegal substance. He further contends that the evidence shows that the tingling effects to which Gardener testified were attributable to a placebo effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Our standard of review for challenges to legal sufficiency is \u201cwhether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 324-25 (C.M.A.1987) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). We draw every reasonable inference from the record in favor of the prosecution. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>54 M.J. 244, 246 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 M.J. 281, 284 (C.M.A.1991). Appellant\u2019s challenge focuses on the element in both offenses that alleges that he used and distributed \u201cmethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a Schedule I controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Gardner testified that Appellant indicated he was giving her a half-pill of \u201cherbal ecstasy,\u201d and that afterwards she felt a tingling sensation in her fingers that lasted for several hours. Dr. Papa, the forensic toxicologist for the Government, had been in the courtroom while she was testifying. He described in detail about what illegal ecstasy, MDMA, contained and that it produced a variety of effects in the user depending on the user\u2019s lack of experience or past experience with the drug and the purity of the drug. He also described and distinguished \u201cherbal ecstasy,\u201d testifying that it was a legally marketed concoction of vitamins and herbal products. Because herbal ecstasy contained stimulants like caffeine, it might produce a feeling of increased energy in the user. However, he testified that the tingling sensation described by Gardner was inconsistent with ingesting half a pill of herbal ecstasy, but was consistent with ingesting MDMA. He further opined that any effects from herbal ecstasy would not have lasted the two to three hours as testified by Gardner.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">During cross-examination of Dr. Papa, defense counsel attempted to suggest that even assuming Gardner had ingested MDMA, she would have been a one-time user of the substance. Therefore, one might have expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to see in her the full range of effects. Dr. Papa stated that this might depend on the concentration of the drug. He stated that someone ingesting MDMA could expect to experience either a partial effect or the full range of effects. Defense counsel also attempted to have Dr. Papa support the defense theory that Gardner may have been experiencing a placebo effect from ingesting herbal ecstasy. According to Dr. Papa, this theory posited that if a person given a placebo expected to feel the effects of the actual drug, this expectation could produce the effects of the actual drug in the body. However, he qualified this testimony as follows, \u201c[I]t depends as to how attuned they are to the effects or what they know about the effects. I mean if you are given a placebo and you don\u2019t know anything about the ecstasy effects ... you might not have any effect.\u201d Earlier, during her testimony relating to what she expected to feel after ingesting the pill, Gardner had the following exchange with the military judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[MJ]: Now on Ascension Islands, what did you expect to experience from taking the pill that the accused gave you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">[WIT]: I didn\u2019t expect anything. I\u2019d never even really heard of it before. So I didn\u2019t have any expectations or anything really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">[MJ]: Did you expect to get a good feeling as compared to a bad feeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">[WIT]: Well, I didn\u2019t really have any expectation. Like I said, I\u2019d never heard of it before. I\u2019d never done any drugs. So I really didn\u2019t know what to expect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Thus, the record indicates that Dr. Papa testified that the effects Gardner felt were consistent with the use of narcotic ecstasy. In addition, Dilocker testified that she heard either Appellant or Gardner state that they had just taken ecstasy, and she did not hear a reference to \u201cherbal\u201d ecstasy. In support of the defense theory, there was evidence that Appellant mentioned that he was giving Gardner herbal ecstasy and that Gardner thought what she was ingesting was herbal ecstasy. However, the members were not obliged to accept the defense theory of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">As reflected in the record, the Government\u2019s case was predicated, in part, on circumstantial evidence regarding the identity of the illicit drug based on the observations and testimony of a lay witness. In <em>United States v. Nicholson, </em>49 M.J. 478, 480 (C.A.A.F.1998), we held that \u201cmere speculation as to the identity of a substance by one non-expert witness \u2014 and nothing more \u2014 does not rise to the level of legally sufficient evidence for conviction.\u201d In <em>Nicholson, </em>a conviction for possession of marijuana was based almost exclusively on testimony by a non-expert witness that he saw the accused holding a bag that contained a \u201cbrown leafy substance that he thought might have been marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479. In concluding that this evidence was insufficient, this Court relied on <em>United States v. Wright, </em>16 F.3d 1429 (6th Cir.1994), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit observed that circumstantial evidence which could support identification beyond a reasonable doubt included \u201c\u2018the physical appearance of the substance\u2019; evidence that the substance had the expected drug effect; \u2018evidence that the substance was used in the same manner as the illicit drug\u2019 in question; evidence that transactions involving the substance were for high prices, paid in cash, and covert; \u2018and evidence that the substance was called by the name of the illegal narcotic\u2019 by those in its presence.\u201d <em>Nicholson, </em>49 M.J. at 480 (quoting <em>Wright, </em>16 F.3d at 1439). In <em>Nicholson, </em>because the Government\u2019s proof on the identity of the substance was based solely on the speculative testimony of one lay witness, the evidence was legally insufficient on that element. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in this case the record contains evidence in addition to the testimony of the lay witness Diloeker concerning the identity of the drug. First, Diloeker\u2019s testimony that Appellant and Gardner referred to the substance as ecstasy rather than herbal ecstasy is unequivocal as to what she heard. Secondly, there was lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>testimony by Gardner of the effects of the drug, accompanied by expert testimony corroborating those effects. Thus, this case is distinguishable from the situation encountered in Nicholson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Based on the evidence presented, we are satisfied that the members could have reasonably found beyond a reasonable doubt that what Appellant used and distributed to Gardner was illegal ecstasy and not herbal ecstasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">DEFENSE SENTENCING EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"AkV_\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At a session pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), prior to sentencing, trial counsel objected to portions of six defense character letters. Specifically, trial counsel argued that language in the proposed sentencing exhibits amounted to recommendations for retention, which he argued would confuse the members by misleading them into thinking they \u201care making a retention decision versus a decision of a punitive discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The military judge sustained the trial counsel\u2019s objections to the following underscored passages from the six exhibits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\"><em>I have no doubt SrA Griggs will continue to be an asset to the mission of the squadron and Air Force. </em>I can honestly say his future is not in my hands, but I ask the panel to have compassion and SrA Griggs is given a second chance <em>to be a productive member of the United States Air Force. </em>I would still like to be able to work with SrA Griggs. <em>In fact I have two airmen I\u2019d gladly trade just to keep him. I feel the Air Force could use more airmen like him. </em>Even with the stress of a pending court martial he has remained dedicated, motivated, and faithful till [sic] the end. I would not hesitate to have SrA Griggs working for me or with me. <em>I continue to hear, \u201cThis is not a one mistake Air Force\u201d </em>so I feel SrA Griggs can learn a valuable lesson from this experience. I believe strongly that everyone deserves a second chance to prove him or herself. <em>I have no doubt SrA Griggs unll continue to be an asset to the mission of the squadron and Air Force. </em>I ask the panel to have compassion and SrA Griggs is given a second chance to be a productive member <em>of the United States Air Force.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">I am convinced that he has learned from this experience and can still be of great potential <em>to the United States Air Force ... </em>We seem to \u201ceat our young\u201d sometimes <em>and see the only course of action is to toss them out after investing so much time, effort, and money.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">Although the military judge did not expressly state the basis for his rulings, we infer from the discussion relating to trial counsel\u2019s objections, that the military judge based his ruling on R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D). This is reflected by his statement to defense counsel to \u201ctell me why the [objectionable statements] don\u2019t fall squarely within the parameters of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D).\u201d The defense counsel ultimately presented the exhibits to the members after redacting the offending language.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">We review a military judge\u2019s decision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McCollum, </em>58 M.J. 323, 335 (C.A.A.F.2003). A ruling based on an erroneous view of the law constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the military judge applied an erroneous view of the law in excluding the relevant passages from the defense exhibits based on R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">R.C.M. 1001 addresses presenteneing procedures at a court-martial. Subsection (b) is titled \u201cMatter to be presented by the prosecution.\u201d In turn, R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(A) states that \u201c[t]he trial counsel may present, by testimony ... evidence in the form of opinions concerning the accused\u2019s ... potential for rehabilitation.\u201d The witness offering the opinion \u201cmust possess sufficient informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tion and knowledge about the accused to offer a rationally-based opinion that is helpful to the sentencing authority.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(B). Also, the opinion \u201cmust be based upon relevant information and knowledge possessed by the witness.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(C). Finally, the rule expressly precludes a witness from offering \u201can opinion regarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the accused\u2019s unit.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">R.C.M. 1001(c) is titled \u201cMatter to be presented by the defense.\u201d In turn, R.C.M. 1001(c)(1) states, \u201cThe defense ... may present matters in extenuation and mitigation regardless whether the defense offered evidence before findings.\u201d \u201cMatter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen the punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial, <em>or to furnish grounds for a recommendation of clemency.\u2019\u2019 </em>R.C.M. 1001(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Mitigation evidence includes \u201cevidence of the reputation or record of the accused in the service for efficiency, fidelity, subordination, temperance, coinage, or any other trait that is desirable in a servicemember.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The question is whether the prohibition expressed in R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) applies to defense witnesses who wish to provide so-called \u201cretention evidence,\u201d and if so, whether such evidence is nonetheless permitted as \u201cmatter in mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We begin our analysis with the text of R.C.M. 1001(b), the subtitle of which refers expressly to \u201cMatter to be presented by the prosecution.\u201d Based on its heading, this section would appear to be limited to witnesses offered by the trial counsel. Moreover, as a structural matter, R.C.M. 1001 distinguishes this section from the next, which is titled \u201cMatter to be presented by the defense.\u201d This structure suggests intentional placement and drafting, rather than inadvertent use of a title to cover material that extends beyond the reach of a dated or ill-placed title. However, as with legislative text, the titles and subtitles of rules are not necessarily dispositive as to the scope, meaning, and intent of a rule. <em>See generally United States v. Banker, </em>60 M.J. 216, 219-21 (C.A.A.F.2004) (Court going beyond title of Military Rule of Evidence 412 to ascertain scope, meaning and intent of rule). Therefore, we look to the text of the rule and the manner in which the rule has been applied as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Under the general heading of \u201cMatter to be presented by the prosecution\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(A) and (D) state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">(5) Evidence of rehabilitative potential____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">(A) In general. <em>The trial counsel may present, </em>by testimony or oral deposition in accordance with R.C.M. 702(g)(1), evidence in the form of opinions concerning the accused\u2019s previous performance as a ser-vicemember and potential for rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">(D) Scope of opinion____ A witness may not offer an opinion regarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the accused\u2019s unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Emphasis added. Thus, the language of the rule itself follows the predicate of the heading. In general, subsection (A) is addressed to evidence \u201c[t]he trial counsel may present.\u201d Subsection (D), regarding the scope of opinion, would thus serve as a limitation on what trial counsel may \u201cin general\u201d present.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">The case law offers support for both the Government\u2019s position and Appellant\u2019s position. Defense witness testimony, including written statements, expressing an opinion that an accused should be returned to duty have long been viewed in case law as \u201cclassic mitigation evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Aurich, </em>31 M.J. 95, 97 (C.M.A.1990)(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Vogel, </em>17 C.M.A. 198, 199, 37 C.M.R. 462, 463 (1967); <em>United States v. Guy, </em>17 C.M.A. 49, 49-50, 37 C.M.R. 313, 313-14 (1967); <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>16 C.M.A. 474, 477-78, 37 C.M.R. 94, 97-98 (1966). In <em>Aurich, </em>two judges of the Court recognized that retention evidence had historically not been offered as evidence of rehabilitative potential. Rather, it was \u201cclassic mitigation evidence\u201d which had \u201clong been relevant in courts-martial.\u201d 31 M.J. at 96, 97. At the same time, dicta in certain cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>suggest that such evidence is nonetheless precluded as an opinion that the accused should not be punitively discharged. <em>See United States v. Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. 301, 304 (C.M.A.1989); <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>42 M.J. 392, 396 (C.A.A.F.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In <em>Ohrt </em>we considered whether the military judge erred in allowing the accused\u2019s commander to testify in the Government\u2019s ease in aggravation that the accused possessed no potential for continued service in the Air Force. 28 M.J. at 302. The Court first observed that such witnesses raise the specter of command influence. <em>Id. </em>at 303. This Court then held that a witness testifying on rehabilitative potential under R.C.M. 101(b)(5)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> must possess \u201csufficient information and knowledge about the accused \u2014 his character, his performance of duty as a ser-vicemember, his moral fiber, and his determination to be rehabilitated \u2014 to give a \u2018rationally based\u2019 opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. The Court concluded, based on the facts of the case, that the commander\u2019s opinion lacked a proper foundation. <em>Id. </em>at 307. The Court noted: \u201ca <em>witness </em>\u2014 be <em>he for the prosecution or the defense </em>\u2014 should not be allowed to express an opinion whether an accused should be punitively discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304-05 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>Ramos, </em>the accused presented three military witnesses on sentencing who knew the accused on a personal and professional basis. 42 M.J. at 393. Each testified that they were willing to take the accused back into their units to work for them. One of these witnesses was questioned at length by both counsel and the military judge, revealing that his opinion might have been based on his sense of loyalty to the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95. After the witness was excused, the military judge instructed the members that they should disregard the witness\u2019 testimony that \u201che thinks [the accused] can still be a soldier in the Army.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. The military judge expressed concern that the members might confuse the issue of a punitive discharge with the issue of retention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Referencing the military judge\u2019s instruction, this Court stated \u201cit does not seem entirely unreasonable that the military judge viewed such testimony as out of bounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396. After briefly discussing the euphemisms used in the past by Government witnesses to suggest that the members award a punitive dis-charger-testimony condemned in <em>Ohrt </em>\u2014 the Court made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">The mirror image [of the Government-witness euphemism] might reasonably be that an opinion that an accused could \u201ccontinue to serve and contribute to the United States Army\u201d simply is a euphemism for, \u201cI do not believe you should give him a punitive discharge.\u201d If so, then such testimony would seem to be what the <em>Ohrt </em>Court had in mind when it explicitly stated that \u201ca <em>witness </em>\u2014 be <em>he for the prosecution or the defense </em>\u2014 should not be allowed to express an opinion whether an accused should be punitively discharged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">In light of these precedents, we can appreciate why the Court of Criminal Appeals found that there was sufficient confusion in the case law to conclude that the military judge in this case had not abused his discretion in applying R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) to the defense sentencing evidence. <em>Griggs, </em>59 M.J. at 715. Indeed, <em>Ohrt </em>and <em>Ramos </em>suggest that R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) applies to a witness \u201cbe he for the prosecution or the defense,\u201d where the testimony implicates the appropriateness of a punitive discharge. Moreover, <em>Ramos </em>was decided after R.C.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>1001 was amended in 1994, suggesting that the language found in <em>Ramos </em>is purposeful and founded on the present structure and text of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We are now confronted, as the Court was not in <em>Ohrt </em>and <em>Ramos, </em>with the apparent tension between the prohibition of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) against opinions related to whether the accused should be returned to duty or not and the express allowance in R.C.M. 1001(c) permitting the defense to present matters in mitigation. We conclude that the better view is that R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) does not apply to defense mitigation evidence, and specifically does not preclude evidence that a witness would willingly serve with the accused again. First, this view is consistent with the structure of the rule. The prohibition is contained in that portion of the rule under the heading of \u201cMatter to be presented by the prosecution.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b). These sections are clearly demarcated. As importantly, the text of the rule is addressed to evidence presented by trial counsel. If the limitation in subsection (D) is indeed applicable to the defense, the title and text of the rule can be easily amended to reflect such an intent. Thus far, no such amendment has occurred, notwithstanding the plain text of the sections and the apparent confusion suggested in the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Second, so-called \u201cretention evidence\u201d is classic matter in mitigation, which is expressly permitted to be presented by the defense. As noted in <em>Aurich, </em>\u201cthe fact that a member of an armed force has sufficient trust and confidence in another member is often a powerful endorsement of the character of his fellow soldier.\u201d 31 M.J. at 96. Moreover, though \u201c[h]aving rehabilitative potential is a mitigating factor. Lacking rehabilitative potential is not an aggravating factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97 n. *</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Finally, with respect to the legal policy behind the rule, there is a distinction between commanders or command representafives expressing their views that they do not want the accused returned to duty and defense witnesses expressing contrary views. Our case law in this area deals mostly with Government witnesses in the sentencing phase testifying as to either their unwillingness to have the accused returned to duty, or their otherwise unfavorable view toward the accused. The chief concerns underlying these cases are \u201cthe need to have \u2018a rational basis for\u2019 an opinion concerning rehabilitation and the importance of avoiding command influence in the sentencing process.... \u201d <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>33 M.J. 266, 270 (C.M.A.1991)(citing <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 304). These concerns coincide with the UCMJ\u2019s overarching concern regarding undue command influence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Defense retention evidence does not bear the same concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">We reach this conclusion with caution. As recognized in <em>Ramos, </em>there can be a thin line between an opinion that an accused should be returned to duty and the expression of an opinion regarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge. Obviously, an accused cannot return to serve in his unit if he receives a punitive discharge. 42 M.J. at 396. But an explicit declaration that an accused should not receive a punitive discharge or that any such discharge should be of a certain severity is disallowed for the defense not because of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D), but because such evidence invades the province of the members to decide alone on punishment. <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J at 305 (\u201cThe question of appropriateness of punishment is one which must be decided by the court-martial; it cannot be usurped by a witness.\u201d). However, as for the kind of retention evidence at issue in this case, any concerns raised can be addressed with a tailored instruction focusing on the distinction between a punitive discharge, which is for the members to decide, and the willingness of a servicemember to serve with an accused again, which may mitigate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>range of punishments available at courts-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We are also cognizant of Government counsel\u2019s concern, expressed during oral argument, that if the defense is allowed to admit such testimony in mitigation, the Government is without recourse. We disagree. Consistent with the historical concerns regarding command influence, the Government is free to rebut such assertions. As stated in <em>Aurich, </em>\u201cif an accused \u2018opens the door\u2019 by bringing witnesses before the court who testify that they want him or her back in the unit, the Government is permitted to prove that that is not a consensus view of the command.\u201d 31 M.J. at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In conclusion, we hold that R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) does not apply to defense evidence offered in mitigation under R.C.M. 1001(e). However, the defense presentation is not boundless. Like other opinion testimony, to establish relevance on sentencing, the witness must have a proper foundation for the opinion or view expressed. Military judges shall exercise their discretion in determining whether such a foundation is laid, and whether the door to rebuttal swings open. <em>Vogel, </em>17 C.M.A. at 199, 37 C.M.R. at 463; <em>Robbins, </em>16 C.M.A. at 478, 37 C.M.R. at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Prejudice Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The question now becomes whether Appellant was prejudiced by this error. We test the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence during the sentencing portion of a court-martial to determine if the error substantially influenced the adjudged sentence. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>55 M.J. 217, 221 (C.A.A.F.2001) (citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). If so, then the result is material prejudice to Appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">On one hand, evidence that a service-member can \u201ccontinue to be an asset\u201d to his unit and service or that he can still be of \u201cgreat potential\u201d to his service is valuable mitigation matter, even \u201cunusual\u201d evidence, as stated by Appellant counsel at oral argument. Moreover, Appellant\u2019s case was heard by members who, in the end, awarded Appellant less punishment than the Government asked for, suggesting that they were receptive to Appellant\u2019s mitigation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">On the other hand, even as redacted, the exhibits contained favorable language to Appellant. For example, three exhibits stated the authors\u2019 view \u201cthat everyone deserved a second chance.\u201d The other three letters stated in unredaeted text the authors\u2019 continued desire to work with Appellant. The remaining portions of the six exhibits were laudatory and were a part of ten such commendatory letters from a variety of civilian and military personnel praising the value of Appellant\u2019s service. In addition, Appellant\u2019s personnel file contained a number of unfavorable performance reports and adverse counseling entries. The members were also aware that during the pendency of Appellant\u2019s trial, he had received nonjudicial punishment for violating a no-contact order involving a witness in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Although this is a close case on prejudice, we believe the balance tips in favor of Appellant in light of the qualitative nature of the excluded statements and the potential impact they may have had upon the members. Evidence from fellow servicemembers who would have stated that Appellant should be retained because of his potential to the Air Force may have had a significant impact on the members, given the value that military members place on respect from peers and superiors. Significantly, one technical sergeant, a coworker and supervisor, who was the Group\u2019s Noncommissioned Officer of the Year in 2000, would have expressed the following view: \u201cI have two airmen I\u2019d gladly trade just to keep him. I feel the Air Force could use more airmen like him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">As a result, we conclude that the excluded evidence may have substantially influenced the adjudged sentence in Appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to the findings and reversed as to the sentence. The record of trial is returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. A rehearing on sentence may be ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-15\">. Specification 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">In that Senior Airman Sean W.

At the time, R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) read as follows: \"(5) Evidence of rehabilitative potential.

The relevant portion of the military judge\u2019s instruction in <em>Ramos </em>was as follows: And one of the dangers that this court and the appellate courts are concerned with is that you will view a punitive discharge as something along the line, \"Well, if he can\u2019t be a good \u2014 if we don't want him in the service then we will give him a punitive discharge.\u201d And that\u2019s not the purpose of it; its to be deemed by you to be the appropriate punishment for the offenses not to \u2014 as a means of eliminating a person from the service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. For instance, Professor Edmund M.

On the question of evidentiary error, however, I cannot agree that the military judge abused his discretion by excluding certain phrases from documents offered by the defense in its sentencing case. Nor can I conclude, after considering all the sentencing evidence and weighing Appellant\u2019s crimes against his sentence, that if there were any error that it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Two critical factual aspects of this case are ignored by the majority: the concession of Appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel and the rote nature of both the excluded language and the letters from which that language was redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The majority correctly quotes the military judge\u2019s query regarding the applicability of Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1001(b)(5)(D) during a session pursuant to Article 39(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a), at which the admissibility of defense sentencing exhibits was discussed, but omits the defense counsel\u2019s response, which I include below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">MJ: Defense Counsel, tell me why the language of the second and third sentences of paragraph 4 of Defense Exhibit D don\u2019t fall squarely within the parameters of RCM 1001(b)(5)(D). I can quote it for you if you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">DC: No sir, I am familiar. I would have to agree with the judge\u2019s opinion on that one, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">The majority correctly notes the favorable effect that testimonials from peers and superiors can and should have on the trial court\u2019s determination of an appropriate sentence. A cursory examination of Defense Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, and H, however, reveals their \u201cform letter\u201d nature, and as the majority notes, the redacted language is also notably similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">R.C.M. 1001(b) AND 1001(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">I agree with the majority that Rule for Courts-Martial 1001(b)(5)(D) applies only to evidence offered by the prosecution in its sentencing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> case, and not to defense evidence. I do not share the majority\u2019s reliance on dicta in <em>United States v. Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. 301 (C.M.A.1989), and <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>42 M.J. 392 (C.A.A.F.1995), to support the lower court\u2019s confusion between: (1) a recommendation/opinion in favor of or opposed to a punitive discharge; (2) a recommendation/opinion for retention; (3) a recommendation/opinion that an accused be separated; and (4) the scope and effect of R.C.M. 1001(b) and 1001(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">Nothing in either <em>Ramos </em>or <em>Ohrt </em>applies R.C.M. 1001(b) to evidence offered by the defense during its sentencing case, nor do those opinions even suggest such an application. What those opinions do suggest, in dicta, is that defense witnesses are not permitted to offer a recommendation pertaining to a punitive discharge. This \u201csauce for the goose\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> tangent is posited without reference to any rule of evidence or procedure, but appears to be grounded on the proposition that \u201csuch an opinion invaded the province of the court-martial____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>If we accept Ohrt\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dicta, arguendo, we could summarize the rules rather easily: (1) the only discharge a court-martial can impose is a punitive discharge, which may only be imposed as a punishment included in the sentence of a court-martial; (2) no witness at court-martial may recommend for or against a punitive discharge; (3) the opinion of a witness at court-martial to the effect that an accused should be discharged or separated is prohibited as tantamount to a recommendation for punitive discharge; and (4) the opinion of a witness at court-martial to the effect that an accused should be retained in the unit or in his service may or may not be a recommendation against punitive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">It is this latter category of opinions that I now address. While R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) expressly prohibits opinions by prosecution witnesses \u201cregarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the accused\u2019s unit,\u201d R.C.M. 1001(c) contains no such prohibition. This is entirely consistent with the drafters\u2019 intention that prosecution evidence fit neatly into one or more of the \u201cpigeon holes\u201d created by R.C.M. 1001(b)(l)-(5), and that defense evidence need only meet the modest limitations of R.C.M. 1001(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, while dicta in our case law prohibit a defense witness from recommending against punitive discharge, we have also long recognized the importance and admissibility of a recommendation that the accused be returned to duty or to his unit. <em>Aurich, </em>31 M.J. at 96. This is not to say that the defense presentation is unfettered. The drafters wisely included R.C.M. 1001(d) as a check on the expansive boundaries for defense evidence. If the defense uses its broader rule to raise matters that the Government was prohibited from raising by its narrower rule, the Government may, within the discretion of the military judge, present evidence to rebut those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">My point is that R.C.M. 1001(b) and 1001(c) are not congruent, but they are not necessarily in conflict. As in the case of any other evidence, recommendations for retention made by defense witnesses, when challenged at trial, must be evaluated in context by the military judge, who must then determine their admissibility, subject to review on appeal for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">DEFENSE CONCESSION AND ABUSE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Were this a de novo review, I would apply the plain language of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) and 1001(c) in the context of this Court\u2019s applicable holdings and determine whether the military judge erred in excluding portions of the defense exhibits. This is not a de novo review, however, and we are examining the military judge\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. Like the court below,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I am not prepared to abjure the significance of defense counsel\u2019s concession to the military judge that either: (1) the defense was offering these exhibits for admission into evidence under R.C.M. 1001(b)(5); or (2) the language of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) could properly be applied to exclude defense evidence. If the defense, as the proponent of the evidence, conceded that the offered evidence was subject to a particular rule of evidence or procedure, that concession should weigh heavily when Appellant later complains that the military judge, in accepting that concession, abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Similarly, although the majority correctly notes that the military judge based his ruling on R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D), <em>Griggs, </em>61 M.J. 402, 406, the majority also appears to assume both that the defense was offering the letters under R.C.M. 1001(c)(1)(B) and that the rules of evidence had been relaxed as provided in R.C.M. 1001(e)(3) to permit admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>these unauthenticated and potentially unreliable letters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">While I do not share the majority\u2019s assumptions, I find it unnecessary to descend into the maelstrom, as I am willing, for purposes of further analysis, to assume without deciding that the military judge abused his discretion by excluding unredacted versions of Defense Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, and H.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Rather than relying on <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>55 M.J. 217 (C.A.A.F.2001), which examined sentencing instructions for prejudice and addressed no evidentiary issues, I would apply this Court\u2019s logic from <em>United States v. Saferite, </em>59 M.J. 270, 274-75 (C.A.A.F.2004), in which we measured the effect of an evidentiary error in the sentencing ease by assessing: (1) the probative value and weight of the evidence (including the \u201ccontent and tone\u201d of testimonial evidence); (2) the importance of the evidence in light of other sentencing considerations, including the military judge\u2019s instructions; (3) the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the evidentiary ruling; and (4) the sentence actually imposed, compared to the maximum and to the sentence the trial counsel argued for. In the context of these considerations, we then determined whether the sentence had been \u201csubstantially swayed by the error.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">That said, I must take issue with the majority\u2019s exclusion of two key points in reaching their determination of prejudice: the form of the letters and the crimes themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">We simply cannot reach a determination as to prejudice without considering the effect that the form of the letters and the redacted language may have had on the weight given the letters by a panel the military judge described as \u201ca group of five really intelligent members.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Laid side by side, as they may well have been in the deliberation room, the letters in question are far too similar for the \u201cfive really intelligent members\u201d to have failed to recognize them as largely the product of someone other than the signatories. Notwithstanding what may have been heartfelt words, the letters are obviously so similar that their weight would doubtless have been diminished by their glaringly mass-produced character. Failing to consider this deficiency, the majority assumes that the addition of further, obviously similar language would have had a favorable effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Appellant was convicted of using marijuana, two specifications of using ecstasy, and two specifications of distributing ecstasy. He faced a dishonorable discharge and a maximum period of confinement of forty-two years. The trial counsel argued for twelve months of confinement. Appellant received a bad-conduct discharge and confinement for 150 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Finding this to be a \u201cclose case,\u201d the majority concludes that the absence of the redacted words from Defense Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, and H \u201csubstantially influenced\u201d the sentence. <em>Griggs, </em>61 M.J. at 410-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">I find this not to be a close case. Convicted of five drug offenses, Appellant received little more than one percent of the maximum permissible confinement and about forty percent of what the trial counsel argued for. He did not receive a dishonorable discharge. It is beyond the common experience of mankind to expect that the \u201cfive really intelligent members\u201d would have been \u201csubstantially influenced\u201d by the addition of the excluded language to adjudge an even more lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Finally, I view as unnecessary and ill-advised the majority\u2019s elevation of <em>Ohrt\u2019s </em>dicta that opinions regarding particular punishments should be disallowed because \u201c[t]he question of appropriateness of punishment is one which must be decided by the court-martial; it cannot be usurped by a witness.\u201d 28 M.J. at 305. I am not at all prepared to say that a military judge may properly exclude, for example: (1) the testimony of an accused\u2019s mother that her son or daughter, facing life without parole, should not be \u201cput away\u201d irrevocably; or (2) the testimony of a young mother that the court should not take away the sole means of support for her and her children. Until we are squarely faced with those questions, and others like them, we would be wise to confine our holding to the issues at hand and leave the dicta of <em>Ohrt </em>right where it is.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\">.
