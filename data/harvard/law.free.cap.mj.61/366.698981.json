The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged, except that he did not approve the additional confinement contingent on failure to pay the fine. The United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently affirmed the findings and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Congress passed a bill authorizing the punishment of confinement for life without eligibility for parole (LWOP) on November 6, 1997,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the President signed the bill into law on November 18, 1997.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the President did not amend the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM </em>or <em>Manual) </em>to incorporate the punishment until April 11, 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant now claims that LWOP was not an authorized punishment for his offenses. We granted review to determine whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">BECAUSE LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE WAS NOT AN AUTHORIZED PUNISHMENT UNDER THE CODE FOR THE CHARGED OFFENSES, THE PRETRIAL AGREEMENT IS A NULLITY AND IT, AND THE FINDINGS AND SENTENCE ON WHICH IT WAS BASED, SHOULD BE SET ASIDE BECAUSE APPELLANT ENTERED INTO THE AGREEMENT BASED ON A MATERIAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THIS ISSUE.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Next, Appellant claims that Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1003(b)(3) requires an accused to be \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d before a fine can be imposed as punishment and, thus, the $75,000.00 fine imposed by the military judge was improper because he was not \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d as a result of his offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we also granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE IMPROPERLY IMPOSED A SENTENCE THAT INCLUDED A $75,000 FINE WHERE APPELLANT WAS NOT UNJUSTLY ENRICHED BY HIS CRIMES.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">We now hold that LWOP was authorized for Appellant\u2019s offense of rape, and that it was not error to impose the $75,000.00 fine. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Army Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">Appellant enlisted in the Army on June 4, 1996, for a term of six years. His military record reflects exceptional service as an Army Ranger, and he was awarded a Silver Star for his heroism in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the incident that later became the basis of the book and movie <em>Black Hawk Down.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">Unfortunately, the heroism Appellant displayed on the battlefield did not translate into his home life. Sometime around October 1, 1998, when Appellant and his family lived at Fort Benning, Georgia, he began sexually abusing his six-year-old daughter, MS. Appellant approached MS and asked her whether she had seen him in bed with his wife. After she replied that she had, Appellant made MS remove her clothes, lie face down on the bed and spread her legs. He then raped her. Appellant admits that he raped MS at least two more times before September 30,1999. Before raping MS for a third time, Appellant also forcibly sodomized her.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">Appellant\u2019s offenses were discovered on March 17, 1999, after Appellant and his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>separated and were living apart. In response to an argument Appellant and his wife had over the telephone, MS, who was then seven, told her mother that she was \u201cmad at him\u201d and that she \u201chate[d] him\u201d \u201c[bjecause he did sex to me.\u201d When questioned by her mother, MS indicated that Appellant had penetrated her genitals and anus and had placed his penis in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">I. <em>LWOP is an Authorized Punishment for Rape After November 18, 1997</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">At trial, the military judge advised Appellant that LWOP was the maximum punishment for his offenses. Appellant entered a pretrial agreement based on this assumption. As noted above, although Congress passed a bill authorizing LWOP on November 6, 1997, which the President signed into law on November 18, 1997, the President did not incorporate this punishment into the <em>MOM </em>until April 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In <em>United States v. </em>Ronghi,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we held that LWOP was an authorized punishment for premeditated murders committed after November 18, 1997. Although <em>Ronghi </em>did not address the availability of LWOP for any other offenses, we find the reasoning in that case controlling in this case. Applying its principles to the offense of rape committed after November 18, 1997, we now hold that LWOP was authorized for Appellant\u2019s offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Article 56a of the UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856a, enacted on November 18, 1997,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> states that a court-martial may adjudge a sentence of LWOP for \u201cany offense for which a sentence of confinement for life may be adjudged.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under Article 120, UCMJ, the maximum punishment for the offense of rape is \u201cdeath or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because confinement for life is a lesser punishment than death, Congress authorized confinement for life as a possible punishment for rape as \u201csuch other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, when Congress adopted Article 56a, it intended to authorize LWOP as another available sentence for a rape that occurred after November 18, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">In <em>Ronghi, </em>we noted that under Article 118, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 918,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Congress explicitly authorized \u201cdeath or <em>imprisonment for life </em>as a court-martial may direct\u201d as the maximum authorized punishment for premeditated murder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Article 120 does not include \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d in the text of the statute. But this distinction between the texts of Article 118 and Article 120 does not change the fact that confinement for life is still a lesser punishment than death and clearly falls within Article 120\u2019s authorization of \u201csuch other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cabsent some other statutory provision limiting LWOP\u2019s availability, it was an authorized sentence\u201d when Appellant committed his offenses between October 1, 1998, and September 30, 1999.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">Congress is not the only decision maker in establishing limitations on the punishments available for those sentenced by courts-martial. The President may also prescribe limitations on the maximum punishment that a court-martial may direct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the next question we must answer is whether the President imposed any limitation on LWOP as a punishment applicable to the rape of a child in 1998 and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>As noted in Ronghi,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the President executed the authority delegated to him by Congress by establishing maximum punishments in Part IV of the <em>MCM. </em>In setting the maximum punishment for rape, the President mirrored the language used by Congress, providing that the maximum punishment for rape is \u201c[d]eath or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, because LWOP is a lesser punishment than death, no conflict exists between the <em>Manual\u2019s </em>maximum sentence provision, death, and the congressionally-authorized sentence of LWOP in a rape case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Additionally, the President explicitly recognized LWOP as an authorized sentence \u201conly\u201d for \u201coffenses committed after November 18, 1997.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellant committed his offenses in 1998 and 1999. Finally, as we found in <em>Ronghi, </em>R.C.M. 1003, which lists the kinds of punishments that a court-martial may impose, does not proscribe LWOP as a form of punishment. Although R.C.M. 1003 does not specifically list LWOP, it \u201cnevertheless allow[s] LWOP, because it is not a new form of punishment, but simply a longer term of confinement than military law had previously allowed a court-martial to adjudge.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Appellant argues that <em>Ronghi </em>is distinguishable from this ease because, while death was clearly an authorized punishment for premeditated murder in the 2000 edition of the <em>MCM, </em>the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution forbids the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Appellant relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>which held that a death sentence <em>for </em>the rape of an adult <em>woman </em>is \u201cgrossly disproportionate and excessive punishment\u201d proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Based on this holding, Appellant argues that confinement for life rather than death is the maximum authorized punishment for rape and that, because LWOP is not a lesser punishment than life, it cannot be considered as the maximum punishment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">Appellant\u2019s argument is inapposite to the issue in this case. In this case, we need not decide the scope and extent of the plurality opinion in <em>Coker. </em>The issue in this ease is not whether Appellant can be executed for the offense of rape. Rather, the issue is whether Congress authorized LWOP for Appellant\u2019s offense of rape and whether the President has subsequently imposed any limitations on the imposition of LWOP as punishment for the rape of minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Additionally, we have explicitly held that \u201crape is an offense punishable by death for purposes of exempting it from the 5-year statute of limitations in Article 43(b)(1).\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In doing so, we stated that \u201cthe question of whether the death penalty may be imposed, given the facts and circumstances of any particular case, does not control the statute of limitations issue.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Similarly, we need not answer the question of whether Appellant may actually be sentenced to death for raping his daughter when she was six and seven. Rather, the question in this case focuses on whether the President established a maximum sentence less than LWOP for rapes that occurred in 1998 and 1999. We conclude that, because the President authorized death for Appellant\u2019s offenses, the 1998 <em>MCM </em>did not preclude a sentence of LWOP for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">We now hold that LWOP is an authorized punishment for Appellant\u2019s offense of rape of his daughter, which occurred after November 18, 1997. Accordingly, the pretrial agreement is not null and void because Appellant was correctly instructed by the military judge as well as defense counsel that LWOP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>was an available punishment for rape. Additionally, there was no material misunderstanding when he signed the pretrial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">II. <em>Fines May Be Imposed in the Absence of Unjust Enrichment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As part of Appellant\u2019s sentence, the military judge imposed a $75,000 f\u00edne against Appellant and sentenced him to contingent confinement if he failed to pay the fine. The military judge also recommended to the convening authority that the fine be disapproved \u201cunder the conditions that a trust fund in the amount of $25,000 be established for the sole purpose of providing medical treatment to the spouse and to the child.\u201d On October 2, 2000, the convening authority approved the fine, without approving either the contingent confinement or establishment of the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">A. Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Appellant argues that the military judge erred when he imposed a fine as part of Appellant\u2019s punishment because Appellant was not unjustly enriched as a result of his offenses. R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) provides that any court-martial may adjudge a fine instead of forfeitures. The discussion accompanying R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) states that \u201c[a] fine <em>normally </em>should not be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless the accused was unjustly enriched as a result of the offense of which convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We conclude that the use of \u201cnormally\u201d in the rule\u2019s nonbinding discussion indicates that \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d is not always a prerequisite to imposing a fine as part of an accused\u2019s sentence. Therefore, we conclude that the military judge did not err in this case by imposing a fine on Appellant in the absence of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">R.C.M. 1003 lists the punishments authorized for any case in which an accused is convicted, \u201c[sjubjeet to the limitations in this Manual.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As noted above, R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) explicitly provides that \u201c[a]ny court-martial may adjudge a fine in lieu of or in addition to forfeitures.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A plain reading of this language indicates that fines are available to be imposed on any accused who is convicted and that there is no requirement of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d for a fine to be imposed in Appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">The \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d language first appeared in the 1949 Army and Air Force editions of the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial. </em>These editions of the <em>Manual, </em>which were essentially identical, stated that a \u201cfine should not <em>ordinarily </em>be adjudged against an officer, warrant officer, or enlisted person unless the accused was unjustly enriched by means of an offense of which he is convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although the 1949 editions of the <em>Manual </em>did not explicitly explain why this language was first included in the <em>Manual, </em>a look at other pre-UCMJ editions of the <em>Man-ualfor Courts-Martial </em>suggests the reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">Historically, fines were considered \u201cespecially appropriate to those offences which consist in a misappropriation or misapplication of public funds or property, being in general adjudged with a view mainly to the reimbursement of the United States for some amount illegally diverted to private purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, the 1921 <em>MCM, U.S. Army, </em>notes that a fine is \u201cespecially recognized\u201d as a form of punishment in Article of War 94, Frauds Against the Government,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and the 1928 <em>MCM, U.S. Army, </em>states that a fine is \u201cexpressly recognized\u201d as a form of punishment in both Article of War 94, and Article of War 80, Dealing in Captured or Abandoned Property.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Also, the 1949 Army and Air Force editions of the <em>Manual </em>included the \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d language with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the following qualifier: that an accused should not be adjudged a fine in the absence of unjust enrichment for \u201can offense of which he is convicted involving loss to the United States or violative of military directives.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Therefore, it is clear that the drafters of these pre-UCMJ editions of the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial </em>viewed fines as the appropriate punishment for those offenses that clearly involved the need to make the government whole for money or property taken from it.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Not only were fines historically limited to specific offenses, but forfeiting the pay of a servicemember was viewed as preferable to imposing a fine because of the relative administrative ease in executing forfeitures. More specifically, the drafters of the <em>MCM </em>recognized that the least difficult way to obtain money from a servicemember as punishment would be by subtracting money from that servicemember\u2019s pay. \u201cWhere indeed the pecuniary liability of the offender is comparatively slight, forfeiture of pay, as being more readily executed, is a penalty preferable to fine.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The drafters\u2019 belief that forfeitures could be executed against servicemembers more easily than fines is further evidenced in the differences between the possible punishments that could be imposed on officers and enlisted members. For example, the 1921 <em>Manual </em>provides that only officers could be fined.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Sentences for enlisted soldiers, on the other hand, could include forfeiture or detention \u2014 which is a form of withholding a certain amount of the accused\u2019s pay that is ultimately returned upon separation from the service.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The 1928 <em>Manual </em>states that \u201c[detention of pay would not be imposed ... except on enlisted men of the Army.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Although detention of pay was still an authorized punishment in the 1949 editions of the <em>Manual, </em>fines became an authorized punishment for enlisted personnel, as well as officers, so long as a dishonorable discharge was also adjudged in the case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">In general, it appears that the drafters of the 1949 editions of the <em>Manual </em>incorporated forfeitures and fines as punishments based on two main historical premises: (1) that forfeitures were preferred because they were administratively easier to secure from those servicemembers who were convicted, and (2) that the Articles of War expressly authorized fines in cases involving fraud against the government or abandoned or captured property \u2014 both offenses which, in essence, involve property or money stolen from the government. The fine thus provided the means of making the government whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">A <em>preference </em>for forfeitures, however, in no way precludes the imposition of fines for certain offenses even in the absence of unjust enrichment. While the history indicating a preference for forfeitures over fines explains why the \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d language first appeared in the <em>Manual, </em>it also illustrates that the drafters did not address the direct question of whether fines are permissible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>offenses other than those that involved direct material loss to the Government. As stated in the Army\u2019s analysis of the 1951 <em>Manual:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMy\">Although the Manual provides that a fine should not \u201cordinarily\u201d be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless [an] accused was unjustly enriched by means of the offense, this is not an absolute rule. The Manual contemplates that fines may be adjudged where no unjust enrichment is present, because paragraph] 126/i(3) permits any [court-martial] to adjudge a fine instead of an authorized forfeiture where the Article] involved authorizes punishment as a [court-martial] may direct.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"abm-dedup-0\">We read the historical absence of explicit limitations on the imposition of fines for those offenses that did not involve direct loss to the United States as consistent with the President\u2019s authorization to impose fines in cases that may not involve \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Accordingly, in <em>United States v. Houn-shell, </em>we held that \u201c[c]ourts-martial have the power to adjudge fines instead of forfeitures in all cases in which the article of the Uniform Code violated by the accused authorizes punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And, in <em>United States v. Cuen, </em>we noted that the language regarding \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d is precatory text and, therefore, \u201cit is clear\u201d that a fine could be imposed in lieu of forfeitures on an accused convicted of absence without leave and assault and battery.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">The conclusion that fines can be imposed even in the absence of unjust enrichment is supported by a historical analysis and this Court\u2019s precedent, along with intermediate military appellate ease law.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We now hold that, based on the plain language of the rule as well as the history of a fine as punishment, it is not unlawful to impose a fine where there is no unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Our inquiry does not end here, however, because we must now decide whether the $75,000 fine imposed on Appellant violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">B. The Eighth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">The Eighth Amendment provides that \u201c[e]xeessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>v. </em>Bajakajian,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the Supreme Court set out a two-pronged analysis for determining whether the Excessive Fines Clause is violated. First, a court must determine if the fine falls within the Excessive Fines Clause and, if so, whether the fine is excessive.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In this case, Appellant claims that, although his crimes were serious, the $75,000 fine is not proportional to the offenses, especially considering the other punishments imposed on Appellant. We must first determine whether the $75,000 fine is a fine within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This first prong of the Excessive Fines Clause analysis is clearly met in this case. As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cat the time the Constitution was adopted, \u2018the word \u201cfine\u201d was understood to mean a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The $75,000 fine was directly imposed on Appellant as part of his sentence and was to be paid to the government as punishment for committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The next question is whether the $75,000 fine was excessive. \u201cThe touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Therefore, if a fine is \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense,\u201d it violates the Excessive Fines Clause.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> This proportionality analysis under the Excessive Fines Clause is conducted on a case-by-case basis and is distinguishable from the determination of sentence appropriateness required by Article 66.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Although counseling against a strict proportionality between the amount of punitive forfeiture and the gravity of a criminal offense, because such judgment is better left to the legislature, the Supreme Court articulated various factors to be analyzed in determining whether a fine was grossly disproportionate.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> First, a court should look to the nature of the offense and then question whether it is related to any other illegal activities by the accused.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Second, the court should assess whether the accused \u201cfit[s] into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Third, if the maximum sentence under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is relatively low, then this confirms a \u201cminimal level of culpability.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Finally, a court should determine the level of harm caused by the accused\u2019s offense by asking both who is affected by the offense and the magnitude of harm to those affected.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In <em>Bajakajian, </em>for example, the Supreme Court stated that only the Government was harmed by the failure of an international traveler to report that he was traveling with $357,144, in violation of a statute that required him to report more than $10,000.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Court also concluded that the harm to the Government was minimal.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Comparing the gravity of the harm caused by defendant\u2019s failure to accurately report the amount of money he was carrying with the fine the Government sought to impose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>which was the entire $357,144, the Supreme Court concluded the forfeiture would be \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the gravity of his offense.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Applying the factors from <em>Bajakajian, </em>we now conclude that the $75,000 fine imposed on Appellant was not \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the gravity of his offense.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> First, the nature of Appellant\u2019s offense was severe\u2014 the repeated rape and forcible sodomy of his six-year-old daughter. There is no way to measure the psychological and mental effect this abuse will have on MS for the rest of her life. At trial, MS\u2019s mother testified that, after the abuse, MS had no self-esteem, was always \u201cvery weepy,\u201d started to wet her bed at night and her pants at school, began to have frequent nightmares, and expressed a desire to kill herself. MS then began attending counseling. A medical exam conducted on MS revealed that MS\u2019s body was so physically traumatized that she suffered from significant physical defects. The nature of Appellant\u2019s crime was extremely severe and far from the relatively harmless nature of the failure to report the value of the currency the defendant was carrying in <em>Bajakajian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Second, there is no doubt Appellant falls into \u201cthe class of persons for whom [Articles 120 and 125 were] principally designed\u201d\u2014 those individuals who commit rape and forcible sodomy.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Third, the eongressionally-prescribed maximum punishment authorized for rape under Article 120 is the most severe sentence known to the law: death.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> This penalty in no way \u201cconfirm[s] a minimum level of culpability,\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and instead indicates that Congress and the President intended to punish these offenses severely. Appellant was sentenced to thirty years of confinement, the $75,000 fine, a dishonorable discharge, and reduction to E-l. Appellant\u2019s sentence was significantly less than the maximum authorized for his offenses. Finally, as discussed above, the harm caused to MS by Appellant\u2019s offenses is extremely severe. The Sentencing Guidelines for the federal civilian system are instructive to our proportionality review in this case.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, had Appellant been tried in the civilian system, his offense of criminal sexual abuse with a minor under the age of twelve at the time of the offense would have authorized a fine anywhere between $17,500 and $175,000.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Comparing the gravity of the repeated rape and forcible sodomy of Appellant\u2019s six-year-old daughter with the $75,000 fine, we conclude that the fine is in no way \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the gravity of his offense.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Therefore, based on the facts of this case, Appellant\u2019s sentence did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">C. Due Process Concerns</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">In this case, we need not answer any Due Process concerns that may arise in other cases when fines are imposed on an accused as part of his sentence and contingent confinement is imposed for failure to pay.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. </em>Tuggle,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> we held, based on R.C.M. 113(d)(3), that the Due Process Clause is violated when confinement is imposed as a sanction for failure to pay a fine where the probationer has made good-faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>efforts to pay but cannot because of indigen-cy and the court below denied the accused the opportunity to make a good-faith effort to pay. In this case, the convening authority did not approve the portion of the military judge\u2019s sentence that provided for five years of contingent confinement for the failure to pay his fine. Moreover, Appellant has neither attempted to pay this fine nor asserted that he is unable to do so. Therefore, we need not reach any questions regarding due process concerns in this case.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 920, 925 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">. <em>United States v.
