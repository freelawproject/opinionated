The military judge convicted appellant, contrary to his plea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of failure to obey a lawful order, in violation of Article 92, UCMJ. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for fifteen months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El. The convening authority ordered 176 days of confinement credit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"aic-dedup-1\">Appellant\u2019s record of trial is fraught with issues; several merit discussion and relief. First, we agree with appellate government counsel that appellant\u2019s court-martial had jurisdiction. Second, we agree with appellate defense counsel that Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III, both alleging larceny on 21 July 2001, should be merged because appellant stole the property listed in these specifications at substantially the same place and time. Third, we hold that the record of trial raises a substantial, unresolved question of law and fact as to the providence of appellant\u2019s guilty plea to the Specification of Additional Charge I and Additional Charge I (going from his appointed place of duty). Fourth, we find the record of trial lacks sufficient evidence to convict appellant of Specification 3 of Additional Charge III (failure to obey a lawful order). Finally, we agree, in part, with appellant\u2019s personal averment that shackling him to a barracks room cot \u2014 when he was a pretrial prisoner and the detention cell was unavailable \u2014 was more rigorous than required and constituted a violation of Article 13, UCMJ. Based on the errors noted, we will grant appropriate relief and reassess the sentence in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"AifE\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"A4i\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azm\">Appellate defense counsel assert the record of trial lacks evidence that Colonel (COL) Wallace B. Hobson, Jr. (the acting commander)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> personally selected appellant\u2019s court members prior to referring the case to a general court-martial. The 1 March 2002 pretrial advice for appellant\u2019s case states, \u201cI recommend that you refer the original and additional charges to trial by general court-martial by the members listed in Courts Martial Convening Order Number [CMCO # ] 3, this headquarters, dated 10 December 2001.\u201d Colonel Hobson\u2019s endorsement to the pretrial advice on that same date states, \u201cAll recommendations of the Staff Judge Advocate are approved.\u201d Court-Martial Convening Order Number 3 is listed as an enclosure to the pretrial advice.</p>\n<p id=\"AVKb\">At trial, defense counsel was put on notice that Major General (MG) Green selected the members for appellant\u2019s court-martial; copies of that order were furnished to \u201ccounsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>and the accused.\u201d Colonel Hobson referred appellant\u2019s case to the panel MG Green previously selected. In the presence of trial defense counsel, the military judge twice clarified that COL Hobson was the acting convening authority. Trial defense counsel affirmatively agreed. CourL-Martial Convening Order Number 3 convenes a general court-martial with the members listed therein, \u201cBY COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERAL GREEN.\u201d <em>See </em>R.C.M. 504(a). On appellant\u2019s charge sheet and additional charge sheet, block 14 states, \u201cReferred for trial to the general court-martial convened by CMCO # 3, dated 10 December 2001, subject to the following instructions: to be tried in conjunction with the [other] charges. By ORDER of COLONEL HOBSON.\u201d Trial defense counsel did not challenge COL Hob-son\u2019s personal selection of the. members on CMCO # 3, nor did he otherwise express any concern about CMCO # 3 or jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">A convening authority may adopt court members selected by his or her predecessor in command. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 601(b); <em>United States v. England, </em>24 M.J. 816, 817 (A.C.M.R.1987); <em>see also United States v. Allgood, </em>41 M.J. 492, 496 (C.A.A.F.1995) (citing with approval this court\u2019s opinion in <em>England, supra). </em>As in <em>England, </em>the referral language in the instant case cited a specific convening order listing members appointed by COL Hobson\u2019s predecessor in command. \u201cWe presume regularity in the action of the convening authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>27 M.J. 734, 735 (A.C.M.R.1988) (citing <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>26 M.J. 596 (A.C.M.R.1988); <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>21 M.J. 585 (A.C.M.R.1985); and <em>United States v. Carman, </em>19 M.J. 932 (A.C.M.R.1985)). This court is satisfied that COL Hob-son referred appellant\u2019s case to a general court-martial after reviewing and approving CMCO #3 incident to consulting with his staff judge advocate. Moreover, appellate defense counsel do not provide any support for their assertion that COL Hobson did not adopt the court members listed on CMCO #3.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We also find the decision of our sister court in <em>United States v. Brewick, </em>47 M.J. 730 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1997), persuasive. Our sister court found a similar claim of lack of personal selection of court members to be without merit because Lance Corporal Brewiek did not raise the issue at trial and failed to show prejudice on appeal. Furthermore, we agree with the <em>Brewick </em>court\u2019s view that <em>Allgood </em>does not require an \u201cexplicit statement of adoption.\u201d <em>Brewick, </em>47 M.J. at 732. Absent evidence to the contrary, adoption can be presumed from the convening authority\u2019s action in sending the charges to a court-martial whose members were selected by a predecessor in command. <em>See id. </em>at 733. We are satisfied that \u201cthe trial counsel\u2019s \u2018averments of jurisdiction\u2019, included in the record without objection, are adequate to establish the proper constitution and jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>47 M.J. 552, 554 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1997) (citing <em>Runkle v. United States, </em>122 U.S. 543, 556, 22 Ct.Cl. 487, 7 S.Ct. 1141, 30 L.Ed. 1167 (1887)). Therefore, we find that appellant\u2019s court-martial had jurisdiction to try him on the referred charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">II. Multiple Article Larceny</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Appellant pleaded guilty to larceny of $60.00 cash and Xanax pills of a value of about $20.00 from Private (PVT) Richard Rasch on 21 July 2001 (Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III, respectively). During the plea inquiry, appellant told the military judge that the day PVT Rasch went absent without leave (AWOL), appellant and PVT Hill entered PVT Rasch\u2019s room and stole \u201ca baggie with the pills in it and some money\u201d from a jewelry box. Thereafter, they divided the money and pills. After pleas but before findings, the military judge reduced the value alleged in Specification 1 to $30.00. He then found appellant guilty of modified Specification 1, and Specification 2 as charged. Trial defense counsel did not request merger of these two specifications based either on unreasonable multiplication of charges or multiplicity. The pretrial agreement did not include a provision waiving all waivable motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Appellate defense counsel now assert Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges and urge us to consolidate these specifications. Appellate government counsel respond that this is an issue of multiplicity that was waived by appellant\u2019s plea of guilty, absent plain error. The government argues in its brief that appellant has failed to meet \u201cthe burden of establishing that there was plain or obvious error that \u2018materially prejudiced\u2019 his \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d The government admits, however, \u201cthe items stolen were taken at the same place and time\u201d and \u201cshould have been charged in one specification.\u201d We agree with appellate defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The charges in appellant\u2019s ease represent an unreasonable multiplication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a larceny of several articles is committed at substantially the same time and place, it is a single larceny even though the articles belong to different persons. Thus, if a thief ... goes into a room and takes property belonging to various persons, there is but one larceny ____\u201d <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2000 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM], </em>Part IV, para. 46c(l)(h)(ii);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>36 M.J. 315, 316 (C.M.A.1993) (improper to separately charge contemporaneous taking of money from automatic teller machine (ATM) and ATM card found within); <em>United States v. Orr, </em>20 M.J. 139 (C.M.A.1985) (summary disposition)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (improper to separately charge three different larcenies that occurred contemporaneously during single housebreaking); <em>United States v. Huggins, </em>17 M.J. 345 (C.M.A.1984) (summary disposition) (improper to separately charge takings that occurred as part of one transaction); <em>United States v. Coffman, </em>45 M.J. 669, 671 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1997) (affirming consolidation of separate larceny specifications involving theft of a wallet and theft of a military identification card contained within). We will therefore merge the two larceny specifications into one specification in our decretal paragraph.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">III. Improvident Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Appellant pleaded guilty to, and was found guilty of, the Specification of Additional Charge I, going from his appointed place of duty, \u201ca doctor\u2019s appointment at William Beaumont Army Medical Center [WBAMC],\u201d on or about 3 October 2001, in violation of Article 86(2), UCMJ. Appellant now asserts his plea to this specification was improvident. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">The stipulation of fact states appellant informed his chain of command he had a doctor\u2019s appointment at WBAMC at 0900 on 3 October 2001. Drill Sergeant Yates drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>appellant to the hospital for this appointment, but subsequently \u201cspotted [appellant] running ... to a convenience store located across the street\u201d from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">During the <em>Care</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>inquiry, the military judge described the elements for leaving a place of duty, Article 86(2), UCMJ, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">One, that a medical authority appointed a certain time and place of duty for you, that is, a 0900 hours doctor\u2019s appointment at [WBMAC];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">Two, that you knew you were required to be present at this appointed time and place of duty; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">Three, that on or about 3 October 2001, you, without proper authority, went from the appointed place of duty after having reported at such place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Appellant agreed that the elements correctly described what he did. He further told the military judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">I had an appointment with physical therapy after lunch at the hospital, but the drill sergeants were going to be running around all day, so they\u2019d have to bring me to the hospital early. So they brought me to the hospital around 0900. I would\u2019ve had to wait around, so myself and [PVT] Kelso walked across the street to the store. As we were walking out, Drill Sergeant Yates told us to get back in the van and he brought us back to post and I missed my appointment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">MJ: When they dropped you off, what did the drill sergeants tell you, if anything? ACC: \u201cCall me when you get done with your appointment,\u201d Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-12\">MJ: Did they tell you you couldn\u2019t leave the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-13\">ACC: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-14\">MJ: You\u2019re certain that the time of the appointment was 1300, not 0900?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-15\">ACC: I\u2019m positive, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">The military judge, without objection from the parties, amended the time of appellant\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointment in the stipulation of fact from \u201c0900\u201d to \u201c1300.\u201d However, he changed only one of the two references to \u201c0900.\u201d Appellant also told the military judge that after Drill Sergeant Yates dropped them off at \u201caround 0845,\u201d he and PVT Kelso left the hospital to go to the 7-Eleven convenience store across the street. Appellant indicated that food or other items were not available in the hospital \u201cfor another hour or so.\u201d When the military judge asked appellant if he thought he was to remain in the hospital until his appointment, appellant said, \u201cI suppose, Your Honor \u2014 I wasn\u2019t real sure.\u201d The military judge then asked appellant, \u201cIs it fair to say that your place of duty was the hospital until your appointment?\u201d and \u201cYou were just trying to kill some time, is that right?\u201d Appellant affirmatively answered, \u2018Tes,\u201d and subsequently agreed that no one gave him permission to leave the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">At the end of the plea inquiry, appellant again agreed with the military judge that \u201ca medical authority appointed a certain time and place of duty for [appellant], that is, [a] 1300 hours doctor\u2019s appointment at [WBAMC],\u201d that he knew he was required to be at \u201c[that] appointed time and place of duty,\u201d and on 3 October 2001, he, \u201cwithout proper authority, went from the appointed place of duty after having reported to such place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">We review a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citations omitted). We will not overturn a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea unless the record of trial shows a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning it. <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">A providence inquiry into a guilty plea must establish that the accused believes and admits he is guilty of the offense and that the factual circumstances admitted by the accused objectively support the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>44 M.J. 496, 497-98 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>40 M.J. 67, 68 (C.M.A.1994); <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364, 367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>(C.M.A.1980); and R.C.M. 910(e)). Should the accused set up a matter inconsistent with the plea at any time during the proceeding, \u201cthe military judge must either resolve the apparent inconsistency or reject the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>44 M.J. at 498 (citing UCMJ art. 45(a) and R.C.M. 910(h)(2)); <em>see also Davenport, </em>9 M.J. at 367 (stating same). Furthermore, when such inconsistent matters \u201creasonably raise[] the question of a defense ... it [is] incumbent upon the military judge to make a more searching inquiry to determine the accused\u2019s position on the apparent inconsistency with his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmins, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 475, 479, 45 C.M.R. 249, 253, 1972 WL 14168 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"A3vu\">\u201cMere conclusions of law recited by an accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Outhier, </em>45 M.J. 326, 331 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Terry, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 442, 45 C.M.R. 216, 1972 WL 14158 (1972)). In determining whether the providence inquiry provides facts inconsistent with the guilty plea, we take the accused\u2019s version of the facts \u201cat face value.\u201d <em>United States v. Jemmings, </em>1 M.J. 414, 418 (C.M.A.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"a-j-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s providence inquiry does not provide an adequate factual basis to meet the requirements of <em>Care, </em>Article 45(a), UCMJ, and R.C.M. 910(e). <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>57 M.J. 236, 238-39 (C.A.A.F.2002). Unlike Article 86(1), UCMJ, (failure to go to an appointed place of duty), Article 86(2), UCMJ, (going from an appointed place of duty), requires a soldier <em>to report </em>at the \u201ccertain time and place,\u201d then depart from that place of duty. The Specification of Additional Charge I, as alleged on the charge sheet, does not reflect a specific time, but only states \u201ca doctor\u2019s appointment at Based upon appellant\u2019s assertions during the plea inquiry, the military judge twice advised, and appellant agreed, that his time and place of duty was a 1300 doctor\u2019s appointment at the hospital. Therefore, the time agreed to by the parties and reinforced by the military judge\u2019s description of the elements, established appellant\u2019s \u201ccertain time\u201d of duty as 1300. [WBAMC]:</p>\n<p id=\"Al_\">Appellant did not admit he was required to be at the hospital at 0845 when he was dropped off. Appellant merely agreed that a \u201cmedical authority\u201d required him to be present for his 1300 doctor\u2019s appointment at WBAMC. Appellant\u2019s statements during the providence inquiry indicate he did not understand he was reporting to his place of duty, a 1300 doctor\u2019s appointment at WBAMC, when he arrived over four hours early. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s responses to the military judge\u2019s questions regarding his departure from the hospital set up matters inconsistent with his guilty plea.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the record of trial raises a substantial, unresolved qu\u00e9stion of law and fact as to the providence of appellant\u2019s guilty plea to a violation of Article 86(2), UCMJ. <em>See Jordan, </em>57 M.J. at 238; <em>Prater, </em>32 M.J. at 436. We will set aside and dismiss this specification in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"akl-dedup-1\">IV. Trial on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"APc\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfV\">Appellant pleaded guilty to Specifications 1 and 3 of Additional Charge III, failure to obey a lawful order by consuming alcohol in violation of Policy Letter 1-7 by Headquarters, 1-56 Air Defense Artillery Regiment, Subject: Alcohol and Tobacco Policy (13 July 1999) [hereinafter Policy Letter 1-7], para. 4c,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on or about 17 August 2001 and 14 July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>2001, respectively. Policy Letter 1-7 was attached to the stipulation of fact and, during the plea inquiry, the military judge took judicial notice of this policy letter without defense objection. During the plea inquiry, appellant admitted that on 14 July 2001 and 17 August 2001, he was an IET student subject to the alcohol prohibition and had a duty to obey the \u201cno alcohol policy.\u201d However, appellant indicated he had no knowledge of this policy at the time he violated the order, and further stated that he never read the policy. The military judge subsequently responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-4\">Counsel, based on the statements of the accused, I have two problems and two concerns. First, he\u2019s admitted under oath that he had full knowledge of the order on the 14th of July and the 17th of August, and he\u2019s just told me that he didn\u2019t have knowledge of the order. He was told he was supposed to read it, but didn\u2019t have knowledge. Second of all, he can\u2019t be provident to Specifications 1 and 3 of Additional Charge III. I don\u2019t think that that can be cured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">I\u2019ll continue on with the providence inquiry, and then give you a chance to tell me what you want me to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Later in the plea inquiry, the military judge stated, \u201cCounsel, before I go through one more time on the elements, I believe the offenses that were problematic \u2014 Specifications 1 and 3 of Additional Charge III, I don\u2019t believe the accused can be provident to those.\u201d Trial counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">With regards to Specification 1 of [Additional] Charge III, the date alleged there is the 17th of August, which is after the 14 July 2001 \u2014 the accused did state that upon getting in trouble for violating the alcohol policy, he was instructed to read the battalion memorandum, the battalion orders. The government doesn\u2019t feel that he is improvident on that charge, because it was his duty and responsibility to know those orders after being advised that those orders did exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Trial defense counsel agreed. The military judge again discussed appellant\u2019s knowledge of the policy, and appellant admitted that after the 14 July incident he was aware of the alcohol prohibition. After a R.C.M. 802 conference with the parties, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-11\">MJ: That leaves us with ... Specification \u2014 I believe it is \u2014 1 [sic] of Additional Charge III, that I indicated that based on the responses of the accused, I was having difficulty \u2014 I would\u2019ve had difficulty finding him provident as to those specifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Government, where are we at?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-13\">TC: Your Honor, in accordance with the understanding of the 802 session, the government will not offer any evidence on any of the charges to which the accused has pled not guilty. However, we do intend to offer evidence regarding Specification 3 of Additional Charge III____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-15\">MJ: Does that \u2014 Captain Weiss, do you agree that\u2019s the gist of what we discussed in the 802 session?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-16\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">The military judge subsequently discussed appellant\u2019s pretrial agreement with appellant. The military judge told appellant, \u201cyou agree to plead guilty as your counsel has indicated, and I\u2019ve already informed you that I did not find you to be provident to Specification 3 ... of Additional Charge III. Did you understand what you\u2019d be required to plead guilty to at the time you signed this agreement?\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant stated, \u2018Yes, Your Hon- or.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Despite having twice informed appellant he found his plea of guilty to Specification 3 of Additional Charge III improvident,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the military judge failed to enter a plea of not guilty to that specification or give appellant the opportunity to do so. The military judge then asked if the government intended to \u201cprove up Specification 3 of Additional Charge III.\u201d Trial counsel responded affirmatively. The military judge stated, \u2018With that in mind, I propose that we delete paragraph six on page two of the stipulation of fact, since the accused can\u2019t be provident along those lines.\u201d With the agreement of the parties, he did so. There was no discussion regarding Policy Letter 1-7 that was attached to the stipulation of fact or of the fact that, as part of the plea inquiry, the military judge took judicial notice of the policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ax8C\">The government subsequently called only one witness, First Sergeant (1SG) Thompson, to prove appellant violated the \u201cno alcohol policy\u201d on 14 July 2001 (Specification 3 of Additional Charge III). First Sergeant Thompson\u2019s testimony only addressed appellant\u2019s knowledge of the policy and status as an IET soldier. During 1SG Thompson\u2019s cross-examination, trial defense counsel alluded to \u201cthe incident at [PVT] Nalos\u2019 house\u201d on 14 July 2001, but no evidence was presented regarding how appellant violated the policy. First Sergeant Thompson\u2019s testimony was the only evidence presented on the merits; the defense did not present any evidence. During argument on findings, trial defense counsel reminded the military judge that \u201cduring [the] providence inquiry\u201d he \u201cheard [appellant\u2019s] testimony\u201d regarding knowledge of the order. Thereafter, the military judge found appellant guilty of Specification 3 of Additional Charge III.</p>\n<p id=\"Act\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4q\">Article 66(c), UCMJ, imposes upon this court the duty to affirm only those findings of guilty we find correct in law and fact. We must conduct an independent review of both the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence. In doing so, our court reviews de novo the legal and factual sufficiency of the case. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>57 M.J. 394, 399 (C.A.A.F.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">The test for legal sufficiency is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational fact finder could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>60 M.J. 495, 497 (C.A.A.F.2005) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed.2d 560 (1979)). When applying this test, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference from the record in favor of the prosecution. <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 M. J. 281, 284 (C.M.A.1991). The test for factual sufficiency is whether, after weighing the evidence of record and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, we are convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987). In sum, to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction, we must find that the government has proven all essential elements and, taken together as a whole, the parcels of proof credibly and coherently demonstrate that appellant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Roukis, </em>60 M.J. 925, 930 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2005), <em>aff'd, </em>2005 CAAF LEXIS 1009 (C.A.A.F. 9 Sept. 2005) (decision without published opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">Article 92(2), UCMJ, provides, \u201cAny person subject to this chapter who ... having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order ... shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d This offense has four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>(a) That a member of the armed forces issued a certain lawful order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-4\">(b) That the accused had knowledge of the order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">(c) That the accused had a duty to obey the order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-6\">(d) That the accused failed to obey the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-7\"><em>MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 16b(2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cto be guilty of this offense, a person must have had actual knowledge of the order or regulation.

R. Evid.] 410(a)(1) and (3); <em>United States v. Heirs, </em>29 M.J. 68, 69 (C.M.A.1989) (\u201c[A]ny statement made by an accused during a providence hearing incident to a tendered plea of guilty is inadmissible if the plea is withdrawn. By implication the same is required if the plea is not accepted by the military judge.\u201d); <em>United States v. Shackelford, </em>2 M.J. 17 (C.M.A.1976) (implying violation of Article 45(a) where evidence from rejected plea inquiry used to convict or impeach accused); <em>United States v. Wahnon, </em>1 M.J. 144, 145 (C.M.A.1975) (stating guilty plea to one charge may not be used as evidence to establish separate charge to which plea of not guilty was entered); <em>United States v.

[I]t may not be used to prove a separate offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">In appellant\u2019s case, the military judge apparently found appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to Specification 3 of Additional Charge III improvident, but did not ensure a plea of not guilty was entered in the record. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 45(a). More important, without including the evidence obtained during the plea inquiry, the elements of failure to obey a lawful order are not met. The government presented no evidence on the merits as to how, when, or where appellant violated the order. The military judge properly deleted paragraph six in the stipulation of fact pertaining to Specification 3 of Additional Charge III.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, the stipulation of fact and the statements appellant made during the plea inquiry constitute the only evidence in the record explaining appellant\u2019s failure to obey Policy Letter 1-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Appellant does not now assert that the military judge improperly considered his statements made during the plea inquiry.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>We will presume the military judge knew and understood the limitations of Mil. R. Evid. 410(a)(1) and (3). <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 M.J. 87, 90 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Mason, </em>45 M.J. 483, 484 (C.A.A.F.1997)) (\u201cMilitary judges are presumed to know the law and to follow it absent clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d); <em>United States v.

Article 13, UCMJ</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), appellant asserts that \u201che should have received Article 13 credit for being shackled to a cot [for eight hours] in \u2018The Ice House.\u2019\u201d Appellate government counsel respond without elaboration that the issues submitted under <em>Grostefon, supra, </em>lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Trial defense counsel made a motion for appropriate relief requesting credit for violations of Article 13, UCMJ. He requested credit for incidents involving the first sergeant calling appellant names, transporting appellant while shackled and in an improperly adorned uniform (without name tag and rank), and for appellant\u2019s \u201cleft arm and right leg [being] shackled to a cot\u201d while being held overnight in the barracks as a pretrial confinement prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">We adopt the following findings of fact made by the military judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-14\">On or about 16 January 2002, the accused was transported back to Fort Bliss from Fort Knox for the Article 32 investigation relating to the additional charges in this case. Because the Provost Marshal [detention] cell was full, the accused was placed in a utility room on the first floor of his barracks. The room was called the Ice House because an ice-making machine was housed inside the room. It was well known to those in the unit. The room also contained a metal cot, several tables, as well as barracks maintenance equipment. There is no latrine in the room. The [charge of quarters (CQ) ] desk was located 10-20 feet away from the door to the room. The duty drill sergeant\u2019s office was located another 10 feet from the CQ desk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">The military judge also found that appellant arrived between 2200 and <em>2300, </em>was \u201csecured with leg irons to one of the legs of the cot,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that SFC Wyatt \u201chad to wake [appellant] in the morning at approximately 0630.\u201d Sergeant First Class Wyatt, PVT MacMahan, and two CQ runners were in \u201cclose proximity to the room [appellant] was billeted in throughout the evening.\u201d Sergeant First Class Wyatt and PVT MacMahan also checked on appellant on several occasions \u201cduring the course of the evening.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The utility room door remained \u201copen throughout the night\u201d except between 0430 and 0730 on 17 January when soldiers were performing physical training. During that time, appellant testified that no one could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>hear him call out for assistance. Prior to appellant\u2019s placement in the \u201cIce House,\u201d PVT Rasch, another soldier in the unit, was placed there when the detention cell was full. The military judge found that \u201c[PVT] Rasch, who had been ordered into pretrial confinement by his battery commander, was not placed in hand irons while he was billeted in the room, and escaped out of one of the room\u2019s windows, which did not have any security bars.\u201d We also adopt these findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Applying these facts, the military judge made the following legal conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">The conditions surrounding [appellant\u2019s] shackling to the cot were not unduly harsh and were reasonably related to military command and control needs, particularly in light of the fact that the [Provost Marshal detention cell] was not available to billet [appellant] for the evening in question ... [and] the conditions were not implemented with intent to punish or stigmatize [appellant] while he was facing disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The military judge granted five days of credit for the name calling and \u201cpublic denunciation\u201d in violation of Article 13, UCMJ, but no credit for having been shackled to the cot.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Unlawful pretrial punishment or confinement issues involve mixed questions of law and fact. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>53 M.J. 168, 170 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>United States v. McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. 162, 164-65 (C.A.A.F.1997). Our court conducts a de novo review of conclusions of law. <em>See Smith, </em>53 M.J. at 170; <em>McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. at 167. We will defer to the military judge\u2019s findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous and apply those facts in our review. <em>See United States v. King, </em>61 M.J. 225, 227 (C.A.A.F.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Article 13, UCMJ, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWu\">No person, while being held for trial, may be subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to insure his presence, but he may be subjected to minor punishment during that period for infractions of discipline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Thus, Article 13, UCMJ, prohibits: (1) purposefully imposing punishment or penalty on an accused before guilt is established at trial, that is, illegal pretrial punishment, and (2) arrest or pretrial confinement conditions more rigorous than circumstances require to ensure an accused\u2019s presence at trial, that is, illegal pretrial confinement. <em>See United States v. Fischer, </em>61 M.J. 415, 418 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>United States v. Inong, </em>58 M.J. 460, 463 (C.A.A.F.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Fricke, </em>53 M.J. 149, 154 (C.A.A.F.2000)). If an appellant can establish that either prohibition was violated, he is entitled to sentence relief. <em>Inong, </em>58 M.J. at 463 (citing <em>United States v. Mosby, </em>56 M.J. 309, 310 (C.A.A.F.2000)); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 905(c)(2). We will address appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement conditions under both prongs. <em>See McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">First, we must decide whether appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement conditions constitute illegal pretrial punishment or constitute legally permissible restraint. In doing so, we must determine whether the conditions are imposed \u201c \u2018for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Palmiter, </em>20 M.J. 90, 99 (C.M.A.1985) (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result) (quoting <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 538, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). Moreover, \u201c[o]ne significant factor, but not the only one, in determining whether the conditions or terms of confinement violate Article 13 is the intent of the detention officials.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>28 M.J. 214, 216 (C.M.A.1989). Additionally, if the particular condition of pretrial confinement is reasonably related to a legitimate government objective, and is reasonable under the circumstances, without more, it does not amount to punishment. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>25 M.J. 326, 331 n. 4 (C.M.A.1987); <em>Palmiter, </em>20 M.J. at 99. Imposing \u201cunduly rigorous circumstances during pretrial detention [may,] in sufficiently egregious circumstances, ... give rise to a permissible inference that an accused is being punished, or may be so excessive as to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tute punishment.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. at 165; <em>see also </em>R.C.M. 304(f); <em>James, </em>28 M.J. at 216; <em>Palmiter, </em>20 M.J. at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We do not find that appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement conditions \u2014 being temporarily housed and shackled in a barracks utility room \u2014 constitute illegal pretrial punishment. We agree with the military judge\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement \u201cconditions were not implemented with intent to punish or stigmatize\u201d appellant. Our review of the record indicates that unit officials did not place appellant in the \u201cIce House\u201d to punish or inflict any penalty upon him. The record establishes appellant was a pretrial prisoner who could not be secured in the detention cell overnight. Furthermore, unit officials did not want appellant to escape from the same room from which an unshackled pretrial prisoner previously escaped.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">Thus, we find no clear abuse of the military judge\u2019s discretion in his conclusion that appellant\u2019s [pretrial confinement conditions were] not done with any intent to punish appellant or inflict any penalty upon him for his alleged underlying misconduct, and that no impermissible \u2018punishment or penalty5 actually occurred as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-7\"><em>McCarthy, </em>47 M.J. at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We must next determine if appellant\u2019s shackling to a barracks room cot was \u201cmore rigorous\u201d confinement \u201cthan ... required to insure\u201d appellant\u2019s presence. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 13. Army Reg. 190-47, Military Police: The Army Corrections System, para. 3-lc (15 Aug. 1996), requires a pretrial prisoner be housed in a detention cell or in a local civilian facility with which the installation has an agreement. According to the regulation, leg and hand irons are appropriate for pretrial prisoners in transit. <em>See id. </em>at paras. ll-3b(2), 11 \u2014 3b(6), and 11-9. Appellant was not in transit; the barracks room provided temporary housing for a pretrial prisoner. <em>See id. </em>at para. 15-5 (defining temporary confinement); <em>see also id. </em>at para. 9-7e (prohibiting \u201csecuring a prisoner to a fixed object\u201d while in a confinement facility except in emergency situations) and para. 11-9 (\u201cGuards will not secure prisoners to any portion of an aircraft----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">The record contains no evidence indicating appellant was a flight risk or posed a risk to others. Moreover, the record does not reflect any violent, predatory, or excessively dangerous criminal behavior by appellant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, if unit officials believed appellant was a flight risk, other methods of restraint were available. The military judge found that at least four soldiers were on duty in the barracks building the entire night, and were within ten to twenty feet from appellant while he slept shackled to the cot.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>one of these soldiers \u2014 or any other properly supervised soldier in the same barracks \u2014 in the room with appellant overnight could have easily served the purpose of securing appellant\u2019s presence at his Article 32, UCMJ, hearing the following morning. Despite the apparent availability of unit personnel to provide for this lesser form of restraint, appellant was severely restrained without an individualized showing of cause that he would flee or otherwise fail to present himself the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">While we do not find that shackling a pretrial prisoner to a cot is per se unduly harsh, we are not persuaded that appellant\u2019s shackling was required to ensure he did not escape through an unsecured window as did an unshackled PVT Rasch awaiting pretrial confinement at a regular facility.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Such restraint was, therefore, not required to ensure appellant\u2019s presence at his pretrial Article 32, UCMJ, hearing scheduled the next day. <em>See generally Smith, </em>53 M.J. at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find that shackling appellant to the cot was a confinement condition \u201cmore rigorous than the circumstances required to insure his presence.\u201d UCMJ art. 13. Although appellant does not request a specific remedy, we will award ten days of confinement credit for the unusually harsh circumstances of appellant\u2019s pretrial confinement while awaiting his Article 32, UCMJ, investigative hearing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Spaustat, </em>57 M.J. 256, 261-62 (C.A.A.F.2002) (stating R.C.M. 305(k) \u201cspecifically authorizes more than day-for-day credit\u201d for unduly harsh conditions of pretrial confinement); <em>see also United States v. Rendon, </em>58 M.J. 221, 224-25 (C.A.A.F.2003) (finding R.C.M. 305(k) credit appropriate remedy for physical restraint).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Appellant\u2019s remaining assertions made pursuant to <em>Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. at 435-37, are without merit. The court orders that Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge III be merged into modified Specification 1 of Charge III, and be redesignated as the Specification of Charge III, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-10\">In that Private First Class Aaron P. Gilchrist, U.S. Army, did, at or near Fort Bliss, Texas, on or about 21 July 2001, steal $30.00 of U.S. currency and Xanax tablets of a value of about $20.00, the property of PVT RR, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">The findings of guilty of the Specification of Charge III, as redesignated, are affirmed. The finding of guilty of Specification 2 of Charge III is set aside and that specification is dismissed. The findings of guilty of Additional Charge I and its specification are set aside and are dismissed. The finding of guilty of Specification 3 of Additional Charge III is set aside and that specification is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the errors noted, the entire record, and applying the principles of <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A.1986), the court affirms only so much of the sentence as provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for twelve months and twenty days, and reduction to Private El. Appellant will also be credited with 177 days of confinement credit. All rights, privileges, and property, of which appellant has been deprived by virtue of that portion of his sentence set aside by this decision, are ordered restored, as mandated by Articles 58b(c) and 75(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Judge ZOLPER and Judge WALBURN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-14\">.
