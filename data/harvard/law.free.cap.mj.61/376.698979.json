The convening authority approved the sentence of twenty years of confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to E-l, and a dishonorable discharge. The United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. <em>United States v. Best, </em>No. ARMY 9701222 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Mar. 8, 2000) [hereinafter <em>Best </em>/]. After Appellant raised issues of mental competence and responsibility for the first time before this Court, we returned the record to the Army Judge Advocate General on November 21, 2000, for conduct of a mental examination under Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 706. <em>United States v. Best, </em>54 M.J. 367 (C.A.A.F.2000) (order granting additional inquiry into Appellant\u2019s mental capacity). That examination was conducted at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on March 12, 2001, by a board consisting of a psychiatrist and two psychologists, who agreed that: in 1997, Appellant was not suffering from severe mental disease or defect, nor was he \u201cunable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct\u201d; and at the time of the board, Appellant was suffering from \u201cSchizophrenia, Catatonic Type Remission\u201d and was able to \u201cunderstand and cooperate in the appellate proceeding.\u201d After reviewing those proceedings, this Court again set aside the lower court\u2019s decision on December 20, 2001, questioning the reliability of the sanity board report on the basis of an alleged conflict of interest created by membership on the board of two psychotherapists who had previously assessed Appellant\u2019s mental condition. This Court ordered the Army Court of Criminal Appeals to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">(1) Was there an actual conflict of interest [involving Drs. Galloway and Kirubakaran] sufficient to undermine the reliability of the sanity board\u2019s findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">(2) Was appellant aware of the potential conflict of interest at the time of the sanity board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">(3) If so, did appellant have an opportunity to raise the issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">(4) Did appellant waive [any] conflict of interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">That, if the court concludes that there was a conflict of interest that was not waived and further concludes that the findings of the sanity board are not reliable because of a conflict of interest, the court will order another sanity board; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">That, after resolving the above issues, the court will determine whether appellant has the mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings. If so, the court will determine whether the evidence regarding appellant\u2019s mental responsibility at the time of the offenses warrants setting aside the findings and sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\"><em>United States v. Best, </em>56 M.J. 251 (C.A.A.F.2001) (order setting aside decision of Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>Best I </em>and returning record for further fact-finding) (citation omitted). After reviewing the findings of the hearing convened pursuant to <em>United States v. DuBay, </em>17 C.M.A. 147, 37 C.M.R. 411 (1967), the court below again affirmed the findings and sentence. <em>United States v. Best, </em>59 M.J. 886 (A.Ct.Crim.App.2004)[here-inafter <em>Best II]. On July </em>23, 2004, this Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">WHETHER THE UNITED STATES ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THERE WAS NO ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST INVOLVING MEMBERS ON APPELLANT\u2019S SANITY BOARD SUFFICIENT TO UNDERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF THE SANITY BOARD\u2019S FINDINGS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">We conclude for the reasons set forth below, the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We accept the factual determinations of the court below, which we include here for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">At about midnight on 5 April 1997, appellant went to the Happy Night Disco in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, with Specialist (SPC) Fowlkes and SPC Wright. At approximately 0200 hrs, 6 April 1997, SPC Brown accidentally bumped into appellant. SPC Brown apologized and turned away from appellant. Appellant grabbed SPC Brown by the arm, turned him around, and struck him in the face with a tall, heavy, beer glass. The glass broke on impact and cut completely through SPC Brown\u2019s cheek to his teeth. This injury required four stitches and left a permanent one-quarter to one-half inch scar on SPC Brown\u2019s face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">After appellant hit SPC Brown, several of the people near them attempted to restrain appellant. Appellant departed that area of the club and took off his easily recognizable, red and white stripe shirt and placed it under his white t-shirt. Shortly thereafter, appellant and SPC Fowlkes departed the club and waited for SPC Wright near the club entrance. A few minutes later, SPC Wright joined them and stated \u201ca guy inside the club [] told three patrons to follow [appellant] and see where he was going, and hold him until they got out there[.]\u201d Appellant asked to see SPC Fowlkes\u2019 \u201cbuck knife.\u201d Specialist Fowlkes gave it to him and appellant placed it in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Appellant, SPC Fowlkes, and SPC Wright then proceeded toward SPC Wright\u2019s automobile. Private First Class (PFC) Little, SPC Bos, and SPC Woods caught up with appellant and his friends. Private First Class Little grabbed appellant by the arm, turned him around, and said, \u201c[Y]ou need to come back with us. You just busted a dude in the face and you need to come back with us, the MPs are on their way.\u201d Appellant pulled away from PFC Little and said, \u2018You need to back off me. Just get away,\u201d and walked across the street to SPC Wright\u2019s car. Appellant stated that he just wanted to leave. Private First Class Little again approached appellant and told him \u201c[C]ome back; you got to be a man and live up to what you did.\u201d Private First Class Little pushed appellant back a couple of feet and appellant came back at him. They started wrestling and punching. Private First Class Little dropped to his knees and said \u201cOh, you got to use a knife.\u201d Appellant replied, \u201c[Y]eah, mother[******].\u201d Specialist Bos then came toward appellant. As SPC Bos did so, he put his hand behind his back and pretended to be holding a knife. Specialist Bos stated the following to appellant: \u201cOh, you gotta use a knife. I\u2019m gonna show you a knife.\u201d Appellant turned and ran to SPC Wright\u2019s car and departed with his friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Lieutenant Colonel Marzouk, a forensic pathologist, testified that he conducted an autopsy on PFC Little\u2019s body. Private First Class Little was stabbed a total of twelve times \u2014 in the heart, left lung, left arm, left armpit, and forearm. The fatal stab wound was to the left axilla, armpit, which lacerated a major vein and artery. Private First Class Little died as a result of blood loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-10\"><em>Best I, </em>slip op. at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Similarly, we accept the additional factual determinations of the lower court in its April 12,2004, decision that are pertinent to Appellant\u2019s claim of a fatal conflict of interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">On or about 30 September 1997, appellant arrived at the USDB [United States Disciplinary Barracks], Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Upon his arrival, he, like all inmates, went through a three-week reception process. The reception process included a battery of tests to determine appellant\u2019s current psychological state. All USDB inmates are assigned case providers. Because appellant\u2019s test results did not indicate that his ease provider needed to be a psychologist, he was assigned a mental health technician as his case provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">Sometime in the spring or summer of 1999, appellant began \u201cspeaking in tongues\u201d and, infrequently, fell into trances. Appellant expressed a belief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>he \u201cwould be delivered from confinement and received into heaven on the evening of the new millennium.\u201d Appellant\u2019s conduct was not disruptive until his belief was not confirmed and the millennium passed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">In January 2000, appellant was on the \u201cblotter\u201d for two separate incidents of disobedience and he began \u201cspeaking in tongues\u201d more frequently. Appellant\u2019s case provider requested an assessment of appellant to determine whether appellant was suffering from some type of psychosis or a religious calling. Doctor Ellen Galloway<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was directed to assess appellant to determine the cause of his disruptive behavior. Before she met appellant, Dr. Galloway: 1) discussed his status with the head chaplain and three mental health technicians; 2) reviewed his mental health records; 3) reviewed the battery of psychological tests administered to him during the reception process;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 4) researched \u201cspeaking in tongues\u201d on an Assemblies of God web page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">On 26 January 2000, Dr. Galloway met with appellant while he was in his cell. The purpose of the meeting was to make initial contact with appellant, to gather preliminary data, and to advise appellant that she planned to spend extensive time the following day conducting a full assessment of him. Appellant refused to discuss his \u201cspeaking in tongues,\u201d trances, or religious beliefs, and refused to cooperate with any psychological testing or with the clinical interview. Appellant smiled, stated God was taking care of him, and told Dr. Galloway that he did not need any mental health intervention. He turned his head sideways and muttered \u201cnonsensical\u201d syllables for approximately ten seconds. After approximately five to ten minutes, appellant told Dr. Galloway that he was uncomfortable and unwilling to talk to her. At that point, Dr. Galloway stopped the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">On 28 January 2000, Dr. Galloway prepared a memorandum for the USDB Commandant regarding appellant\u2019s mental status. In it, Dr. Galloway stated that without more cooperation, she could not determine the driving force behind appellant\u2019s behavior. She decided that the most likely reasons for his disruptive behavior were the result of two combined factors, \u201ctraits of a personality disorder and malingering.\u201d Doctor Galloway further concluded, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">The personality disorder would have been sub-clinical in nature and exacerbated by his confinement. This would have been intensified further when his expectation of deliverance was not realized. The rigidity inherent in personality disorders would explain why he persists with his behavior despite starting to experience adverse consequences. The malingering would explain why his behavior does not follow the pattern that [the head chaplain] stated he would have expected from an individual who speaks in tongues. It would also explain his refusal to cooperate with any form of assessment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">Doctor Galloway recommended, at that time, that any further disruptive or disobedient behavior should be treated as a custody and control issue rather than a mental health or religious issue. She stated that all inmates, regardless of their mental status, are expected to comply with the USDB regulations, but that a psychological issue could result in mitigating punitive action. Doctor Galloway even suggested that she be called as a witness at any board to explain the mental health circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">By 3 April 2000, appellant was non-communicative with the USDB non-commissioned officers, had been on the \u201cblotter\u201d for more disruptive behavior, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201cbeen refusing to eat or drink for ... three or four days.\u201d A physician\u2019s assistant, who was appointed to treat appellant during his hunger strike, was alarmed with appellant\u2019s behavior and refused to engage in the hunger strike protocol until appellant was psychiatrically cleared. Doctor Galloway called Dr. Kirubakaran<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and asked him to meet with appellant on an emergency consultation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">Doctor Kirubakaran immediately met with appellant in his cell. Appellant refused to look at Dr. Kirubakaran, did not respond to any of his instructions, kept his face covered with a blanket, constantly talked to himself, and rocked his body. Because Dr. Kirubakaran was unable to fully assess appellant\u2019s mental or physical condition, he recommended appellant be sent to the nearest emergency room for a complete examination. Later, Dr. Kiruba-karan diagnosed appellant with a \u201cpsychotic disorder [not otherwise specified] and concerns about catatonia.\u201d He had appellant admitted to the psychiatric services section of the Leavenworth Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">The VA hospital staff initially determined that appellant was depressed and was, perhaps, \u201cplaying games\u201d with them. The VA put appellant on anti-psychotic and mood stabilizing drugs. Appellant seemed aware of his surroundings because he shook his head \u201cno\u201d when asked about taking his medication and allowed the nursing staff to take his vital signs and blood. Between 5 and 6 April 2000, Dr. Galloway made more than ten phone calls to the VA doctors and nurses, and Dr. Kirubakaran, discussing appellant\u2019s physical and mental condition. The VA nurse working with appellant raised, with Dr. Galloway, the issue of appellant\u2019s actions as malingering. On 6 April 2000, the VA discharged appellant and he returned to the USDB. The VA\u2019s chief of psychiatric services stated that \u201c1) Inmate Best was not catatonic[;] 2) Inmate Best was not in the middle of an acute psychotic episode[;] and 3) that he was filling an isolation room that another patient might need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">By 17 April 2000, appellant was again non-communicative, frequently shaking and covering his head with a blanket, and most of the time refusing to eat or drink. Doctor Galloway once more requested that Dr. Kirubakaran assess appellant. Doctor Kirubakaran met with appellant at appellant\u2019s cell for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Appellant appeared to be psychotic and agitated. Doctor Kirubakar-an did not develop a treatment plan for appellant, however, because he was told that appellant was to be transferred to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisons (Federal Medical Center) in Springfield, Missouri, because of his refusal to eat or drink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">On 26 April 2000, appellant was transferred to the Federal Medical Center. Initially, Dr. Robert Denny, a staff psychologist, assessed appellant and concluded that he probably had a serious psychotic disorder. Doctor Denny transferred him to the psychiatric hospital for closer observation to accurately diagnose appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">On 28 April 2000, appellant met Dr. Richard Frederick, a staff psychologist board certified in forensic psychology. Doctor Frederick was appellant\u2019s primary clinician \u2014 responsible for conducting assessments and determining appellant\u2019s mental health status \u2014 for approximately four months. Doctor Tom Mallory, Chief of Psychiatry, assisted in assessing and medicating appellant. Initially, they hypothesized that appellant may have been faking his illness. After weeks of observation, however, they determined that their hypothesis was illogical. \u201cHis condition was very, very serious. He was not eating. He was not responding rationally or even at all, at times. He was demonstrating very strange postural changes and mannerisms that were indicative of probably the most severe psychotic disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>In early May 2000, Drs. Mallory and Frederick started appellant on an involuntary, non-consensual medication regimen because they considered appellant gravely disabled and without it, at risk of death. They began medicating appellant with very large doses of extremely powerful anti-psychotic drugs. Even with the medication, it took appellant approximately one month to respond to staff interactions in any consistent fashion. On 18 May 2000, Dr. Frederick diagnosed appellant as having \u201cSchizophrenia, catatonic type, in acute exacerbation[.]\u201d In early June, Drs. Mallory and Frederick augmented the anti-psychotic medication with anti-depressant medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Doctor Frederick advised Dr. Galloway that he thought it would be in appellant\u2019s best interest to continue his treatment at the Federal Medical Center. On 15 September 2000, a <em>Vitek </em>hearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was conducted at Fort Leavenworth. Doctor Frederick testified that appellant suffered from catatonic schizophrenia. He added that many of the symptoms of the mental disorder were currently in remission because of appellant\u2019s medication regimen. Because Dr. Galloway had not had any personal contact with appellant since April 2000, she testified that she did not have a professional opinion as to appellant\u2019s current mental condition. After hearing all of the evidence, the military judge recommended that appellant remain at the Federal Medical Center for as long as the staff at the center determined it necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">Appellant continued his treatment at the Federal Medical Center from September 2000 until his transfer back to the USDB on 8 June 2001. Once he returned to the USDB, Dr. Kirubakaran began seeing him on a monthly basis. Appellant did \u201cextremely well,\u201d his medication was reduced, and he did not exhibit any of the symptoms he had before. Appellant was called to testify, by the defense, at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing. He discussed his relationships with Drs. Galloway and Kirubakaran, the <em>Vitek </em>hearing, and the sanity board. He answered all of the questions of the defense counsel, trial counsel, and military judge in a logical, coherent manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">59 M. J. at 888-91 (footnotes in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Appellant argues that R.C.M. 706 contains an implicit, per se prohibition of membership on a so-called \u201csanity board\u201d by any physician or psychologist who has previously \u201cdiagnosed and/or treated\u201d the subject of that board. In the alternative, we are urged to conclude that the results of the board convened under R.C.M. 706 to examine Appellant are fatally unreliable because of an actual or apparent conflict of interest on behalf of one or more members of that board.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">At the outset, we decline the Government\u2019s invitation to view both the question of whether a conflict of interest existed and the effect of any such conflict as questions solely of fact, and thus limit our review to a determination of whether the Army Court of Criminal Appeals abused its discretion in denying relief. While there are factual questions in issue, the lower court\u2019s interpretation of R.C.M. 706 and assessment of the reliability of trial proceedings are matters of law that we review de novo, not only because the lower court\u2019s decision constitutes the recognition and formulation of legal standards, but because \u201cthe reasoning upon which it is based shows it to be a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Benson, </em>3 C.M.A. 351, 354, 12 C.M.R. 107, 110 (1953). Consistent with other mixed questions of fact and law, the findings of fact made by the court below are accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>42 M.J. 360, 363 (C.A.A.F.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>A. NATURE OF AN R.C.M. 706 BOARD IN THE POST-TRIAL ARENA</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">A sanity board is a creature not of statute, but of executive order and long-standing military practice, dating to at least 1917. <em>See </em>Captain Charles E. Trant, <em>The American Military Insanity Defense: A Moral, Philosophical, and Legal Dilemma, </em>99 Mil. L.Rev. 1, 66 n. 349 (1983). Referring to sanity inquiries based on the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (MCM)( </em>1951 ed.), para. 121, this Court has held that \u201c[m]edieal board proceedings, of course, are not judicial in nature, purpose, or effect; they are entirely administrative.\u201d <em>United States v. Erb, </em>12 C.M.A. 524, 529-30, 31 C.M.R. 110, 115-6 (1961). By comparing the participation of Drs. Galloway and Kirubakaran in Appellant\u2019s R.C.M. 706 board to a trial judge who reviews his own rulings, Appellant fails to recognize the distinction between administrative and judicial bodies. As an administrative board, whose members are typically appointed by a medical commander and not by the convening authority, and whose findings do not bind the court-martial in its determination of either competence (R.C.M. 909(e)) or mental responsibility (R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(C) and 921(e)(4)), a board convened under R.C.M. 706 cannot be analogized to a court of members. For example, doctors serving on an R.C.M. 706 board would not only be granted access to an appellant\u2019s prior medical records, including previous diagnoses by other doctors, but would be encouraged to read those prior records to develop a full picture of an appellant\u2019s mental history. Thus, in this case, Drs. Galloway and Kiruba-karan would have access to previous diagnoses of Appellant regardless of whether they made those diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Nonetheless, we have frequently recognized the important protections afforded by R.C.M. 706 and its predecessors to service-members facing the court-martial process. We have emphasized the responsibility of the convening authority and the military judge to order a sanity board when required, as well as the duty of all participants in the process to bring to the attention of the convening authority or military judge any condition or behavior that may reasonably call into question the mental responsibility or competence of an accused. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>60 M.J. 261 (C.A.A.F.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Although post-trial R.C.M. 706 boards are not expressly sanctioned by the rule (or by its predecessors, <em>MCM </em>(1951 ed.), para. 121, and <em>MCM </em>(1969 ed.), para. 121), this Court has historically addressed issues associated with such boards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">In the Uniform Code of Military Justice, sanity is mentioned directly only with respect to trial proceedings, and not at all in connection with post-trial review. <em>See </em>Articles 51 and 52, 50 USC \u00a7\u00a7 626 and 627. Paragraph 121 of the 1951 Manual is entitled \u201cInquiry before Trial\u201d \u2014 and therefore, on its face, would appear to be inapplicable to mental disease first appearing during the appellate process, and not present either at the time of the crime or that of the trial. However, this same Manual division is referenced in paragraph 124, which is concerned with the post-trial action of the convening, or of higher, authority. This mention we construe to be directed to insuring that, in a proper case, the convening authority will direct the convention of a medical board of inquiry \u2014 as provided in paragraph 121 \u2014 -for the purpose of answering three questions concerning the accused\u2019s mental condition. The first two of these have to do with mental <em>responsibility </em>for the crime; the third concerns mental <em>capacity </em>and is phrased as follows: \u201cDoes the accused possess sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and intelligently to conduct or cooperate in his defense (120c)?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\"><em>United States v. Washington, </em>6 C.M.A. 114, 118, 19 C.M.R. 240, 244 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Further, \u201cwhen not restrained by the 2-year limitation of Article 73, [UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 873] we have given preferential treatment to the question of mental responsibility when raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>50 M.J. 4, 15 (C.A.A.F.1998). In so doing, however, this Court has made plain that to constitute reversible error, the existence or outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a sanity board must have had a substantive effect on the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">It is true that, historically, sanity has occupied a special status in military law. However, to prevail on appeal an accused must convince an appellate court that a \u201cdifferent verdict might reasonably result\u201d if the trier of fact had evidence of a lack of mental responsibility that was not available for consideration at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>United States v. Breese, </em>47 M.J. 5, 6 (C.A.A.F.1997). <em>See also United States v. Young, </em>43 M.J. 196, 197 (C.A.A.F.1995); <em>United States v. Dock, </em>28 M.J. 117, 119, 120 (C.M.A.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B. QUALIFICATION AND DISQUALIFICATION OF SANITY BOARD MEMBERS</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">1. <em>Federal Civilian References</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Although applicable only by analogy, we note that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(b)(2000), provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">A psychiatric or psychological examination ordered pursuant to this chapter shall be conducted by a licensed or certified psychiatrist or psychologist, or, if the court finds it appropriate, by more than one such examiner. Each examiner shall be designated by the court, except that if the examination is ordered under section 4245 [commitment of those already imprisoned] or 4246 [commitment of prisoners due for release], upon the request of the defendant an additional examiner may be selected by the defendant ... Unless impracticable, the psychiatric or psychological examination shall be conducted in the suitable facility closest to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Neither this section nor Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2, on the same subject, precludes examination of a defendant by a psychotherapist who has previously assessed, examined, diagnosed, or treated that defendant. In fact, by allowing the defendant to pick his own additional examiner in certain situations, the statute appears to invite participation in the process by a treating psychotherapist, though not in the specific context of a pretrial sanity inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">New cases in the federal circuits have examined conflicts of interest involving psychotherapists, and none has considered the precise question of whether a psychotherapist who has entered even a limited practitioner-patient relationship should be excluded from participation in future, unbiased evaluations of that patient. Even so, we are aided by the logic of the Third and Seventh Circuits on related topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Addressing whether a treating physician should be allowed to testify as an expert witness for the patient he had treated, the Third Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">Opinions by physicians who have neither examined nor treated a patient \u201chave less probative force, as a general matter, then they would have if they had treated or examined him.\u201d <em>Wier ex rel. Wier v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 955, 963 (3d Cir.1984). In the context of social security disability eases, in fact, we afford greater weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Dorf v. Bowen, </em>794 F.2d 896 (3d Cir.1986); <em>Brewster v. Heckler, </em>786 F.2d 581 (3d Cir.1986). \u201cThe rationale for giving greater weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion is that he is employed to cure and has a greater opportunity to know and observe his patient ____\u201d <em>Sprague v.

Peters, </em>when invited to find a due process violation in the alleged incompetence of one or more of the psychiatrists appointed to examine that appellant, the Seventh Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-19\">[W]e would be reluctant to open up this type of <em>[Ake v.

Every aspect of a criminal case which involves the testimony of experts could conceivably be subject to such a review \u2014 a never[-]ending process. In this case, as the district court noted, three experienced, board-certified, independent practicing psychiatrists were appointed to examine the Petitioner. Each psychiatrist conducted a thorough examination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>submitted his diagnosis to the court ... Without regard to their ultimate diagnoses, we believe that this meets the requirements set forth in <em>Ake. </em>A conclusion to the contrary would require this court and other federal courts to engage in a form of \u201cpsychiatric medical malpractice\u201d review as part-and-parcel of its collateral review of state court judgments. The ultimate result would be a never-ending battle of psychiatrists appointed as experts for the sole purpose of discrediting a prior psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis. We do not believe this was the intent of the Court in <em>Ake </em>when it held that indigent defendants who raise a defense of insanity are entitled to psychiatric assistance in the preparation of their defense. Accordingly, we reject Petitioner\u2019s fourteenth amendment due process claim concerning the competence of the psychiatrists at his trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">905 F.2d 986, 1012-13 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">While the Seventh Circuit specifically noted that each of these psychiatrists was \u201cindependent\u201d \u2014 the quality Appellant claims is missing in his <em>ease </em>\u2014 we believe that reference was to the right to an expert independent of the prosecution established by <em>Ake: </em>\u201cIn the cases, \u2018independent\u2019 as opposed to \u2018neutral\u2019 means that the expert must be additional to, and separate from, court-appointed experts or experts engaged by the prosecution.\u201d <em>Orbe v.

Congress has established statutory qualifications for convening authorities (Articles 22, 23, 24, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 822, 823, 824 (2000)), court members (Article 25, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825 (2000)), military judges (Article 26, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 826 (2000)), trial and defense counsel (Article 27, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 827 (2000)), and investigating officers (Article 32, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832 (2000)). Congress provided for court reporters and interpreters (Article 28, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 828 (2000)) but left their qualifications to the service secretaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Likewise, pursuant to his authority under Article 36, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836 (2000), the President has promulgated the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial </em>establishing or embellishing qualifications for convening authorities, court members, military judges, counsel, court reporters, bailiffs, interpreters, escorts, clerks, and guards. <em>See generally </em>R.C.M., ch. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">R.C.M. 706 establishes requirements for sanity boards, including membership qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\"><em>By whom conducted. </em>When a mental examination is ordered under subsection (b) of this rule, the matter shall be referred to a board consisting of one or more persons. Each member of the board shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist. Normally, at least one member of the board shall be either a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist. The board shall report as to the mental capacity or mental responsibility or both of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">R.C.M. 706(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">R.C.M. 706 does not address professional conflicts of interest for sanity board members. Both the discussion and the drafter\u2019s analysis are silent on the issue. Neither the 1951 <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, </em>nor the May 1953 edition of the Department of the Army\u2019s Technical Manual (TM) 8-240, <em>Psychiatry in Military Law, </em>addressed conflicts of interest for sanity board members or prohibited appointment to such boards of mental health practitioners who may have previously diagnosed or treated an accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in 1961, this Court noted, without comment, the appointment of a treating psychiatrist to a \u201ccompetency board\u201d (predecessor of the R.C.M. 706 board) pursuant to a local <em>requirement </em>that the doctor \u201cpersonally responsible\u201d for the accused be a member of the board. <em>Erb, </em>12 C.M.A. at 529, 31 C.M.R. at 115. In fact, in <em>Erb, </em>the accused\u2019s psychiatrist was appointed as a member of the second competency board, notwithstanding his participation in the first board as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>psychiatrist who \u201cpresented the case to the board.\u201d <em>Erb, </em>12 C.M.A. at 529, 31 C.M.R. 115. This second board found that Sergeant Erb was a chronic schizophrenic, but could distinguish right from wrong and had an impaired ability to form the specific intent for \u201chomicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court\u2019s silence on the issue of board membership is noteworthy because, on appeal, one claim raised by Sergeant Erb was that improper command influence had affected the result of the second board appointed to inquire into his sanity. The defense contended that the board results had been manipulated \u201cwithout regard to their <em>reliability </em>or trustworthiness\u201d to ensure the trial and conviction of Sergeant Erb. <em>Erb, </em>12 C.M.A. at 530, 31 C.M.R. 116, (emphasis added). This Court\u2019s opinion did not question participation on the board by Sergeant Erb\u2019s treating psychiatrist. Finally, <em>Erb </em>cautions against looking for a \u201ccorrect\u201d diagnosis: \u201cPsychiatry is not an exact science; and individual psychiatrists may differ strongly in their findings regarding an accused.\u201d <em>Erb, </em>12 C.M.A. at 529, 31 C.M.R. at 115 (citing <em>United States v.

We are satisfied that their determinations are impartial and that they seek not to uncover evidence for the Government but truly to determine the mental condition of the accused ____ Military psychiatrists are paid by the Government, but so are defense counsel. We are certain that neither group shirks its professional responsibilities because they are employees of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-9\"><em>United States v.

Loving, </em>this Court declined to expand the membership requirements of R.C.M. 706:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">The next question is whether the requirements of RCM 706 (Change 3) have been met. RCM 706(c)(1) provides that an inquiry into mental capacity or mental responsibility \u201cshall be referred to a board consisting of one or more persons. Each member of the board shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-15\">We hold that the requirements of RCM 706(c)(1) have been met in appellant\u2019s case. A board consisting of a single psychiatrist would have satisfied the rule. Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that CPT Coleman had not received his Ph.D. degree at the time he participated in the board, there is nothing in the rule requiring that a \u201cclinical psychologist\u201d possess a Ph.D. The record before us reflects that CPT Coleman was a trained psychologist, was credentialed by Army medical authorities as a clinical psychologist, and was assigned to duties as a clinical psychologist. RCM 706 was amended in 1986 to parallel prevailing federal practice of allowing use of clinical psychologists in mental status evaluations. Drafters\u2019 Analysis of RCM 706(e)(1), Manual, supra at A21-36 (Change 3). Unlike 18 USC \u00a7 4247(b), RCM 706(c)(1) does not specify that the psychiatrist or psychologist performing the evaluation be \u201clicensed or certified.\u201d Nevertheless, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact that CPT Coleman was credentialed by military medical authorities to perform duties as a clinical psychologist raises a presumption that he was qualified to do so. <em>See United States v. Masusock, </em>1 U.S.C.M.A. 32, 35, 1 C.M.R. 32, 35 (1951) (\u201cpresumption of regularity in the conduct of governmental affairs\u201d).

Psychologists must always be sensitive to the potential harmful effects of other contacts on their work and on those persons with whom they deal. A psychologist refrains from entering into or promising another personal, scientific, professional, financial, or other relationship with such persons if it appears likely that such a relationship reasonably might impair the psychologist\u2019s objectivity or otherwise interfere with the psychologist\u2019s effectively performing his or her functions as a psychologist, or might harm or exploit the other party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">(b) Likewise, whenever feasible, a psychologist refrains from taking on professional or scientific obligations when pre-existing relationships would create a risk of such harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">(c) If a psychologist finds that, due to unforeseen factors, a potentially harmful multiple relationship has arisen, the psychologist attempts to resolve it with due regard for the best interests of the affected person and maximal compliance with the Ethics Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">7.02 Forensic Assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">(b) ... psychologists provide written or oral forensic reports or testimony of the psychological characteristics of an individual only after they have conducted an examination of the individual adequate to support their statements or conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Both Drs. Galloway and Kirubakaran testified that they were aware of these guidelines, had considered them, and had concluded that no conflict of interest existed. No case law, commentary, or analysis is available to enlighten our consideration of their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">While not in force at the time of Appellant\u2019s sanity board, the 2003 revision of the APA ethical standard for multiple relationships is enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">3.05 Multiple relationships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">(a) A multiple relationship occurs when a psychologist is in a professional role with a person and (1) at the same time is in another role with the same person .... A psychologist refrains from entering into a multiple relationship if the multiple relationship could reasonably be expected to impair the psychologist\u2019s objectivity, competence, or effective-ness in performing his or her function as a psychologist, or otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the professional relationship exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">Multiple relationships that would not reasonably be expected to cause impairment or risk exploitation or harm are not unethical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">3.06 Conflict of Interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">Psychologists refrain from taking on a professional role when personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships could reasonably be expected to 1) impair their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing their function as psychologists or 2) expose the person or organization with whom the professional relationship exists to harm or exploitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">APA <em>Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3.05, 3.06 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">Neither the Office of Government Ethics\u2019 <em>Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, </em>5 C.F.R. pt. 2635 (2005), nor the Department of Defense supplement thereto, provides any directly pertinent provision, as the conflict of interest rules therein are primarily aimed at financial or employment conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-19\">Finally, we note that this case does not require us to decide whether, or in what circumstances, a practitioner who receives a privileged communication under M.R.E. 513 may be ineligible to serve as a member of a board appointed under R.C.M. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>C.

APPLYING THE NEW TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">1. <em>Dr. Galloway\u2019s prior involvement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">As Chief, Mental Health Division, USDB, Dr. Galloway was directed in January 2000 to assess Appellant to determine whether he was suffering from a psychosis and to determine the cause of his disruptive behavior. When Dr. Galloway attempted to interview Appellant, he resisted and then declined, saying that God was taking care of him and he needed no mental treatment. <em>Best II, </em>59 M.J. at 889. Dr. Galloway then reported to the commandant that she was unable to \u201cdetermine the driving force behind Appellant\u2019s behavior,\u201d and posited a combination of personality disorders and malingering as the most likely causes. She further recommended that Appellant\u2019s disruptions be treated as misconduct rather than medical issues. <em>Id. </em>About nine weeks later, when Appellant\u2019s behavior worsened and he began a hunger strike, Dr. Galloway asked Dr. Kirubakaran to effect an emergency consultation. <em>Id. </em>at 890. During the two days after Appellant\u2019s admission to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, Dr. Galloway made \u201cmore than ten phone calls to the VA doctors and nurses, and Dr. Kirubakaran, discussing appellant\u2019s mental and physical condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Amid questions of potential malingering, Appellant was released from the VA on April 6, 2000, by order of the VA\u2019s chief of psychiatric services. On April 17, Dr. Galloway again asked Dr. Kiru-bakaran to assess Appellant\u2019s symptomatic behavior in his cell. <em>Id. </em>At a hearing pursuant to <em>Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980), on September 17, Dr. Galloway testified that, because she had not seen Appellant since April 2000, she had no current opinion of his condition. <em>Best II, </em>59 M.J. at 891. Dr. Galloway did not treat or diagnose Appellant during their initial visit; she did only a brief assessment. Appellant was not one of her patients. Dr. Galloway is usually involved in sanity boards on prisoners because she works \u201cbehind the walls\u201d and can gather necessary documents and information. Dr. Galloway does not believe she had any conflicts in her dealings with Appellant because she was wearing the same hat \u2014 performing assessments on someone who was not her patient. She also was not \u201cprotecting\u201d her earlier diagnosis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">Q. You talked about the questions that the board had prior to it\u2019s [sic] meeting. Did you know the answers to those questions before the board met on the 21st of March?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\">A. I knew that Springfield had diagnosed him as schizophrenia. It\u2019s my job to make my own diagnosis, but in terms of the earlier questions like can he assist counsel right now, or whatever that \u2014 let me look at what the questions were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">Q. No, no, just testify from your recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-16\">A. Okay. Okay, from my recollection, sir, I had Springfield\u2019s diagnosis, but my responsibility to make my own, and frankly theirs and mine didn\u2019t match, so it was my job to figure out what was going on, and who in my opinion was right. In terms of whether or not he was competent to assist counsel, I had no clue, because I hadn\u2019t seen him, and in terms of his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-17\">Q. So the short answer is you didn\u2019t know before the board met?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">Q. You didn\u2019t know the answers to the questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>A. Well, except that I did know their opinion on the diagnostic piece. I didn\u2019t know the rest at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">Q. And you knew theirs disagreed with yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Q. Okay, now after the board met though, and after you \u2014 I take it you were able to answer the four questions, as a member of the board, and your answer as to the diagnosis agreed with that of Springfield, did it not, after the board? A. Um-hum. In essence, sir, they were right and I was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Q. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">A. Or at least my earlier one was wrong. Q. And you said it was your responsibility to reach a diagnosis. How exactly do you do that at this board? How did you reach the diagnosis that agreed with Springfield\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">A. The same way you reach a diagnosis of anybody. You ask them a whole lot of questions, because I know what symptoms are associated with what illnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">2. <em>Dr. Kirubakaran\u2019s prior involvement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">When called by Dr. Galloway, Dr. Kiruba-karan (the psychiatry medical officer at the Fort Leavenworth hospital) \u201cimmediately met with appellant in his cell.\u201d Because Appellant was uncommunicative and appeared abnormal, Dr. Kirubakaran referred Appellant to the nearest emergency room for a complete examination. He \u201cdiagnosed\u201d appellant \u201cwith a \u2018psychotic disorder [not otherwise specified] and concerns about catatonia\u2019 \u201d and had Appellant admitted to the psychiatry ward of the Leavenworth VA hospital on April 3. <em>Best II, </em>59 M.J. at 890. On April 17, when requested by Dr. Galloway, Dr. Kirubakaran met with Appellant in his cell for about fifteen to twenty minutes, observed that Appellant was \u201cpsychotic and agitated,\u201d but didn\u2019t make a treatment plan because Appellant was being transferred to federal prison because of Appellant\u2019s hunger strike. <em>Id. </em>After more than thirteen months at the federal medical center, Appellant returned to the USDB, where Dr. Kiru-bakaran \u201cbegan seeing him on a monthly basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior to the sanity board, Dr. Kirubakaran saw Appellant twice, both for brief assessments, not amounting to evaluations and not amounting to treatment. Because Dr. Kirubakaran\u2019s contacts with Appellant, prior to the sanity board, had been brief assessments, Dr. Kirubakaran did not believe that, clinically, he had a conflict of interest; however, once he became Appellant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, that analysis would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">Adopting and applying the test formulated by the court below, we conclude that even if there exists some evidence of conflict, that evidence is insufficient to comprise an \u201cactual conflict of interest.\u201d There was no material limitation of either Dr. Galloway\u2019s or Dr. Kirubakaran\u2019s ability to participate objectively in the board or evaluate Appellant. Although there are conflict of interest rules for psychologists and commentary to the ethical guidelines for the practice of forensic psychiatry suggesting that psychiatrists \u201cshould generally avoid agreeing to be an expert witness or to perform evaluations of their patients for legal purposes,\u201d American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law <em>Ethical Guidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry </em>(adopted 1987, revised 1995), those conflict rules do not apply to these facts. As Dr. Galloway put it, at least through the time of Appellant\u2019s sanity board, both Dr. Galloway and Dr. Kirubakaran were each wearing only \u201cone hat.\u201d Neither was Appellant\u2019s psychotherapist. Neither did more than a brief assessment, followed in some cases by referral to those who could diagnose Appellant and offer him treatment. Consequently, there is no reason to question whether the board\u2019s membership complied with R.C.M. 706 or question the reliability of the trial results.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">. Doctor Galloway, Chief of the Mental Health Division at the Directorate of Treatment Programs at the USDB, is a Doctor of Psychology.

Doctor Galloway determined these test results were invalid because of appellant\u2019s \"need to present himself in an unrealistically socially desirable light.

As recounted in the majority opinion, neither doctor assessed Appellant as suffering from a severe mental disease or defect. As a result, neither doctor treated Appellant for such a disease or defect. Dr. Galloway indicated in her assessment a suspicion that Appellant was malingering and that abnormalities in his behavior should be treated in the framework of custodial discipline and not as medical problems. However, there came a time when Appellant\u2019s behavior required medical treatment, and he was subsequently diagnosed with acute schizophrenia. Appellant was eventually referred to a board convened pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 706 by order of this Court. <em>United States v. Best, </em>54 M.J. 367 (C.A.A.F.2000). The board concluded that Appellant was not suffering from a severe mental disease or defect at the time of his original offense. Dr. Galloway and Dr. Kirubakaran served as two of the three members of Appellant\u2019s R.C.M. 706 board.</p>\n<p id=\"AHp\">The question on appeal is whether Dr. Galloway or Dr. Kirubakaran had a conflict of interest that should have disqualified them from serving on Appellant\u2019s R.C.M. 706 board. Put into factual context, in light of their prior assessments, which did not identify the severity of Appellant\u2019s condition, were they capable of impartially serving on Appellant\u2019s board without in some manner trying to validate or justify their prior judgments regarding Appellant?</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">Like this Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals found this to be a question of first impression. The lower court analogized to both the American Psychological Association\u2019s Code of Conduct (applicable to psychologists) and the American Medical Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics (applicable to psychiatrists), as well as the conflict of interest standard for legal counsel articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 172 n. 5, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002), to develop its standard for psychotherapist conflict of interest review. The Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cconclude[d] that an actual conflict of interest exists if a psychotherapist\u2019s prior participation materially limits his or her ability to objectively participate in and evaluate the subject of an R.C.M. 706 sanity board.\u201d <em>United States v. Best, </em>59 M.J. 886, 892 (A.Ct.Crim.App.2004). However, the lower court, this Court, and the parties have struggled to place this issue in broader legal context. The majority, for example, concludes that the process associated with R.C.M. 706 boards is entirely a function of administrative law and executive discretion, and fails to place the issue presented into constitutional context.</p>\n<p id=\"ATp\">While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Galloway and Dr. Kirubakaran did not bear a disqualifying conflict in this ease, I believe the question presented finds its root in constitutional due process. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution restrain government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, and \u201cprotect ] the individual against the arbitrary action of government.\u201d <em>Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 459-60, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); <em>Ex parte Wilson, </em>114 U.S. 417, 426, 5 S.Ct. 935, 29 L.Ed. 89 (1885) (\u201cThe purpose of the [Fifth] Amendment was to limit the powers of the legislature, as well as of the prosecuting officers, of the United States.\u201d). A protected liberty interest may arise from either the text of the Due Process Clause itself, or as a result of a statute or regulation that places substantive limitations on official discretion. <em>See Thompson, </em>490 U.S. at 462, 109 S.Ct. 1904; <em>Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 488, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980); <em>see also Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 428, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (O\u2019Con-nor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cOur cases leave no doubt that where a statute indicates with \u2018language of an unmistakable mandatory character,\u2019 that state conduct injurious to an individual will not occur \u2018absent specified substantive predicates,\u2019 the statute creates an expectation protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d) (quoting <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 471-72, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"ANs\">Under R.C.M. 706, once a mental examination is ordered, the matter <em>shall </em>be submitted to a sanity board charged to report on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the mental responsibility or capacity of the accused. The rule includes specific, discretion-narrowing directives for both the order authorizing the board and for the conduct of the board itself. R.C.M. 706(c). While Appellant may have had no independent constitutional right to an R.C.M. 706 board, once such a board was ordered, its evaluation must have been conducted in a manner consistent with the requirements of procedural due process. <em>See Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. at 428-29, 106 S.Ct. 2595; <em>see also Diaz v. Judge Advocate General of the Navy, </em>59 M.J. 34, 38 (C.A.A.F.2003) (where statute has created appellate process as integral part of criminal justice system, procedures used in deciding appeal must comport with demands of <em>due process </em>and <em>equal protection).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Such due process includes the right to a fair and impartial adjudicator. <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Prods. v. Constr. Laborers Pension Trust, </em>508 U.S. 602, 617, 113 S.Ct. 2264, 124 L.Ed.2d 539 (1993) (\u201cThat officers acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity are disqualified by their interest in the controversy to be decided is, of course, the general rule.\u201d) (quoting <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 522, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927)). <em>Cf. United States v. Dowty, </em>60 M.J. 163, 169 (C.A.A.F.2004) (\u201cThis right [to an impartial jury] \u2018is the cornerstone of the military justice system.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Hilow, </em>32 M.J. 439, 442 (C.M.A.1991)); Article 37, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837 (statute prohibiting any attempt to improperly influence the determinations of a court martial or reviewing authority). In the context presented at bar, the Court of Criminal Appeals adopted by analogy the conflict standards for psychotherapeutic professionals and for legal counsel to determine if the members of Appellant\u2019s R.C.M. 706 board were indeed impartial. While I defer on whether this is the correct standard to apply in all R.C.M. 706 conflict of interest contexts (i.e., for both psychologists and psychiatrists), I am satisfied that this standard appropriately tested whether Dr. Galloway and Dr. Kirubakaran were \u201cimpartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I believe the facts as applied against this standard indicate that both were capable of impartial judgment. Among other things, Dr. Galloway acknowledged under direct examination and cross-examination that she was incorrect in her initial assessment of Appellant. Further, she demonstrated a willingness to reassess her judgment and to do so without apparent defensiveness or protection of her prior judgment. As judges are asked on occasion to reconsider their judgments on appeal, based on perceived errors in law or fact, <em>See, e.g., </em>C.A.A.F. R. 31, I do not believe doctors as professionals are inherently incapable of doing the same absent a showing of actual conflict. In the context of the liberty interest associated with this particular R.C.M. 706 board, there was added protection in that the integrity and impartiality of the doctors\u2019 evaluation was subject to the crucible of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">This would appear to leave Appellant in the position of arguing for a per se disqualification where an assessing psychotherapist subsequently serves on a R.C.M. 706 board. However, such a position is not required as a matter of statutory law or constitutional due process, where as here, Appellant has had the opportunity to test for impartiality. Moreover, in the military context, there may be good operational reasons why an assessing or treating physician may also be required to serve on an R.C.M. 706 board.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">That being said, while the Government may be satisfied that a doctor can appropriately function as both a treating physician and subsequent board member in specific situations, that does not mean that a treating physician should always do so. The Government might choose as a prudential matter to eliminate any possible appearance of a conflict of interest, and related litigation, by affirmatively selecting qualified R.C.M. 706 board members with no prior connection to the subject of the review. Such an approach is consistent with the admonition in both the psychologists\u2019 Code of Conduct and the psychiatrists\u2019 Principles of Medial Ethics, which disfavor, and in some cases bar, a treating psychotherapist\u2019s performance of multiple roles.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
