The United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) agreed that a violation of R.C.M. 707 had occurred but disagreed with the military judge\u2019s decision to dismiss with prejudice and reversed his decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This case illustrates the difficulty an intermediate appellate court faces when balancing the defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ence due a military judge under the abuse of discretion standard with the potential drastic remedy of dismissal with prejudice.

We therefore reverse the opinion of the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals and reinstate the decision of the military judge to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In 1998, Appellant was tried and convicted of the receipt and possession of child pornography in violation of Article 134(3), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant served seven months of confinement. This Court set aside his conviction on June 29, 2004,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> based on our decision in <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor:</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Judge Advocate General of the Navy then returned the case to the convening authority, who decided to retry Appellant for the receipt and possession of child pornography. At the first session of the special court-martial on December 10, 2004, the military judge found a violation of Appellant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. The military judge performed an analysis of the factors listed in R.C.M. 707<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and dismissed the case with prejudice. The Government filed an appeal under Article 62, UCMJ,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently reversed the military judge\u2019s ruling, determining that he abused his discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">I. <em>The military judge\u2019s decision to dismiss with </em>prejudice<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">The military judge first concluded that the Government had violated R.C.M. 707 because Appellant was arraigned more than 120 days after the convening authority received the record. The military judge found that the record of trial, along with this Court\u2019s opinion, was received at the headquarters of the Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMNAVAIRLANT) on July 13, 2004. The Government\u2019s docketing request, placed on the docket on November 9, 2004, did not request arraignment until November 15. The military judge thus determined that the docketing request was filed 139 days after the decision and 125 days after the record was received at COMNAVAIRLANT, and that accordingly the case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">The military judge then considered the four factors listed under R.C.M. 707 to determine whether the dismissal should be with prejudice. First, the military judge considered the seriousness of the offense. He stated that the \u201callegations against [Appellant] are serious, both in terms of the punishment that they could have carried but for Article 63, UCMJ, ..., and for the societal norms that they implicate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Considering the factors that led to dismissal, the military judge acknowledged that the Government\u2019s efforts to review the case were \u201cpraiseworthy,\u201d and that the \u201cefforts to minimize the impact on the accused are to be applauded.\u201d But he found that \u201cinordinate delay occurred at several points in the process.\u201d More specifically, the military judge found that the \u201ccourtesy screening\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the \u201crelatively small record of trial (under 150 pages)\u201d took over a month. Then, two more months elapsed \u201cpending the referral decision; granted, some of that time was necessary to locate the evidence and to evaluate it, but the Government has not made a convincing ease that all of that time was necessary.\u201d Furthermore, it took nearly two weeks for the Government to route a docketing request. The military judge also found that \u201c[ejven scheduling the hearing on the speedy trial motion revealed some lack of urgency on the part of the Government....\u201d Finally, he recognized that \u201cthe Defense had by that point requested a continuance, but the Government should still have been prepared to go at an earlier date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The third R.C.M. 707 factor is the effect of a retrial on the administration of justice. The military judge asserted that R.C.M. 707 would lose its plain meaning if a trial is allowed to proceed in this case. Interpreting the rule, he focused on the accountability of the convening authority over his subordinate servieemembers. The military judge rejected the Government\u2019s implicit attempt to insulate the convening authority from the delay caused by subordinates. He noted that the rule refers to a \u201cresponsible convening authority,\u201d rather than a \u201clegal advisor to the responsible convening authority.\u201d If a convening authority was not held accountable for time awaiting legal advice, the military judge reasoned, \u201c[a] command without a staff judge advocate attached would be able to drag out proceedings <em>ad infinitum, </em>waiting on the desired legal advice. Commands with laby-rinthe routing systems would be given a pass from the requirements of the rule.\u201d The military judge concluded by stating that he does \u201cnot fear that commanders will bypass necessary staff advice in order to comply with the rule; rather, the court believes that commanders will impose reasonable, attainable milestones for action in a given case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Finally, the military judge considered \u201cany prejudice resulting [to Appellant] from [the] denial of a speedy trial.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He found that Appellant is \u201csuffering prejudice daily.\u201d Recognizing that Appellant is earning pay and allowances established by law and that the Government put forth \u201csubstantial effort\u201d to minimize the impact on Appellant, the military judge found that \u201che is in fact being subjected to punishment in the Transient Personnel Unit without due process. He is a photographer\u2019s mate who is not permitted to work in his rating. He is a second class petty officer who is not supervising troops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">II. <em>The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 review of the military judge\u2019s decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The CCA adopted the military judge\u2019s finding that more than 120 days passed between the date the convening authority received the record of trial and the date the Government was prepared to arraign Appellant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, it agreed that there was a violation of R.C.M. 707.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the lower court concluded that the military judge abused his discretion in dismissing with prejudice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Regarding the first factor under R.C.M. 707, the CCA \u201cfully concur[red]\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>military judge\u2019s finding that Appellant\u2019s crimes were serious.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the court disagreed with the military judge\u2019s analysis of the other three factors. Regarding the first factor \u2014 the facts and circumstances that led to the delay \u2014 the CCA determined that the military judge erred by imposing a higher standard on the Government under R.C.M. 707 than is imposed under Article 10, UCMJ.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under Article 10, it must be shown that the Government did not proceed \"with \u201creasonable diligence\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or that it acted with \u201cintentional dilatory conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The CCA found no evidence of either in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cbrief periods of inactivity in an otherwise active prosecution are not unreasonable or oppressive.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Concluding its discussion of the first factor, the CCA disagreed with the military judge that \u201cthis case of \u2018under 150 pages\u2019 should not have taken so long to review.\u201d The CCA stated that, because the case was reversed based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>\u201cthe Government was obligated to locate the evidence and evaluate it to determine whether the images [Appellant] had received and possessed were images of actual children.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Discussing the effect of a retrial on the administration of justice, the CCA asserted that the military judge\u2019s analysis \u201cseems wide of the mark,\u201d because \u201che focuses solely on the question of when a responsible CA receives the record and the opinion authorizing a rehearing. That simply addresses the question of when the speedy trial clock began to tick in this case, and not the impact on the administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The lower court noted that missing from the military judge\u2019s analysis is any consideration of the fact that this case was returned because the Supreme Court, in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech </em>Coalition,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> struck down a portion of the statute Appellant was convicted of violating.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The CCA then determined that the effect of a retrial is \u201crelatively neutral____ Due to the limited holding in <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>the Government is allowed an opportunity to retry [Appellant] and [Appellant] would be accorded all his legal rights.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">Moreover, the lower court disagreed with the military judge\u2019s assessment of prejudice against Appellant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The CCA agreed with the Government that any prejudice experienced by Appellant \u201cis incidental to his being activated to stand trial and not a result of any delay on the part of the Government.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The lower court noted that \u201calso missing from the military judge\u2019s analysis is consideration of the fact that\u201d Appellant was not on active duty for 100 of the 125 days it took the Government to be prepared to arraign Appellant from the date the \u201cresponsible CA received the record.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rather, Appellant was recalled to active duty on October 22, 2004, and the Government sought to arraign him on November 15, twenty-five days later.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">Finally, the CCA noted that the military judge did not consider the Discussion to R.C.M. 707(c)(1), which provides that the ex-cludable periods of time from the 120-day calculation include the \u201ctime to process a member of the reserve component to active duty for disciplinary action.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The CCA finds the situation in this case analogous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>recalling a servicemember to active duty.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It asserted that, similar to the situation in <em>United States v. </em>Dies,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cthe CA could have exercised his discretion and excluded a portion of the period of time during which [Appellant] was still in an inactive duty status, avoiding this entire R.C.M. 707 issue.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The CCA concluded \u201cthat this case is not a close call.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It held, therefore, \u201cthat the military judge clearly abused his discretion when he dismissed the Charge and Specifications ... with prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Under R.C.M. 707, the military judge is directed to apply certain factors in determining a remedy for a speedy trial violation, and then decide whether those factors lead to the conclusion that the case should be dismissed with or without prejudice. Under an abuse of discretion standard, mere disagreement with the conclusion of the military judge who applied the R.C.M. 707 factors is not enough to overturn his judgment. The standard requires that the military judge be clearly wrong in his determination of the facts or that his decision be influenced by an erroneous view of the law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We conclude that, in this case, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals erred in reversing the military judge\u2019s decision because it applied an improper standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">I. <em>The standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\"><em>United States v. </em>Gore<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> presented us with an issue similar to the one in this case. In <em>Gore, </em>the military judge dismissed all charges with prejudice as a remedy for unlawful command influence and the Government appealed, pursuant to Article 62, UCMJ.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Although the CCA agreed with the military judge that there was unlawful command influence, it determined that the military judge abused his discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We stated that, because neither the lower court nor the Government challenged the finding of unlawful command influence, the real issue was \u201cwhether the military judge erred in fashioning the remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">Similarly, in this case, neither the Government nor the lower court disputes that a violation of R.C.M. 707 occurred. Rather, both maintain that the case should not have been dismissed with prejudice and that the Government should have the opportunity to retry Appellant. The pertinent question for our review, therefore, is whether the military judge erred in his conclusion that an analysis of the factors listed in R.C.M. 707 supports dismissal of Appellant\u2019s case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">In <em>Gore, </em>we explained the deference that must be accorded a military judge under the abuse of discretion standard. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">An abuse of discretion means that when judicial action is taken in a discretionary manner, such action cannot be set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors---- We will reverse for an abuse of discretion if the military judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous or if his decision is influenced by an erroneous view of the law.... Further, the abuse of discretion standard of review recognizes that a judge has a range of choices and will not be reversed so long as the decision remains within that range.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">\u201c[Dismissal is a drastic remedy and courts must look to see whether alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>remedies are available.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But dismissal is \u201cappropriate when an accused would be prejudiced or no useful purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Deference to the military judge\u2019s decision is particularly prudent in those cases when a violation of R.C.M. 707(d) has occurred because, as the legislative history of the Speedy Trial Act<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> demonstrates, Congress clearly intended trial judges to have \u201cguided discretion\u201d whether to dismiss with or without prejudice.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cneither remedy was given priority.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Rather, a military judge\u2019s decision is guided by the factors articulated in R.C.M. 707 and can be reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion. More specifically, the military judge\u2019s decision in this ease should be affirmed unless his factual findings are clearly erroneous or his decision in applying the R.C.M. 707 factors was influenced by an incorrect view of the law.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">II. <em>Application of the R.C.M. 707factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Under R.C.M. 707, the first factor that a military judge must consider in determining whether to dismiss with prejudice is the seriousness of the offense. In this case, the military judge and the CCA agree that Appellant\u2019s crimes were serious. The finding that the receipt and possession of child pornography is a serious offense, in its impact on both victims and society, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">In analyzing the facts and circumstances that led to his decision to dismiss with prejudice, the military judge weighed the efforts of the Government that he found \u201cpraiseworthy\u201d and \u201cto be applauded\u201d against the factors that contributed to the delay. He clearly articulated the basis for his findings \u2014 that, despite the good efforts by the Government, all the elapsed time was not \u201cnecessary\u201d and it showed a \u201clack of urgency\u201d on the part of the Government. We agree with the CCA that the military judge did not find \u201cintentional dilatory conduct on the part of the Government\u201d and that he did not explicitly state that the Government\u2019s attitude was \u201ctruly neglectful.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Whether the military judge used these exact phrases, however, is not the test under the abuse of discretion standard. Rather, the question is whether his findings of fact were \u201c \u2018clearly erroneous or if his decision is influenced by an erroneous view of the law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The CCA did not find that the military judge\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. Rather, it stated the military judge\u2019s findings were factually correct and \u201cclearly supported by th[e] rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ord.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Because the CCA was essentially asserting that it disagreed with the military judge that the Government\u2019s actions did not constitute \u201ctruly neglectful\u201d conduct, we agree with Appellant that the CCA was substituting its judgment for that of the military judge. Therefore, the CCA erred by performing a de novo review of the \u201cfacts and circumstances that le[d] to dismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The third factor to consider under R.C.M. 707(d) is the effect of the retrial on the administration of justice.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We believe the military judge was correct to note that the plain meaning of R.C.M. 707 may be thwarted if trial is allowed to proceed in this case. The rule requires the military judge to dismiss the case but, if the military judge dismisses without prejudice and the Government decides to reprosecute the accused, the remedy leads to further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We agree with the CCA\u2019s interpretation that the \u201ceffect of a retrial is relatively neutral in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> On the one hand, the Government\u2019s interest in reprosecuting Appellant is diminished because he served seven months of confinement in 1998. Thus, even if Appellant is reprosecuted and convicted, he cannot serve any more confinement. On the other hand, dismissing the case with prejudice means that Appellant will no longer be a \u201cconvicted\u201d possessor of child pornography due to the 2004 decision to overturn his conviction. Additionally, as noted by the CCA, his conviction was overturned because of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition. </em>If Appellant is retried, the Government would have the opportunity to retry him in light of the new legal precedent and Appellant would not be convicted based on an erroneously overbroad definition of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Although the CCA properly interpreted the effect of retrial on the administration of justice, it did not clearly articulate an appropriate basis to overturn the military judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Rather than determining that the military judge was clearly erroneous in any factual finding or that his decision was based on an incorrect view of the law, the CCA stated that it did not \u201cconcur\u201d with the military judge\u2019s decision and that it found the effect of the retrial relatively neutral.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus the CCA failed to apply the correct legal standard in reversing the ruling of the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">The final factor that must be considered under R.C.M. 707(d) is prejudice to the accused. Prejudice may take many forms, thus \u201csuch determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis in the light of the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Prejudice can include any detrimental effect on Appellant\u2019s trial preparation,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> or any impact on the right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It can also include any restrictions or burdens on his liberty,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> such as disenrollment from school or the inability to work due to withdrawal of a security clearance.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Regarding prejudice to Appellant, the military judge clearly articulated that he found Appellant was \u201csuffering prejudice daily.\u201d He found that Appellant was \u201cin fact being subjected to punishment in the Transient Personnel Unit without due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>process,\u201d because he is a photographer\u2019s mate not allowed to work in his rating and a second class petty officer not permitted to supervise troops.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The CCA stated that it \u201cdisagree[ed] with the assessment by the military judge\u201d and that it \u201cconcur[ed]\u201d with the trial counsel\u2019s argument that any prejudice suffered by Appellant is incidental to recall for trial.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Whether the CCA disagrees with the military judge or concurs with the trial counsel is not the standard of review. The military judge clearly articulated his reasoning for believing Appellant was being unfairly prejudiced. Therefore, the CCA could not reverse the military judge\u2019s prejudice finding absent a determination that it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Furthermore, other evidence of prejudice was on the record and before the military judge. Approximately sixteen pages of the record was devoted to exploring the prejudice Appellant was suffering because he was recalled to active duty after five years of appellate leave.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We note these other forms of prejudice solely to emphasize that the military judge was in the best position to assess the prejudice Appellant was suffering because he questioned Appellant extensively about his life since being recalled. We need not, however, consider these factors in concluding that the factual findings of the military judge were neither clearly erroneous nor based on an incorrect view of the law. Therefore, the military judge did not abuse his discretion and the CCA erred in reversing his decision to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The decision of the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed. The decision of the military judge is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\">. <em>See United States v.

Although the military judge does not define the time period which he labeled as the \"courtesy screening,\u201d it appears that the military judge was most likely referring to the period between July 20 and August 23. Based on the testimony of Lieutenant Biles, who was working in the COMNAVAIRLANT Staff Judge Advocate Office at the time, this time elapsed while the Trial Service Office was reviewing Appellant's case and determining whether to recommend reprose-cuting Appellant. About two more months then elapsed between August 23 and October 22, when Appellant was recalled to be reprosecuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\">. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 707(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b392-14\">. <em>See Dooley, </em>61 M.J. at 615-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b392-15\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b392-16\">. 61 M.J. at 617-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. 61 MJ. at 617.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. 61 MJ. at 617.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. <em>United States v.
