Contrary to his pleas he was convicted of three specifications of maltreatment, rape, two specifications of adultery, indecent assault, indecent acts, and solicitation to commit adultery, in violation of Articles 93, 120 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 893, 920, 934 (2000). The adjudged and approved sentence included a dishonorable discharge, confinement for sixty-one months, forfeiture of $200 pay per month for sixty months and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Appellant\u2019s offenses resulted from his conduct with Specialist (SPC) M on three separate dates. The facts relied on by the Court of Criminal Appeals follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">Specialist (SPC) M\u2019s testimony was the primary basis for appellant\u2019s conviction. The guilty findings related to three incidents of sexual activity between appellant and SPC M during her attendance as a student at the thirty-day Primary Leadership Development Course (PLDC) at the 7th Army Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Academy in Grafenwoehr, Germany. At the time of her attendance, SPC M had been on active duty between four and five years. She was a single parent of a fifteen-month old son. Specialist M was 65 inches tall and weighed approximately 130 pounds, and appellant was 71 inches tall and weighed approximately 188 pounds. At the time of the offenses, appellant was a thirty-four-year-old Small Group Leader (SGL) at the NCO Academy. However, he was not a member of SPC M\u2019s platoon; he was not her SGL or instructor. He did not rate her. On all three occasions, while appellant and SPC M were wearing battle dress uniforms, appellant initiated sexual activity with SPC M in the third floor SGL office during breaks between SPC M\u2019s classes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>10 September Offenses</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Before 10 September 1999, appellant went out of his way to engage SPC M in personal conversations. During this time period, SPC M complained to appellant that her roommate was spreading a rumor that she was fraternizing with another student. Specialist M asked for appellant\u2019s help with her roommate. Appellant responded that he could \u201cget anyone kicked out\u201d of PLDC, and SPC M assumed that appellant would have her roommate dismissed from the course. However, her roommate was not dismissed from the course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Appellant used two offices at the NCO Academy, one located on the first floor and one on the third floor. The first time appellant asked SPC M to go to the third floor SGL office, she said \u201cno.\u201d Later when he asked her to go there, she agreed because she did not \u201cfeel like [she] had a choice.\u201d Once in the third floor SGL office, appellant asked SPC M what her intentions were toward him. She asked what he meant; appellant repeated the same question. They went near a couch. He put his arms around her, pulled her close, and kissed her. She put her hands on his chest to \u201cput space between [them]\u201d and leaned back. Appellant then said he wanted to have sex with her. He held SPC M\u2019s wrist and started \u201cgroping\u201d her and tried to undo her pants and belt buckle. Specialist M told him \u201cno\u201d and said, \u201cI know you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get me that easily.\u201d She \u201cwrestled\u201d with appellant, preventing him from removing her trousers. This testimony was the basis for appellant\u2019s conviction of one specification each of maltreatment, indecent assault, and solicitation to commit adultery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">Appellant told SPC M that he wanted to masturbate before she left the room. He got some toilet paper and she sat on the couch. Appellant masturbated in front of her until he ejaculated. He cleaned himself with toilet paper and she left the room. She testified that she did not cry out during the incident because she was nervous. She was afraid to run for the door because she did not know what he would do. She did not report appellant\u2019s behavior because she was afraid that he might lie about her, causing her dismissal from PLDC. Specialist M emphasized her responsibility to her infant son, stating, \u201cI\u2019m a single parent ... [and I] had to do what is best for both of us.\u201d Appellant was not charged with any specific offense for masturbating in SPC M\u2019s presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">After this first incident on 10 September 1999, SPC M \u201cacted like nothing happened\u201d and \u201cblew it off.\u201d She still smiled at appellant and was courteous to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">\n<em>12 September Offenses</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">Appellant asked SPC M to go to his third floor office two days later. They each went to his office separately. Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>cialist M went \u201cbecause [she] thought [she] could talk [her way] out of it again.\u201d Appellant locked the door and left the key in the lock, precluding others who shared the office from entering during the sexual activity. He said he \u201cwanted [her],\u201d but SPC M laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d He replied that she had twenty minutes between classes. Appellant grabbed SPC M and wrestled with her, trying to get her trousers down. She said \u201cno\u201d more than once. Appellant held one of her wrists and tried to unbuckle her trousers with his other hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">As this was occurring, SPC M decided, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m not going to win this battle.\u2019 I was not going to try to fight him, so I let him have sex with me.\u201d She was surprised when appellant took a condom out of the desk. She noticed he had a box and a bag containing condoms. Specialist M accused appellant of \u201csetting her up\u201d and \u201cbringing other females up there.\u201d He denied that he was setting her up and asserted \u201cthat he never did anything like that before.\u201d They engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk. He ejaculated, removed the condom, and wrapped it in a tissue. She pulled up her trousers, unlocked the door, and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Specialist M testified that she let appellant have sex with her because she was worried that appellant might dismiss her from PLDC for having a bad attitude given that she already had trouble with her roommate. Appellant was found guilty of one specification each of maltreatment, rape, and adultery for his conduct on 12 September 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>21 September Offenses</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">On the third occasion, appellant gave SPC M a key and asked her to meet him at the third floor SGL office after lunch. She asked him, \u201cWhat happens if I get caught going up there?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI\u2019ll just tell them that I sent you up there for something.\u201d About an hour after receiving the key, SPC M went to the third floor office. She told appellant there was insufficient time for sexual activity, but he \u201cbegged\u201d her to give him five minutes. She said \u201cno\u201d and they \u201cwrestled as usual.\u201d He put on a condom and then had sexual intercourse with SPC M on the office couch. She was face down during the intercourse. Afterwards, appellant put the used condom into a tissue. Specialist M pulled up her trousers and ran back to class where others noted her ebullient demeanor and her efforts to make the students laugh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">Specialist M testified that she did not do anything else to let appellant know that she did not want to have sex with him. At one point, she asked him whether he was forcing himself on her, and he said \u201cno.\u201d Later, the following exchange occurred between SPC M and trial defense counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">Q. What was it that you were more scared of than having sex forced upon you again by the accused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">SPC M. I was afraid of not graduating [from] the class and not being successful, and that\u2019s \u2014 I mean this is all I have to take care of my son. The Army is all I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-14\"><em>United States v. Leak, </em>58 M.J. 869, 870-72 (A.Ct.Crim.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">Regarding the events of September 21, 1999, at trial Appellant was found not guilty of rape, but guilty of the lesser included offense of indecent acts, and guilty of one specification each of maltreatment and adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">Concluding that it was \u201cnot convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual intercourse on September 12 was done by force and without SPC M\u2019s consent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 877, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals found the evidence of rape factually insufficient and affirmed the lesser included offense of indecent assault. The court also set aside the finding of guilt on the indecent acts offense and instead affirmed a lesser included offense of a simple disorder in violation of Article 184, UCMJ. After reassessing the sentence, the lower court affirmed only so much of the sentence providing for a dishonorable discharge, confinement for three years, forfeiture of $200 pay per month for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>three years and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, E-l. Appellant then petitioned this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Subsequent to Appellant\u2019s filing of his petition, the Government filed a certificate for review asking whether the lower court applied the correct legal standard in reviewing and reversing Appellant\u2019s conviction for rape. While Appellant\u2019s petition and the Government\u2019s certificate were under consideration, we specified two additional issues relating to our authority to review the certified question. We subsequently specified a third issue related to the previous two specified questions. The following issues are now before the Court:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>THE GRANTED ISSUE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">WHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED BY CONVICTING APPELLANT OF THE GREATER OFFENSE OF MALTREATMENT AND ITS LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF A VIOLATION OF A SIMPLE DISORDER BASED ON THE SAME ACTS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>THE CERTIFIED QUESTION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">WHETHER THE UNITED STATES ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT EMPLOYED A REASONABLE FEAR OF DEATH OR GRIEVOUS BODILY INJURY STANDARD ON THE ISSUE OF CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THIS COURT\u2019S HOLDING IN UNITED STATES V.

The relevant text states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-21\">(a) The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces <em>shall review </em>the record in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(2) <em>all cases </em>reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals <em>which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">(c) In any case reviewed by it, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces <em>may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals. In a case which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, that action need be taken only with respect to the issues raised by him. </em>In a case reviewed upon petition of the accused, that action need be taken only with respect to issues specified in the grant of review. <em>The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall take action only with respect to matters of law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Article 67(a)(2),(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(a)(2), (c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Two propositions relevant to the specified issues are textually plain. First, subsection (a) requires this Court to \u201creview\u201d the record in this case. Second, as stated in the last sentence of subsection (c), this Court\u2019s review is limited to questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The Judge Advocate General\u2019s certified question asks us to determine whether the lower court applied the correct law in reversing Appellant\u2019s conviction for rape on the ground of factual insufficiency. In this legal context, two jurisdictional questions arise. First, where the Court of Criminal Appeals has set aside a finding on the ground of factual insufficiency, may this Court nonetheless review that decision and address matters of law? Second, and related, does the language underscored in subsection (c) delimit, or curtail, the exercise of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over a question of law certified by the Judge Advocate General?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">One possible reading of the language in subsection (e) of the statute is that because the lower court did not affirm the finding with respect to Appellant\u2019s rape charge, or set it aside as incorrect in law, this Court is without authority to \u201cact.\u201d Under this reading, this Court would be obliged to \u201creview\u201d the Judge Advocate General\u2019s certified question, but we would have no statutory authority to \u201cact.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">However, at the same time the statute states that \u201c[t]he Court ... <em>shall </em>take action only with respect to matters of law.\u201d Article 67(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(c) (emphasis added). As the earlier language can be read narrowly to preclude this Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in cases where courts of criminal appeals do not affirm or set aside the findings as incorrect in law, this later language might be read narrowly to <em>require </em>this Court to take action in all certified cases with respect to matters of law. Further, because the statute does not define the terms \u201cact\u201d or \u201creview,\u201d the language of the statute is ambiguous as to what is intended by a structure that would have this Court review all certified cases, but not act on certain of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Given this ambiguity we believe it axiomatic that Article 67 must be interpreted in light of the overall jurisdictional concept intended by the Congress, and not through the selective narrow reading of individual sentences within the article. Having determined the necessity of reviewing the statutory purpose, we turn now to the history on which these judgments are based. We will then consider this Court\u2019s longstanding precedent in applying Article 67 in light of the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>During the congressional drafting process of the UCMJ in 1949, both houses issued committee reports accompanying and explaining their respective versions of the new Code. With respect to Article 67, each report contained the following identical language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">The Court of Military Appeals takes action only with respect to matters of law____ It may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority. If the Board of Review has set aside a finding as against the weight of the evidence <em>this </em>decision cannot be reconsidered by the court. If, on the other hand, the Board has set a case aside because of the improper introduction of evidence or because of <em>other prejudicial error, </em>the Court of Military Appeals may reverse if it finds there has been no such error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">H.R Rep. No. 81-491, at 32 (1949)(emphasis added); S.Rep. No. 81-486, at 29 (1949)(em-phasis added) (both reports collected in <em>Index and Legislative History, Uniform Code of Military Justice </em>(1950)). This expression of the committees\u2019 understanding of Article 67 suggests that with respect to findings of factual insufficiency, as long as a Judge Advocate General\u2019s certified question raises a legal issue other than a complaint as to the manner in which the lower court weighed the evidence, this Court shall review that claim. Further, the legislative history indicates that Congress contemplated that this Court and not the lower courts would decide whether a claim presents a question of law or fact, and that with respect to questions of law, this Court would determine whether the lower court engaged in an erroneous application of the law. Thus, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, the principal drafter of the UCMJ, Professor Edmund M. Morgan Jr., stated, \u201cThey [the Judicial Council<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] review questions of law only---- We limit the civilian court to the review of questions of law.\u201d <em>Hearings on H.R. 2198 Before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services, </em>81st Cong. 609 (1949) (statement of Prof. Edmund M. Morgan Jr., Chairman of UCMJ drafting committee), <em>reprinted in Index and Legislative History, </em>Uniform Code of Military Justice (1950) (not separately paginated). When asked who would determine the initial question whether what was at issue was indeed a question of law, he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">Why the judicial council would. That is, the court of last resort would determine whether it was a question of law or a question of fact..... Under our system, they would not pass on the weight of the evidence in the sense that they would set aside a finding because they thought it was against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">If the conclusion is that the lower court has erroneously applied the law, its decision on the finding is not yet final. Under these circumstances, the lower court\u2019s action can best be described as a setting aside of the finding \u201cbecause of other prejudicial error,\u201d necessitating a remand to the lower court for application of proper legal principles. Once the lower court has complied and again reached a finding of factual insufficiency, there can be no further review of that finding. This scheme of review is not a \u201creconsideration\u201d of the court\u2019s decision that the finding is against the weight of the evidence. And it is consistent with the precedent of this Court dating to the inception of the UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">In <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>2 C.M.A. 460, 9 C.M.R. 90 (1953) a Navy board of review<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had dismissed a finding of guilty to missing movement by neglect. According to the board of review, there was no proof of a causal connection between the accused\u2019s neglect in absenting himself and the missing of the scheduled movement. The relevant question certified by the Judge Advocate General was whether there was sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to establish a prima-facie case of missing movement through neglect. In other words, the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>was whether the Government was required to prove as one of the elements of the offense that the scheduled movement was the proximate cause of the accused\u2019s unauthorized absence. Notwithstanding the wording of the certified question, the Court suggested that the board\u2019s opinion was unclear as to whether it had reached a conclusion of factual insufficiency or legal insufficiency. The Court began its analysis by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">[As] we read the opinion of the board of review, it amounts to a factual determination that there is insufficient evidence to support the findings. If this determination is based solely on an appraisal of the evidence, we shall not overturn it. Our jurisdiction is limited to questions of law and we shall, therefore, review the decision of the board of review only in so far as it purports to delineate the legal elements of the offense under consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 462, 9 C.M.R. 90 (citations omitted). This language unambiguously indicates that the Court was expressly acknowledging its lack of authority to review a factual insufficiency determination that was based solely on the weight of the evidence. Alternatively, if that determination was reached after an erroneous consideration of the elements of the offense, this Court saw itself as statutorily obligated to review the matter. After concluding that the board of review had erred by requiring an additional legal element not required by law, this Court remanded the case to the board for reconsideration in light of the legal principles announced in the ease. In doing so, it issued a further clarification of the authority it had exercised by stating, \u201cWe should make it abundantly clear that if the board of review here determined that, conflict as to the issue of causal connection aside, there was insufficient evidence to support the findings, we are not reversing that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 9 C.M.R. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">In <em>United States v. Bunting, </em>6 C.M.A. 170, 19 C.M.R. 296 (1955), the Court further interpreted Article 67 in the context of a certified question submitted after a factual determination by a board of review disposing of the findings. In that case, the board concluded \u201cas a matter of fact\u201d that they had a reasonable doubt as to the accused\u2019s sanity at the time of the offenses and dismissed the findings. The Judge Advocate General certified a question asking whether the board had erred as a matter of law \u201cin its analysis of the testimony\u201d in dismissing the findings. <em>Id. </em>at 172,19 C.M.R. 296. After again recognizing its authority over matters of law exclusively, the Court made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">It is implicit in the grant of authority found in Article 67 of the Code that a board of review may not permissibly defeat review in this Court by labeling a matter of law, or a mixed holding of law and fact, as a question of fact. To avoid that impasse, we look to the substance of the holding, and its rationale, not to the characterization by the board of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATE\"><em>Id. </em>at 173, 19 C.M.R. 296. The Court went on to conclude that the issue as to the accused\u2019s sanity was \u201cone of fact, not law\u201d and held that the board had not erred. Neither <em>Thompson </em>nor <em>Bunting </em>have been overruled by this Court, or abrogated by subsequent legislation or executive directive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">These precedents along with the legislative history convince us that it is within this Court\u2019s authority to review a lower court\u2019s determination of factual insufficiency for application of correct legal principles. At the same time, this authority is limited to matters of law; we may not reassess a lower court\u2019s fact-finding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A contrary reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>would defeat the overall intent of Article 67 \u2014 to grant this Court jurisdiction to decide matters of law raised by appellants or certified by Judge Advocates General. Moreover, such a reading would divest Article 67(a)(2) of its obvious and plain meaning, except in those eases where the Court of Criminal Appeals has affirmed a finding and sentence or decided the case on the grounds of legal insufficiency. This view would also make dispositive the terminology used by the lower courts in conducting their reviews, under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866 (2000), thereby putting beyond reach matters of law in those cases purportedly decided on the grounds of factual insufficiency. \u201cAlthough a Court of Criminal Appeals has broad fact-finding power, its application of the law to the facts must [still] be based on a correct view of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Weather-spoon, </em>49 M.J. 209, 212 (C.A.A.F.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">For these reasons, we conclude Article 67 does not preclude review of questions of law certified by Judge Advocates General where the courts of criminal appeals have set aside a finding on the ground of factual insufficiency. However, such review must be conducted in a manner consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">B. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The specified issues also raise the question of whether double jeopardy considerations preclude a remand in the event we answer the certified question in the affirmative. Rephrased, is a service court\u2019s determination that the evidence is factually insufficient on a finding considered an \u201cacquittal\u201d for the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution states \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. As is clear from the text of the clause and common-law origins, the prohibition is directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 342, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). The Supreme Court has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">The constitutional prohibition against \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense____ The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-13\"><em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). \u201c \u2018[Central to the objective of the prohibition against successive trials\u2019 is the barrier to \u2018affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 128, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980) (citation omitted). Thus, the clause \u201cprotects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) <em>overruled on other grounds by Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). The first two protections are relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">An acquittal has been afforded special consideration in the law of double jeopardy. Thus, a \u201cverdict of acquittal ... could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\u201d <em>United States v. Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 671, 16 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). \u201cIf the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">However, civilian jurisprudence distinguishes between appellate review in the wake of a verdict of guilty and appellate review following a jury or bench trial acquittal. In <em>Wilson, </em>the jury returned a guilty verdict against the defendant for a federal offense. 420 U.S. at 353, 95 S.Ct. 1013. The trial court dismissed the indictment with prejudice on the ground that the delay between the offense and the indictment had prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The Government appealed the ruling dismissing the indictment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the applicability of the Double Jeopardy Clause to Government appeals from post-verdict rulings by the trial court. In the Court\u2019s view, a decision on appeal in favor of the Government simply reinstates the guilty verdict of the jury. Therefore, the Court held that permitting the Government to appeal would not expose the defendant to a second trial for the same offense. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere there is no threat of either multiple punishment or successive prosecutions, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 344, 95 S.Ct. 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977), a deadlocked jury was unable to agree upon a verdict at the defendant corporations\u2019 contempt trial. The district court granted motions for judgments of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 and the Government appealed. The court of appeals held that because reversal of the acquittals would enable the Government to try the defendants a second time, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the appeals. Affirming the lower court, the Supreme Court reasoned that the trial court had acted where the jury had not. It then went on to hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars appeal from an acquittal entered under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 after a jury mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 97 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">More recently, in <em>United States v. Genova, </em>333 F.3d 750 (7th Cir.2003)(and cases cited therein), the court of appeals applied the rationales of both <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>In <em>Genova, </em>the jury returned guilty verdicts on two counts of misapplication and diversion of funds in violation of federal law. The district court subsequently granted motions for acquittal under Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 and the Government appealed. In reinstating the convictions, the Seventh Circuit said, among other things, that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a Government appeal from a ruling in favor of the defendant after a guilty verdict has been entered by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756 (quoting <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 130, 101 S. Ct. 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Several principles emerge. First, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive trials. Second, the clause does not bar an appeal by the Government following a judge\u2019s entry of a judgment of acquittal when the jury has previously returned a verdict of guilty. However, an acquittal returned by a jury, or by a judge in a bench trial sitting as the trier of fact, is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">In light of the distinct de novo factual powers of the service courts of criminal appeals, this precedent does not create an immediate template for the military context. As a result, this case poses the question whether in the military justice system the decision to set aside a guilty verdict on factual insufficiency grounds by a service court of criminal appeals is equivalent to an acquittal at trial for the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. This Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>ed States v. Crider, </em>22 C.M.A. 108, 46 C.M.R. 108 (1973)[hereinafter <em>Crider II], </em>and <em>United States v. Riley, </em>55 M.J. 185 (C.A.A.F.2001), offer some support for both sides of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In <em>Crider II, </em>the accused was convicted of four specifications of premeditated murder. 22 C.M.A. at 108-09, 46 C.M.R. 108. The Court of Military Review approved as correct in law and fact the lesser included offense of unpremeditated murder. This Court granted the appellant\u2019s petition for review and reversed the lower court\u2019s decision holding that the members of the reviewing panel should have recused themselves. <em>United States v. Crider, </em>21 C.M.A. 193, 44 C.M.R. 247 (1972). On further review, a different panel of the Court of Military Review affirmed the original findings of guilt to premeditated murder. Appellant again appealed. Although both sides claimed that double jeopardy principles turned the decision in their favor, the Court ruled for Appellant on the ground that in military law \u201can accused cannot come to harm by appealing here and securing reversal of his conviction.\u201d <em>Crider II, </em>22 C.M.A. at 110, 46 C.M.R. 108. However, in reaching this conclusion, the Court stated, \u201c[i]f the Government believes that the Court of Military Review erred, it has the right to seek certification of the case by the Judge Advocate General for possible corrective action in this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the one hand, this statement left open the possibility that had the Government certified a claim of legal error regarding the affected offenses and prevailed, the Court of Military Review could have revisited, from a legal standpoint, its earlier \u201cacquittal.\u201d On the other hand, the Court described the fact-finding function of the courts of criminal appeals as analogous to the actions of a trial fact-finder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">Essentially, the Court of Military Review provides a <em>de novo </em>trial on the record at appellate level, with full authority to disbelieve the witnesses, [and] determine issues of fact .... We believe such a court\u2019s exercise of its fact-finding powers in determining the degree of guilt to be found on the record is more apposite to the action of a trial court than to that of an appellate body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 111, 46 C.M.R. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">In <em>Riley, </em>the appellant was convicted of the unpremeditated murder of her newborn child. 55 M.J. at 186. The Court of Criminal Appeals set aside the conviction of unpremeditated murder on the ground that the evidence was factually insufficient and affirmed a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. This Court reversed, holding that the lower court had affirmed the lesser included offense on a theory not presented to the trier of fact. On remand, the Government argued in the court below that the court was now free to revisit its earlier determination of factual insufficiency on the offense of unpremeditated murder. The lower court disagreed and the Government certified the question whether that court had erred in not revisiting its decision on the unpremeditated murder offense. Concluding that the rationale of <em>Crider II </em>was controlling, this Court held that reinstatement of the conviction of unpremeditated murder was prohibited. <em>Riley, </em>55 M.J. at 188. This reinforced the holdings in <em>Crider II </em>that an accused should incur no harm by appealing and that absent a certified question on the affected offenses, an accused is entitled to plead double jeopardy against any attempt by the Court of Criminal Appeals to reinstate and affirm the conviction of a greater offense. 22 C.M.A at 111, 46 C.M.R. 108. We then answered the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Considering the principles behind the Double Jeopardy Clause and precedent, in our view a lower court\u2019s finding of factual insufficiency is not the legal equivalent of an acquittal by the trier of fact at the court-martial level. For sure, Congress \u201cintended to give an accused a <em>de novo </em>proceeding on the merits and to empower the Courts of Criminal Appeals to acquit an accused.\u201d <em>Riley, </em>55 M.J. at 188. We have also stated \u201cthat Congress intended a Court of Criminal Appeals to act as factfinder in an appellate-review capacity and not in the first instance as a trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>47 M.J. 236, 242 (C.A.A.F.1997). A court of criminal appeals is more akin to a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>court entering its judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 than it is to a trial jury. In such a case, \u201c[u]nder the double jeopardy clause the government may appeal the granting of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if there would be no necessity for another trial, i.e., only where the jury has returned a verdict of guilty.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 advisory committee\u2019s note (discussing Dec. 1, 1994, amendments). In the military justice system, at the time a court of criminal appeals makes a determination of factual insufficiency, a guilty finding will necessarily have been returned by a court-martial. Indeed, we have distinguished this de novo review power from a trial in recognizing that the courts of criminal appeals must exercise their unique fact-finding powers making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses who testified at the trial. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>58 M.J. 391, 395 (C.A.A.F.2003); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">But that is not to say the principles behind the Double Jeopardy Clause do not apply. \u201c \u2018[Cjentral to the objective of the prohibition against successive trials\u2019 is the barrier to \u2018affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 128, 101 S.Ct. 426 (citation omitted). Exercise of this Court\u2019s authority under Article 67 to review certified questions of law does not permit supplementation of the factual record by either side. The lower court\u2019s review having become final with the assumption of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the facts, as opposed to the application of the law to those facts, are set. Nor, may this Court supplant the lower court\u2019s evaluation of the weight of the evidence with our own. In such a case, we would indeed be acting beyond our statutory authority. This, too, is consistent with the overall jurisdictional scheme contemplated by Congress. The power of de novo factual review that the courts of criminal appeals possess was intended as a safeguard to servicemembers. <em>United States v. Parker, </em>36 M.J. 269, 271 (C.M.A.1993)(declaring that plenary de novo power of review is to protect an accused); <em>United States v. Claxton, </em>32 M.J. 159, 162 (C.M.A.1991)(describing review under Article 66(c) as <em>\u201ccarte blanche </em>to do justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that neither Article 67(e) nor double jeopardy considerations preclude this Court from reviewing the question of law raised by the Government by certification where the members at trial have returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\n<em>THE CERTIFIED QUESTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-e\">A. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">In military law, rape is \u201can act of sexual intercourse, by force and without consent.\u201d Article 120, UCMJ. The <em>Manual for Courts-Martial </em>lists the elements of rape as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">(1) That the accused committed an act of sexual intercourse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-14\">(2) That the act of sexual intercourse was done by force and without consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-15\"><em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, </em>(2002 ed.) <em>(MCM), </em>pt. IV, U 45.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Although listed within the same element, the discussion and case law make clear that force and lack of consent are distinct, although related, elements of the offense. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>58 M.J. 368, 377 (C.A.A.F.2003)(\u201c[F]orce and lack of consent are separate elements____\u201d). Whether the elements of the offense are met is based on a totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Cauley, </em>45 M.J. 353, 356 (C.A.A.F.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">In plain English, consent generally means voluntary agreement. <em>See, e.g., Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>265 (11th ed.2003). In discussing rape and carnal knowledge, the <em>MCM </em>amplifies this definition, pointing out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-19\">The lack of consent required, however, is more than mere lack of acquiescence. If a victim in possession of his or her mental faculties fails to make lack of consent reasonably manifest by taking such measures of resistance as are called for by the circumstances, the inference may be drawn that the victim did consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-20\"><em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, 1I45.C. (l)(b). Significantly, \u201csuch measures of resistance\u201d can be verbal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>physical or a combination of the two. In other words, in context, a verbal \u201cno\u201d can manifest the necessary lack of consent for the offense of rape. In such a context, physical resistance is not required. <em>Cauley, </em>45 M.J. at 356 (\u201c[A] finding of lack of consent does not require proof that the witness physically resisted her attacker.\u201d). Moreover, proof of resistance in any form is not a necessary element of the offense of rape. <em>United States v. Bonano-Torres, </em>31 M.J. 175, 179 (C.M.A.1990). It may, however, be probative on the issue of consent. Further, verbal or physical measures of resistance are not required \u201cif resistance would have been futile, where resistance is overcome by threats of death or great bodily harm, or where the victim is unable to resist because of lack of mental or physical faculties.\u201d <em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, 1f 45.e.(l)(b). In such a circumstance, there is no consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Force is the second essential element of rape. The <em>MCM </em>and case law recognize that force can be accomplished in one of two manners: actual force or constructive force. Actual force is physical force used to overcome a victim\u2019s lack of consent. <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>33 M.J. 7, 9 (C.M.A.1991). Actual force requires \u201cmore than the incidental force involved in penetration.\u201d <em>Bonano-Torres, </em>31 M.J. at 179. However, military law also recognizes the concept of constructive force, which \u201cmay consist of expressed or implied threats of bodily harm.\u201d <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>24 M.J. 3, 6 (C.M.A.1987). \u201cConstructive force may be shown by proof of a coercive atmosphere that includes, for example, threats to injure others or statements that resistance would be futile.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>58 M.J. at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In application, the concepts of actual and constructive force are complex for three reasons. First, Article 120 is antiquated in its approach to sexual offenses. In particular, the article does not reflect the more recent trend for rape statutes to recognize gradations in the offense based on context. <em>See generally Report of the Commission on the 50th Anniversary of the Uniform Code of Military Justice </em>11 (Nat\u2019l Inst, of Military Justice 2001). These statutes incorporate the legal realization that the force used may vary depending on the relationship and familiarity, if any, between perpetrator and victim, but the essence of the offense remains the same \u2014 sexual intercourse against the will of the victim. Because Article 120 is dated, its elements may not easily fit the range of circumstances now generally recognized as \u201crape,\u201d including date rape, acquaintance rape, statutory rape, as well as stranger-on-stranger rape. As a result, the traditional military rape elements have been applied in contexts for which the elements were not initially contemplated. Case law has evolved to address this reality. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Simpson, </em>58 M.J. at 368 (drill instructor\u2019s coercive influence over recruits); <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>33 M.J. at 7 (parental compulsion found to be a form of constructive force); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>4 C.M.A. 268, 15 C.M.R. 268 (1954)(concept of constructive force recognized as applicable to military).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Second, application of the concepts of actual and constructive force is complex because the elements of consent and force are often intertwined. For example, these elements are included within the same statutory element, suggesting an intentional substantive link. They also are often closely allied with regard to proof. The same evidence offered on the issue of force, may also serve to prove lack of consent. In this manner for example, evidence of measure(s) of resistance might prove both the elements of force and lack of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Finally, these concepts are complex because actual and constructive force address bodily harm, but retain subtle but distinct differences in the standard of measurement required to demonstrate each. This is succinctly and clearly stated in <em>Simpson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">Fear of great bodily harm is used in the <em>MCM </em>with respect to inferring consent on the element of lack of consent. With respect to the use of constructive force to prove the element of force, however, we have held that it is sufficient if the Government proves that the abuse of authority placed the victim in fear of physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqH3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>58 M.J. at 378-79 (citations omitted). Moreover, in assessing the totality of the circumstances, a court may well address both the actual and constructive force concepts, and then apply the same factual evidence to both, thus weaving facts with legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">B. <em>The Law Applied in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">With this backdrop, we turn now to the lower court\u2019s treatment of force and consent. The Government argues that the court applied the wrong legal standard to its factual review of the evidence. In particular, the Government argues that the court applied the more rigorous \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d measure in finding an absence of constructive force, when <em>Simpson </em>states that the standard for constructive force is \u201cphysical injury.\u201d As evidence of this error, the Government focuses almost exclusively on the substance of the following sentence from the lower court opinion, highlighted here within its parent paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">On September 12, SPC M again initially resisted appellant\u2019s sexual advances. She wrestled with him and told him \u201cno.\u201d Appellant was unable to undo her trousers and belt. Appellant never threatened bodily harm to SPC M, nor did he expressly threaten her military career. <em>Specialist M did not have a reasonable fear of death or grievous bodily injury, nor did she have a reasonable basis for her conclusion that resistance would be futile. </em>When she saw multiple condoms in his office, she was not too intimidated to challenge his intentions toward other women. As such, we find that SPC M ceased to resist and then engaged in sexual intercourse with appellant. We may infer consent with respect to a rape charge unless SPC M made her lack of consent reasonably manifest by taking such measures of resistance as are called for by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Leak, 58 </em>M.J. at 876 (citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Responding, Appellant argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction to answer this question, but that in any event, the lower court has applied the correct standard to its legal review. Therefore, under either argument the lower court\u2019s decision to set aside Appellant\u2019s conviction for rape is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">We conclude the Court of Criminal Appeals has included within its opinion the essential elements of rape, and has correctly disaggregated the concepts of actual and constructive force. It also applied the correct legal measure to both concepts. The language cited by the Government is addressed to the element of consent and not the element of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">To start, the sentence appears within a paragraph discussing consent and not the element of force. Moreover, breaking the sentence down into its constituent parts, it is evident that the first and second clauses of the sentence are intended to address the second and first clauses of the <em>MCM\u2019s </em>text concerning inferred consent, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvH\">Consent, however, may not be inferred <em>if resistance would have been futile, where resistance is overcome by threats of death or great bodily harm, </em>or where the victim is unable to resist because of the lack of mental or physical faculties. In such a case there is no consent and the force involved in penetration will suffice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\"><em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, U 45.e.(l)(b)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Thus, the lower court did not confuse the requisite standard of physical apprehension addressed to the element of consent with the lesser apprehension of physical injury necessary to demonstrate constructive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">However, we are less certain of the lower court\u2019s application of the law to the facts with respect to this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMB\">we find that SPC M ceased to resist and then engaged in sexual intercourse with appellant. We may infer consent with respect to a rape charge unless SPC M made her lack of consent reasonably manifest by taking such measures of resistance as are called for by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-17\"><em>Leak, </em>58 M.J. at 876 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">On the one hand, this language might be read as the sequential evaluation of resistance as a measure of lack of consent. The court, having found in the preceding sentences that resistance would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>futile, and that resistance was not overcome with the threat of death or great bodily harm, had already found by implication that SPC M had not made her lack of consent reasonably manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On the other hand, the court does not expressly find that the putative victim <em>did not make her lack of consent reasonably manifest, </em>before addressing the question of inferred consent. The court found \u201cSPC M\u2019s testimony to be credible with respect to her unrebutted descriptions of her initial physical and oral manifestations of resistance and the eventual occurrence of sexual activity with appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875-76. The Court of Criminal Appeals also found that SPC M \u201cwrestled with him and told him \u2018no.\u2019 Appellant was unable to undo her trousers and belt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876. In this factual context, the court\u2019s \u201cceased to resist\u201d statement could suggest that the Court of Criminal Appeals considered SPC M\u2019s failure to continually resist, to present, in effect, a legal talisman as to whether or not she had consented. However, as stated earlier, as a matter of law depending on the circumstances, a victim need not physically resist to manifest lack of consent and once lack of consent has been reasonably manifested, one need not continually manifest that lack of consent through resistance. In some contexts, a verbal statement of lack of consent will establish the necessary manifested lack of consent \u2014 \u201cNo,\u201d for example. In other cases, where the lack of consent is not manifest by the language used, or any language at all, or perhaps where the language is superseded or accompanied by competing manifestations of consent, continual resistance may prove dispositive on the question of consent. In this case, the lower court also found as fact that \u201c[w]hen [SPC M] saw multiple condoms in his office, she was not too intimidated to challenge his intentions toward other women.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, this sentence follows the earlier unequivocal analysis regarding inferred consent. Without further discussion it is not clear, on the element of consent (as opposed to force) whether and how this fact may have modified the lower court\u2019s conclusion on consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Because this text is susceptible to two interpretations, one correct in law and the other not, we conclude that a remand for clarification is necessary. We are conscious that few appellate opinions can survive the degree of line diagramming asked by the Government, and now by this Court. At the same time, we are not prepared to read between the lines of the lower court\u2019s opinion and infer application of a correct standard of law given the importance of this matter of law to this case, and to the law generally. Nor do we have authority to find any facts necessary to reach such a conclusion ourselves. However, on remand for clarification the factual findings made by the Court of Criminal Appeals during its Article 66 review are final and may not be reevaluated. <em>See generally Riley, </em>55 M.J. at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\n<em>THE GRANTED ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Regarding the events of September 21, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that the intercourse that occurred on that date \u201cwas not open and notorious and thus it was not \u2018indecent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leak, </em>58 M.J. at 878. Accordingly, the court determined the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction for indecent acts. Instead, the court affirmed the lesser offense of a simple disorder under Article 134 for \u201csexual activity of [a noncommissioned officer] cadre with an enlisted soldier in training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Appellant already stood convicted of maltreatment under Article 93 for \u201cengaging in sexual acts\u201d with \u201ca person subject to his orders.\u201d A simple disorder in this context is a lesser included offense of the maltreatment offense. \u201cOffenses are multiplicious if one is a lesser-included offense of the other.\u201d <em>United States v.

Since \u201cevery enumerated offense under the UCMJ is <em>per se </em>prejudicial to good order and discipline,\u201d the elements of the disorder affirmed under Article 134 are wholly contained in the maltreatment offense as it was charged. <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>54 M.J. 107, 112 (C.A.A.F.2000)(sexual relations with subordinate found as lesser included offense of maltreatment).

The conviction for a simple disorder affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals is dismissed. The certified question and the second specified issue are answered in the negative.

In my view, the correct answer to this request is the same as the punch line of the old joke about the Maine farmer asked for directions to Millinoeket: You can\u2019t get there from here. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion\u2019s resolution of the first and third specified issues. Because I believe we have no authority to act on a finding that a Court of Criminal Appeals has set aside as factually insufficient, I would not reach the certified issue or the second specified issue. I concur with the majority\u2019s resolution of the granted issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">I. Article 67(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">This is a Court of limited jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Clinton v. Goldsmith, </em>\u201cCAAF\u2019s independent statutory jurisdiction is narrowly circumscribed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are an Article I court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cArticle I courts are courts of special jurisdiction created by Congress that cannot be given the plenary powers of Article III courts. The authority of the Article I court is not only circumscribed by the [Constitution, but limited as well by the powers given to it by Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unless Congress has given us the authority to act, we may not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">Congress established our jurisdiction and powers in Article 67 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Article 67(c) provides, \u201cIn any case reviewed by it, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and <em>as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This language conveys a clear and plain meaning: in a case where a Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside a finding on factual insufficiency grounds, rather than on legal grounds, we have no power to \u201cact\u201d on that finding. Such a ruling of the Court of Criminal Appeals is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">That plain language meaning is so clear that the Army Government Appellate Division has recognized it in its brief to this Court. In its response to the third specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>issue, the Government acknowledges that \u201cConsideration of the granted issue falls outside the specific terms of Article 67.\u201d That acknowledgement \u2014 which reflects a correct reading of Article 67 \u2014 is dispositive of this case, because as an Article I court we have no power to act outside the specific terms of Article 67.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201cIt is well established that when the statute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the courts \u2014 at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd \u2014 is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So the plain meaning of the Article 67(c) \u2014 that we are without power to act on a finding that a Court of Criminal Appeals has set aside as factually insufficient \u2014 should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The majority opinion acknowledges this as a possible interpretation of Article 67(c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> yet declines to adopt it. The majority offers two bases for rejecting what I view as the plain-meaning interpretation. First, the majority contends that Article 67(c)\u2019s provision that this Court \u201cshall take action only with respect to matters of law\u201d \u201cmight be read narrowly to <em>require </em>this Court to take action in all certified eases with respect to matters of law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But that language appears to be a limitation on our power to act, not an express command that we take certain action. Acting with respect to a matter of fact would violate that provision; failing to act on a matter of law would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The majority also argues that because Article 67 \u201cdoes not define the terms \u2018act\u2019 or \u2018review,\u2019 the language of the statute is ambiguous as to what is intended by a structure that would have this Court review all certified cases, but not act on certain of those cases.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">I see no ambiguity. Congress clearly intended our Article 67(c) power to <em>act </em>on a ease to be narrower than our Article 67(a) responsibility to <em>review </em>certain cases. Article 67(a) provides that this Court \u201cshall <em>review </em>the record in ... (2) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to review.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Article 67(c) provides that \u201c[i]n any case <em>reviewed </em>by it, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may <em>act </em>only with respect to the findings and sentence ... as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Congress established the authority to <em>act </em>as a subset of the authority to <em>review. </em>This Court must <em>review </em>the record when a Judge Advocate General certifies an issue, but the result of that review may be to say that we have no statutory authority to <em>act. </em>Such an interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tation is consistent with the majority\u2019s own analysis of the terms \u201creview\u201d and \u201cact.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Additionally, the majority\u2019s own construction of Article 67(c) would not avoid this perceived ambiguity. For example, hypothesize that a Court of Criminal Appeals set aside a finding of guilty as factually insufficient and that the relevant Judge Advocate General then certified to this Court an issue expressly asking whether the evidence was factually sufficient. Under the plain meaning of Article 67(c), we would be required to \u201creview\u201d the record in that ease. But the majority would agree that we would have no power to \u201cact\u201d in that case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> So under either the majority\u2019s interpretation or my interpretation, Article 67(c) requires this Court to \u201creview all certified cases, but not act on certain of those cases.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The only question that divides us is which cases fall within the latter prohibition. I believe that the plain language of Article 67(c) answers that question: we may not \u201cact\u201d with respect to the portion of a finding that a Court of Criminal Appeals has set aside as factually insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Because the statute\u2019s meaning is plain, we need not \u2014 and should not \u2014 go beyond the statute\u2019s text to interpret it. As Judge East-erbrook has written for the Seventh Circuit, \u201clegislative history ... may be used only when there is a genuine ambiguity in the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But if it were proper to consult the UCMJ\u2019s legislative history, such consultation would support the conclusion that Congress did not intend to allow this Court to act on a finding that a Court of Criminal Appeals has set aside as factually insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">This meaning is reflected by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees\u2019 reports on the draft UCMJ. Those reports are particularly significant because, as the Supreme Court has noted, a \u201ccommittee report represents the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Both reports observed, \u201cIf the Board of Review has set aside a finding as against the weight of the evidence this decision cannot be reconsidered by the [Cjourt [of Military Appeals].\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The reports contrast such a ruling with one in which a board of review \u201chas set a case aside because of the improper introduction of evidence or because of other prejudicial error.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the Armed Services Committees\u2019 analysis of Article 67(c) emphasized <em>the basis on which the board of review ruled. </em>If that basis was factual insufficiency, then the board of review\u2019s ruling was final. If, on the other hand, the basis was some form of legal error, then the issue could be certified to this Court for further review. In this case, the <em>basis </em>of the Army Court\u2019s ruling was factual insufficiency. So under both the plain language of the statute and the Armed Services Committees\u2019 analysis of the statute, that ruling is final. We have no power to revive the portion of the finding that the Army Court set aside as factually insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The majority, however, finds an \u201cambiguity in statutory intent\u201d and posits that it is \u201caxiomatic that Article 67 must be interpreted in light of the overall jurisdictional concept intended by the Congress, and not through the selective narrow reading of individual sentences within the article.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But concluding that Congress precluded this Court from reviving a finding that a Court of Criminal Appeals set aside as factually insufficient is not a \u201cnarrow reading\u201d of Article 67(c); it is the plain meaning of Article 67(c). In any event, courts are supposed to read Article I courts\u2019 jurisdictional statutes narrowly. The majority\u2019s conceptual approach appears to violate the general principle of statutory construction that \u201cjurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>courts is neither granted nor assumed by implication.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That maxim is particularly apt in the case of an Article I court, whose jurisdiction \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The majority emphasizes that this Court retains the authority to determine whether a decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals is a legal or factual ruling.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> I agree. But as the majority itself acknowledges, \u201cthe Army Court of Criminal Appeals found the evidence of rape factually insufficient and affirmed the lesser included offense of indecent assault.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> So this is not a case where a Com\u00ed; of Criminal Appeals ruled on a legal matter but attempted to insulate its ruling from further review by pretending that it had, instead, ruled on a factual matter. The majority has exercised this Court\u2019s authority to distinguish legal from factual rulings by concluding that the lower court\u2019s decision was based on factual insufficiency. This conclusion places this case outside our Article 67(c) authority to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In discussing the legislative history that indicates this Court retains the discretion to decide whether the lower court\u2019s ruling was a factual or legal decision, the majority states that if we conclude \u201cthat the lower court has erroneously applied the law,\u201d then the lower court\u2019s \u201cdecision on the finding is not yet final.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This puts the cart before the horse. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, we must determine the merits of the case before making what I view as the threshold decision of whether we have the power to act on the case. In this case, we <em>still </em>do not know whether the lower court erroneously applied the law because this Court concludes that the Army Court\u2019s opinion is \u201csusceptible to two interpretations, one correct in law and the other not.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Additionally, the majority\u2019s approach appears to allow the certification of almost all cases that result in a finding of factual insufficiency, because such decisions will almost invariably discuss the law and apply the law to the facts of the case. Under the majority\u2019s approach, this Court would be required to analyze any such discussion or application of the law for legal correctness. The plain meaning interpretation of Article 67(c) is far easier to apply, because it merely calls for a determination of the basis of the lower court\u2019s ruling rather than a far more searching analysis of whether any legal errors contributed to the ultimate ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The majority ably demonstrates that its interpretation of Article 67(c) finds support in this Court\u2019s early precedent.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But because this precedent\u2019s approach conflicts with Article 67(c)\u2019s plain meaning, I would give effect to the congressional limitation on our power. Additionally that half-century old precedent<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> was decided without the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent emphasis on the limitations of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">The majority concludes its analysis of this issue by holding that \u201cArticle 67 does not preclude review of questions of law certified by Judge Advocates General where the courts of criminal appeals have set aside a finding on the ground of factual insufficiency.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> That holding is absolutely correct. This Court does have power to <em>review </em>such issues. As an Article I court, we are not bound by any Article III prohibition against \u201canswering] certified questions which would not or did not alter the position of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ties.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We have, on occasion, issued such opinions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> What this Court lacks is any statutory authority to <em>act </em>in such instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">So this Court is free to address whether the Army Court employed a correct or incorrect constructive force standard. This Court is free to provide analysis of this question that will guide the lower court \u2014 and other military justice practitioners \u2014 in future cases. But Congress has not authorized us to <em>act </em>on a case like this. Accordingly, the majority exceeds its authority when it returns the case for the Army Court to clarify its holding regarding Charge II, Specification 1 \u2014 a finding on which this Court has no authority to \u201cact\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Nor do I join in the portion of the majority opinion addressing the double jeopardy implications of reviving Charge II, Specification 1. Under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, when \u201c \u2018a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In this case, construing Article 67(c) to deprive this Court of authority to revive Charge II, Specification 1 would avoid having to address the double jeopardy issue. Because we can \u2014 and should \u2014 adopt that construction, I would not reach the double jeopardy question.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">. 526 U.S. 529, 535, 119 S.Ct. 1538, 143 L.Ed.2d 720 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\">.
