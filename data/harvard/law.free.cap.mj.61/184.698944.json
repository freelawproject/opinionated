A military magistrate then issued a search authorization to seize a hair sample from Appellant to test it for evidence of drug use. We conclude that the search authorization was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">Appellant was tried by a general court-martial for a single specification alleging use of cocaine on divers occasions between January 17, 2001, and February 16, 2001. Following a contested trial, the members found Appellant guilty as charged of violating Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 21 A key piece of evidence against Appellant was the result of a hair analysis that indicated multiple uses of cocaine. The admissibility of that evidence is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">On February 7, 2001, Appellant provided a urine sample as part of a random drug test. His urine sample contained 238 nanograms per milliliter of the cocaine metabolite; the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD\u2019s) cutoff for a \u201cpositive\u201d test result is 100 nanograms per milliliter.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Following this positive urinalysis result, an Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent interviewed Appellant, who denied that he had knowingly used cocaine. OSI Special Agent (SA) Michael Tanguay then sought authorization to seize a hair sample from Appellant for further testing. He presented an affidavit to Yokota Air Base\u2019s primary magistrate, Colonel Dale A. Hess. The affidavit described the results of Appellant\u2019s urinalysis. It stated next that, based on SA Tanguay\u2019s training and information gathered from a forensic science consultant and the National Medical Services Laboratory, \u201caffiant believes trace amounts of cocaine may be trapped in the cortex of BETHEA\u2019s hair follicles.\u201d The affidavit then went into greater detail to support that conclusion, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">a. As the blood circulates through the body, it nourishes the hair follicle. If there are drugs in the blood, trace amounts of the drug become trapped in the internal portion of the hair, known as the cortex. Those traces remain in the hair as it grows out from the body. These are not removed with routine hygienic washings nor are they flushed out. Thus, chronic drug use, as well as a binge use of a drug, can be detected for a period of up to several months, depending on the length of the hair sample.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The affidavit also described the scientific tests used to analyze hair for evidence of drug use. The affidavit then compared urine testing with hair testing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">c. While urine tests can determine whether a drug was used at least once within the recent past, hair analysis potentially provides information on a binge use or chronic drug use ranging from months, depending on the length of the hair and the type of hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">d. Hair analysis is not subject to false negatives due to temporary abstention or excessive fluid intake. It is currently accepted that hair records drug use in chronological manner and in relative proportion to the amount consumed. The National Medical Services Laboratory can distinguish between heavy, medium and light drug users. Consequently, such hair analysis may be used to prove binge use as well as multiple and/or chronic use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">After spending approximately fifteen minutes with SA Tanguay, the military magistrate issued an authorization to seize from Appellant \u201c[bjodily hair for the purposes of drug testing.\u201d The resulting analysis indicated that Appellant had used cocaine on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">At trial, the defense moved to suppress the results of the hair analysis. The defense argued that the authorization to seize Appellant\u2019s hair was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">During the suppression hearing, the military magistrate who authorized the search took the stand. Colonel Hess testified that \u201cin my mind there was no doubt\u201d probable cause existed. He stated that he was not \u201cconcerned about binge use. I was concerned about the fact that [Appellant] came up positive on urinalysis and I wanted confirmation.\u201d He testified that \u201cI knew ... that the hair test would confirm whether or not he had used cocaine.\u201d He indicated that this conclusion was \u201c[b]ased on previous knowledge and experience\u201d that the affidavit \u201cconfirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">During the suppression hearing, OSI Special Agent (SA) Shannon Nuckols also testified. SA Nuckols was one of six OSI forensic science consultants. SA Nuckols testified that he did not know if hair analysis can detect \u201ca specific single use.\u201d But, SA Nuck-ols testified, a hair analysis will indicate \u201cmultiple uses over a period of time.\u201d He later clarified that \u201cbinge or chronic use ... would show up in hair.\u201d He defined binge use as \u201cnumerous uses over a short period of time, 12, 24, 36 hours.\u201d SA Nuckols also testified that \u201ca positive urinalysis doesn\u2019t necessarily show a single use. You can get multiple uses that show up in a urinalysis.\u201d While SA Nuckols was on the stand, the military judge said, \u201cI want to move back from the science a little bit and just talk sort of logic or common sense. Somebody pops positive on a urinalysis 30 days ago, is there a fair shot hair is going to be able to detect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>some drug?\u201d SA Nuckols answered, \u2018Tes, Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">On cross-examination, the defense established that SA Nuckols had previously testified at the Article 32 investigation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201ca single small use\u201d of cocaine would not be detected by hair analysis. SA Nuckols then expanded, \u201c[M]y experience and training is if I had to choose between the two methods, urinalysis and hair, if you\u2019re looking for a single use, urinalysis would be better. And that typically hair shows chronic uses \u2014 multiple uses.\u201d SA Nuckols also agreed with the military judge that based on the DOD cutoff levels, a positive urinalysis is \u201cequally consistent with the tail end of a binge use or ... a very small use [a] short time prior to submission of the sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The military judge denied the motion to suppress. He concluded that \u201cthe positive urinalysis alone, coupled with the information available to the magistrate, more than adequately demonstrates a reasonable likelihood that cocaine or a cocaine derivative will be found in the accused\u2019s hair,\u201d especially because the seizure would occur \u201cwithin a month of the alleged use.\u201d The military judge concluded that evidence derived from seizing the hair was admissible \u201ceven if the Magistrate operated under the assumption that the accused had only used cocaine on one occasion approximately two weeks before the requested search.\u201d The military judge concluded that the \u201c[mjagistrate relied upon information he had been provided which suggests that drug hair testing can detect a single drug use, albeit characterized as \u2018binge.\u2019 \u201d The military judge then observed that he was \u201cconvinced that it is more than reasonable to assume, based upon the contents of the affidavit, that hair drug testing can detect a ... single drug use if the hair test is performed within two months of the alleged use, regardless of how that use may be characterized.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The military judge also found that \u201cthere was no evidence whatsoever, either direct or circumstantial,\u201d that the requesting agents had intentionally or recklessly withheld relevant information from the military magistrate. The military judge then repeated that a hair analysis can detect \u201cbinge use,\u201d which \u201ccan reasonably mean one or a series of large doses.\u201d He concluded that SA Nuckols\u2019s testimony and the affidavit itself \u201cclearly\u201d indicate that \u201ca single use of cocaine can be detected by hair testing, particularly when the hair is seized within several months of the alleged use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The military judge also concluded in the alternative that, even if the search authorization had not been supported by probable cause, the evidence would be admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the military judge\u2019s ruling in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Air Force Court ruled that Appellant\u2019s urinalysis results were \u201csufficient to establish a \u2018fair probability\u2019 that the appellant\u2019s hair would contain evidence of cocaine use.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Air Force Court also agreed with the military judge that regardless of whether the authorization was supported by probable cause, the evidence would be admissible because the OSI agents who seized Appellant\u2019s hair sample \u201cacted in \u2018objectively reasonable reliance\u2019 upon the magistrate\u2019s facially valid search authorization.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">This case concerns whether Appellant\u2019s urinalysis results provided probable cause to support the seizure of a sample of his hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The affidavit presented to the military-magistrate established that Appellant\u2019s urine contained the metabolite that the body produces following the use of cocaine. Neither Appellant\u2019s results in particular, nor positive urinalysis results in general, suggest whether the individual used a controlled substance once or more than once. So Appellant\u2019s urinalysis results were equally consistent with a single use of cocaine or with multiple uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The affidavit that was before the military magistrate indicated only that hair analysis would detect \u201cbinge\u201d or \u201cchronic\u201d use of a drug. Yet the military magistrate suggested and the military judge expressly stated that they believed hair analysis could detect a single use of cocaine. To decide this case, we need not engage in a semantic analysis of the meaning of \u201cbinge.\u201d Even if that term is properly understood to refer only to multiple uses, we conclude for the reasons set forth below that Appellant\u2019s urinalysis results provided probable cause to seize a sample of his hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A military judge\u2019s determination of whether probable cause existed to support a search authorization is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for ... concluding] that probable cause existed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIn reviewing probable cause determinations, courts must look at the information made known to the authorizing official at the time of his decision. The evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-18\">\u201cProbable cause to search exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in the place or on the person to be search[ed].\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The test for probable cause is whether, under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the magistrate had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for determining that probable cause existed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A probable cause determination is a \u201cpractical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cprobable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A probable cause determination merely requires that a person \u201cof reasonable caution\u201d could believe that the search may reveal evidence of a crime; <em>\u201cit does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So even though \u201cpeople often use \u2018probable\u2019 to mean \u2018more likely than not,\u2019 probable cause does not require a showing that an event is more than 50% likely.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>When evaluated under this standard, the affidavit provided the military magistrate with a substantial basis for concluding that there was probable cause to authorize the seizure of Appellant\u2019s hair. The urinalysis results were consistent with, though not necessarily indicative of, multiple uses of cocaine. The information presented to the military magistrate indicated that an analysis of Appellant\u2019s hair would detect multiple uses of cocaine. So it was as likely as not that evidence of cocaine use would be found in Appellant\u2019s hair. That degree of likelihood more than satisfies the probable cause standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In light of our holding that there was a substantial basis for finding probable cause, we need not consider whether the military judge and the Air Force Court were correct when they determined that even absent probable cause, the evidence would have nevertheless been admissible under the exclusionary rule\u2019s good faith exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-25\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. <em>See </em>Article 32, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">.
