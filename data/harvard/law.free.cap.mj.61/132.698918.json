James pleaded guilty to using and distributing ecstasy in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a (2000). He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, two years of confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of E-l. The convening authority approved the findings and sentence and granted James 120 days of administrative confinement credit under Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 305(k). On December 10, 2003, the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. James, </em>No. ACM 34863, 2004 WL 26824 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Dec. 10, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">A judge may limit a defendant\u2019s cross-examination of a prosecution witness regarding the terms of a plea agreement entered into by the witness, so long as adequate inquiry into possible bias of that witness has been allowed through other lines of questioning. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>39 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir.1994). During James\u2019s court-martial the military judge allowed the defense to cross-examine one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses concerning some aspects of the witness\u2019s pretrial agreement. The military judge, however, precluded the defense from questioning the witness regarding a specific term of that agreement. We granted review of Issue I to determine whether the limitations placed on the cross-examination of the witness impermissibly infringed upon James\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">A member of a court-martial panel may be removed for cause if it is shown that he or she \u201chas an inelastic opinion concerning an appropriate sentence for the offenses charged.\u201d R.C.M. 912(f) discussion. During voir dire one of the potential members expressed reservations about discharging ser-vicemembers who were convicted of minor drug crimes. She later agreed that if the evidence warranted, she would be able to vote for a punitive discharge. The military judge granted the Government\u2019s challenge for cause against the member. We granted review of Issue II to evaluate whether the military judge\u2019s decision to grant the challenge for cause was prejudicial error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">We find that the military judge did not err in regard to either ruling. His ruling limiting cross-examination did not impermissibly infringe on James\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights and his grant of the Government\u2019s challenge for cause was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>I. <em>Cross-Examination of Airman Basic Rose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the prosecution called Airman Basic Scott Rose, James\u2019s alleged best friend, to testify against James. Rose testified that James had introduced him to ecstasy by providing him with his first ecstasy pill. He also testified about James\u2019s use and distribution of ecstasy on a number of occasions. At the time of his testimony, Rose had been tried by a general court-martial, had pled guilty pursuant to a pretrial agreement, and had been sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">His pretrial agreement limited the period of confinement that could be approved by the convening authority to eighteen months. Although the maximum authorized punishment for Rose\u2019s crimes included the possibility of confinement for fifty-two years, his adjudged sentence was eighteen months and a punitive discharge. At the time of Rose\u2019s testimony he had not yet submitted clemency matters for the convening authority\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">During cross-examination of Rose, the defense attempted to explore Rose\u2019s potential bias in favor of the Government by inquiring into Rose\u2019s offenses and the terms of his pretrial agreement. The military judge allowed the defense some latitude to explore potential motives for Rose to fabricate testimony because of his pretrial agreement. He ruled, however, that the terms of Rose\u2019s pretrial agreement concerning the maximum punishment the convening authority could approve were not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In response to questioning by the defense and trial counsel, Rose acknowledged: (1) that he had a pretrial agreement in his own court-martial; (2) that as part of that pretrial agreement he pleaded guilty and entered into a stipulation of facts; (3) that he had immunity for his testimony in James\u2019s court-martial; (4) that his pretrial agreement required him to cooperate with the Government against his best friend; and (5) that clemency was still pending in his case and as part of that process he would be able to tell the convening authority that he had cooperated and testified against James.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Military Rule of Evidence 608(e) provides that \u201c[b]ias, prejudice, or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by evidence otherwise adduced.\u201d James argues that he was precluded from adequately exploring the bias and motives of a witness against him by the military judge\u2019s rulings, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. He notes that in his pretrial agreement, Rose received a reduction in his possible sentence from fifty-two years to eighteen months. He argues that this potential windfall was relevant evidence of Rose\u2019s bias in favor of the Government, regardless of the fact that Rose had already been sentenced to eighteen months and would not realize any actual benefit of the sentence limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">The Government argues that the military judge exercised his discretion in placing reasonable limits on Rose\u2019s cross-examination in order to avoid confusion of the issues. It contends that James had ample opportunity to explore Rose\u2019s bias by exposing the fact that he was testifying pursuant to a pretrial agreement and by obtaining his admission that he might receive a benefit in the form of clemency from his testimony. The Government concludes that Rose\u2019s failure to actually benefit from the agreement means that the terms of the agreement are not relevant to show possible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">In <em>United States v. Bahr, </em>33 M.J. 228, 232 (C.M.A.1991), this court adopted the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986), for determining whether cross-examination inquiring into the potential bias of a witness was properly limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">\u201c[w]e have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Davis [v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-17, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)] (citing <em>Greene v. McElroy, </em>360 U.S. 474, 496, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959)). It does not follow, of course, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness. On the contrary trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">475 U.S. at 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431. Because this court has not had occasion to specifically address the scope of cross-examination that a judge should allow concerning pretrial agreements, it is helpful to review the federal circuit court decisions that have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>United States v. Maceo, </em>947 F.2d 1191 (5th Cir.1991), the Fifth Circuit found that the trial judge did not err when he limited the defense attorney\u2019s cross-examination of a witness regarding the terms of his plea agreement. The court noted that \u201c[t]he Confrontation Clause does not prohibit a trial judge from limiting cross-examination where the testimony would confuse the issues, is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>Maceo, </em>947 F.2d at 1200 (citing <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431). The court found that the jury was well aware of the terms of the plea agreement and that limiting the cross-examination simply precluded additional questioning on the subject. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>the Seventh Circuit found that the Sixth Amendment rights of the defendants were not violated where the trial judge prevented defense counsel from asking two prosecution witnesses \u201cwhat penalties they might have faced without plea bargains.\u201d 39 F.3d 705, 707-08 (7th Cir.1994). Defense counsel was allowed to impeach the motives of the witnesses by eliciting testimony that the witnesses were testifying under plea bargains as well as what benefits they were to receive from their agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The court in <em>Nelson </em>discussed the limitations of cross-examination and noted that courts must initially distinguish between the \u201c \u2018core values of the confrontation right and more peripheral concerns which remain within the ambit of the trial judge\u2019s discretion.\u2019 \u201d 39 F.3d at 709 (quoting <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>973 F.2d 1354, 1358 (7th Cir. 1992)). Addressing the limitations imposed by the trial judge, the court found that there was no constitutional violation because the limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">on cross-examination did not deny the defendants the opportunity to <em>establish </em>that the witnesses may have had a motive to lie; rather, the limitations denied them the opportunity to <em>add extra detail </em>to that motive. \u201c \u2018The exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u2019\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 678-79, 106 S.Ct. at 1435 (quoting <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-17, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)). But once this core function is satisfied by allowing cross-examination to expose a motive to lie, it is of peripheral concern to the Sixth Amendment how much opportunity defense counsel gets to hammer that point home to the jury. The trial court may preclude \u201ccumulative and confusing cross-examination into areas already sufficiently explored to permit the defense to argue personal bias and testimonial unreliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>832 F.2d 366, 373 (7th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1739, 100 L.Ed.2d 203 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 708. The court then went on to find that the trial judge had allowed the jury to hear enough evidence to make a \u201cdiscriminating appraisal\u201d of the witnesses\u2019 motives and biases, and that he did not abuse his discretion in limiting cross-examination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Faced with somewhat different factual situations, other circuit courts have taken different views of the issue. In <em>United States v. Roan Eagle, </em>867 F.2d 436 (8th Cir.1989), a prosecution witness had pleaded guilty to manslaughter instead of murder as part of her plea agreement but had not yet been sentenced. The Eighth Circuit found that under those circumstances an inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the terms of the agreement was essential. The court noted that the information is especially relevant if the witness has not yet been sentenced because \u201cthere is a continuing incentive to give testimony that strengthens the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In <em>United States v. Schoneberg, </em>388 F.3d 1275 (9th Cir.2004), the prosecution witness was a eoconspirator whose plea agreement required his cooperation with the Government. The jury was made aware of the plea agreement and also was told that a term of the plea agreement reserved the possibility of a sentence reduction after the witness testified against his coconspirators. That term required the Government to file a post-sentencing motion to reduce the witness\u2019s sentence if it determined that he had provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the Government through his testimony. <em>Schoneberg, </em>388 F.3d at 1277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The trial judge prohibited the defense attorney from cross-examining the witness as to whether his testimony was affected by the Government\u2019s promise to move for a sentence reduction if he provided them with \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit found that this prohibition had the effect of keeping from the jury the fact that the witness was conscious, throughout his testimony, that the Government and not just the jury was judging the truthfulness of his statements. The court found that this consciousness gave him a motive to lie in favor of the Government and therefore was a relevant area for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Having reviewed the holdings in these eases, we conclude that the limitations placed on cross-examination by the military judge were within his discretion and did not affect James\u2019s core constitutional right to cross-examination. The members knew that Rose had received an agreement in exchange for his testimony and that pursuant to that agreement he had pleaded guilty and entered a stipulation of fact. They also knew that this agreement required him to cooperate with the Government in James\u2019s prosecution. They knew that he had been granted immunity for his testimony in James\u2019s trial. Finally, they knew that his clemency hearing was still pending and that he would be able to tell the convening authority that he had cooperated in James\u2019s prosecution. As the Seventh Circuit noted in <em>Nelson, </em>once the defendant has been allowed to expose a witness\u2019s motivation in testifying, \u201cit is of peripheral concern to the Sixth Amendment how much opportunity defense counsel gets to hammer that point home to the jury.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>39 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Additionally, we find it important to consider that although Rose entered into a pretrial agreement that promised a substantial reduction in sentence if he cooperated with the Government, he already had been sentenced to eighteen months of confinement by members who had no knowledge of the terms of the pretrial agreement. This is distinguishable from both <em>Roan Eagle </em>and <em>Schone-berg </em>where the witnesses had yet to receive the benefit of their bargain with the Government and were therefore under a continuing obligation to comply with their agreements to testify against the defendant to obtain the promised relief. Rose\u2019s only \u201ccontinuing incentive\u201d identified in this case was that his clemency appeal was pending before the convening authority and if he testified favorably he would be able to inform the convening authority that he cooperated with the Government in James\u2019s trial. As noted above, the military judge allowed the defense to bring these facts to the attention of the members and expose Rose\u2019s potential bias and motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">A military judge has wide discretion to limit repetitive cross-examination or to prohibit cross-examination that may cause confusion. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431. The military judge in this case properly exercised this discretion and we affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">II. <em>Voir Dire of Major Winkler</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB2\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">During voir dire of potential panel members, Major (Maj) Maryellen Winkler was questioned regarding her view of discipline in the Air Force and more specifically regarding her views on punishments for drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>crimes. In responding to those questions Maj Winkler mentioned her concern over a newspaper article that she had seen regarding a large drug bust in which a number of Air Force members were caught and punished. Her testimony in response to questions from the trial and defense counsels and the military judge is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">Examination by Circuit Trial Counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">Q. Major Winkler in response to one of my questions regarding progressive discipline, you said that you didn\u2019t feel that a court-martial may be the appropriate starting point for someone who has admitted guilty to use and illegal distribution of drugs. Could you please expound on your answers to why you feel that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">A I truly feel, looking at the individual, it almost feels like it is a one shot deal. You have one shot at making a mistake and then that\u2019s it. Of course everyone has seen the Air Force Times showing the big drug bust in the Virginia area and all the airmen and airman basics, senior airman and what sentences they have received, etcetera, etcetera, and I thought about that before I even knew what this case was about and it was kind of shocking to me. Q. The length of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">A. The length of time and what they received, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">Q. Will you be thinking about that back in the deliberation room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">A I\u2019m human and that is just how I feel. Yes, I would be. It might be just my personality, it just might be looking at him, he\u2019s young, does he just deserve one shot and hopefully not getting what they gotten. There is a conflict in my mind. But, I didn\u2019t hear any of the evidence and I don\u2019t know exactly what is going on, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">Q. Let me ask you ... do you think that drug use is more of a medical problem then [sic] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">A. No, not at all. I guess maybe what I am thinking is that we are all young, we all do stupid stuff sometimes, and one mistake shouldn\u2019t kill us____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">Examination by Circuit Defense Counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">Q. Ma\u2019am, if the military judge instructs you that you are to consider \u2014 -I expect that he will instruct you that you are to consider the full range of punishments, <em>from no </em>punishment up to the maximum punishment, can you assure the court, both the government and defense, that you will do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-16\">A. I think I can, because we are looking at him totally not as a young kid, we are looking at him as a military member too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-17\">Examination by the Military Judge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-18\">Q. And let me just ask you, do you feel comfortable sitting on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-19\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-20\">Q. And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-21\">A. Just because, again, I have read \u2014 you just see in the paper all the time and the punishments that the kids got, the young airmen got in Virginia \u2014 we have no tolerance of drugs whatsoever in the military, which we know that. Yet on the other hand, I just feel that a young person shouldn\u2019t be probably kicked out and put in jail or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-22\">Q. I guess I am trying to get you to go ahead and conclude for me. What is the conclusion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-23\">A. I just feel that he deserves more of a shot than one error in his career.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-24\">Q. When I asked you if you feel uncomfortable sitting in the case, do you feel that you can perform your duties in sitting on a case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-25\">A. Definitely, Sir, I can perform my duties. Would I feel comfortable with myself, yes, because it is my duty. Will I do the right thing? Yes, I will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-26\">Q. And you mentioned these Air Force Times articles that you have read ...[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-27\">A. Actually there was a big bust in Virginia, the Virginia area, I think there were about 20 people that were listed in the Air Force Times ranging anywhere from an airman basic \u2014 I think the highest rank was a senior airman, I am not sure. Then I saw all their sentences and I was shocked, I was taken back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Q. At what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">A. Their sentences. I really felt that while these \u2014 again, I didn\u2019t hear any of their cases, but I just thought, wow, these guys made a mistake and look at the punishment for this. I am not making myself clear am I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">Q. No, it is important since you have had some obviously careful thought about the offense of which the accused is now before this court for sentencing, that you disclose to both parties what that careful thought is. Can you be fair to both the government and the accused in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">A. Yes, I feel I can be fair, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The prosecution challenged Maj Winkler for cause on the grounds of an \u201cinelastic predisposition in favor of the defense.\u201d The military judge granted the challenge stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Well, my recollection is that she not only said she was shocked twice by a punitive discharge, but shocked by another form of punishment as well, that may have been confinement. She also said that. \u201cShe hated or hates to see the airmen kicked out for this offense\u201d were the words I recall her using in reference to those discharges. She seemed almost relieved when I asked if she would be uncomfortable sitting on the court, as though it was going to be an opportunity for her not to have to sit on the court. I think at the same time she is professional enough to let us know that as much as she hates to see a sort of punishment like this, or as much as she is shocked, she is a professional officer, to let us know that she would try and do her best to be fair in performing her duties. It just seems to the court, from viewing her and viewing her expressions as she described the Air Force Times article in regard to those other cases, that she would have an extremely difficult time in sitting on this case and doing just what she promised to do, which was consider the entire range of punishments, just wavering a little bit in that area is cause for concern as well. I am going to grant the challenge for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">This court has held that an accused \u201c \u2018has a constitutional right, as well as a regulatory right, to a fair and impartial panel.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Strand, </em>59 M.J. 455, 458 (C.A.A.F.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Wiesen, </em>56 M.J. 172, 174 (C.A.A.F.2001)). A member may be removed for cause if it is shown that he or she should not sit \u201cin the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.\u201d R.C.M. 912(f)(l)(N). The discussion accompanying this rule provides that an inelastic opinion concerning an appropriate sentence for the offenses charged may be grounds for challenge under this provision. R.C.M. 912(f) discussion. The party that makes the challenge for cause has the burden of proving that grounds for a challenge exist. R.C.M. 912(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Generally, this court has addressed challenges for cause where those challenges were denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In evaluating a military judge\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause, the court has found it appropriate to recognize the military judge\u2019s superior position to evaluate the demeanor of court members. A military judge\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause will therefore not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. McLaren, </em>38 M.J. 112, 118 (C.M.A.1993); <em>United States v. White, </em>36 M.J. 284, 287 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">In evaluating challenges for cause based on claims of \u201cinelastic attitude,\u201d this court has held that \u201can unfavorable inclination toward an offense is not automatically disqualifying. \u2018The test is whether the member\u2019s attitude is of such a nature that he will not yield to the evidence presented and the judge\u2019s instructions.\u2019,\u201d <em>McLaren, </em>38 M.J. at 118 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. McGowan, </em>7 M.J. 205, 206 (C.M.A.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In the context of challenges brought by a defendant, this court has stated that \u201cmilitary judges must liberally grant challenges for cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Downing, </em>56 M.J. 419, 422 (C.A.A.F.2002); <em>see also McLaren, </em>38 M.J. at 118 (quoting <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>25 M.J. 278, 279 (C.M.A.1987)). The \u201cliberal grant\u201d policy supports the UCMJ\u2019s interest in ensuring that members of the military have their guilt or innocence determined \u201cby a jury composed of individuals with a fair and open mind.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>21 M.J. 15, 18 (C.M.A.1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Deain, </em>5 C.M.A. 44, 49, 17 C.M.R. 44, 49 (1954)). It is a response to the unique nature of the military justice system \u201cbecause in courts-martial peremptory challenges are much more limited than in most civilian courts and because the manner of appointment of court-martial members presents perils that are not encountered elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19; <em>see also Glenn, </em>25 M.J. at 279. Because the Government rather than the defendant brought this challenge for cause, we must first consider whether the \u201cliberal grant\u201d policy is applicable under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Unlike the convening authority, who has the opportunity to provide his input into the makeup of the panel through his power to detail \u201csuch members of the armed forces as, in his opinion, are best qualified for the duty,\u201d <em>see </em>Article 25(d)(2), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(d)(2)(2000); <em>see also </em>R.C.M. 503(a)(1), the defendant has only one peremptory challenge at his or her disposal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Glenn, </em>25 M.J. at 279. The liberal grant rule protects the \u201cperception or appearance of fairness of the military justice system.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>42 M.J. 384, 386 (1995). Given the convening authority\u2019s broad power to appoint, we find no basis for application of the \u201cliberal grant\u201d policy when a military judge is ruling on the Government\u2019s challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">We turn next to the central question of whether the military judge\u2019s finding that Maj Winkler \u201cwould have an extremely difficult time in sitting on this case and doing just what she promised to do, which was consider the entire range of punishments,\u201d was clearly erroneous. Maj Winkler repeatedly expressed concern with the harsh punishments handed out for drug crimes in the Air Force. She clearly expressed her feeling that \u201cwe are all young, we all do stupid stuff sometimes, and one mistake shouldn\u2019t kill us.\u201d She also stated that she would feel uncomfortable sitting as a member because of her beliefs. While Maj Winkler provided appropriate responses to rehabilitative questions, the military judge not only was able to hear her responses, he was able to evaluate her demeanor by \u201cviewing her and viewing her expressions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">We conclude that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in granting the Government\u2019s challenge to Maj Winkler on the basis of an \u201cinelastic predisposition.\u201d The military judge found that Maj Winkler wavered when asked if she could consider the entire range of punishments and expressed her concerns regarding punishments in drug cases both verbally and nonverbally. We decline to find his conclusion that she would have trouble considering the entire range of punishments to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">We also do not see evidence that the military judge applied the liberal grant policy in reaching his conclusion. The record reflects that he carefully considered all of Maj Wink-ler\u2019s responses and her demeanor in reaching his conclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Air Force court as to Issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to Issues I and II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\">. In Issue I we granted review of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT\u2019S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONT THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM BY REFUSING TO PERMIT DEFENSE COUNSEL TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL BIAS OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES ARISING FROM PROMISES BY THE GOVERNMENT TO LIMIT PUNISHMENT OF THE WITNESSES IN EXCHANGE FOR COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF APPELLANT.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-17\">. In Issue II we granted review of the following: WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED IN GRANTING THE PROSECUTION\u2019S CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE (OVER DEFENSE OBJECTION) AGAINST A COURT MEMBER.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">. It is only in cases involving the death penalty that the court has been asked to review a challenge for cause that was granted. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>33 M.J. 101, 107 (C.M.A.1991); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>51 M.J. 1, 31-32 (C.A.A.F.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. The staff judge advocate also may have the power to excuse members before the court-martial is assembled, and the trial counsel then still has one peremptory challenge during the court-martial itself. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 505(c)(1)(B); R.C.M. 912(g)(1). The Government therefore has ample opportunity to affect the makeup of the panel before trial defense counsel has any opportunity for input.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
