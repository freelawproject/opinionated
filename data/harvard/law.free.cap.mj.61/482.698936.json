He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for six months, forfei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ture of $737 pay per month for six months, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged, and the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">We granted review of the following issue: WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT WHEN, OVER DEFENSE OBJECTION, HE GAVE THE \u201cFRIEDMANN\u201d INSTRUCTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">For the reasons articulated below, we affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">During the sentencing hearing of his court-martial, Appellant elected to give an unsworn statement to the members in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">When deciding whether your sentence should include some amount of confinement, I know that each case has to be decided on its own merits. But I also believe that similar cases should receive similar punishments. Such as last year, Senior Airman Watson from Tyndall was charged with using ecstasy and the confinement portion of his sentence was only three months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">To rebut Appellant\u2019s statement, trial counsel presented the court-martial order relevant to Senior Airman (SrA) Watson\u2019s case indicating that Watson had received a bad-conduct discharge, four months of confinement, forfeitures, and reduction to E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Over the objection of defense counsel, the military judge also informed the parties that he was going to issue a <em>Friedmann </em>instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then instructed the members as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">Now, during the accused\u2019s unsworn statement, he alluded to a case of another individual who the accused had stated had received a certain degree of punishment. In rebuttal, the trial counsel offered you Prosecution Exhibit 6, which was the court-martial order from that case which stated what that individual got in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-15\">The reason I mention this is for the following reason, and that is because, in fact, the disposition of other cases is irrelevant for your consideration in adjudging an appropriate sentence for this accused. You did not know all the facts of those other cases, or other cases in which sentences were handed down, nor anything about those accused in those cases, and it is not your function to consider those matters at this trial. Likewise, it is not your position to second guess the disposition of other cases, or even try to place the accused\u2019s case in its proper place on the spectrum of some hypothetical scale of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">Even if you knew all the facts about other offenses and offenders, that would not enable you to determine whether the accused should be punished more harshly or more leniently because the facts are different and because the disposition authority in those other cases cannot be presumed to have any greater skill than you in determining an appropriate punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">If there is to be meaningful comparison of the accused\u2019s ease to those of other [sic] similarly situated, it would come by consideration of the convening authority at the time that he acts on the adjudged sentence in this case. The convening authority can ameliorate a harsh sentence to bring it in line with appropriate sentences in other similar cases, but he cannot increase a light sentence to bring it in line with similar cases. In any event, such action is within the sole discretion of the convening authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-18\">You, of course, should not rely on this in determining what is an appropriate punishment for this accused for the offenses of which he stands convicted. If the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that you impose in this case is appropriate for the accused and his offenses, it is none of your concern as to whether any other accused was appropriately punished for his offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">You have the independent responsibility to determine an appropriate sentence, and you may not adjudge an excessive sentence in reliance upon mitigation action by higher authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Appellant argues, as he did before the Court of Criminal Appeals, that the military judge\u2019s instruction interfered with his right of allocution, which this Court stated is \u201clargely unfettered\u201d and has been \u201cbroadly construed.\u201d <em>United States v. Grill, </em>48 M.J. 131, 133 (C.A.A.F.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">During sentencing proceedings, an accused has a right to \u201ctestify, make an unsworn statement, or both in extenuation, in mitigation or to rebut matters presented by the prosecution.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(e)(2)(A). An un-sworn statement may be oral, written, or both. R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C). It may be presented to the court by the accused or by counsel at the direction of the accused. <em>Id. </em>The unsworn statement is not subject to cross-examination; however, it is subject to rebuttal, comment during the Government\u2019s closing argument, and it may be tempered by appropriate instructions from the military judge. <em>Id.; Grill, </em>48 M.J. at 133. Thus, while \u201cthe scope of an unsworn statement may include matters that are otherwise inadmissible under the rules of evidence, the right to make an unsworn statement is not wholly unconstrained.\u201d <em>United States v. Tschip, </em>58 M.J. 275, 276 (C.A.A.F.2003); <em>United States v. Jeffery, </em>48 M.J. 229, 230 (C.A.A.F.1998). An accused, for example, may not use the unsworn statement as a vehicle to show disrespect or a defiance of authority. <em>United States v. Rosato, </em>32 M.J. 93, 96 (C.M.A.1991). Appellant now tests the apparent tension between the rationale of <em>Rosato </em>and <em>Grill, </em>and this Court\u2019s stated view in <em>United States v. Mamaluy, </em>10 C.M.A. 102, 106, 27 C.M.R. 176, 180 (1959), that \u201csentences in other cases cannot be given to court-martial members for comparative purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">In <em>Grill, </em>the Government asked the military judge to bar the accused from referencing in his unsworn statement the sentences received by the accused\u2019s civilian coconspira-tors in civilian court. The Government argued that the civilian sentences were irrelevant to the accused\u2019s sentencing at court-martial. Grill wanted to advise the members that some of his fellow weightlifters, who were civilians, received lenient or no punishment for their use of steroids.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>their cases were adjudicated rapidly, whereas he had suffered the stress of lengthy adjudication. The military judge agreed with the Government, and concluded that the material was \u201c \u2018clearly inappropriate to present to members\u2019 and was objectionable as irrelevant and confusing under Mil. R. Evid. 402 and 403....\u201d <em>Grill, </em>48 M.J. at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">This Court reversed and stated that \u201can accused\u2019s right to allocution in the form of an unsworn statement, while not wholly unconstrained, has been broadly construed for decades.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized that in most cases the military judge\u2019s instructions could serve to place the unsworn statement in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">[W]e have confidence that properly instructed court-martial panels can place un-sworn statements in the proper context, as they have done for decades ____ Such instructions, as well as trial counsel\u2019s opportunity for rebuttal and closing argument, normally will suffice to provide an appropriate focus for the member\u2019s attention on sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\"><em>Id. </em>This would include \u201cany concern of the military judge with muddying the sentencing waters\u201d by having the accused include with his unsworn statement \u201cmatters that were not admissible in evidence on sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132 (citing <em>Rosato, </em>32 M.J. at 96; <em>United States v. Breese, </em>11 M.J. 17 (C.M.A.1981)). With this predicate, the Court concluded \u201cthe right to make a statement in allocution is not wholly unfettered, but if there are abuses, they should be addressed in the context of the statements made in specific cases.\u201d <em>Grill, </em>48 M.J. at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The issue presented in this case is whether Appellant\u2019s proposed statement regarding the sentence of another accused in an unrelated case was relevant to the issue of Appellant\u2019s sentencing, and if not, whether Appellant nonetheless was entitled to introduce the information without instruction by the military judge that the information was irrelevant. Appellant argues that the instruction effectively nullified his right of allocution. The Government argues that by placing Appellant\u2019s statement in proper context, the military judge was doing no more than that required by <em>Grill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">We review a military judge\u2019s decision to give a sentencing instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>56 M.J. 393, 395 (C.A.A.F.2002)(citing <em>United States v. Greaves, </em>46 M.J. 133 (C.A.A.F.1997)). \u201cThe military judge has considerable discretion in tailoring instructions to the evidence and law.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>56 M.J. at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">As described above, Appellant called the members\u2019 attention to the sentence awarded to SrA Watson at Tyndall Air Force Base. Appellant did not assert that Watson\u2019s case was closely related to his own. The military judge permitted trial counsel to rebut Appellant\u2019s statement concerning Watson\u2019s sentence, and instructed the member as quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">The judge\u2019s instruction accurately states the law. \u201c[I]t has long been the rule of law that the sentences in other cases cannot be given to court-martial members for comparative purposes.\u201d <em>Mamaluy, </em>10 C.M.A. at 106, 27 C.M.R. at 180. This rule seeks to keep courts-martial from becoming engrossed in collateral issues and recognizes the UCMJ\u2019s emphasis on individualized consideration of punishment. \u201c[Pjroper punishment should be determined on the basis of the nature and seriousness of the offense and the character of the offender, not on many variables not susceptible of proof.\u201d 10 C.M.A. at 107, 27 C.M.R. at 181. Therefore, the instruction in this case appropriately stated that the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>mation was irrelevant. Appellant\u2019s statement brought the sentence from another case to the attention of the members for comparative purposes. Case law precludes such comparison. Thus, we conclude that the military judge acted within his discretion in instructing the members that the comparative sentencing information offered by Appellant was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In reaching this conclusion, we are cognizant of Appellant\u2019s argument that the military judge\u2019s instruction effectively nullified this portion of his statement. Because the information in question was not otherwise relevant as mitigation, extenuation, or rebuttal, it was beyond the scope of R.C.M. 1001, and the military judge could correctly advise the members that the comparative sentencing information was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In different circumstances, a military judge might appropriately preclude the introduction of information that in context is outside the scope of R.C.M. 1001, if the military judge determines that an instruction would not suffice to place the statement in proper context for the members. For example, were an accused to offer a comparative review of sentences in the Air Force generally, a military judge would have to consider whether an instruction could adequately place the information \u201cin proper context\u201d and whether the Government was entitled to rebut the information with a study of its own, with all the incumbent risks of the mini-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In summary, the right to allocution is broad, and largely unfettered, but it is not without limits. <em>Grill </em>should not be read to suggest otherwise. Appellant presented comparative sentencing information, which was not relevant as extenuation, mitigation, or rebuttal. The military judge put the information \u201cin proper context\u201d by effectively advising the members to ignore it. While the military judges instruction emphasized that this portion of Appellants statement was irrelevant, the instruction was consistent with <em>Grill\u2019s </em>general preference for contextual instruction rather than outright preclusion. However, each case will present different facts, different arguments regarding the relevance of sentencing statements under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2), and a differing risk of confusion, distraction, and error. A military judge exercising his or her discretion, for example, might treat the comparative cases of cocon-spirators differently than the sentences of drug offenders generally, choosing to instruct or preclude given the specific statement at issue and depending on the context in which it is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">We hold that the military judge did not err when he instructed the members regarding Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement. The instruction given enabled the members to place Appellant\u2019s statement in the appropriate perspective. The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\">. In <em>United States v. Friedmann, </em>53 M.J. 800 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2000), the accused informed the members in his unsworn statement that two of the four airmen who pled guilty to drug use with him received nonjudicial punishment and administrative discharges. He then asked the members to allow his commander to administratively discharge him in lieu of adjudging a punitive discharge. In response, the military judge instructed the members to disregard the possibility that the accused might be administratively discharged along with the sentences given to others in related cases. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed under a plain error analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. Although not the focus of his appeal, Appellant also argues that the judge's instruction \"was dangerously misleading because the military judge\u2019s reference to the convening authority ameliorating any harsh sentence essentially relieved the court members of their independent responsibility to determine an appropriate sentence.\u201d An instruction may not suggest that members may consider the possibility of convening authority action in determining an accused's sentence. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1005(e)(4). In this case, however, the Appellant initiated the discussion of sentence comparison in his unsworn statement by asking the members to consider the sentence adjudged in another case when determining his sentence. The military judge was responding to Appellant\u2019s request and placing it in context. If a military judge has not limited an accused\u2019s unsworn statement that invokes sentence comparison, a military judge may instruct the members that in the military justice system: (1) the members are required to adjudge a sentence based upon their evaluation of the evidence without regard to the disposition of other cases; (2) to the extent that the system provides for sentence comparison, that function is not part of the members\u2019 deliberations; it is a power assigned to the convening authority and Court of Criminal Appeals; and (3) in the course of determining an appropriate punishment, the panel may not rely upon the possibility of sentence reduction by the convening authority or the Court of Criminal Appeals. The militaiy judge in this case provided an instruction that covered these points. In the future, it would be preferable for military judges not to use terms such as \"harsh\u201d or \"light\u201d so as to avoid any implication that the panel might rely on the convening authority\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\">. In particular. Grill wanted to include the following language in his unsworn statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">There have been two additional factors which have made waiting during the last year even more difficult. One is knowing that my friends, the men who are weight lifters just like me and who were equally involved with ster<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>oids, have received such favorable treatment while I am being treated so harshly. It is my understanding that one of them ..., who was in the United States on a visa, was simply asked to leave and that no charges were brought against him. Another of my friends ... was charged months ago, plead [sic] guilty, just like I have, and received only probation. Then he was allowed to move to Korea even though he was convicted and on probation. Finally, it is my understanding that no charges have ever been brought against [the third civilian conspirator], and may never be brought against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af8\">The fact that everyone else received such lenient treatment, and that [the first two friends] have had their cases over and done with, while I am still waiting after so much time, makes this entire situation really hard for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq6\"><em>Grill, </em>48 M.J. at 132-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b618-12\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">I write separately to mourn our missed opportunity to clarify, modify, or overrule this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Grill, </em>48 M.J. 131 (C.A.A.F.1998). Instead, this Court again leaves counsel and military judges in Alice\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">\u201cIt seems very pretty,\u201d she said when she had finished it, \u201cbut it\u2019s <em>rather </em>hard to understand!\u201d (You see she didn\u2019t like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn\u2019t make it out at all.) \u201cSomehow it seems to fill my head with ideas \u2014 only I don\u2019t know exactly what they are!\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">As if describing the theory that parallel lines eventually meet in space, the majority posits that somewhere, some material exists that, when offered in an unsworn statement, a military judge, bearing in mind <em>\u201cGrill\u2019s </em>general preference for contextual instruction rather than outright preclusion,\u201d may preclude consideration of information on the basis that it \u201cin context is outside the scope of R.C.M. 1001.\u201d 61 M.J. at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Grill </em>was certainly not such a case and, apparently, neither is Appellant\u2019s. And so the great dance continues. <em>Grill </em>recognizes a nearly unfettered right to introduce matters, such as sentence comparisons in an unsworn statement, and today\u2019s lead opinion reassures military judges that they should follow <em>Grill </em>and \u201cplace unsworn statements in proper context\u201d by telling the members that the sentence comparisons are irrelevant and should be excluded from their sentencing considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In the end, this practice probably does more to detract from an accused\u2019s credibility and the effectiveness of his presentencing case than if the President were to eliminate the unsworn statement altogether. Because military judges dare not exclude such matters, when an accused and his counsel weave the thread of sentence comparison (or other, as yet undetermined matters) through the accused\u2019s unsworn statement, the last thing court members will hear before they begin their sentence deliberations is the military judge telling them that much of what the Appellant asked them to consider was baloney.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Until we revisit <em>Grill, </em>return the unsworn statement to a form more consistent with law and history, and reassure military judges that they may exercise reasonable control over the sentencing case, the carousel will continue to operate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. Lewis Carroll, <em>Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There </em>24 (William Morris &amp; Co., Inc. 1993)(1872) (Alice's observation after using the looking glass to read \"Jabberwocky.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b619-7\">ERDMANN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Acz\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">I agree with the majority disposition of this case. I write separately, however, to express my view that <em>United States v. Grill, </em>48 M.J. 181 (C.A.A.F.1998), creates an irreconcilable tension between the scope of pre-sentencing unsworn statements and the military judge\u2019s obligation to provide proper instructions. That tension is obvious in this case: what the currently defined right to allocution through a pre-sentencing unsworn statement under <em>Grill </em>permits, the military judge takes away in a <em>Friedmann </em>instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">This tension finds its origin in <em>United States v. Rosato, </em>32 M.J. 93 (C.M.A.1991) where this court stated that the scope of unsworn statements is \u201cgenerally considered unrestricted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. The treatises relied upon in <em>Rosato </em>for the assertion that an unsworn statement is virtually unlimited must be considered in context. It is premised upon a right to make an unsworn statement that is distinctly different than the right currently established as part of military pre-sentencing procedure in the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) (2002 <em>MCM).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">The unsworn statement recognized in trials by courts-martial prior to implementation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the 1951 <em>Manual for Courts-Martial</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a pre-findings statement, as contrasted with the current pre-sentencing statement. The accused was permitted to make a statement \u201cin the nature of an argument\u201d which \u201cby custom of the service\u201d could also contain \u201callegations of fact, some of which may not have been presented to the court in the form of evidence during the course of the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Colonel Winthrop notes in his treatise on military law, an accused was granted \u201cvery considerable freedom\u201d before findings because \u201cunder the critical circumstances in which he is placed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>[the accused] should certainly be allowed the largest latitude of expression.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The 1928 Manual<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> established a pre-sen-tence procedure that did not provide for an unsworn statement or argument by counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the 1928 <em>MCM, </em>the right to make an unsworn statement was provided only prior to findings, and was permitted \u201cin denial, explanation, or extenuation of the offenses charged.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At that time the unsworn statement played a key role in the actual defense against charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Pursuant to the authority granted by Article 36(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 836(a) (2000), the President adopted revised pre-sentencing procedures in the 1951 <em>MCM. </em>Those procedures included the right of an accused to make \u201can unsworn statement to the court in extenuation or mitigation of the offenses of which he stands convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The 1969 <em>Manu</em>al<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> contained the same authority for an accused to make an unsworn statement \u201cin mitigation or extenuation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The right was expanded in the 1984 Manual\u2019s<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rules for Courts Martial (R.C.M.) to include an \u201cunsworn statement ... in extenuation, in mitigation, or to rebut matters presented by the prosecution, or for all three purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The accused\u2019s right to make an unsworn statement exists in that same form in the current version of the <em>MCM.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">Although the historical underpinnings of the \u201cunsworn statement\u201d prior to the 1951 <em>MCM </em>are relevant to the scope of that \u201cpre-findings\u201d unsworn statement, they do not support the cortelusion that the \u201cpre-sen-tence\u201d unsworn statements are broader than as defined by the President. The right to make an unsworn statement on sentencing does not conflict with or diminish any constitutional or statutory right and should be enforced and interpreted as created by the President, i.e., to include matters in extenuation, mitigation and rebuttal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These terms are well-defined and known in military practice but are not so broad as to be unrestricted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">While I recognize that the majority opinion is following this court\u2019s prior precedent in <em>Chill </em>and that the viability of <em>Chill </em>was not challenged in this case, I believe it is time to reconsider that precedent. In relying on the flawed premise that a pre-sentence unsworn statement is \u201cunrestricted,\u201d <em>Chill </em>engenders a procedure that unnecessarily complicates military justice proceedings. The military judge and counsel must sit by while the accused articulates information that is not in extenuation, mitigation or rebuttal. The military judge then instructs the members to ignore those portions of the unsworn statement. The result is unnecessary confusion and distraction that benefits neither the accused nor the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The scope of unsworn statements is defined by R.C.M. 1001 and the content is limited to extenuation, mitigation and rebuttal. There is no right for an unsworn statement to exceed that definitional scope. Where an accused seeks to make a pre-sentencing unsworn statement containing material that does not mitigate, extenuate, or rebut, the military judge should exclude that information as irrelevant to proper sentencing consideration. Such action not only preserves the accused\u2019s rights as conferred by the <em>Manual, </em>it also prevents confusion, distraction and waste of time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\">. <em>See United States v.
