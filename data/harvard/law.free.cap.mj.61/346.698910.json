The military judge sentenced Appellant to be reduced to E-l, to be confined for ten months, and to be discharged with a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority reduced Appellant\u2019s sentence to confinement for 199 days, but otherwise approved the sentence. On June 10, 2004, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals modified the findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-24\">[E]xcepting the phrases \u201con divers occasions\u201d and \u201cvisual depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u201d from the finding of guilty, substituting therefore \u201cthirty-four visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,\u201d as ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>erenced in Prosecution Exhibit 1 and as illustrated by the thirteen attachments to that exhibit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>United States v. Garlick, </em>No. ACM 35298, 2004 CCA LEXIS 183, at *8, 2004 WL 1539576, at *3 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. June 10, 2004). That court reassessed and affirmed the sentence. On December 10, 2004, this Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">WHETHER APPELLANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED BY THE PROSECUTION\u2019S FAILURE TO DISCLOSE DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION PRIOR TO TRIAL.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We conclude that any error that may have resulted from a failure to disclose information was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and that Appellant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Finding no basis in fact and law to question the providence of that plea, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The court below summarized the facts, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">The appellant was a member of an Internet group (Egroup) called Candyman, an electronic forum devoted to child pornography. The appellant was a subscriber from 15 January 2001 to 28 January 2001. An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that the appellant was in possession of numerous images of child pornography at his home near Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. These images were discovered during a search authorized by a civilian federal magistrate pursuant to a probable cause affidavit submitted by the FBI. Trial in the case took place on 5 August 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afz-dedup-0\">The appellant avers that on 12 August 2002, a week after his court-martial ended, the trial counsel notified the trial defense counsel by memorandum that a statement contained in the FBI\u2019s probable cause affidavit was untrue. Trial defense counsel appended this memorandum to the appellant\u2019s clemency submissions, which are attached to the record of trial. The statement in question is as follows: \u201cEvery email sent to the [Candyman] group was distributed to every member automatically. Therefore, when an individual transmitted child pornography to the Candyman group via e-mail, those images were transmitted to every one of the group members.\u201d According to the trial counsel\u2019s memorandum, however, automatic receipt of e-mails was only the default setting for subscribers to the group, and individuals were able to elect not to receive emails if they so chose. According to this memorandum, this information was known to the FBI prior to trial in the appellant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-14\"><em>Garlick, </em>2004 LEXIS 183, at *2, 2004 WL 1539576, at *1 (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">The eleven-page affidavit of Special Agent (SA) Davis, upon which the U.S. Magistrate Judge\u2019s search warrant was based, included brief details of SA Davis\u2019s five-year FBI career; described the premises and items to be seized; provided definitions from the Child Pornography Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251-2260 (2000), and other sources; explained basic workings of computers and peripheral devices; explained how the internet is used as a medium for traffic in child pornography and how internet sites and user addresses work, including that even on-line storage can leave detectable traces on the individual computer used to effect that storage. This section also explained that those interested in child pornography tend to collect, trade, and preserve the images on computers, disks, etc., and usually retain the images for long periods of time. The affidavit then provided nearly four pages of information specific to operation of the Candyman Egroup and to Appellant\u2019s involvement therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>25.... The purpose of the Candyman Egroup, as stated on its own website, was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201cThis group is for People who love kids. You can post any type of messages you like too [sic] or any type of pics and vids you like too [sic]. P.S. IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER WE WILL HAVE THE BEST GROUP ON THE NET.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">27. Voluntary Egroup Membership: In order to join the Egroup, a person had to visit the URL ... and send an e-mail to the group moderator requesting permission to join. The moderator would then send a confirmation notice to the request- or\u2019s e-mail account, advising him that he now had access to the Egroup. There was no fee to join. In addition, at the bottom of each e-mail were directions instructing a member what to do if he wanted to stop receiving e-mails from the group and no longer desired to be a member of the group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">28____ <em>Second, all new members of the Egroup were immediately added to the Candyman e-mail list. Every e-mail sent to the group was distributed to every member automatically. Therefore, when an individual uploaded and transmitted child pornography to the Candyman group, those images were transmitted to every one of the group members </em>.... [emphasis added to indicate factually misleading material.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">29. Images Posted on the Website: The primary feature of the Candyman Eg-roup\u2019s website was the \u201cFiles\u201d section. This allowed members to upload and download images directly to and from the website. SA Binney was a member of the Egroup from January 2, 2001, through February 6, 2001, when Yahoo! closed down the Egroup. During that period of time, SA Binney captured approximately one hundred images and video clips that had been uploaded to the website. The images and video clips can be broken into three categories: 1) the majority depicted prepubescent minors engaged in different sexual activities; 2) a large number of the images focused on the genitalia of the nude minors; 3) the remainder were considered child erotica. Yahoo was unable to tell the FBI who downloaded images or video clips from the Egroup. <em>However, when someone uploaded a file to the website, the Egroup was set up such that a notice was sent via e-mail to all members advising them of the name of the file, which folder it had been posted in, the e-mail address of the individual who posted it and, in some cases, a description of the file. In other words, child pornography posted to the website was automatically distributed to the members, </em>each of which had knowingly joined an Egroup devoted to the trading of child pornography, [emphasis added to indicate factually misleading material.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">30. E-mail received: From January 2, 2001, through February 6, 2001, SA Bin-ney received approximately 498 e-mail messages from the Candyman Egroup, most of which contained images of child pornography or child erotica or information concerning those subjects or the operation of the Egroup. During this period, SA Binney received a total of approximately 183 child erotica images and 105 child pornography images through these emails. The last e-mail containing child pornography SA Binney received from the group he received on February 6, 2001\u2014 the date that Yahoo! closed down the Eg-roup. This e-mail contained two child pornography images. The first image depicts a nude female approximately ten years of age performing oral sex on an adult male while the second shows the same female straddling an adult male while masturbating him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">31. On January 22, 2001, SA Binney served a federal grand jury subpoena on Yahoo Services, the owner and operator of Egroups. Yahoo responded with a list of approximately 3397 e-mail addresses of Candyman Egroup members. Specifically, the e-mail address garlickjason@ hotmail.com, was listed on the Candyman Egroup list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">33.... Yahoo provided subscription logs (indicating the dates and times subscribers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>requested to subscribe and/or unsubscribe to the different Egroups), and post logs indicating the dates and times members posted images and/or text messages to the Egroups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Affidavit For Search Warrant, Investigating Officer\u2019s Report, June 28, 2002, Allied Papers. <em>See also Garlick, </em>2004 LEXIS 183, at *3,2004 WL 1539576, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">SA Davis did not append these \u201csubscription logs\u201d to the affidavit and did not aver any dates and times pertaining to Appellant\u2019s alleged activity with the Egroup, or that Appellant was a member of the Egroup on any date other than January 22, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After documenting that \u201cgarlickjason@ hotmail.com\u201d was Appellant\u2019s \u201cusername\u201d and that Appellant lived at the address to be searched, SA Davis added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">44. On August 31, 2001, pursuant to the court order, Yahoo! provided a zip disk to the Houston Division of the FBI containing all log files from the three Egroups [\u201cCandyman,\u201d \u201cShangrLIa,\u201d and \u201cGirls 12-16\u201d]. Houston analyzed and copied all information referencing garlickjason@ hotmail onto a CD which was forwarded to the Pensacola Resident Agency of the FBI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">46. Attached to this affidavit are copies of 15 photographs which were received by Jason P. Garlick while he was a member of the Candyman e-group. These photographs are a sample of the 116 photographs that Jason P. Garlick received while a member of that e-group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Affidavit For Search Warrant, Investigating Officer\u2019s Report, June 28, 2002, Allied Papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">After receiving formal, post-trial notice of misstatements in the search affidavit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel requested a ten-day delay in the submission of clemency matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">On 12 Aug 02, the defense was informed that a factual inconsistency existed in the affidavit submitted by SA Kerry Davis in obtaining the search warrant for SrA Gar-lick\u2019s home. In order to effectively advise my client and prepare an adequate clemency request or take other appropriate action, I require additional time to investigate and research this matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Api\">After this delay, the defense counsel submitted clemency matters to the convening authority on Appellant\u2019s behalf, to which she appended trial counsel\u2019s notice of \u201cfactual inconsistencies.\u201d Defense counsel requested no relief related to these \u201cinconsistencies,\u201d nor does the appellate record indicate that defense counsel requested either a post-trial Article 39(a) session<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">Appellant contends that <em>Brady v. MarylandI</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and R.C.M. 701(a)(6) compel disclosure of exculpatory evidence, including impeachment evidence, for use at trial, and that the Government failed to make such disclosure. Further, because the Government cannot demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the results of trial would not have been different, Appellant argues that he is entitled to a new trial under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Roberts.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Assuming that the Government had a duty to disclose the information at issue in a timely manner, the distinctive facts set forth below would still compel us to evaluate Appellant\u2019s claims in light of whether there is a \u201c \u2018substantial basis\u2019 in law and fact for questioning [Appellant\u2019s] plea.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In determining whether Appellant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we look to the record of trial and the documents considered by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">As detailed above, the affidavit of SA Davis raised several concerns, which, taken together with Appellant\u2019s admitted familiarity with the Candyman website and its operation, cannot have escaped the notice of both Appellant and his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">There is no indication that SA Davis included the zip drive with his affidavit or catalogued its contents, and while paragraphs 44 and 46 of the affidavit could be read to imply otherwise, the actual language of those paragraphs fails to allege that the \u201cHouston Division\u201d found <em>any </em>e-mails, uploads, or downloads bearing garkckjason@hotmail.com, or that that office attributed <em>any </em>images of child pornography to Appekant\u2019s possession, control, or usage. Finally, the presumptive support for SA Davis\u2019s conclusion that the fifteen photographs attached to the affidavit \u201cwere received by Jason P. Garlick while he was a member of the Candyman e-group,\u201d or for SA Davis\u2019s further conclusion that those photographs \u201care a sample of the 116 photographs that Jason P. Garlick received while a member of that e-group,\u201d is SA Davis\u2019s earker, erroneous description of the \u201cautomatic e-mail\u201d system of the website.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Nothing in AppeUant\u2019s pretrial agreement precluded a suppression motion to contest either the factual sufficiency of the affidavit or any other perceived defect in the warrant or subsequent authorization. Appellant made no motions. Even without the \u201cfactual inconsistencies\u201d provided by the Government, this was an affidavit ripe for litigation, yet Appellant and his counsel declined to litigate the issue prior to Appellant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">If there remained a question regarding Appellant\u2019s knowledge of the necessary factual support for such a motion, that question was emphatically resolved by his counsel\u2019s later fully informed and well-considered declination either to raise the motion in a post-trial Article 39(a) session,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or request a new trial from the convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">During the <em>Care </em>inquiry, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-15\">MJ: I just want to make sure that none of these ... images that you\u2019ve pled guilty to possessing weren\u2019t delivered to your computer by mistake____ So what you\u2019re telling me is there was no mistake?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-18\">ACC: Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-19\">MJ: So you intentionally downloaded the images, knowing what they were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-20\">ACC: Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">Further, the Stipulation of Fact, knowingly and wilkngly entered into by Appellant, describes Appellant\u2019s subscription to the Can-dyman Egroup and the Egroup\u2019s e-mail options, but makes no mention of any \u201cautomatic e-mail\u201d option. That omission, as well as the stipulation\u2019s inclusion of a corrected figure for the number of photographs Appekant downloaded from the Candyman website, Appellant\u2019s admission to the military judge that he had purposely and intentionaky downloaded these images, and Appellant\u2019s post-trial decision not to litigate when presented with the opportunity to do so, detract significantly from Appellant\u2019s claim that he was not already aware of the \u201cfactual inconsistencies\u201d disclosed by the Government, as wek as other errors in SA Davis\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The information not disclosed by the Government was within Appellant\u2019s knowledge well before trial. Even after being formally notified after trial of a disclosure error, and obtaining a delay to consider legal options, Appellant\u2019s counsel declined to litigate the issue or advocate its importance to the convening authority in her R.C.M. 1105 submission. Under these unique circumstances, any error that may have resulted from a failure to disclose such information is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find no basis in law or fact to question the providence of Appellant\u2019s voluntary plea, and we affirm the decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. In so doing, however, we do not retreat from our established practice of urging trial counsel to execute diligently their continuing duty to disclose discoverable information to the defense. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 701(d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">.

I write separately, however, because I believe that the Court\u2019s analysis should focus on the effect of the violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), in the warrant affidavit, rather than on the Appellant\u2019s imputed pretrial knowledge of that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The majority disposes of Appellant\u2019s claim principally based upon his failure to act on imputed knowledge of the misrepresentation in the warrant affidavit prior to entry of his guilty plea. Although the lead opinion never uses the term \u201cwaiver,\u201d its analysis is strongly redolent of that concept. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1611 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201cwaiver\u201d as \u201cthe voluntary relinquishment or abandonment \u2014 express or implied \u2014 of a legal right or advantage____ The party alleged to have waived a right must have had both knowledge of the existing right and the intention of foregoing it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">An unconditional guilty plea \u201cwaives any objection, whether or not previously raised, insofar as the objection relates to the factual issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made.\u201d R.C.M. 910(j). But a valid guilty plea must be intelligent and voluntary. <em>United States v. Roeseler, </em>55 M.J. 286, 289 (C.A.A.F.2001); <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 C.M.A. 535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969). \u201cMisapprehension of the strength and extent of the prosecution\u2019s case which is engendered by misrepresentation or other impermissible government conduct is a matter which clearly could impact on the voluntariness of the decision by appellant ... to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Payton, </em>23 M.J. 379, 381 (C.M.A.1987). <em>See also Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 720, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Here, the Government failed to fulfill an affirmative duty to disclose a known factual misrepresentation in the search warrant affidavit. That affidavit asserted that Candy-man list members automatically received all materials, including child pornographic images, distributed to the list. In reality, subscribers chose from among three different delivery options, two of which did not automatically distribute pornographic images to list members. Indeed, the majority of subscribers elected one of the \u201cnon-automatic\u201d options. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>247 F.Supp.2d 459, 467-68 (S.D.N.Y.2003); <em>United States v. Strauser, </em>247 F.Supp.2d 1135, 1137 (E.D.Mo.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">The majority contends that Appellant and his counsel must have been aware of these errors prior to entry of Appellant\u2019s guilty plea. But it seems illogical to impute such knowledge to the Appellant where the government agent preparing the actual warrant affidavit was himself apparently oblivious to the error. And once the Government did become aware of its misrepresentation, it failed to provide Appellant notice of the defect until several days after he entered his unconditional guilty plea and was sentenced. Because Appellant\u2019s plea was entered without notice of a potentially fatal misrepresentation in the search warrant, I do not believe that he waived his right to challenge that warrant for probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Ultimately, however, I conclude that Appellant\u2019s conviction must survive because, even absent the false material, the remaining information in the warrant affidavit continues to establish probable cause. At the threshold, \u201c[t]he duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for ... concluding1 that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>54 M.J. 414, 418 (C.A.A.F.2001) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">As we recently stated in <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>59 M.J. 323, 325 (C.A.A.F.2004), \u201c[o]ur review of diseovery/disclosure issues utilizes a two-step analysis: first, we determine whether the information or evidence at issue was subject to disclosure or discovery; second, if there was nondisclosure of such information, we test the effect of that nondisclosure on the appellant\u2019s trial.\u201d As indicated above, and conceded by the Government, the Government\u2019s knowledge of the false information in the warrant affidavit was clearly material to Appellant\u2019s defense, and consequently, subject to disclosure under <em>Brady, </em>Article 46, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000), and R.C.M. 701. Moreover, the Government\u2019s duty to diligently disclose newly discovered evidence continued throughout the duration of the court-martial proceedings. R.C.M. 701(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Proceeding to the second step of the analysis, erroneous nondisclosure will generally entitle an appellant to relief only where the appellant demonstrates a reasonable probability of a different result at trial had the evidence been disclosed. <em>Roberts, </em>59 M.J. at 326-27. But where an appellant establishes that the Government failed to disclose discoverable evidence in response to a specific request, the burden shifts to the Government to demonstrate the nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Here, Appellant\u2019s counsel served a fairly detailed discovery request to trial counsel asking for, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">[A]ll personal or business notes, memoran-da, and writings prepared by investigators incident to said case (including FBI or other civilian law enforcement) which are not furnished pursuant to any other provisions of this request ... [;] any known evidence tending to diminish credibility of ... all potential witnesses ... [; and] any and all evidence in the possession of the Government or otherwise known to Trial Counsel which reasonably may tend to: 1) negate the guilt of the Accused; 2) reduce the guilt of the Accused to the offenses charged; or 3) reduced the punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">I conclude that the Government\u2019s failure to disclose the erroneous information pursuant to this request shifts the burden to the Government to demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The probable cause predicate in the search warrant would be invalid if the Court were to conclude that the Government included the defective material in the supporting affidavit \u201cknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d and that the affidavit\u2019s remaining material was inadequate to establish probable cause after the false information was set aside. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Because the erroneous Candyman affidavit was used to support search warrants in literally hundreds of investigations of list members around the world, this precise issue has been repeatedly litigated in other courts. At least three federal district courts decided that the Government acted recklessly and that the remaining information in the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>United States v. Kunen, </em>323 F.Supp.2d 390 (E.D.N.Y.2004); <em>Perez, </em>247 F.Supp.2d at 479-85; <em>Strauser, </em>247 F.Supp.2d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Consistent with the majority of courts considering this issue, however, I conclude that, regardless of the Government\u2019s knowledge or recklessness regarding the erroneous material, the information remaining in the warrant affidavit was adequate to demonstrate probable cause. <em>See United States v. Froman, </em>355 F.3d 882 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Hutto, </em>84 Fed.Appx. 6 (10th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Schmidt, </em>373 F.3d 100 (2d Cir.2004) (stating in dicta that the affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>vit continued to establish probable cause, but deciding ease on other grounds). While the allegation that Appellant automatically received pictures of child pornography in his email was a significant component of the warrant affidavit\u2019s probable cause predicate, it was not the only one. In particular, the affidavit asserted that the \u201cwebsite had several different features\u201d including a \u201c\u2018Files\u2019 section [which] provided an area for members to post images or video files for others to upload.\u201d Indeed, the affidavit described the Files section as the \u201cprimary feature\u201d of the website, and noted that the agent investigating the case downloaded approximately one hundred images of child pornography and erotica over a one month period. The affidavit also quoted the website\u2019s description of itself as a \u201cgroup for people who love kids\u201d and invitation to \u201cpost any type of messages you like too [sic] or any type of pies and vids you like too [sic].\u201d Appellant does not challenge these portions of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">As we recently reiterated in <em>United States v. Bethea:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">A probable cause determination is a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [the issuing judge], including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that probable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard. A probable cause determination merely requires that a person of reasonable caution could believe that the search may reveal evidence of a crime; <em>it does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. </em>So even though people often use probable to mean more likely than not, probable cause does not require a showing that an event is more than 50% likely. 61 M.J. 184, 187 (C.A.A.F.2005) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">I think it is a reasonable inference from the uncontested information in the warrant affidavit that a probable purpose of Candy-man membership was to gain access to the child pornography available on the website. Someone joining the site was likely to download and trade in child pornography. Thus, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the unchallenged portion of the warrant affidavit constituted a substantial basis for the issuing magistrate to conclude that there was probable cause that Appellant had downloaded child pornography from the Candyman website, and retained such images in his possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">My conclusion is further ratified by two additional considerations. First, in those cases where courts have suppressed the fruits of the Candyman warrant, the defendants demonstrated that they had elected a non-automatic distribution option. <em>Perez, </em>247 F.Supp.2d at 471; <em>Strauser, </em>247 F.Supp.2d at 1137. Thus, the erroneous information in the warrant affidavit was not only false, but demonstrably misleading as applied to those defendants\u2019 receipt of child pornography. Here, Appellant does not claim that he chose one of the non-automatic delivery options. Thus, there is no basis for an inference of actual prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">Finally, I find it significant that Appellant did not assert his plea was improvident in the clemency package or in a post-trial session in front of the military judge. He raised the issue as a legal concern only after it became apparent that other Candyman defendants were having some success raising the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">In sum, Appellant alleges that the contested warrant lacks probable cause, and consequently, that his guilty plea was improvidently entered. Because I disagree with Appellant regarding his first proposition, I conclude that there is no substantial basis in law or fact to question the providence of his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M. J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991).</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
