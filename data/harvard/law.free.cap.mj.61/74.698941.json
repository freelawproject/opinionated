Roberts, </em>59 M.J. 323, 327 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Hart, </em>29 M.J. 407, 410 (C.M.A.1990)). During discovery, Cano specifically requested that the Government produce the clinical psychologist\u2019s medical records compiled during her therapy sessions with the victim. After reviewing the materials in camera, the military judge released a portion of the material and sealed the remaining documents. The Court of Criminal Appeals found that the military judge erred in withholding the materials but held that Cano was not prejudiced by the error. We granted review to determine whether the Court of Criminal Appeals erred in finding that Cano was not prejudiced by the withholding of these documents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the nondisclosure of these materials was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On August 9, 2000 Cano\u2019s eleven year-old stepdaughter, DH, had a sleepover with two of her friends at the Cano home. The girls stayed up late and around midnight Cano came into DH\u2019s room and asked the girls if they wanted to take some pictures with his computer. He took DH\u2019s two friends, one at a time, into his computer room where he removed their clothes, touched each of them on their breasts and one of them on her vaginal area, made one of the girls touch his penis, and took pictures of each of them. After the girls went back to DH\u2019s room they told DH what happened. DH tried to tell her mother but Cano prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">One of the girls lived nearby, so the two girls left Cano\u2019s house and went to the girl\u2019s home where they told her mother what had happened. The incident was reported to Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID), which interviewed DH as part of its investigation. During that interview DH gave a sworn statement in which she alleged that Cano had sexually abused her for six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">Some time after DH made this statement she met with Dr. DeeAnn Lau, a clinical psychologist from the on-post medical facility. DH was treated by Dr. Lau from September 2000 through December 2000. At some point between the August 9 incident and Cano\u2019s trial, Cano\u2019s wife (DH\u2019s mother) told Dr. Lau that DH had recanted her story about having been abused by Cano. Mrs. Cano also made other statements regarding the possibility that DH was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">At trial DH testified regarding various incidents in which Cano had touched her, had forced her to rub his penis, had forced her to place his penis in her mouth, and had inserted his penis into her vagina. DH\u2019s mother testified for the defense. She said that on the evening in question she had been in bed with Cano and had been awake until approximately 1 a.m. On cross-examination the Government pointed out that this was inconsistent with her statement on the night of the incident in which she said that she had fallen asleep at midnight. Mrs. Cano said that she had no explanation for the discrepancy and was also unaware that the pictures taken of the girls that had been found on Cano\u2019s computer were time-stamped at approximately 12:30 a.m. She further testified that after she and DH watched a movie about a man who was falsely convicted for something he had not done, DH told her that \u201cshe was lying\u201d because of the way Cano treated her and that she \u201csaid that stuff\u2019 because Cano spanked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Prior to trial the defense made a specific discovery request for the collection of notes taken by Dr. Lau during her therapy sessions with DH between August and December 2000. The military judge rejected the Government\u2019s contentions that the notes were privileged and reviewed the materials in camera. Following his review, the military judge released that portion of the materials he deemed relevant to the case and sealed the remainder. The Army Court of Criminal Appeals found that although the military judge erred in failing to release all of the materials, that error was not prejudicial to Cano.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In evaluating the impact of the requested evidence, the Army court tested for materiality on the basis of whether the evidence \u201cmight have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d The Army court found that the withheld evidence would have allowed for some minor impeachment of DH when she testified and \u201cwould have provided data relevant to the defense\u2019s concern that DH\u2019s testimony was of a memory created or implanted during the therapy process.\u201d However, after evaluating DH\u2019s testimony the Army court found that overall she was \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cclear and forthcoming, largely consistent with her\u201d earlier signed statement, and \u201ccredible.\u201d It also noted that her testimony was \u201csubject to reasonable scrutiny by the defense on cross-examination.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe undisclosed evidence would not, in fact, have made any difference in the outcome of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Before this court Cano argues that the Army court erred in concluding that he was not prejudiced by the military judge\u2019s erroneous decision to deny him the opportunity to review the withheld documents. He argues that the lower court applied the wrong standard for evaluating prejudice and also erred in failing to consider the impeachment value of the withheld evidence. Cano argues that the withheld notes demonstrate inconsistencies in DH\u2019s account of what allegedly transpired between DH and Cano and support the possibility that Dr. Lau\u2019s counseling techniques influenced DH\u2019s account of events. Cano asserts that denying him access to these records undermined the defense\u2019s ability to prepare for trial effectively, and more specifically, to prepare its cross-examination of DH.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The Government responds by arguing that the military judge\u2019s error in failing to disclose this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore did not prejudice Cano. It contends that the evidence presented against Cano at trial was overwhelming, noting the strength of DH\u2019s testimony and the defense\u2019s failures in its attempts to impeach her credibility and her memory. Additionally, the Government argues that the evidence in question is not evidence of inconsistencies or coaching, but rather shows that DH was consistent in her statements regarding the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. It concludes that the undisclosed evidence in this case was of minimal evidentiary value and would not have affected the fact-finder\u2019s decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\n<em>The Army Court\u2019s Prejudice Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In <em>Roberts </em>this court clarified that \u201c[wjhere an appellant demonstrates that the Government failed to disclose discoverable evidence in response to a specific request ... the appellant will be entitled to relief unless the Government can show that nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 59 M.J. at 327 (citing <em>United States v. Hart, </em>29 M.J. 407, 410 (C.M.A.1990)). The Army court\u2019s opinion in this case, issued prior to this clarification, concluded that \u201cthe undisclosed evidence would not, in fact, have made any difference in the outcome of this case[,]\u201d and therefore applied a lesser standard than required by <em>Roberts. </em>As we review issues of prejudice from erroneous evidentiary rulings de novo, this court can apply the correct \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard in our review. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>45 M.J. 494, 496 (C.A.A.F.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\n<em>Inconsistencies in DH\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">We first turn to Cano\u2019s claim that Dr. Lau\u2019s notes could have been used to show inconsistencies in DH\u2019s testimony. The most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>obvious difference between DH\u2019s earlier statement and her testimony at trial was her statement at trial that Cano had penetrated her, while her earlier statement suggested that he had only touched her with his penis. Dr. Lau\u2019s notes do contain a statement noting that DH said Cano had penetrated her, and therefore DH\u2019s assertions regarding penetration would have been revealed to the defense prior to trial had the materials been turned over.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Cano\u2019s defense counsel became aware of this inconsistency when DH testified at trial and properly impeached her during cross-examination. By cross-examining on that point, the defense counsel demonstrated to the military judge that DH\u2019s earlier statement was not as complete as her trial testimony. There was little more that he could have done even if he had received the notes at an earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Dr. Lau\u2019s notes also indicated that during treatment, DH made inconsistent statements concerning the timing and location of incidents of abuse. For example, the notes stated that DH \u201cdenied having been abused since she was 10 y.o.\u201d Cano points out that DH was, in fact, eleven years and five months old at the time she had earlier claimed she was last molested. Similarly, Cano argues that the evidence shows an inconsistency with regard to the location in which DH claimed incidents of abuse took place. There is a notation in the therapy notes that in talking to Dr. Lau, DH \u201crecalled that the abuse occurred \u2018downstairs in the computer room,\u2019\u201d but at trial DH testified that the abuse took place in the bathroom and in her parent\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We agree with the defense that these are inconsistencies that could have been used by the defense at trial. However, it was obvious throughout DH\u2019s testimony, both on direct and cross-examination, that her sense of the timing and locations of various instances of abuse was not always entirely clear. Defense counsel himself showed at trial that DH\u2019s understanding of time was not exact. He began his cross-examination by asking DH how many days were in a week, to which she replied \u201clike 5 days,\u201d and then asked how many hours in a day, to which she answered \u201cI think 26.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Inconsistencies such as these are not uncommon when child abuse victims testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax_\">[T]he evidence ... is underscored by the fact that the persuasive testimony is from a child, from whom gathering more exact details as to when the sexual conduct precisely began is an unreasonable expectation and a formidable hurdle. Any person who suffers from some type of traumatic experience, adult or child, may have difficulty relating that experience in a chronological, coherent and organized manner. <em>See </em>Kermit V. Lipez, <em>The Child Witness in Sexual Abuse Cases in Maine: Presentation, Impeachment, and Controversy, </em>42 Me. L.Rev. 283, 345 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\"><em>Paramore v. Filion, </em>293 F.Supp.2d 285, 292 (S.D.N.Y.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">While the additional information from Dr. Lau\u2019s notes could have been used to demonstrate that DH did suffer from some confusion, that fact was already obvious from her testimony at trial. In <em>United States v. Santos, </em>59 M.J. 317, 322 (C.A.A.F.2004), we found that withheld evidence might have been used to impeach an important Government witness, but concluded that the error in withholding it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was \u201clargely cumulative of other information available to Appellant\u201d at trial, was vague, and concerned a collateral issue. Conversely, in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>59 M.J. 330, 335-36 (C.A.A.F.2004), we found that erroneously withheld evidence was \u201ccritical on a pivotal issue on the ease\u201d and that because it was so significant the error in withholding it was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">As found by the Army court, DH\u2019s \u201ctestimony was reasonably direct, with a minimum of leading. She was mainly clear and forthcoming, and largely consistent with her signed statement of 10 August 2000 to the CID, made on the morning she reported the abuse.\u201d At trial the defense was able to explore the major inconsistency in DH\u2019s testimony as to whether Cano had penetrated her with his penis or simply touched her. The defense was able to show that DH was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>confused concerning the timing and location of various encounters as well as raise the possibility that DH was lying through the testimony of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Unlike the evidence in <em>Jackson, </em>the notes in question here would not have been \u201ccritical on a pivotal issue in the case\u201d because the defense already had the opportunity to attack DH\u2019s credibility and the notes would not have provided any new ammunition with which to do so. 59 M.J. at 335-36. We find that any inconsistencies revealed in the withheld evidence in this case are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because they are cumulative of other evidence available at trial, easily explained based on DH\u2019s age and maturity, and are not significant in relation to DH\u2019s overall testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Suggestive Therapy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We next turn to Cano\u2019s argument that the withheld evidence could have been used to demonstrate that DH\u2019s testimony was the result of coaching by Dr. Lau in their counseling sessions. The record reveals that DH\u2019s testimony concerning several of the more serious allegations of abuse at trial was consistent with the statement she gave to CID investigators immediately following the August 9 incident. That statement was made well before DH had met Dr. Lau or started her therapy. In the August statement she said that Cano had touched her \u201cchest\u201d and \u201cprivate area\u201d with his hand, and that he had her put her hands around \u201cthe part he goes to the bathroom with and ... shake it.\u201d She also said he would \u201chave me put it in my mouth sometimes.\u201d At trial, she testified that Cano: touched her chest; put his finger in her vagina; put his \u201cfront bathroom part\u201d in her mouth; and put his \u201cfront bathroom part\u201d inside her; and that she had to rub Vaseline on his \u201cfront bathroom part\u201d so \u201cit can be wet and moisty.\u201d While DH\u2019s trial testimony was more detailed than the earlier statement, the main allegations in the earlier statement were largely consistent with her testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">We disagree with Cano\u2019s assertion that the withheld evidence showed Dr. Lau to be \u201cmore of a zealot who was prone to overreaching in interviewing an alleged child sex abuse victim than she was a therapist whose goal it was to simply treat a child sex abuse victim.\u201d It has been noted in the context of rape counseling that the role of a therapist is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">not [to] probe inconsistencies in their clients\u2019 description of the facts of the incident [or to] conduct independent investigations to determine whether other evidence corroborates or contradicts their clients\u2019 renditions. Because their function is to help their clients deal with the trauma they are experiencing, the historical accuracy of the clients\u2019 descriptions of the details of the traumatizing events is not vital in their task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\"><em>People v. Bledsoe, </em>36 Cal.3d 236, 203 Cal. Rptr. 450, 681 P.2d 291, 300 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">There is a good deal of scholarly debate in the area of child suggestibility and its effect on the reliability of the testimony of a child victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, scholars agree that the danger of false testimony from a child is greater when the child is subjected to highly suggestive interviewing techniques such as \u201cclosed\u201d (yes/no) questions and \u201cmultiple interviews with multiple interviewers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">Dr. Lau was the sole therapist who treated DH during this period and her notes make it clear that she was acting in accordance with her role as a counselor. She does indicate that DH required \u201cprompting\u201d in telling her story. However, the notes surrounding this statement reflect that the prompting came in the form of open-ended questions because the quoted responses by DH are in the form of factual descriptions of events rather than yes/no answers. Dr. Lau\u2019s therapy questions are consistent with her role in counseling DH, a victim of trauma, and do not establish that Dr. Lau was a \u201czealot\u201d or that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>coaching DH. Because we find that the notes do not provide evidence of suggestive questioning or coaching, we conclude that withholding the material was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">.
