The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for four years and 134 days, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El. The convening authority ordered 134 days of confinement credit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our decision dated 29 June 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>we discussed seven issues and affirmed the findings of guilty. We otherwise affirmed the sentence, but reduced \u201cappellant\u2019s confinement by thirty days to moot appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice resulting from the staff judge advocate\u2019s (SJA\u2019s) misstatement of the maximum possible sentence in his post-trial recommendation (SJAR) to the convening authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>60 M.J. 512, 514 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2004). Today we reaffirm our previous decision. However, we now order that appellant receive thirty days of pay and allowances because the government failed to comply with our previous order requiring release of appellant from confinement. <em>See id. </em>at 514, 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">On 12 July 2004, appellant received a copy of this court\u2019s original decision. On 19 July 2004, appellant filed a petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for grant of review. On 14 September 2004, appellant completed his sentence to confinement and was released from confinement. On 8 October 2004, appellate defense counsel requested that the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces remand this case to our court for an appropriate remedy because the confinement facility failed to reduce appellant\u2019s confinement by thirty days as ordered in our 29 June 2004 decision. On 10 January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces granted review of the following modified issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">WHETHER APPELLANT WAS SUBJECT TO ILLEGAL POST-TRIAL CONFINEMENT IF, IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE DECISION OF THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS, HE WAS NOT CREDITED WITH THIRTY DAYS OF CONFINEMENT CREDIT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9M\"><em>United States v. Hammond, </em>60 M.J. 457 (C.A.A.F.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed the findings of guilty, reversed the sentence, and remanded appellant\u2019s ease to this court \u201cfor consideration of the granted issue,\u201d and \u201cto determine whether relief is warranted as to sentence, and if so, what relief should be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The case is again before this court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Appellate counsel agree that appellant remained in confinement longer than he should have because he did not receive the thirty-day reduction in his sentence to confinement previously ordered by this court. Post-trial affidavits established that a copy of our decision was served upon appellant; however, the leadership at the confinement facility did not receive a copy of our court\u2019s decision in a timely fashion. Remedial action in the processing of appellate decisions at the confinement facility has been taken so that this mistake will not recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">We agree with appellate counsel that appellant was subjected to illegal post-trial confinement. Appellate counsel, however, do not agree on an appropriate remedy. Appellate defense counsel urge this court to set aside appellant\u2019s dishonorable discharge, or, in the alternative, to upgrade it to a bad-conduct discharge. Appellate government counsel ask us to disapprove two months of appellant\u2019s already-served confinement, \u201cwhich would allow appellant to collect financial remuneration from other [forums] pursuant to Article 75, UCMJ.\u201d We are reluctant to change the character of appellant\u2019s discharge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a dishonorable to a bad-conduct discharge because the facts and circumstances of the offenses clearly warrant a dishonorable discharge. However, \u201c[w]hen an appellant is held in confinement past what should have been his release date, this court may fashion an appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>United States v. Nicholas, </em>53 M.J. 656, 658 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Keith, </em>36 M.J. 518, 519 (A.C.M.R.1992)); <em>see also United States v. Phelps, </em>40 M.J. 550 (A.C.M.R.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Appellate government counsel support a grant of meaningful relief for appellant. They assert that reducing appellant\u2019s sentence to confinement by two months will allow appellant to financially benefit from a restoration of pay under Article 75(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(a). Appellate government counsel explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\">While there are no provisions discussing how to calculate the appropriate amount of financial compensation for a period of confinement which has been set aside, there is no reason to believe that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) would not respect the decision of this Court in determining an appropriate remedy in accordance with Article 75, UCMJ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and paragraph 480901 of the [Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR) ].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Brief for Appellee 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Four factors suggest that DFAS may be unable to provide the relief contained in the government\u2019s proposed remedy, i.e., \u201cfinancial remuneration\u201d resulting from a reduction in appellant\u2019s already-served period of confinement. First, appellant was past his expiration of term of service date<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prior to trial. Appellant was placed into pretrial confinement on 12 April 2001. On 3 June 2001, while appellant was in pretrial confinement, his term of service expired. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service stopped appellant\u2019s pay and allowances on his ETS date. A servieemember is not entitled to receive pay and allowances while in confinement and past his or her ETS date, unless he or she is returned to duty status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellate counsel \u201cagree that, under the applicable finance regulation, DFAS had no duty to pay appellant after his ETS date.\u201d <em>Hammond, </em>60 M.J. at 514. Furthermore, the record lacks any indication that appellant was returned to duty status after his trial. Therefore, adjudged and automatic forfeitures would not have been collected after their execution because after appellant\u2019s ETS date he was not due any pay and allowances against which the forfeitures could operate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We doubt appellant would be entitled to a return of forfeitures not collected after his ETS date.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">Second, appellant\u2019s adjudged forfeiture of all pay and allowances began fourteen days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>after appellant was sentenced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Third, even if we disapprove a portion of the adjudged forfeitures, appellant would still be subject to the automatic or mandatory forfeiture of all pay and allowances during his confinement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On 8 August 2001, appellant was tried and sentenced at court-martial, and thereafter, placed into post-trial confinement. Fourth, after appellant was released from confinement he went on excess leave<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and was not entitled to pay and allowances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Appellate government counsel address the issue of appellant being held past his ETS date for court-martial, without an entitlement to receive pay and allowances, by asserting that appellant may be paid because he was held past his ETS date on active duty \u201cfor the convenience of the government.\u201d Appellate government counsel reason: confinement related to his court-martial and that this situation does not appear to have been contemplated by the DoDFMR, his additional period of confinement would likely be considered as being for the convenience of the Government, in addition to constituting relief under Article 75, UCMJ.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">Given the fact that there was no lawful purpose to hold appellant in [post-trial]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">Brief for Appellee at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">We find that a R.C.M. 305(k) punishment equivalency provides the best mechanism for granting appropriate relief for the excess confinement that appellant served. Although R.C.M. 305 enumerates procedures for imposing pretrial confinement upon service-members, and for reviewing the necessity of continued confinement until trial, it provides a mechanism for selecting a remedy for unlawful pretrial confinement. Rule for Courts-Martial 305(k) provides, \u201c1 day of confinement [credit] shall be equal to 1 day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>of total forfeiture<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or a like amount of fine. The credit shall not be applied against any other form of punishment.\u201d We agree with the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 use of R.C.M. 305(k) punishment equivalencies in fashioning appropriate remedies for excess confinement served. <em>See United States v. Sherman, </em>56 M.J. 900, 902 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Gazurian, </em>46 M.J. 299 (C.A.A.F.1997) (summary disposition)). We choose to order a monetary credit of thirty days of pay and allowances at the grade of E4 to compensate appellant for thirty days of illegal post-trial confinement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The decision of this court in this case dated 29 June 2004 is reaffirmed and remains in effect. We order that appellant receive thirty days of pay and' allowances at the grade of E4 to compensate appellant for thirty days of illegal post-trial confinement. <em>See Sherman, </em>56 M.J. at 903 (affirming sentence and ordering five days of pay to compensate service-member for five days of illegal confinement served despite servicemember\u2019s excess leave or no-pay-due status).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Senior Judge HARVEY <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Judge BARTO concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-11\">. Appellant also received \"good time\u201d credit based upon the Department of Defense policy that a prisoner who receives a court-martial sentence to confinement of at least three years, but less than five years, will be credited with seven days of confinement credit for each month of good conduct during the sentence. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Def.

Under that statute, automatic or mandatory forfeitures are triggered by the specific types of sentences set forth in Article 58b(a)(2); they are: \u201c(A) confinement for more than six months or death; or (B) confinement for six <em>months or less </em>and a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or dismissal.\u201d If the sentence is subsequently modified by the convening authority or upon appellate review so that it no longer provides for a qualifying punishment, then any amounts taken as automatic forfeitures will be returned to the servicemember under the repayment provision in Article 58b(c).

Therefore, through the enactment of Article 58b(c), Congress provided us with the power to provide forfeiture relief.
