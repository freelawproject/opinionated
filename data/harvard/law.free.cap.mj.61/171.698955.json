The convening authority approved the sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, three months of confinement, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. We granted review of the following issues on November 18, 2004:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-27\">I. WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS IMPROPERLY CONDUCTED ITS APPELLATE REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 66(c), UCMJ, BY CON<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>SIDERING EVIDENCE OUTSIDE THE RECORD IN VIOLATION OF <em>UNITED STATES v. HOLT, </em>58 M.J. 227 (C.A.A.F.2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">II. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION BY PERMITTING THE TRIAL COUNSEL TO ELICIT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE APPELLANT\u2019S PRE-SERVICE DRUG USE FROM THE APPELLANT\u2019S MOTHER TO \u201cREBUT\u201d MATTERS TO WHICH THE MILITARY JUDGE HIMSELF \u201cOPENED THE DOOR.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. If there was error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">During sentencing, the prosecutor offered evidence from Appellant\u2019s personnel record reflecting three disciplinary infractions during his seventeen months of military service: (1) consumption of alcoholic beverages while under the age of twenty-one on August 18, 2002; (2) failure to obtain a medical evaluation on July 8, 2002; and (3) failure to report to duty on August 7, 2002. The prosecutor also offered a detailed confession to the use of cocaine that occurred between August 14 and August 22, 2002, and called the interrogator, who discussed the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In addition to his unsworn statement, Appellant offered several documents from family friends, coworkers, and supervisors attesting to his rehabilitative potential. His mother also testified as to Appellant\u2019s interests and upbringing. When asked by defense counsel about rehabilitative potential, she replied that her son was not a malicious person and that his cocaine use was an \u201cerror in judgment\u201d from which he could learn. \u201c[H]e has a lot of integrity ... and he is honest____ But ... he\u2019s 19, and teenagers make \u2014 have some poor judgments [sic] in things because they feel that they \u2014 they have their whole life, that they are really invincible and that it won\u2019t really matter this time.\u201d She also recognized that her son had made mistakes. Defense counsel inquired further, \u201cBut with your son, does he learn from his mistakes?\u201d She responded, \u201c[H]e always has learned from his mistakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">At the conclusion of her direct examination, there was no cross-examination by the prosecutor. However, the military judge began the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">Q: [Y]ou had no concerns about the people he was hanging around with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">A: Not normally, no. Every once in a while, you know, somebody would do something stupid, and I would say, you know, guys, get it together, because I\u2019ll call you on it. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">Q: Right. I\u2019m trying to figure out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-16\">A: He didn\u2019t hang out with the jocks, and he didn\u2019t hang out with the computer geeks. He\u2019s always been somewhat of a loner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-17\">Q: Okay. Because at least from the evidence I\u2019ve got so far, it appears the folks that he was hanging out here with ... weren\u2019t doing him any favors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-18\">A: No. And that was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-19\">Q: And that\u2019s one concern I have if [he] comes back to you. I mean, did he have a history of kind of hanging out with those folks, or maybe it was just because he was here in San Antonio and didn\u2019t really know anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-20\">A: I have a feeling that was probably the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-21\">Q: And did you have any concerns from his prior history of any sort of substance problems as far as alcohol beyond I guess what you would normally expect of high school kids?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-22\">A: Nothing beyond what normal high school kids get involved with, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">Upon completion of the military judge\u2019s questioning, the trial counsel posed the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-24\">Q: Do you know if your son ever used marijuana while he was in high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-25\">A: He probably\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>DC [Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. This is going into uncharged misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">MJ [Military Judge]: Well, the problem is you\u2019ve got the judge asking questions and I \u2014 you know, I was mostly thinking about alcohol as much as anything else. I didn\u2019t realize I was wandering into uncharged misconduct territory. Probably that would have been the better place for you to object there when I said, you know \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">I tell you what, I\u2019m going to overrule the objection, <em>but only to the extent </em>\u2014 and <em>you can rest assured, I\u2019m not going to consider it for any uncharged misconduct purposes. </em>But to the extent it would only weigh to rebut the question I asked. Okay. So I asked \u2014 I asked the question about did you have any \u2014 have any reason to suspect the history of any sort of substance abuse. And, you know, there wasn\u2019t any objection to that. I certainly had no reason to know what the answer was going to be____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">[M]y suspicion is the witness is going to say no, because that\u2019s what she told me, but I\u2019ll go ahead and allow you to ask the question. But, <em>it\u2019s a bench trial, </em>you don\u2019t have to worry about non 403-type [sic] uses. I\u2019m only going to <em>use </em>\u2014 if <em>I consider it </em>at all, and it will depend on the answer, it will be for <em>a very limited purpose which I\u2019ll put on the record.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">[Trial Counsel (TC)]: Ma\u2019am, again, do you know or are you aware that your son ever used marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">A: I believe he tried it at some point because he\u2019s a normal high school kid. You know, but as far as continual use or\u2014 no. No. Would he have at a party? Let me just put it this way: At every single high school party that I have known of in the last 20, 30 years, it has been there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">On redirect examination, defense counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">Q: Just one clarification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">Q: You just said you\u2019ve been to parties, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-17\">Q: Is this any time soon or is this back when you were in high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-18\">A: Oh. High school, college. Yeah, there is \u2014 not recently. Actually, I don\u2019t go to too many parties anymore. But it is \u2014 it is part of the culture. It\u2019s there. Whether or not your intention is to use when you go to a party, there is always the possibility that it is there, you know. And I\u2019d be silly to say, no, it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-19\">DC: Nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-20\">MJ: Just so the record is clear, my ruling is that the defense objection is overruled. I opened the door with my question. <em>But what I\u2019m taking it as that you\u2019re telling me is that it was experimentation at a party-type environment in high school and that\u2019s it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-21\">[Witness]: I would assume. I would assume, based on where we are today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-22\">MJ: That\u2019s fine. And, <em>clearly, I\u2019m not going to impose any other punishment for an experimental use in high school. But I will consider it in the context of everything else.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-24\">After announcing his sentence, the military judge noted that Appellant was an \u201cideal\u201d candidate for the Air Force Return-to-Duty Program, a rehabilitation program that allows convicted airmen to return to duty upon successful completion of its rigorous requirements. He recommended that the convening authority approve such a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">The lower court opined that once the door was opened during discussion of rehabilitative potential, the prosecutor\u2019s solicitation of the information was proper. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s question properly clarified the foundational basis for Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s opinion testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-26\">On appeal, the defense did not contest the accuracy of Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s statement or the propriety of the military judge\u2019s question to his mother about \u201cany substance abuse problems as far as alcohol.\u201d The Court of Criminal Appeals stated that, assuming the military judge did not open the door with that question, \u201cother aspects of [Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony] <em>brought out by the defense </em>did make the Appellant\u2019s pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>service marijuana use proper rebuttal.\u201d <em>United States v. Gorence, </em>No. ACM S30296, 2004 CCA LEXIS 132, at *8, 2004 WL 1239172, at *3 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. May 18, 2004). When the defense counsel asked Appellant\u2019s mother whether \u201cappellant learned from his mistakes and whether he had rehabilitative potential,\u201d this \u201copened the door to other information challenging the foundation of her opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is \u201cnot significant\u201d that this questioning was conducted by the trial counsel after the judge\u2019s questioning. <em>Id. </em>at *9, 2004 WL 1239172, at *3. The court noted that in the trial by judge alone, the military judge is presumed to have based his sentence upon admissible evidence. \u201cThe military judge made it clear he would not increase the punishment he imposed based upon\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at *9-10, 2004 WL 1239172, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">As to Issue I, we hold that <em>Holt </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Holt, </em>the military judge had admitted into evidence certain sentencing exhibits and clearly ruled that the jury could not consider them for the truth of the matter asserted in the exhibits. 58 M.J. at 232. But, the Court of Criminal Appeals considered these exhibits as substantive evidence. In remanding <em>Holt, </em>the Court held that a court of criminal appeals \u201cmay not resurrect excluded evidence during appellate review under Article 66(c).\u201d 58 M.J. at 232-33. In <em>Holt, </em>the Air Force court\u2019s consideration of the exhibits as substantive evidence impermissibly changed the evidentiary nature of the exhibits. <em>Id. </em>That is not what happened here. In this case, the Air Force court did not resurrect any excluded evidence; rather, it found an alternative foundational basis for the rebuttal evidence considered by the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">As to Issue II, we hold that, if there was error, it was harmless. This was a trial by a military judge alone in which Appellant\u2019s mother testified that her son had \u201ca lot of integrity\u201d but had \u201clearned from his mistakes.\u201d Following this testimony, the military judge asked questions concerning Appellant\u2019s future life, his dreams, and what would happen if he left the Air Force. After the colloquy between the military judge and Appellant\u2019s mother, the trial counsel asked the questions that were the subject of the defense counsel\u2019s objection. While overruling the defense counsel\u2019s objection, the military judge responded, \u201c[Cjlearly, I\u2019m not going to impose any other punishment for experimental use in high school, but I will consider it in the context of everything else.\u201d Admittedly, this was not a clear statement as to how the military judge would use this evidence. In any event, any error was harmless because this was a trial by military judge alone, and from the statements made by the judge on the record, we may infer that he did not give significant weight to Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s speculative testimony that Appellant used drugs in high school. For example, the military judge stated, \u201cit was experimentation in a party-type environment in high school and that\u2019s it____ I am not going to impose any other punishment for experimental use in high school.\u201d Additionally, Appellant gave a detailed confession as to his use of cocaine, and the military judge recommended that Appellant be returned to duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Based on all of these facts, we affirm the decision of the United States Air Force 00014; of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b306-11\">ERDMANN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Asj\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">I agree that any error made by the military judge in admitting Gorence\u2019s mother\u2019s speculative testimony about her son\u2019s pre-service drug use was harmless. As to Issue I, in light of the lack of clarity in the military judge\u2019s ruling, I cannot be certain how he considered the mother\u2019s testimony, if at all. Consequently I cannot join in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cfound an alternative foundational basis for the rebuttal evidence considered by the military judge.\u201d 61 M.J. at 174. However, in light of the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeals found no prejudice \u201ceven if we were to assume there was error,\u201d I would affirm the decision below on that basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
