Despite his pleas of not guilty, he was convicted of three specifications of assault consummated by a battery in violation of Article 128, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 928. The members sentenced Appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for six months, forfeitures of $737 pay per month for six months, and reduction to E-l. The Convening Authority approved the sentence as adjudged. Before this Court, Appellant has assigned three errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-30\">In his first assignment, Appellant contends that the evidence was not factually sufficient to sustain a charge of assault consummated by a battery. We disagree. Applying the standard from <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987), the evidence of record convinces us of Appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We also reject Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error in which he contends that the military judge erred in failing to instruct the members <em>sua sponte </em>to disregard certain portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of trial counsel\u2019s closing argument which Appellant contends were improper and included an erroneous statement of the law. During cross-examination of Appellant, trial counsel tried to question him as to why the victims would fabricate their account of Appellant\u2019s cutting them with his knife. The military judge sustained an objection by Appellant and instructed the members that they could not consider the answers for any purpose whatsoever. Later in trial counsel\u2019s closing argument, he revisited the subject by contending that the victims had no reason to fabricate their testimony, that they had already received administrative determinations of alcohol incidents and that there was no other trouble the victims could get into. Appellant did not object to this argument; therefore, the issue whether the military judge should have instructed the members to disregard the statements made by trial counsel is waived, unless there is plain error. We do not find plain error in these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In his third assignment, Appellant contends that the trial counsel made additional improper argument on sentencing to the effect that Appellant had not sincerely accepted responsibility for his acts and that \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t accept responsibility, you need to be punished.\u201d R. at 464. Appellant did not object to the prosecution\u2019s sentencing argument at trial, but asks this Court now to find that it was error for the judge not to instruct the members at the conclusion of trial counsel\u2019s argument that failure of Appellant to admit guilt, or to take responsibility, or show remorse, if perceived, cannot be considered in aggravation. Appellant also submits that there was no proper foundation for trial counsel\u2019s argument that Appellant\u2019s refusing to admit his guilt was a factor bearing on rehabilitative potential that the members could consider in sentencing. Moreover, Ap-' pellant contends that trial counsel went beyond that argument and improperly couched the asserted lack of genuine remorse as a matter in aggravation rather than something to be considered with respect to rehabilitative potential. Even if trial counsel\u2019s argument was error the statement must amount to plain error, since failing to object constitutes waiver, absent plain error. We will address this third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">As indicated earlier, Appellant pled not guilty. He took the stand in his own defense and testified that he did not cut two individuals, as alleged, and did not assault a third person. He was convicted nevertheless. At sentencing, he made the following unsworn statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Commander Mozee, Members of the Panel, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Maye, and everybody else here, I would like to start out by apologizing for the part I played in bringing you all here today. I\u2019m sure you would all rather be somewhere else right now. I know I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">First, I would like to say that I understand that everything that has been said and done in this courtroom for the past couple of days has been done in the application of everyone\u2019s duties, and I respect that. It isn\u2019t my place to question the judgment of the Court. It is now my duty to serve my sentence with honor in the best way I know how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">I freely acknowledge that what has happened is that I am responsible for what has happened, and I accept that. I can only beg and pray that the Court will understand that I never wanted to hurt anyone. Excuse me. Sorry. I\u2019m all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">I wanted to share something about myself that I had to keep hidden for fear, for fear of something like this happening. In the past, I\u2019ve cut myself for many reasons, primarily as a physical expression of pain that I feel inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">I chose to share that expression with those two young men because I thought they would understand. I thought that I had found kindred spirits, and, then, perhaps, with them, the pain would recede for a time and give me some rest. I was wrong, and I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">If I could undo what has been done, I would, but I can\u2019t. I can only say that what happened was a stupid mistake, and it never should have happened. I have done a great deal of reflecting over the past four months. I\u2019ve realized that what happened \u2014 my actions have wronged many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>people, not just the victims, but also my Command for the imposition that this Court Martial has caused; my Chief, who I\u2019ve always admired and respected, for not being there when I was needed; to my mother, for causing her to see her son go to a Court Martial, and everyone here for having to participate in this proceedings. As I said, I cannot change what has already happened. I can only learn from my mistakes, learn from the experience, and try not to make the same mistakes in the future. I will try to be a better man, and I pray that I never hurt anyone like this ever again, not just for myself, but for everyone in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">I can honestly say that the Coast Guard changed my life. I will never regret my enlistment, and it saddens me deeply that I will see my tour come to a premature end. I\u2019ve had some rough times during my service, but in no way do I blame the Coast Guard for these problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">Finally, I can only say that I am sorry for the trouble I\u2019ve cause[d] to the victims and to everyone else involved. Thank you for hearing me out. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">R. at 454-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Thereafter, trial counsel made the following argument with regard to an appropriate sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">TRIAL COUNSEL: Members, your job here today, unlike yesterday, is to decide what [is] the appropriate punishment for Petty Officer Weddle\u2019s assault on Sims, Clark, and Haider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">Now, the Military Judge is going to instruct you on the principles upon which sentencing is based. One of those principles is the rehabilitation of the Accused. And the Defense is probably going to tell you that Petty Officer Weddle is sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">He\u2019s sorry. He realizes he was wrong now, and he doesn\u2019t need any more punishment to be rehabilitated. But, remember this, today, he made an unsworn statement. And, in that statement, while he expressed remorse, he said he was sorry for the \u201cPart I played.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">He said he was sorry that we had to be here. He said he accepted responsibility in some general sense, but he never said, \u201cI stabbed Seaman Clark and Seaman Sims, and I held a knife to the throat of Petty Officer Haider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">He\u2019s sorry? He\u2019s sorry he got convicted. Those were not tears of genuine remorse. Those were the tears of someone who is afraid of what you\u2019re about to do to him. He stabbed two of his shipmates, and he held the knife to the throat of the third. You can never trust him again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">He can\u2019t stay in the Coast Guard. He can\u2019t. He needs to be separated with a bad conduct discharge. Why? Because bad conduct deserves a bad conduct discharge and that\u2019s pretty bad conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">When you look at Defense Exhibit Delta, when you look on the first page, you\u2019ll see he didn\u2019t even admit to his doctor that he had done anything wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">You\u2019ll see that he told his doctor he cut himself and made a sharp knife available for other Coast Guard Members to cut themselves. He\u2019s not being honest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">He wasn\u2019t honest with you yesterday. Yesterday, he sat right here and told you, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">Where was the remorse? Where\u2019s the acceptance of responsibility? Oh, you didn\u2019t believe me? I guess I really did do it. Yeah. I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. But he\u2019s still not saying he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">There\u2019s no remorse. There\u2019s no genuine remorse. Then look at the character of his prior service. When you look [at] Prosecution Exhibit 4, you\u2019ll see four page sevens as you\u2019ve already seen, I should say, four page sevens, all negative, two for alcohol incidents; then the final page refers to another assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-19\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I\u2019m sorry, sir. It\u2019s an alleged assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-20\">TRIAL COUNSEL: It\u2019s an alleged assault where Petty Officer Weddle also claims he blacked out and can\u2019t remember doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-21\">Where is the acceptance of responsibility? If you don\u2019t accept responsibility, you can\u2019t be given another chance. If you don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>accept responsibility, you need to be punished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">There was lots of testimony today about Petty Officer Weddle and Petty Officer Weddle\u2019s upbringing. What about Seaman Clark and Seaman Sims and BM3 Haider? Nobody mentioned them today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">They\u2019re the victims. His scars are self-inflicted that he\u2019s been carrying around. Sims and Clark now have a lifelong reminder of the night Petty Officer Weddle sliced them up. And, yet, when Petty Officer Weddle gave his unsworn statement, he apologized to everyone here, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not his job to question the judgment of the Court,\u201d but he didn\u2019t say he thought you were right. He\u2019s still not admitting guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">Then, at the very end, almost as an afterthought, he put in, \u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m sorry for the victims, too.\u201d They should have been the first people who he apologized to. And he told you he\u2019s sorry that y\u2019all had to come here because he would rather be somewhere else; of course, he would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Think of Seaman Sims, Seaman Clark, and Petty Officer Haider. They certainly wanted to be somewhere else today, and they were here because of his actions in which he showed no remorse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">He needs to be separated from the Coast Guard with [a] bad conduct discharge. He needs some further confinement on top of the 118 days he\u2019s already served. The maximum you can adjudge is a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">The Government is not even going to ask for the maximum. Give him nine months\u2019 confinement. The Judge will tell you he\u2019ll get credit for what he\u2019s already served. Give him nine months\u2019 confinement; separate him with a bad conduct discharge. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">R. at 461-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Was It Error For Trial Counsel To Argue Lack Of Remorse At Sentencing?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">Appellant raised no objection to the foregoing argument at trial, but, citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>1 M.J. 213, 215 (C.M.A.1975), now contends before this Court that trial counsel\u2019s argument crossed the bounds of fair comment. Appellant notes from <em>Johnson </em>that, while a guilty plea is a positive first step towards rehabilitation, properly considered in mitigation at sentencing, a not-guilty plea, standing alone, does not conversely carry with it a negative implication capable of aggravating a sentence. <em>Johnson, </em>1 M.J. at 215. Appellant acknowledges, however, that our higher Court recognized that where a proper foundation is laid, an accused\u2019s refusal to admit guilt after findings may be considered at sentencing as bearing on rehabilitation potential. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>35 M.J. 351, 355 (C.M.A.1992). In <em>Edwards, </em>the Court went on to say, \u201cAs a general rule, the predicate foundation is that an accused has either testified or has made an unsworn statement and has either expressed no remorse or his expressions of remorse can be arguably construed as being shallow, artificial, or contrived.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>35 M.J. at 355 (citing <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>30 M.J. 1138 (A.F.C.M.R.), <em>pet. denied, </em>32 M.J. 247 (1990); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>29 M.J. 1002 (A.F.C.M.R.1990)). Appellant submits that this foundation requirement for trial counsel\u2019s argument was not satisfied, that Appellant expressed remorse in an expansive sincere manner, which included crying during his unsworn statement. Appellant asserts that, without evidence in the record to the contrary, his apologies and acceptance of responsibility cannot be construed as other than genuine. Moreover, according to Appellant, the trial counsel compounded his argument error by shifting the focus from lack of rehabilitation potential to one of aggravation based on trial counsel\u2019s contention that Appellant had not expressed responsibility specifically for stabbing and assaulting his shipmates, and then argued, \u201cIf you don\u2019t accept responsibility you need to be punished.\u201d R. at 464. Appellant asserts that this statement changed the whole thrust of trial counsel\u2019s argument to one of treating failure to acknowledge responsibility as a matter in aggravation rather than something bearing on rehabilitation potential. The latter is permitted with the proper foundation; the former is not. If Appellant is correct that a proper foundation for arguing lack of rehabilitative potential was not established and that, even with a foundation, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>argument in aggravation was not proper, then trial counsel committed error. Accordingly, Appellant contends that the military judge should have given a curative instruction to the members and without such an instruction a rehearing on sentence is needed. Again, however, where Appellant made no objection and did not request such a curative instruction, we are inclined to look for plain error as a basis for providing the relief requested at this level, rather than simple error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Was It Plain Error For The Military Judge Not To Instruct The Members To Disregard Certain Portions Of Trial Counsel\u2019s Argument On Sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In assessing whether plain error was committed, it is worthwhile to review anew whatever instruction in this area may be found in <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>35 M.J. 351 (C.M.A.1992). While the Court in that case was not disposed to issue \u201cany black letter edict regarding the limitations of trial counsel\u2019s comments,\u201d 35 M.J. at 354, it did express \u201csome guiding, fundamental principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355. For example, as already indicated, \u201ca sentencing argument by trial counsel which comments upon an accused\u2019s exercise of his or her constitutionally protected rights is \u2018beyond the bounds of fair comment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355 (citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>1 M.J. 213, 215 (C.M.A.1975)). \u201cThere may be other evidence in the record which gives rise to the inference that an accused is not remorseful. However, the inference may not be drawn from his failure to testify or from his pleas of not guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355. While Appellant pled not guilty, he did not remain silent, testifying, instead, on the merits. Trial counsel did not comment negatively on Appellant\u2019s plea of not guilty, but he did have things to say about Appellant\u2019s trial testimony and a pretrial statement to his doctor. Trial counsel told the court members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">When you look at Defense Exhibit Delta, when you look on the first page, you\u2019ll see he didn\u2019t even admit to his doctor that he had done anything wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">You\u2019ll see that he told his doctor he cut himself and made a sharp knife available for other Coast Guard Members to cut themselves. He\u2019s not being honest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">He wasn\u2019t honest with you yesterday. Yesterday, he sat right here and told you, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">Where was the remorse? Where\u2019s the acceptance of responsibility? Oh, you didn\u2019t believe me? I guess I really did do it. Yeah. I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. But he\u2019s still not saying he did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">R. at 463. In <em>Edwards, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aop-dedup-0\">an accused\u2019s mendacity may be considered by a sentencing authority in arriving at a just sentence. <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978) (sentencing judge could properly consider a defendant\u2019s false testimony, as observed by the judge at trial, when considering an accused\u2019s rehabilitative potential and fixing sentence). However, consideration of an accused\u2019s false testimony is limited to the determination of rehabilitative potential. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>13 M.J. at 285, citing <em>Grayson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\"><em>Edwards, </em>35 M.J. at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">As can be seen, once a trial counsel chooses to mine this area for argument, it is fraught with potentially dangerous consequences. In this regard, the quote in <em>Edwards </em>from Senior Judge Kastl of the United States Air Force Court of Military Review bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">[W]e caution trial counsel ... [as to] how difficult this area of the law can be. There are still issues to be resolved in this are-na____With precedents far from settled, only the bravest of advocacy acrobats ought to tempt fate. (They do so at their own peril, for we guarantee no safety net against reversal).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">35 M.J. at 354. Notwithstanding this advice, the Court in <em>Edwards </em>did not issue any black letter edict regarding the limitations of trial counsel\u2019s comments, in part because an accused has an advocate with a duty \u201cto ferret out improper argument, object thereto, and seek corrective action in the nature of instructions or a mistrial if the argument is so outlandish that it is incapable of being cured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354. By not objecting at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the defense counsel obviously did not find trial counsel\u2019s argument such that a curative instruction was needed, much less a mistrial, possibly because the above quoted portion arguably can be seen as constituting permitted comment on Appellant\u2019s mendacity, just as the Court in <em>Edwards </em>found with respect to the following: \u201c[t]he accused showed his true colors and mettle when he got on the stand yesterday and told you the story he told you. It\u2019s apparent that he\u2019s not ready to accept responsibility or accountability for his actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. That argument was deemed \u201cnot a comment on appellant\u2019s failure to testify in the sentencing procedure, on his pleas of not guilty, or on his subsequent testimony denying guilt on the merits. Rather, it was an observation of appellant\u2019s demeanor or mendacious trial testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. In so finding, the Court was unable to conclude that plain error was committed. We, too, find trial counsel\u2019s similar argument in the instant case did not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Trial counsel\u2019s argument that followed presents more of a problem, however: \u2018Where is the acceptance of responsibility? If you don\u2019t accept responsibility, you can\u2019t be given another chance. <em>If you don\u2019t accept responsibility you need to be punished.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) R. at 464. This argument is not necessarily a statement that one should be punished for the act of failing to accept responsibility. It can be considered a statement that the crime in the first instance deserves punishment and if you don\u2019t accept responsibility you forfeit the consideration of rehabilitative potential. That said, however, trial counsel\u2019s contention may have gone beyond an argument concerning rehabilitative potential to which it should have been limited. All of this could have been cleared up at trial if defense counsel had objected and asked for clarifying action by the military judge. Obviously it did not strike trial defense counsel as egregious enough to warrant objection, and, absent any objection by Appellant, it certainly is not serious enough to constitute plain error. Accordingly, we reject the third assigned error. Additionally, with respect to that assignment, as well as the other errors assigned in this case, we see no reason to disregard the plain error threshold and apply our plenary authority, as articulated in <em>United States v. Claxton, </em>32 M.J. 159, 162 (C.M.A.1991), in order to do justice. In so acting, however, we caution trial counsel to exercise great care when alluding to an accused\u2019s failure to accept responsibility and take to heart the words of former Senior Judge Kastl of the Air Force, bearing in mind the duty to protect the record. Also, trial defense counsel must be ever alert to prosecution argument that can be construed as objectionable and take appropriate action at the trial level. Otherwise, any error committed may be deemed waived. Finally, we would be remiss if we faded to mention that the military judge can eliminate issues such as this one by <em>sua sponte </em>giving clarifying instructions. Even when such an instruction is not legally required, an alert judge can have a positive effect by ensuring that the members do not get the wrong idea, and at the same time ensuring a clean record.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We have reviewed the record in accordance with Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866. Upon such review, the findings of guilty and sentence are deemed to be correct in law and fact and should be approved. Accordingly, the findings and sentence as approved below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Judge KANTOR and Judge McClelland concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
