Terzian (hereinafter \u201cplaintiff\u201d), the insured under an automobile policy issued by defendant insurance carrier, brought this action under the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. He appeals from a judgment for defendant entered after nonjury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s policy included uninsured motorist coverage as required, and with the provisions required, by Insurance Code section 11580.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The coverage obligated defendant to pay him, subject to a policy limit of $ 10,000, all sums which he was \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury . . . caused by accident and arising out of the . . . use of such uninsured automobile; . . .\u201d (See \u00a7 11580.2, subd (a).) An arbitration clause <em>(ibid., </em>subd. (d)) provided that if the parties disagreed concerning plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to recover such damages or upon the amount due him under the coverage, \u201cthen, upon written demand of either,\u201d the matters in disagreement \u201cshall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ...\u201d Other provisions following the statute\u2019s language subrogated defendant to plaintiff\u2019s rights against third partie<em>s</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>(ibid., </em>subd. (f)), and excluded coverage <em>{ibid., </em>subd. (c)) in specified circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Plaintiff received bodily injuries on July 2, 1960, in a three-automobile accident involving vehicles driven by himself, Mario Alvarado and Jack L. Riveness. Alvarado was uninsured. In subsequent discussions and correspondence with defendant in 1961, plaintiff\u2019s attorney took the position that Alvarado was responsible for the accident and demanded (1) payment of the full $10,000 policy limit under the uninsured motorist coverage and (2) arbitration of the amount to be paid him as provided therein. Neither demand having been met, plaintiff commenced a superior court action against Alvarado in June 1961, seeking damages for his injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His attorney, reporting the status of the Alvarado action to defendant by letter dated October 5, 1961, again demanded arbitration pursuant to plaintiff\u2019s policy. Receiving no response, plaintiff commenced the present action in March 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The complaint herein (entitled \u201cComplaint\u2014Breach of Insurance Contract\u201d) alleged the policy, the uninsured motorist coverage and the language of the arbitration clause; the facts of the Alvarado accident, plaintiff\u2019s injuries and Alvarado\u2019s negligence as a proximate cause thereof; that the Alvarado vehicle was an \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d; that plaintiff had performed all his agreements under the policy and had demanded that defendant arbitrate the amount of money due him thereunder; and that defendant had refused to arbitrate, thereby breaching the policy to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the amount of $10,000. Answering the complaint, defendant denied that plaintiff had performed under the policy; denied that it had refused to arbitrate or had breached the policy; denied plaintiff\u2019s alleged damages; and admitted (by failure to deny) the other allegations of the complaint summarized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As originally filed in April 1962, the answer pleaded no affirmative defenses. In 1963, defendant was permitted to file a supplemental answer setting forth the language of the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause (quoted in fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>and alleging that, without defendant\u2019s written consent, plaintiff had \u201cprosecuted to judgment an action against one Mario Alvarado for the bodily injuries referred to in the complaint on file herein.\u201d By reason of the multiple issues thus presented, the pretrial conference order severed them for trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>At the first-phase trial defendant proved that without its consent a judgment for $10,000 and costs, in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against Alvarado, had been entered in the Alvarado action on March 8, 1963, pursuant to a formal stipulation executed therein by plaintiff and Alvarado on the same date. The judgment and stipulation were received in evidence at the trial hereof. Pursuant to the latter, the judgment permanently enjoined plaintiff from enforcing it \u201cexcept for such rights as Plaintiff may have as a judgment creditor to the extent of this judgment in those certain bankruptcy proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Southern Division, entitled \u2018In the Matter of Mario Alvarado, Bankrupt,\u2019being Action Number 63515 of said Court . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">At the conclusion of trial the court made formal findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The findings recited the language of the uninsured motorist coverage and of the exclusionary clause in plaintiff\u2019s policy, set forth the facts of the 1960 accident and plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and summarized the parties\u2019 1961 negotiations. No finding was made as to whether defendant had breached the policy in any respect, but the court found that Alvarado was an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d and that the aforementioned $10,000 judgment had been entered against him in the Alvarado action on March 8, 1963, without defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Based upon the findings last mentioned, the court stated in its conclusions of law (among other things not involved on the appeal) \u201c1. That plaintiff did prosecute to judgment an action against Mario Alvarado, <em>a person who might be legally liable </em>for the bodily injury received [by plaintiff] in the accident on July 2, 1960\u201d (italics added) and \u201c6. Defendant is not obliged to make any payment to plaintiff . . . [under the uninsured motorist coverage] . . . on account of the accident of July 2, 1960.\u201d The judgment (that \u201cplaintiff take nothing\u201d) followed, thus concluding the action in the first phase specified in the pretrial conference order. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Appealing from the judgment, plaintiff relies upon <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 407 [62 Cal.Rptr. 177], In that case, an action by an insured under a similar policy, the appellate court held that the insurer could not invoke the exclusionary clause as a defense if it had itself breached the policy in the first instance <em>(id., </em>at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>411-413); plaintiff argues that <em>Calhoun </em>applies here because defendant initially breached this policy by refusing to arbitrate. Defendant contends that <em>Calhoun </em>does not control because the carrier there breached the policy by wrongfully denying coverage to the insured, whereas it (defendant here) did not deny coverage in the present case, did not refuse to arbitrate, and in any event had not breached the policy. Therefore, defendant argues, plaintiff\u2019s prosecution of the Alvarado action to judgment gives it (defendant) a complete defense under the exclusionary clause by reason of the rule established in <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Kowalski </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 607, 610 [43 Cal.Rptr. 843].</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The trial court, having concluded in defendant\u2019s favor on its policy defense, apparently applied the <em>Kowalski </em>rule upon the factual premise that defendant had not breached the policy; and we might perceive, in support of the judgment, an implied finding to that effect. (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) Trial,\u00a7 118, par. (1), p. 1850.)  But the opposing arguments do not\u2014as the trial court did not\u2014take into account that, in the Alvarado bankruptcy proceeding mentioned in the evidence, Alvarado filed in bankruptcy on August 3, 1961; (2) that he scheduled as a provable debt therein his prospective liability to plaintiff arising from the 1960 accident (and identified the then-pending Alvarado action by court, title and number); and (3) that he (Alvarado) was discharged in bankruptcy therein in 1961. These facts are not explicitly disclosed in the trial record, but we judicially notice them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rojas </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 676, 679 [21 Cal.Rptr. 564, 371 P.2d 300]; <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 492, 496-497 [15 Cal.Rptr. 87, 364 P.2d 263].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A discharge in bankruptcy releases the bankrupt from liability upon all his provable debts which existed when the petition in bankruptcy was filed (Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 17, subd. a [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35, subd. (a)]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Bergere </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 267, 271-272 [210 P.2d 727]; 1 Collier Bankruptcy Manual (2d ed. 1969) \u00a7 17.00, p. 205; 9 Am.Jur.2d Bankruptcy, \u00a7 743, pp. 554-555) and which were duly scheduled as such in the bankruptcy proceeding. (Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 17, subd. a, par. [3] [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35, subd. (a), par. (3)]; 1 Collier <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 17.06, p. 214.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Such debts include one \u201cfounded upon ... the right to recover damages in any action for negligence instituted prior to and pending at the time of the filing of the petition . . .\u201d (Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 63, subd.\" a, par [7] [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, subd. (a), par. (7); 1 Collier, <em>op. cit. supra, % </em>63.17, pp. 777-778; 9 Am.Jur.2d Bankruptcy, \u00a7\u00a7 406 [p. 325], 756 [564-565].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The legislative purpose in enacting the unconsented-judgment exclusion in the uninsured motorist statute (\u00a7 11580.2, subd. (c), par. (3)) was to protect, and to prevent the insured from compromising, the rights against the uninsured motorist to which the insurer is subrogated under subdivision (f) of the statute <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App 2d 124, 129 [41 Cal.Rptr. 650]; see Eisler, California Uninsured Motorist Law (1969) \u00a7 7.5, p. 98), and to which defendant was subrogated under the policy in the present case. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em> An unconsented judgment cannot compromise those rights as against an uninsured motorist who is judgment-proof by reason of a discharge in bankruptcy, and it protects the same rights to the extent that the insurer remains subrogated to any recovery by the insured as a creditor-claimant in the bankruptcy proceedings.  It thus appears that the Legislature did not intend to require exclusion of uninsured motorist coverage under the circumstances perceived to exist here, and that the parties did not so intend when they contracted under the exclusionary clause in the policy. The <em>Kowalski </em>decision does not direct any contrary conclusions; such circumstances did not exist in that case. <em>(Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Kowalski, supra, </em>233 Cal.App. 2d 607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Application of the foregoing considerations to the facts here (as shown in the record and as judicially noticed) would produce, as prospects at least, the successive conclusions (1) that Alvarado\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy in 1961 released him from liability for plaintiff\u2019s injuries sued upon in that action; (2) that Alvarado was not thereafter \u201clegally liable therefor\u201d; (3) that plaintiff, stipulating to the entry of judgment in the Alvarado action on March 8, 1963, did not\u2014within the meaning of the uninsured motorist statute (\u00a7 11580.2, subd. (c), par. (3)) or of the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause founded upon it (see fn. 3, ante)\u2014\u201cprosecute to judgment any action against any person who may be legally liable\u201d for his injuries; and (4) that defendant therefore cannot invoke the exclusionary clause as the basis of a policy, defense in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Although these prospects require reversal of the judgment because they were not taken into account at the trial, the full legal effect of Alvarado\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy depends upon the resolution of certain other questions. One is whether his liability for injury to plaintiff was discharge-able in bankruptcy as one sued upon in an \u201caction for negligence\u201d as that term is defined in the bankruptcy laws (Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 63, subd. a, par. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>[7] [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, subd. (a), par. (7)]) or whether it was conceivably \u201cfor willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another\u201d and not dischargeable for that reason. (Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 17, subd. a, par. [2] [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35, subd. (a), par. (2)]. See 1 Collier, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 17.03, p. 211-1-213 [and, particularly, cases cited in fn. 7 on p. 212].) (As we hereinafter mention, defendant has attempted to show the latter on the appeal.) Another question is whether Alvarado\u2019s liability, if originally a provable debt in his bankruptcy proceeding, remained such by reason of its allowance or allowability upon liquidation therein. (See Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 57, subd. (d) [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93, subd. (d)]; <em>ibid., </em>\u00a7 63, subd. d [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, subd (d)]; 1 Collier, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 63.17 [pp. 777-778], 57.11 [pp. 539-543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Both parties attempted to have us resolve some of these questions on the appeal; each moved this court (1) for an order augmenting the record on appeal to include various documentary items and (2) to take judicial notice of the matters recited or mentioned therein. Defendant so moved with reference to records of a criminal prosecution in which Alvarado was convicted of felony'drank driving as a result of the 1960 accident; from these records, defendant would have us conclude that Alvarado\u2019s liability to plaintiff was \u201cfor willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another\u201d and, hence, not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Augmentation to include some of the items moved by plaintiff is unnecessary because they already appear in the record. Augmentation to include others, as sought by both parties, would be improper because none were \u201cused on the trial\u201d (rule 12(a), California Rules of Court) or considered by the trial court through judicial notice or otherwise. (Id.; see <em>Gelini </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 340, 348 [18 Cal.Rptr. 853]; cf. <em>Lipka </em>v. <em>Lipka </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 472, 481 [35 Cal.Rptr. 71, 386 P.2d 671].) The matters mentioned in the latter category\u2014and especially those propounded by defendant\u2019s motion\u2014are not, in our view, proper subjects of judicial notice for the purposes contemplated by the parties. For these various reasons, we deny both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The unresolved questions should be decided by a trial court, upon conventional evidence and under the general rule that, although the granting of a discharge in bankruptcy is a function of the bankruptcy court, \u201cthe effect of a discharge is properly for the determination of any court in which it is duly pleaded or otherwise submitted for judgment.\u201d <em>(Yellow Creek Logging Corp. </em>v. <em>Dare </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 50, 55 [30 Cal.Rptr. 629].) The trial court can do this at retrial of the first phase hereof, upon relevant proof and consistent with our construction\u2014as applicable\u2014of the exclusionary provision of the uninsured motorist statute herein discussed. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (c), par. (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The parties\u2019 respective motions for augmentation of the record on appeal, and relative to judicial notice of certain matters, are denied.

J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The cited statute, to which we occasionally refer herein as \u201csection 11580.2,\u201d was enacted by the 1959 Legislature and repealed and reenacted in 1961. (Stats. 1961, ch. 1189, p. 2921 et seq. [\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2].) As will appear, plaintiff\u2019s claim under the policy arose when he was injured in July 1960. Accordingly, all references to the statute herein are to the 1959 version.
