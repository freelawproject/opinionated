The matter was heard by the court sitting without a jury. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the sum of $5,000 together witli interest and costs. Defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">In 1960 plaintiff, an attorney at law, who had never before invested in a gas or oil well, and defendant, a licensed California stockbroker, salesman, had a conversation about gas leases. Defendant told him he had been investing in gas leases or gas wells in the San Juan area in New Mexico, knew the son of the developer, had opportunities to invest and had clients who invested with him in gas wells; that \"it was like shooting fish in a barrel\u201d for there just weren\u2019t any dry wells in the San Juan region, and after a well is developed and sold the returns are from three to six times the investment. Later after several conversations, defendant went to plaintiff's home where he explained that the promoters permit him and his friends to invest, usually in \u201c$15,000 chunks \u201d and he could make one available to plaintiff for $15,000. When plaintiff told him he did not have $15,000, defendant said that maybe they would accept less if he (defendant) could get additional money elsewhere. Subsequently defendant called and said if he could afford $5,000 he could get into the deal, they were expecting a good well, \u201cIt\u2019s a sure thing.\u201d Soon thereafter defendant came to plaintiff\u2019s home and showed him a map of the region. Plaintiff said he didn\u2019t want any doubts about the investment; defendant told him he was so confident, so sure of it, he would guarantee the $5,000 in writing, and brought to plaintiff a handwritten \"dry hole guarantee\u201d he had prepared. Later plaintiff told defendant he did not like the form of the document, and \u201cthen discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>it some more. And out of that we both then agreed that he would buy my interest back for $5,000 at any time after six months if I made demand for it. In return for that, I would extend to him an option to buy my interest, whether I wanted to sell it or not, for $15,000 at any time within twelve months\u2019. And based upon that oral agreement I then drew a written document . . . one for me and one for him.\u201d Thereafter on February 21, 1961, in plaintiff\u2019s office, plaintiff handed to defendant (he may then have mailed it at defendant\u2019s direction) his cheek for $5,000 \u201cand at that time we both signed this agreement and he took a copy of it. \u2019 \u2019 His counsel showed plaintiff a photocopy (Exh. 1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which he identified as a copy of the copy of the agreement he had prepared and given to defendant February 21,1961.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">At this point in the trial, defendant having claimed that he did not sign the agreement, the judge suggested that the issue whether the written agreement of February 21, 1961, had been executed be determined first. It developed that the original written agreement signed by defendant and retained by plaintiff was lost. According to plaintiff, after the execution of the written agreement he turned over the original to John Atchley, his attorney, who later brought the within action. Mr. Atehley and Mr. Walker (defendant\u2019s attorney) tried to settle by setting up a joint escrow and transferring certain documents but the attempt failed. In 1963 Mr. Atehley died. As to the original written agreement bearing defendant\u2019s signature, plaintiff testified, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what Mr. Atehley did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>with it, but when we went to his file it was not there anymore, so what he did, I don\u2019t know . . . He died, your Honor, and that is when we started looking through his things.\u201d Defendant testified, \u201cI have my own opinion on it that I didn\u2019t sign it [original agreement] in his deposition he said he could not remember. However, when shown his photocopy (Exh. 1) which bears plaintiff\u2019s signature and his own initials, \u201cW.J.T., \u201d defendant admitted that the initials \u201cappear\u201d to have been made by him and that it was a photocopy of the onionskin copy plaintiff prepared and gave to him and which he later gave to his attorney Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker also died and the onionskin copy too disappeared; thus both the original written agreement and defendant\u2019s original copy have been lost. Then defendant was confronted with two affidavits executed by him (October 27, 1965, and February 18, 1966) and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment, in each of which he stated under oath: \u201cThat on February 21, 1961, your affiant [defendant] and plaintiff executed a certain document a copy of which is attached hereto and marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having heard all of the evidence in this connection, the trial court ruled that defendant \u201cdid execute the original agreement\u201d retained by plaintiff and that neither the original agreement nor the orginal copy is any longer in existence. Ultimately the trial court found that plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing dated February 21, 1961 (Finding I); there is no question but that this finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The trial continued and, relying upon the photocopy (Exh. 1) of his copy which contains neither his signature nor the legal description in the blanks provided therefor and which he kept in his possession, defendant raised the issue that \u201cthe document is entirely at law insufficient . . . there is no description here, absolutely none. \u201d (\u00a7 1624, subd. 4, Civ. Code.) However, the evidence received without objection, establishes that as part of the transaction and at the time plaintiff gave his $5,000 check to defendant and they signed the written agreement, they discussed the fact that no legal description was then available and the impossibility of filling in the blanks therefor at that time, and orally agreed that when the legal description became available each could fill in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>his copy;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that subsequently plaintiff did receive the legal description and pursuant to their oral contract the description<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was inserted in the original agreement then in the possession of plaintiff\u2019s counsel;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that although the legal description also became available to defendant, defendant failed to enter the same on his copy. (Exh. 1.) Relying upon the incomplete photocopy (Exh. 1), defense counsel did not question defendant concerning this, thus the court asked defendant if he had discussed with plaintiff the absence of a description and whether this would be filled in later, but defendant evaded answering the question and talked about his unexecuted handwritten ' ' dry hole agreement. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Appellant challenges the findings \u201cthat the legal description was inserted on the original of said agreement\u201d (VIII) which \u201cis a sufficient agreement in writing, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>by section 1624(4) of the Civil Code\u201d (XV).  Designating the interest set up in the written agreement as an \u201cinterest in real property,\u201d appellant, still relying on his own copy in which he did not insert the legal description, argues that the lack of description therein is fatal (\u00a7 1624, subd. 4, Civ. Code), parol evidence cannot \u201csupply the required description which the parties have failed to insert,\u201d and the only agreement presented to the court (photocopy of defendant\u2019s copy) contains no description whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">When a finding is attacked on the ground the evidence is not sufficient to support it, the power of this court begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradictory or uncontradictory which will support the finding of fact. <em>(Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 [299 P.2d 231]; <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Nickel, </em>194 Cal. 243, 260 [228 P. 25].)  Moreover, such contention requires appellant to demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support the challenged finding. <em>(Nichols </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>32 Cal.2d 598, 600 [197 P.2d 550].)  Thus, with these rules in mind, comparing the findings with all of the evidence in the ease and construing them liberally in support of the judgment <em>(Mashon </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 151, 167 [11 Cal.Rptr. 865]), and viewing the evidence and indulging all reasonable inferences therefrom most strongly in favor of the findings and judgment <em>(Grainger </em>v. <em>Antoyan, </em>48 Cal.2d 805, 807 [313 P.2d 848]; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183]), we can only conclude that the record contains ample evidence in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">First, the record shows that the photocopy of defendant\u2019s incomplete copy of the agreement which lacks both his signature and the legal description (Exh. 1), upon which he relies, is neither \u201cthe only agreement presented to the court\u201d below as asserted by appellant, nor the agreement relied on and proved by plaintiff. The written agreement on which plaintiff predicated his case was the original which contained defendant\u2019s signature and the legal description.  Second, appellant misconceives the purpose for which the parol evidence was received. It was not offered to vary the original written agreement or to supply a legal description which it did not include, but to prove the contents of the lost document, Preliminarily and without objection, plaintiff offered proof of the loss or destruction of the original written agreement. Exercising its discretion <em>(Kenniff </em>v. <em>Caulfield, </em>140 Cal. 34, 42 [73 P. 803]) the trial court determined the proof to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>sufficient and ruled that the original written agreement was no longer in existence. Defendant did not and does not here question the ruling. Having found the original instrument to have been lost, it was proper for the court to receive parol evidence as to its content. (\u00a71501, Evid. Code; <em>Guardianship of Levy, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 237, 249 [290 P.2d 320].) Accordingly, without objection thereto, plaintiff proceeded to establish the contents of the original written agreement; obviously the trial court gave credence to plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">At no time did defendant deny under oath that at the time they signed the agreement and plaintiff paid the $5,000 they discussed the unavailability of the legal description and orally agreed that when each received the same he could fill in the blanks on his own copy; and no evidence that the original written agreement did not contain the legal description was received. Thus, the judge inquired of defendant concerning this but received no responsive answer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Suspecting that defendant knew that a legal description was necessary for a valid agreement and that he intentionally submitted for plaintiff\u2019s signature the \u201cdry hole agreement\u201d containing none, the judge asked further questions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, it is apparent from the evidence that, while he may have had no legal description at the time of the execution of the written agreement, defendant did have a map of the San Juan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>region showing \u2018 \u2018 the tract, range and township relative to this amount of property\u201d which he brought to plaintiff\u2019s home, and subsequent thereto had the legal description although he did not, under the oral agreement, insert the same in his copy. Defendant\u2019s entire testimony reflects a reluctance to be forthright in his version of what occurred and to assume any responsibility for his acts. In many areas he was vague and indefinite and frequently resorted to lack of memory; in major matters his testimony was inconsistent and evasive. At some points he denied having anything at all to do with plaintiff\u2019s investment except ' ' conversationalwise is all,\u201d or knowing about it; several times he claimed that others (Dial or Noel) dealt with plaintiff and they knew more about it, and all he knew was what he read in the complaint. The foregoing, the fact that plaintiff, a practicing attorney, obviously knew the necessity for compliance with the requirements of section 1624 subdivision 4, Civil Code and plaintiff\u2019s direct testimony support the findings.  Plaintiff having paid the $5,000 and executed the written agreement of February 21, 1961, in reliance on the oral contract that later each could insert the legal description in his copy, and through his attorney the oral contract having been completely executed on his side, defendant cannot take advantage of his own failure to fill in the blanks in his copy by relying upon his incomplete copy to invoke the statute of frauds in this action for his breach of the written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is unnecessary to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s transaction amounted to participation in a pooling agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The written agreement provides for the purchase by defendant from plaintiff of \u201call of his right, title and interest in and to a certain natural gas lease,\u201d but it is apparent from the evidence that others including defendant invested in the gas lease or well. Defendant himself had invested $18,000 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>area over the past two years and was paid by the promoters to interest others. Originally defendant offered plaintiff a $15,000 \u201cchunk\u201d but later took his $5,000 and made up the $10,000 from other investors which may well have included himself. Defendant admitted that there were 320 acres to the well in which plaintiff invested and that he invested therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Within the six-month period plaintiff, under the written agreement of February 21, 1961, made several demands on defendant to purchase his interest for $5,000; after his last demand plaintiff filed the within lawsuit but did not serve it; when defendant ignored the demand, plaintiff attached certain of defendant\u2019s property. Defendant then told plaintiff he would arrange to pay the $5,000 if he would hold up further proceedings for a while, that it would be expensive for him to defend the action, take depositions and hire attorneys; \u201chis point was if we just hold everything up for 60 days that he would pay us the money. ...\u201d Plaintiff testified he told defendant \u201cthat I would take the promissory note, not in payment of the obligation, but just in evidence of his good faith and would hold up all other proceedings for a while and that I would have the right to proceed on either the note or the original agreement if, in fact, he did not pay. He agreed\u201d and gave plaintiff his promissory note dated January 15, 1963, for $5,000 payable on or before March 16, 1963. Plaintiff further testified, \u201cI was not to do anything or pursue it [action] in any way and I was to give him 60 days to get the money together. \u2019 \u2019 During the 60-day period plaintiff made no demand on defendant and did not in any manner proceed with the lawsuit. However, counsel made an effort \u201ctowards winding the whole thing up\u201d whereby defendant was to pay plaintiff $5,000 and plaintiff would waive interest and give an assignment and general release, but the effort failed because around March 16, 1963, on behalf of defendant, Dial gave plaintiff his check for $5,000; it \u201cwas put through and it bounced.\u201d On the other hand, defendant testifying concerning the promissory note admitted that he executed the note and did not pay it, explained the circumstances under which he signed it, the purpose for which it was given\u2014\u201cto keep Mr. Robinson from going to the district attorney\u201d\u2014and the consideration therefor\u2014\"I got peace of mind. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The trial court found \u201cthat the promissory note set forth was a valid, binding, legal agreement, and was not executed by the defendant Thornton conditionally to attempt to settle a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>lawsuit, but was executed with the full expressed intention that defendant Thornton would be bound by the said promissory note, and pay plaintiff the sum of $5,000, as provided in said note.\u201d (Finding IV.) While it is true that counsel took advantage of the 60 days and sought to settle the matter, defendant\u2019s promissory note was given specifically in exchange for time in which to get the money together and for peace of mind and plaintiff\u2019s. promise that during the 60 days he would proceed no further with his action. This forbearance was sufficient to constitute a good and valuable and independent consideration to support the note <em>(Brody </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>193 Cal.App.2d 644, 645 [14 Cal.Rptr. 539]), although, of course, there was an obvious benefit running to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">At the conclusion of the trial the judge called the attention of counsel to the failure of the pre-trial order to specifically mention the issue of nonpayment of the promissory note alleged in plaintiff's fourth cause of action and said, \u2018 \u2018 If you want to make a motion to amend the pre-trial to include the issues raised by the fourth cause of action . . . and the answer thereto, you can do that\u201d; plaintiff so moved and the motion was granted. Appellant claims this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Trial courts have the discretion to allow oral amendments to pre-trial orders at any time during the trial provided the adverse party is not prejudiced thereby. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 69, 74-75 [47 Cal.Rptr. 501]; <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>250 Cal.App. 2d 722, 727 [58 Cal.Rptr. 870].)  Plaintiff pleaded the execution of the promissory note, demand and defendant\u2019s failure to pay it in his fourth cause of action (par. VI, VII). While appellant now asserts that plaintiff\u2019s fourth cause of action was not sufficient to set up a cause of action on the note, he neither demurred to it nor moved to strike but admitted the note\u2019s execution and tendered the issue of its consideration and payment in paragraph 14<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of his answer by setting up a further and separate defense to the fourth cause of action. This case was tried on the basis that the issue was properly raised and without objection plaintiff testified to the execution of the note, the consideration given therefor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>defendant\u2019s failure to pay it; defense counsel then cross-examined plaintiff on these matters; and defendant testified that he executed the note and failed to pay it and explained the circumstances surrounding its execution and the purpose for which it was given. The entire issue was fully tried. There was no element of surprise, and it is not true, as appellant now asserts, that he was not permitted to raise the defense of lack of consideration. Among other questions concerning consideration, defendant\u2019s own counsel asked him, \u201cDid you receive any consideration for giving a promissory note ? \u2019 \u2019 and defendant answered, \u201cYes. I got peace of mind. ...\u201d The issue of consideration was fully developed during the course of the trial. We find in the record no prejudice to defendant resulting from amendment of the pre-trial order to conform to proof, and there is manifest no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in allowing the oral amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Fourt, Acting P.

I never intended or thought that I was buying any leases from anybody.\u201d Asked if it was his understanding that he was buying an undivided interest in some leases or a lease plaintiff answered: \u201cIt was my understanding that I was going into a pool and that when the time came for distribution, in order to protect each person who was investing, that some undivided interest in the total lease would bear my name. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> \u201dThat the note was executed approximately five months after the filing of the Answer to the original complaint, and said note was executed in connection with efforts on the part of the defendant\u2019s then counsel to settle the pending litigation, and that plaintiff knew full well and still knows that said promissory note was executed in connection with these efforts to settle the litigation, which proved fruiless, and for no other purpose whatsoever. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
