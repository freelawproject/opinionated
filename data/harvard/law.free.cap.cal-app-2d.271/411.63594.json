An expert was appointed to examine him as to his sanity (Evid. Code, \u00a7 730), and defendant thereafter entered an additional plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and two more experts were appointed to examine defendant (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1027; Evid. Code, \u00a7 730). Subsequently he withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and the court\u2014jury having been waived on such issue\u2014found the alleged prior felony conviction to be true. After a jury trial defendant was found guilty of first degree murder and the penalty fixed at life imprisonment. He appeals from the judgment; the attempted appeal from the order denying defendant \u2019s motion for a new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Myron Johnson was the owner of an auto parts store in Palmdale. Shortly before 8 p.m. on August 11, 1967, James Bland heard a shot inside the store and saw a man, later identified as defendant, run from the store; he carried- a gun in his right hand and a generator box in his left; entering a blue Plymouth he drove away. A few seconds later Bland saw Johnson come out of the store; his chest was bleeding and he told Bland he had been shot and was dying. Deputy Sheriff Compton responded to Bland\u2019s telephone call; upon arrival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>he saw Johnson lying on the sidewalk with Bland bending over him; he noticed a blood trail from behind the counter of the store to the spot where Johnson was lying. Inside the store Deputy Compton observed a bullet hole through the back wall and removed a slug embedded therein; he testified that it was his opinion that the shot was fired from the customer\u2019s side of the counter. Johnson\u2019s wallet was empty upon arrival at the coroner\u2019s office although, according to his wife, he always kept between 10 and 15 dollars for business transacted after the store was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Deputy Shanley received a radio message of the shooting, including a description of the suspect and his car. After a license check, Shanley ascertained that the car was registered to defendant and that he resided at a certain address. Defendant not being home when Shanley called, the latter was directed to the residence of defendant\u2019s girl friend. Upon Shanley\u2019s arrival at about 1:30 a.m. defendant was there; near his person Shanley found a .38 caliber revolver and eight .38 caliber bullets. Defendant\u2019s car was located later that morning on an old desert road; it was stuck in the sand. A cardboard box containing a generator was found about 100 yards from the vehicle; fingerprints, concededly those of the defendant, were on the generator box. There was testimony that the slug found embedded in the wall of defendant\u2019s store was fired by defendant\u2019s .38 caliber revolver; that the weapon would not have fired unless the trigger was pulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Johnson\u2019s widow testified that she and her husband lived in an apartment directly above the store; she last saw him alive about 7:30 p.m. when he was downstairs in the store putting stock away; the cash register drawer was then not out on the counter. A part-time employee, called to the store by the widow shortly after the shooting, noticed that the cash register drawer was on the counter, and stated that he had never seen this happen before; he also noticed the number of a generator written on the order pad (on the counter) belonging to a type that fitted 1942 to 1947 Chrysler products.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">There was evidence tending to establish \u2018diminished capacity.\u201d Although defendant\u2019s girl friend stated that he was' not drank upon arrival at her home early on the.morning of August 12, she did testify that she was with him the previous afternoon. when he drank one quart of beer and wanted to take, her .to Lancaster. Robert Bowen was with defendant before the latter saw his girl friend later that afternoon; according to him defendant consumed four to five quarts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>beer during their four hour visit. Defendant\u2019s brother (David) last saw defendant at 6 p.m., about two hours before the offense was committed at which time defendant was drunk; he testified that defendant had the mind of a ten-year-old child. Another witness corroborated the testimony of Robert Bowen that defendant consumed four to five quarts of beer; she testified that he was drunk and nearly fell out of his car when he drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Dr. George Thompson, court-appointed psychiatrist, conducted extensive tests and examination with a view to ascertaining defendant\u2019s mental capacities; he reached the following conclusions: Defendant suffers from a mental deficiency of the upper moron level, with an overall intelligence quotient of 69\u2014his mental age was considered to be about 10 years; because he suffers from chronic mental deterioration, he is more subject to the effect of alcohol than a person without such impairment\u2014defendant told the witness that he had no recollection of the shooting; defendant was probably sane at the time of the commission of the offense\u201d although \u201chis mental state was probably clouded by the alcohol he had consumed\u201d; defendant probably had the mental capacity to form the specific intent to commit the crime of robbery but it was doubtful whether he had the mental capacity to deliberate, premeditate or to harbor malice\u2014-\u201che had diminished capacity to form specific intent to kill and to steal because of limited intellectual functioning and poor impulse control. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">With one exception (presently to be noted),-the trial court generally followed the suggested form of instructions found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>64 Cal.2d 310, 324-326 (fn. 4) [49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911], In addition to defining homicide and robbery, the court gave the following instructions designated as \u201cAdaptation of <em>Conley </em>Rule.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>given on second degree murder, which appellant claims constituted prejudicial error. Preliminarily, and prior to instructing the jury, the court told counsel in chambers that \u201cIn respect to the Wells, Gorshen, Connelly [sic] and othei leading cases, the Court has prepared its own special instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tion adapted from the footnote in People versus Connelly<em>[sic] . . . </em>The court feels that there is no possible tenable theory on which this could be a second degree murder since there is no substantial evidence under any other theory for second degree murder and that if diminished capacity reduces defendant\u2019s ability to form the various specific intents that may be material, it would be reduced all the way to voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, as the case may be. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the problem. A homicide committed in the perpetration of a robbery is murder of the first degree. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lookadoo, </em>66 Cal.2d 307, 314 [57 Cal.Rptr. 608, 425 P.2d 208].) On the other hand, the nature and extent of the felony-second-degree murder rule in this state have been thus expressed: <em>\u2018 \u2018A </em>homicide that is a direct causal result of the commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life <em>(other than the six felonies enumerated in Pen. Code, \u00a7 189) </em>constitutes at least second degree murder.\u201d (Italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>60 Cal.2d 772, 795 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892].) Section 189 has been construed as not requiring a strict causal relation between the felony and the homicide, and the homicide is committed in the perpetration of a felony if the killing and the felony are parts of one continuous transaction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Cal.2d 164, 168-169 [4 Cal.Rptr. 841, 351 P.2d 1025].) In the present ease defendant was seen leaving the store with a gun in his hand after the sound of a shot apparently originating within those premises. He carried a generator box which was found near his car and bore his fingerprints. When found, the victim\u2019s wallet was empty although he always carried a sum of money; too, the cash box on the store counter was empty. The bullet embedded in the wall of the store was fired by defendant\u2019s revolver, and there was evidence that the weapon could not have been discharged accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">As noted above, the form of instructions suggested in <em>Conley </em>included an instruction on second degree murder;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but, as pointed out in the first paragraph of the footnote (fn. 4, 64 Cal.2d at p. 324), the suggested instructions are for cases where diminished capacity is a defense <em>and </em>\u201cthe felony murder doctrine is not involved. . . .\u201d  Under the \u201cfelony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>murder doctrine\u201d a killing whether intentional or unintentional is murder in the first degree if committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate six designated felonies, including robbery. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coefield, </em>37 Cal.2d 865, 868 [236 P.2d 570].) The ordinary elements of first degree murder\u2014 malice and premeditation\u2014are eliminated by the doctrine, the only criminal intent required being the specific intent to commit the felony.  As shown in <em>Coefield, </em>\u201cwhen one enters a place with a deadly weapon for the purpose of committing robbery, malice is shown by the nature of the attempted crime, and the law fixes upon the offender the intent which makes any killing in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate the robbery a murder in the first degree.\u201d (37 Cal.2d at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">But, says defendant, if there was no specific intent to commit robbery at the time of the killing or if the intent to take the generator was formed after the killing, the jury could have found him guilty of murder in the second degree. As noted above, specific intent to commit the independent felony must be proved in order to establish first degree murder ; but as also noted earlier, proof of a strict causal relationship between a felony and a homicide is not required, and it is sufficient to show that the felony and the homicide were parts of a continuous transaction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>61 Cal.2d 353, 361-362 [38 Cal.Rptr. 726, 392 P.2d 526].) Too, subsequent possession of the victim\u2019s property (in this case, the generator box) is evidence that the independent felony was committed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>44 Cal.2d 252, 266 [282 P.2d 53].) The jury was properly instructed that if by reason of diminished capacity defendant did not form the specific intent to steal or if there was a reasonable doubt whether he formed such intent, he could not be found guilty of a greater offense than manslaughter; the finding, of course, was against defendant in such respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Appellant\u2019s present contention is further weakened by what may well be characterized as a tactical maneuver on the part of defendant\u2019s trial counsel to confront the jury with the limited choice between first degree murder and manslaughter in the event an acquittal was not secured. Thus, the record reveals that at the conclusion of the session in chambers regarding the instructions to be given, the court stated: \u201cIf there are no further matters, Gentlemen, then I am ready to proceed if you are,\u201d to which defense counsel replied: \u201cI have nothing to add, your Honor. \u2019 \u2019 Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>an instruction on second degree murder should have been given, the failure to request such an instruction may well be considered as invited error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>64 Cal.2d 574, 580-581, fn. 4 [51 Cal.Rptr. 225, 414 P.2d 353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Appellant argues that a reversal is warranted because of the incompetency of trial counsel, the following examples of which are failure to (1) ask for a second degree murder instruction; (2) move that the entire jury panel be excused after the prosecution had asked jurors prejudicial questions on <em>voir dire-, </em>(3) ask for a mistrial when references were made to defendant\u2019s prior record; (4) call a defense witness who allegedly would have supported the theories urged by him; and (5) move for a mistrial when a certain witness was not called by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">To justify relief on the ground that- counsel was inadequate, it must appear that the trial was reduced to a farce or sham through the attorney\u2019s lack of competence, diligence, or knowledge of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487].) Further, \u201c [defendant has the burden ... of establishing his allegation of inadequate representation \u2018not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>64 Cal.2d 766, 774 [51 Cal.Rptr. 691, 415 P.2d 35].)  Appellant has failed to sustain his burden; further, the record does not admit the application of the rule announced in <em>Ibarra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\"><em>We </em>have already disposed of example (1), <em>supra, </em>thus, we consider (2) that the entire panel should have been excused on motion, the ground for which seems to be that without objection by defense counsel the prosecution continued, despite some admonition at the bench, to so question each prospective juror that a death penalty minded jury would be impaneled. The questions related to the jurors\u2019 possession of any conscientious objections to capital punishment and whether the possible fact of a death penalty would prevent them from returning a first degree murder verdict. Such line of inquiry was not improper under the <em>Witherspoon </em>case <em>(Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 785, fn. 21, 88 S.Ct. 1770]): \u201cThe most that can be demanded of a venireman in this regard is that he be willing to <em>consider </em>all of the penalties provided by state law, and that he not be irrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\u201d The remaining examples [(3), (4) and (5)], we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>believe, involve matters of trial tactics. In this regard, \u201cThe choice of when to object and when to allow the evidence to come in as offered is inherently a matter of trial tactics. Ordinarily the tactical decisions of trial counsel will not be reviewed with the hindsight of an appellate court. [Citations.] \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>246 Cal.App.2d 343, 350-351 [54 Cal.Rptr. 731].) The three items, numbered above, constitute no exception to the general rule just related. Significant, also, is this appraisal by the trial court of counsel\u2019s efforts: \u201cI think this matter was most ably tried by defense counsel. There was great consideration given to every legal point involved, including the voir dire proceedings . . . the instructions given . . . the admissibility of evidence. I think counsel did a most exemplary job in all respects. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The <em>Witherspoon </em>case is cited in support of defendant\u2019s last point. Conceding that such decision is not applicable when the jury chooses the penalty of life imprisonment, defendant nevertheless contends that he was denied due process because there were no death penalty objectors among the jurors finally selected. He refers to a certain study cited in <em>Witherspoon </em>(20 L.Ed.2d 776, 782 [fn. 10]) that jurors with no scruples against the death penalty are \u201cmore prosecution prone\u201d than those who object to that penalty. But the court thus commented on the results of the study: \u201cThe data adduced by the petitioner . . . are too tentative and fragmentary to establish that jurors not opposed to the death penalty tend to favor the prosecution in the determination of guilt. We simply cannot conclude, either on the basis of the record now before us or as a matter of judicial notice, that the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment results in an unrepresentative jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increases the risk of conviction.\u201d (P. 782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Fourt, Acting P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><em>\u201c</em>Bearing on the matter of intent, the defendant has offered evidence of intoxication and mental deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"Asqc\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant fired the shot which killed Mr. Johnson and was conscious at the time, hut that he had substantially reduced mental capacity because of mental deficiency or intoxication, you must consider what effect, if any, this diminished capacity had on the defendant\u2019s ability to form the specific mental state which is an essential element of murder under the felony murder doctrine or of manslaughter. I have already discussed the felony murder doctrine to some extent and will enlarge upon it shortly, as well as defining manslaughter for you.</p>\n<p id=\"AZUA\">\u201cMalice is an essential element of murder, as I have previously informed you. Under the felony murder doctrine, malice is implied when a killing is a direct causal result of the perpetration of or the attempt to perpetrate certain felonies inherently dangerous to human life, including robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"A1qf\">\u201cTherefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>killed Mr. Johnson, whether intentionally, unintentionally, or accidentally, in the perpetration of or the attempt to perpetrate robbery, you will find him guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"A6m5\">\u201cHowever, you will recall that one essential element of robbery is the specific intent to steal. Therefore, if you find that by reason of diminished capacity defendant did not form the specific intent to steal, or have a reasonable doubt whether he formed that speifie intent, you are in effect finding that he did not harbor malice, and you cannot find him guilty of a offense than manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"AUe\">\u201cManslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. Two kinds of manslaughter, the definitions of which are pertinent here, are voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"Aka\"><em>\u201cVoluntary manslaughter </em>is an intentional killing in which the law, recognizing human frailty, permits the defendant to establish the lack of malice either by:</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">\u2018(a) Showing provocation such as to rouse the reasonable man to heat of passion or sudden quarrel. When such provocation is shown, the law will assume that the defendant who acts in the heat of passion or sudden quarrel, acts without malice. <em>Or hy:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYTi\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>(b) Showing that due to diminished capacity caused by mental illness, mental defect, or intoxication, the defendant did not attain the mental state constituting malice.</p>\n<p id=\"ArC\">\u201cThus, if you find that defendant did not, or you have a reasonable doubt that he did, commit robbery or attempted robbery, but find that he killed Mr. Johnson intentionally although in the heat of passion or a , sudden quarrel, his killing would be without malice and would be voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"AiY4\">\u2022 \u201cIf you find that due to diminished capacity he did not attain, or you have a reasonable doubt that he attained, the mental state constituting malice, but that he had the capacity to form the intent to kill and killed \"M&gt;. Johnson intentionally, the killing would also be voluntary man- \u25a0 slaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\"><em>\u201cInvoluntary manslaughter </em>is a killing in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or in the commission of a lawful \u2022act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due ; care and circumspection.</p>\n<p id=\"AZNB\">\u201cDrawing or exhibiting a firearm in a rude, angry or threatening manner, in the presence of another person, except in self-defense, is an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, and if death results, such killing . is involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">* \u2018 The carrying of a firearm, even loaded, is without more a lawful act. Yet if the firearm is handled without due care and circumspection, death</p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">. may result, and such killing would be involuntary manslaughter. \u201cIf you find that by reason of intoxication, the defendant was unable to form either the specific intent to kill or that to steal (and thus, as I</p>\n<p id=\"AGhn\">\u2022 have explained, could not harbor malice) the killing of Mr. Johnson would nevertheless be involuntary manslaughter, oven if the defendant was so intoxicated that he became unconscious. The law does not permit a \"person to use his own vice as a shelter against the legal consequences of his act. An ordinary and prudent man would not, while in the possession o.f a loaded firearm, permit himself to reach such a state of intoxication as to be unconscious of his actions. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The suggested instruction on second degree murder read as follows: \u201cIf you find, however, that the defendant\u2019s mental capacity was so diminished that he did not, or you have a reasonable doubt whether he did, premeditate, deliberate, or form an intent to kill, you will find the murder to be of the second degree.\u201d (64 Cal.2d at p. 325, fn. 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
