Since no extrinsic evidence directed toward interpretation and raising an issue of credibility was offered, we must make an independent determination of the meaning of the contract. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Dev. Co., </em>62 Cal.2d 861, 866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">In the present ease, plaintiff sought to recover dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ages pursuant to the terms of the contract, rather than independently of its terms. If the words \u201cto enforce or interpret\u201d the contract are broad enough to encompass the present action for damages arising from breach of contractual duty\u2014and certainly the contract had to be \u201cinterpreted\u201d to ascertain liability-\u2014then it seems clear that attorney\u2019s fees were envisioned when such interpretation became necessary. The basic lawsuit here is the plaintiff\u2019s means of enforcing its rights pursuant to the contract.  To enforce may mean to give effect to or to cause to have force. (See 30 C.J.S. 696 and <em>Meridian, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Sippy, </em>54 Cal.App.2d 214, 220 [128 P.2d 884].)  A valid contract is one which can be enforced so as to give to the proponent thereof the property, or the money, or the profit, or other advantage for which he bargained.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">There is no question but that if a contract provides for the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and suit is instituted to enforce the provisions of the contract, such an allowance may properly be made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>42 Cal.App.2d 293, 295 [108 P.2d 768].) (See also: Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021; <em>Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, </em>47 Cal.2d 241, 246 [302 P.2d 289]; <em>Citizens Suburban Co. </em>v. <em>Rosemont Dev. Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 666, 683 [53 Cal.Rptr. 551]; <em>Arthur B. Siri, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>189 Cal.App.2d 599, 603 [11 Cal.Rptr. 322].) Thus, in <em>Moss Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Wullfsohn, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 203, 204 [253 P.2d 483], a suit for monies due under a building contract, the court sustained an award of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff pursuant to a provision in the contract that \u201cshould either party hereto bring suit in court <em>to enforce the terms hereof, </em>any judgment awarded shall include court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the successful party.\u201d (Italics added.) (See also <em>Ansco Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Ocean View Estates, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 235 [337 P.2d 146].) In <em>Downer Corp. </em>v. <em>Union Paving Co., </em>172 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>126, 128 [342 P.2d 64], the court sustained an award of attorney\u2019s fees in an action confirming an arbitration award, where the agreement provided as follows: \u201c In the event either party finds it necessary to bring an action at law <em>to enforce its rights hereunder, </em>it is agreed that the Court shall award the successful party reasonable counsel fees.\u201d (Italics added.) Awards of attorney\u2019s fees have been sustained in suits on promissory notes. (See <em>Dankert </em>v. <em>Lamb Finance Co., </em>146 Cal.App.2d 499, 503 [304 P.2d 199], where the note provided for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin the event of commencement of suit to enforce this note\u201d; see also <em>Marsh Wall Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henry Marcus Building Specialties, </em>162 Cal. App.2d 371, 380 [328 P.2d 259].) Thus, in <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>91 Cal. 518, 522 [27 P. 755], where a promissory note provided for payment of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee if the note was collected by suit, it was held that the amount properly to be allowed for such fee was \u201ca special damage, expressly authorized by the contract to be recovered <em>in addition to general damages.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Similarly, attorney\u2019s fees have been allowed in suits for damages brought pursuant to lease agreements. (See <em>Challenge-Cook Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 536 [64 Cal.Rptr. 239], an action to recover accrued rentals and damages for withholding possession; <em>Erbe Corp. </em>v. <em>W &amp; B Realty Co., </em>255 Cal.App.2d 773 [63 Cal.Rptr. 462], an action for unlawful detainer and treble damages; <em>Wiese </em>v. <em>Steinauer, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 651 [20 Cal.Rptr. 295], an action to recover rent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 713, 718 [209 P.2d 854], although the particular contractual provision is not quoted, the court permitted plaintiff to recover attorney\u2019s fees in an action for damages for breach, of contract, stating: \u201cIn the present case the parties contracted for reasonable counsel fees ... in enforcement of the terms of the agreement. That language does not appear to be ambiguous. \u2019 \u2019  We think the language used in the contract before us is likewise free from ambiguity and clearly contemplates the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Our conclusion that this was a suit to enforce the contract is not affected by the fact that the damages sought and proved were for consequential damages to plaintiff\u2019s building, caused by defendant\u2019s poor workmanship in performing the contract. It may be that plaintiff would have been able to prove that his damages were tortiously caused, thus eliminating any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>necessity for proving the existence of a contract. (Compare <em>Eads </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>39 Cal.2d 807, 810-812 [249 P.2d 257] with <em>L. B. Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>39 Cal.2d 56, 61-63 [244 P.2d 385].) It may also be that for purposes not involved in this action, plaintiff\u2019s suit might be characterized as ex delicto, rather than ex contractu. The true question is whether the contractual provision for attorney\u2019s fees should be interpreted to cover an action such as this, which from the filing of the complaint until the formulation of issues at pretrial and then all the way through the trial itself, was treated by all parties as being one for the enforcement and vindication of a right to damages arising out of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The judgment is reversed, with directions that the \u25a0 trial court determine the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as a part of plaintiff\u2019s damages,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance therewith, and enter the appropriate judgment in accordance with the findings and conclusions thus amended. <em>(Cirimele </em>v. <em>Shinazy, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 46, 53 [268 P.2d 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Kaus, P. J., and Reppy, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">On April 23, 1969, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> On June 6, 1968, section 1717 was added to the Civil Code. It provides: \u201cIn any action on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the provisions of such contract, shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether he is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to costs and necessary disbursements. [ If ] Attorney\u2019s fees provided for by this section shall not be subject to waiver by the parties to any contract which is entered into after the effective date of this section. Any provision in any such contract which provides for a waiver of attorney\u2019s fees is void. [ 1\u00cd ] As used in this section \u2018prevailing party\u2019 means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> We have been asked to make a finding as to the value of the fees. There is insufficient evidence before us to warrant our applying Code of Civil Procedure section 956a, as was done in <em>Boller </em>v. <em>Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>230 Cal.App.2d 648 [41 Cal.Rptr. 206]; hence the matter is remanded to the trial court, which is in a better position than we to measure' and assess the value of such services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
