The information also alleged that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>offenses. Defendant pleaded not guilty and waived Ms right to trial by jury. Defendant was adjudged guilty of robbery in the first degree as to both counts. The court found that the defendant was not armed with a deadly weapon at the time of' the commission of the offenses. The court ordered that the defendant be committed to the California Youth Authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Briefly, defendant and a companion robbed a man and his wife. Defendant took the man\u2019s wallet, and his companion took the wife\u2019s purse. There is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion of the court that the offenses were committee! by means of force or fear. Further exposition of the facts relative to either count is unnecessary since the issues presented on appeal are unrelated to the actual commission of the offenses involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Defendant contends that he did not effectively waive his right to trial by jury because the nature of the right and the implications of its waiver were not explained to him. The answer to this contention requires reference to the reporter\u2019s transcript of the waiver proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The thrust of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ant\u2019s argument is that the waiver was deficient because the court did not inform him that the jury had to reach a unanimous verdict. Not only had defendant previously discussed the question of jury wavier with his counsel, but he was specifically and unequivocally told in open court that in a jury trial, 12 citizens would decide his innocence or guilt, whereas in a court trial, the judge alone would make the decision.  All that is required to establish a valid waiver is that defendant, by use of language in open court, personally and expressly relinquish his right to trial by jury in a manner leaving no question of misinterpretation, doubt, or uneertainy. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Lookadoo, </em>66 Cal.2d 307, 311 [57 Cal.Rptr. 608, 425 P.2d 208]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>269 Cal.App.2d 327, 330-331 [74 Cal.Rptr. 617].)  Here, the record clearly and affirmatively establishes a knowledgeable waiver by defendant after having the full benefit of discussing the matter with his counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 734, 741 [29 Cal.Rptr. 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"> Defendant next contends that the prosecution and conviction of two counts of robbery placed him in double jeopardy and constituted multiple punishment in violation of Penal Code section 654. There is no merit to either of these contentions. Double jeopardy has reference to multiple prosecutions for the same offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>246 Cal.App. 2d 594 [54 Cal.Rptr. 777].) Here, there has been only one trial, and hence double jeopardy cannot exist since there has been no prior determination which placed defendant in jeopardy for the same offense. (Pen. Code, \u00a71023.)  As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to the contention of multiple punishment, where a defendant participated in the simultaneous robbery of two separate victims, the law is clear that two separate criminal acts or omissions occurred. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654; <em>In re Hayes, </em>70 Cal.2d 604 [75 Cal.Rptr. 790, 451 P.2d 430] (Decided March 17, 1969, S.Ct. Cr. No. 11647); <em>People </em>v. <em>Tideman, </em>57 Cal.2d 574 [21 Cal.Rptr. 207, 370 P.2d 1007] ; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>55 Cal.2d 11 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].)  Moreover, in the present case, defendant was committed to the Youth Authority.  In California, commitment to the Youth Authority is not the equivalent of a sentence to state prison for punishment of a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilkens, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 823, 829 [60 Cal.Rptr. 49]; <em>In re Keller, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 520 [42 Cal.Rptr. 921]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zaccaria, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 787 [31 Cal.Rptr. 383].) Hence, Penal Code section 654, which says that \u201c [a]n act or omission <em>which is made punishable in different ways </em>by different provisions of the code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be <em>punished </em>under more than one, ...\u201d (italics added), does not apply where commitment is in accordance with the provisions of section 1731.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   We do not suppose that defendant is receiving two concurrent \u201ctreatments\u201d or that, if he is, he is in a position to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Kaus, P.
