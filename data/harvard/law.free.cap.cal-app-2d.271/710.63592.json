J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au0F\">Brunswick filed a complaint at 2:11 p.m. on September 29, 1967 in the San Diego Superior Court to recover possession of bowling equipment, immediately gave the sheriff an affidavit, undertaking and endorsement for claim and delivery, under Code of Civil Procedure, sections 510-512, and directed the sheriff to take possession of the equipment. Appellants filed an answer to the complaint at 4:47 pm. that afternoon, before the sheriff seized the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">When the sheriff refused to take possession of the equipment Brunswick brought this mandamus proceeding requiring him to do so. From a judgment favoring Brunswick the intervening parties in possession of the bowling equipment have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">The sole issue involves the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure, section 509, particularly the words \u201cclaim the delivery,\u201d which provides: \u201cThe plaintiff in an action to recover the possession of personal property may, at the time of issuing the summons, or at any time before answer, <em>claim the delivery </em>of such property to him as provided in this chapter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>To be effective before answer, does \u201cclaim the delivery\u201d require the sheriff to actually seize or take possession of personal property, as contended by appellants ? Or is it sufficient, as contended by Brunswick, to have the necessary papers placed with the sheriff? We hold Brunswick\u2019s contention is correct. Brunswick claimed the delivery of the equipment before appellants answered. The superior court, therefore, properly entered judgment requiring the sheriff to take possession of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">That claim the delivery is different from and does not encompass seizure or taking possession is apparent when viewed in the context of the entire chapter on \u201cClaim and Delivery of Personal Property\u201d in the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 510 provides for the content of the affidavit \u201cWhere a delivery is claimed.\u201d Sections 511 and 512 provide for <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>seizure of claimed property \u2019 \u2019; after the plaintiff claims delivery, the \u201cofficer must forthwith take the property . . . and retain it in his custody.\u201d Section 514 provides for \u201cdelivery of the property to the plaintiff\u201d and the method by which a defendant may obtain its return; section 518 also provides for custody of property seized and delivery to the party entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The trial court reasoned: section 509 provides the plaintiff may at the time of issuing the summons claim the delivery of the property; if \u201cclaim the delivery\u201d means, as contended by appellants, the actual seizure of the property by the sheriff, this could not be done \u201cat the time of issuing the summons,\u201d and that portion of the statute would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The matter is now clearly settled by <em>American Machine &amp; Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Pitchess, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 490 [68 Cal.Rptr. 814], where the court, on similar procedural facts, aptly concluded: \u201c. . . a plaintiff has claimed the delivery of personal property within the meaning of the provisions of chapter 2, part 2, title 7 (\u00a7\u00a7 509-521) of the Code of Civil Procedure when he has made the affidavit required by section 510 thereof; has indorsed the affidavit as required by section 511 thereof; has obtained the written undertaking as required by section 512 thereof, and has delivered these documents to the officer charged with the duty of taking possession of the personal property at any time before the filing of the answer, and that the filing of the answer after such delivery and before the officer takes physical possession or exercises dominion and control over the property does not preclude the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>from taking the property under the mandate of section 512 of the Code of Civil Procedure. To hold otherwise would sanction the destruction of plaintiff\u2019s right to the provisional remedy afforded him by the law in such cases where the officer charged with the duty to seize the property, for whatever reason connected with the conduct of his office, was unable to forthwith take the property, or where from dilatory tactics on his part he failed to act forthwith, before answer. To hold otherwise would also permit a defendant, who had knowledge of the claim for delivery, to sequester the property for a sufficient time to enable him to file his answer before seizure and thus, by his fraud, defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to the provisional remedy.\u201d (P.494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
