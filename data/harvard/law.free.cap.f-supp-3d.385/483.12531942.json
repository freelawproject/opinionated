To aid in disaster relief, Congress appropriated funds that were administered through the Community Development Block Grant Program of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and distributed to state governments.\n   <em>\n    In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consol.

Oct. 24, 2011). Louisiana created the Road Home program to disburse these funds to homeowners in the form of grants to compensate them up to $150,000 for structural damages caused by the storms.\n   <em>\n    In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consol.

Individual recipients of grant money must likewise reimburse the State insofar as they subsequently receive insurance payments or other payments for losses covered by their Road Home grants. To the extent that the State recovers funds pursuant to these Agreements, the State recycles such funds within the Road Home Program. As part of the closing process, the Road Home program requires that individual recipients execute the Road Home Limited Subrogation/Assignment Agreement (\"Agreement\") in which the recipient promises to pay back any Road Home funds that are duplicated through other sources, such as through insurance payments for building coverage. The recipient further assigns the right to such duplicate funds to the State, and further agrees to provide notice to the State if he/she chooses to \"abandon, dismiss, or release the claims against [his/her] insurance company...to allow the State to individually pursue recovery of the rights which have been assigned to the State herein.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202425\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Calogero's home in Slidell, Louisiana, was significantly damaged by the storms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 11, 2007, Calogero entered into a contract with the OCD to receive a Road Home grant in the amount of $33,392.68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[I]n consideration of receipt of all Grant\n   proceeds as compensation for damages incurred by [Calogero] due to the Hurricanes,\" she agreed to contractual covenants pertaining to alienation and use of the property, maintenance of flood insurance, and other items.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Calogero also agreed to repay to the State any additional funds she received from her insurance company or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") for damage to the property caused by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita in the amount by which her Road Home grant would have been reduced if she had received those payments prior to receiving the grant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 9, 2018, Defendants sent Calogero a letter informing her that they represented the OCD in an effort to retrieve Road Home grant overpayments, and that she owed $4,598.89 to the State because she received more in total insurance proceeds than the amount used to calculate her grant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 5, 2018, Calogero disputed the alleged overpayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 10, 2018, Defendants sent a letter to Calogero's counsel explaining that Calogero initially reported to OCD $5,200 in FEMA payments and $14,733.29 in homeowners' insurance proceeds for structural damage, which amounts were used to calculate Calogero's Road Home grant. OCD later learned that Calogero actually received $10,500 from FEMA and $16,003.14 in structural damage insurance proceeds from her insurer, resulting in variances of FEMA benefits and insurance benefits used to calculate her Road Home grant in the amounts of $5,300 and $1,269.85, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, after accounting for a $1,970.96 credit in the lack-of-flood-insurance penalty, OCD calculated that Calogero's Road Home grant should have been $28,793.79, rather than the $33,392.68 she received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 16, 2018, Calogero filed this action alleging that Defendants violated the FDCPA because the collection letter did not inform her both that the alleged debt is prescribed and thus unenforceable, and that any repayment would restart the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Calogero contends that, by administering the Road Home program to distribute federal funds, the OCD acted as a federal agency and any action to recover overpayments is subject to a six-year statute of limitations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202425\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Calogero argues that the overpayment debt is unenforceable and Defendants' collection letter violated the FDCPA by falsely (according to her) implying that OCD could sue her for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Calogero also asserts that the letter misrepresented the nature of her alleged debt because it stated that the entire $4,598.89 Road Home grant overpayment was due to unreported insurance proceeds, when only $1,269,85 of that amount was in unreported insurance proceeds,\n   whereas the rest was unreported payments from FEMA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PENDING MOTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Calogero's individual and class FDCPA claims arguing that the FDCPA is inapplicable because Calogero's obligation to repay the overpayment on her Road Home grant is not a debt as defined by the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that the money was disaster compensation intended to help recipients expeditiously rebuild their homes after Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita, and that it \"would never have to be repaid unless: a) the grant recipient was determined to have not been eligible for the Grant; b) the terms of compliance set forth in the contractual agreements were not met; or c) the amount of the Grant was determined to have been calculated in error based on information available at the time of the Grant disbursement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants point out that there were no contractual interest or late charges, and the obligations assumed by the grant recipients, such as Calogero, were to ensure that the money was used appropriately, not to create either a promise to repay the funds or consumer debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the FDCPA is not applicable to Defendants' attempts to collect the $4,598.89 in Road Home overpayments that Calogero owes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants further argue that it is irrelevant that they included in the collection letter language required by the FDCPA because using such language does not of itself render applicable the FDCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Calogero counters that her obligation to repay the alleged overpayment is a debt under the FDCPA because it arose from the consumer transaction of her entering into the Road Home contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As required by the FDCPA, the funds received were meant for \"personal, family or household purposes\" - in this case, repairs for structural damage to Calogero's home.

Rather, OCD granted to Calogero money to repair her home - money that Calogero would never be obligated to repay unless she broke one of the covenants or received an overpayment. The FDCPA's application is limited to the recovery of debts incurred as a result of transactions for the consumption of consumer goods and services. OCD's grant of funds to a hurricane victim that elicited a promise from the recipient to return funds to which she was never entitled is not such a transaction.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orenbuch v.

Oppenheim transferred the funds to his personal bank account. A few weeks later, PayPal discovered that the buyer's payment was fraudulent and requested that Oppenheim refund the money to PayPal pursuant to the user agreement that allows PayPal to reverse a transaction in such a situation. Oppenheim refused and PayPal hired I.C. Systems, Inc. (\"I.C. Systems\"), a collection service, which repeatedly called Oppenheim in an attempt to collect the funds. Oppenheim sued I.C. Systems under the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073131\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/833/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073131\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/833/\">\n    at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court did not hold that just any contractual obligation to repay constitutes a debt under the FDCPA. Instead, the court held that there was a qualifying\n   transaction that gave rise to the consumer debt in that case. As stated above, Calogero did not incur any consumer debt by purchasing any goods or services from OCD; instead she received grant monies, and the obligation to repay arose as a result of the overpayment of the grant funds to which Calogero was never entitled. The overpayment of the Road Home grant funds is more like the overpaid salary the court in\n   <em>\n    Orenbuch\n   </em>\n   concluded was not a debt for purposes of the FDCPA, than it is like the quintessential consumer credit transaction at issue in\n   <em>\n    Oppenheim\n   </em>\n   .
