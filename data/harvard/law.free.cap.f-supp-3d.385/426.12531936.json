Eventually, ALJ Pankow issued an Unfavorable Decision in May of 2014. Of relevance to this case, ALJ Pankow determined that Babyak had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform sedentary work with certain limitations. (R. 48) Thereafter, Babyak filed the pending claim, asserting a disability onset of September 29, 2016, her 50\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   birthday. (R. 13)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Babyak submitted a Pre-Hearing Memorandum in this action urging that, in light of the prior determination that she was limited to sedentary work combined with her age, the Medical-Vocational Grids directed a finding of disability. (R. 204) Following a videoconference hearing, which both Babyak and a vocational expert attended, ALJ Perry-Dowell denied benefits. Babyak seeks judicial review of that denial of her claim for a period of disability, for disability insurance benefits (\"DIB\"), and for supplemental security income (\"SSI\"). Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Docket\n   Nos. 11 and 13.

(R. 16) The ALJ also determined that Babyak suffered from several severe impairments. Specifically, the ALJ found that Babyak has: asthma ; degenerative disc disease ; degenerative joint disease ; Type II diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral neuropathy ; coronary artery disease ; and obesity. (R. 16) Those impairments, or a combination thereof, however, do not meet or equal one of those listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. (R. 16-17) Further, the ALJ concluded that Babyak had the RFC to perform light work with a number of limitations. Additionally, the ALJ found that, although she was unable to return to her past work, considering Babyak's age, education, work experience, and RFC,\n   there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy which Babyak could perform. (R. 20-21) Accordingly, the ALJ denied benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) Collateral Estoppel - Res Judicata\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Babyak urges that ALJ Perry-Dowell erred in failing to give\n   <em>\n    collateral-estoppel / res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect to the residual functional capacity assessment made by Judge Pankow in the earlier case.
