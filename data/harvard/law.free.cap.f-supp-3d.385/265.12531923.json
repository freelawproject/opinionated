SCHOFIELD, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns an alleged fraudulent scheme to promote certain third-party companies offering multi-level marketing and training programs. The Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") asserts racketeering and conspiracy claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"RICO\"). The Complaint also asserts various state law claims. Defendants Donald J. Trump (\"Trump\"), The Trump Corporation, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump move to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As discussed below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part. The RICO claims are dismissed because the Complaint does not sufficiently plead that Defendants' conduct was the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' losses. Defendants' motion to dismiss the state law claims is denied because the Court has subject matter jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (\"CAFA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Complaint and are accepted as true only for purposes of this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Columbia Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055185\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/46/#p48\">\n    831 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (2d Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Promotion of Third-Party Companies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For over a decade, Defendants operated a complex enterprise through which they promoted third-party companies offering consumer-facing business opportunities and training programs. The companies included two \"multi-level marketing\" programs, ACN Opportunity, LLC (\"ACN\") and TTN, LLC (d/b/a \"The Trump Network\"), and a \"live-seminar program,\" Business Strategies Group, LLC (d/b/a \"The Trump Institute\") (collectively, the \"Third-Party Programs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2005, Defendants agreed to promote and endorse ACN. ACN is a company offering products and services through independent salespeople known as \"Independent Business Owners,\" or \"IBOs.\" In order to sell these products and services, IBOs must pay an initial sign-up fee and an annual renewal fee. From 2013 until 2016, these fees were $499 and $149, respectively. IBOs can earn commissions for selling ACN products and services, and can receive additional bonuses when they meet certain sales targets. IBOs can also earn money by recruiting others to sign up as IBOs. When an existing IBO recruits a new IBO, the recruit becomes part of the existing IBO's \"downline,\" and the existing IBO becomes part of the recruit's \"upline.\" IBOs can receive a commission on the sales generated by members of their downline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Key to ACN's recruiting operation are small group events hosted by IBOs in their own homes or at local hotels and event spaces. These meetings are the primary mechanism through which consumers are recruited to become IBOs. ACN also stages ticketed multi-day events, often billed as \"Training Events\" or \"International Conventions.\" These events function as motivational rallies and are a substantial source of revenue for ACN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In exchange for financial inducements that were never disclosed to the public, Defendants promoted and endorsed ACN in promotional videos, in print and online media, at ACN events and in episodes of\n   <em>\n    The Celebrity Apprentice\n   </em>\n   , a television program hosted by Trump that featured Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. Through these channels, Defendants deliberately misled consumers regarding the nature of ACN's business. First, Defendants misled consumers into believing that ACN offered a reasonable probability of commercial success. Defendants accomplished this by misrepresenting (a) the risk inherent in the ACN business opportunity, (b) the profitability to consumers of the ACN business opportunity and multi-level marketing programs in general and (c) the market for ACN's products and services. Second, Trump falsely represented that the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   he supported ACN was because it offered a reasonable probability of commercial success. He never disclosed that he was being paid millions of dollars for his endorsement. Third, Defendants falsely represented that Trump's endorsement was predicated on appropriate due diligence,\n   inside information and personal experience with ACN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ACN's association with Trump and the Trump brand was \"extremely powerful in the minds of investors.\" In published testimonials, \"IBOs attributed their decision to join ACN to Trump's endorsement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ACN was not the only third-party company to be promoted and endorsed by Defendants. In the mid-2000s, a company affiliated with Defendants, Trump University, LLC, entered into a licensing agreement with Business Strategies Group, LLC to form \"The Trump Institute.\" The Trump Institute was a live-seminar program that purported to teach Trump's \"secrets to success\" in the real estate industry. In 2009, Defendants entered into a licensing agreement with Ideal Health, a multi-level marketing company. Pursuant to this agreement, Ideal Health was officially rebranded \"The Trump Network.\" As they had done with ACN, Defendants disseminated a series of knowingly false statements regarding The Trump Institute and The Trump Network: (1) that the programs offered consumers a reasonable probability of commercial success, (2) that Trump endorsed the programs\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they offered a reasonable probability of commercial success and (3) that Trump's endorsements were predicated on extensive due diligence, inside information and personal experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Investments in ACN\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff Doe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Doe, a citizen of California, was invited to attend her first ACN meeting by a friend who told her that the company \"was a great opportunity for them both to make money.\" At the meeting, a promotional video prominently featuring Trump was played. It was Trump's endorsement of ACN that \"sold [Doe] on the opportunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Doe paid the $499 sign-up fee to become an IBO. Shortly thereafter, senior IBOs told Doe that attending an ACN convention in Palm Springs \"would be a great way to begin her career with ACN,\" and they implied that Trump would make an appearance. Doe decided to attend the convention for several reasons, but the most important reason was that she wanted to meet Trump. At the Palm Springs convention, Trump was prominently featured, but he did not appear in person. Doe's cumulative expenses from the convention totaled almost $1,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the convention, Doe remained fully committed to ACN. Senior IBOs told her that she had to attend ACN meetings in order to be successful. Each meeting cost $20, and Doe often attended two meetings per month. Doe felt \"substantial pressure\" to attend these meetings, which often caused her to miss shifts at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Approximately six months after she signed up as an IBO, Doe attended a national ACN convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Senior IBOs told Doe that the convention \"could not be missed,\" emphasizing \"the community, the training and, importantly, that Trump might be there as a special guest.\" Doe's total investment in attending the Cleveland convention was approximately $2,000. Doe also attended a multi-day event in Detroit, Michigan, again investing substantial amounts of money to attend in the hopes of seeing or meeting Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Trump's support for ACN -- including specific statements touting ACN -- had encouraged Doe to join and persevere with ACN. But eventually, during her second year as an IBO, Doe came to the realization that ACN did not provide average IBOs a realistic chance of making a profit. Doe cut her losses and ceased to participate in ACN. She had earned only $38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff Loe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Loe, a citizen of California, was invited to attend an informational meeting about ACN by a co-worker at the Salvation Army. The meeting was held at a hotel in Los Angeles, and began with short speeches by ACN representatives, followed by a promotional video prominently featuring Trump. Trump's endorsement \"was the key factor\" that induced Loe to join ACN. When he joined and while he was associated with ACN, Loe heard and relied on specific statements from Trump, which are detailed in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Loe had very limited success with ACN. During his time with ACN, he was able to recruit only one other IBO. Loe sold ACN services to friends, in one instance registering services in his own name for a friend who promised to pay him back, but who never did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Loe attended twenty-five to thirty ACN meetings, each one costing $10 to $20. Loe felt \"substantial pressure\" to attend these meetings, and when he missed one \"he was criticized and shunned by more senior IBOs.\" Loe also attended three larger ACN events -- the national convention in Cleveland and two multi-day events in Palm Springs and Detroit. Loe borrowed money from his team members to attend these events, \"hopeful that if he continued investing in pursuing the ACN business opportunity he would ultimately recoup his initial investment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But Loe ultimately concluded that ACN \"was not a good moneymaking opportunity.\" When the time came for his annual renewal, he chose not to pay the renewal fee. Despite his efforts, Loe never received any income from ACN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff Roe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff Roe, a citizen of Maryland, learned about ACN from an IBO who told him that \"he had a business opportunity for him.\" The IBO showed Roe an ACN magazine and gave Roe his ACN business card. Two weeks later, Roe called the number on the business card, and the IBO sent Roe \"an informational video that boasted of the lifestyle ACN would provide.\" The IBO convinced Roe to join an online conference with IBOs and potential recruits. After the online conference, the IBO pressed Roe to sign up, but Roe said that he would have to think about it. The IBO then invited Roe to attend an ACN convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Roe decided to do additional research on ACN. In his research, he came across an online video of Trump and Ivanka Trump promoting ACN. Trump's statements were the \"turning point .... Roe believed that by promoting the company, the Trumps were telling others that they too could make money and become successful business owners like him by investing in ACN.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Roe attended the convention and was excited about the opportunity offered by ACN. The IBO continued to call Roe to recruit him, but the $499 sign-up fee was financially out of reach. Roe was finally able to afford the fee after winning $300 at a casino and $200 from a lottery ticket. The IBO who recruited Roe became his mentor, and during his first month with ACN the IBO \"repeatedly called him and would always give him an ACN motivational speech.\" When he was recruited and during his time with ACN, Roe heard and relied on specific statements by Trump, which are detailed in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In March 2017, Roe began to suspect that ACN was a scam. Roe realized that he was not making any money, and that Trump's statements about ACN were false. Roe did not renew his ACN registration and his account was terminated. He did not recover any of the money that he invested in ACN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiff Moe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff Moe, a citizen of Pennsylvania, signed up as an IBO in April 2013. Moe's niece introduced Moe to ACN and invited her to an ACN award ceremony. Soon after arriving at the ceremony, it became clear to Moe that the main purpose of the event was to recruit IBOs. The organizers of the event played a five-minute promotional video that prominently featured Trump. After watching this video, \"Moe knew that she was going to sign up for ACN.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As an IBO, Moe attended ACN meetings in order \"to widen her network and continue to develop her skills.\" Meetings occurred almost every weekend and cost between $5 and $10 to attend. At the meetings, organizers would remind IBOs of Trump's involvement with and endorsement of ACN. Moe also attended four extended weekend seminars that cost $49 to $69. Moe believed the senior IBOs who told her that these meetings were \"important and necessary for her success.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During her second year as an IBO, Moe paid the registration fee for the national ACN convention in Los Angeles, believing that \"attending the convention was necessary for her to succeed.\" After paying the fee, however, it became clear that the costs of attending the convention would be too high, and she decided not to attend. In December 2014, \"Moe realized that she was not going to make any money in ACN,\" and she declined to renew her membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The loss amount is necessarily each Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    net\n   </em>\n   loss, rather than gross expenditures.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 903 cmt. a (1979) (\"When there has been harm only to the pecuniary interests of a person, compensatory damages are designed to place him in a position substantially equivalent in a pecuniary way to that which he would have occupied had no tort been committed.\") Accordingly, the Complaint seeks to certify a \"Nationwide Damages Class\" of individuals who suffered net monetary losses from their association with ACN -- \"all persons and entities who invested in, subscribed to or made payments to ACN ... or its affiliates, but did not recoup an amount equal to or [greater] than those payments from ACN.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The loss for purposes of analyzing causation is therefore determined by reference to both amounts\n   Plaintiffs paid to ACN, and the revenues, if any, that Plaintiffs received through it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Complaint fails to plead proximate causation because it does not allege a direct relation between Defendants' conduct and Plaintiffs' losses. Numerous intervening factors may account for Plaintiffs' inability to recover their investments in ACN. Plaintiffs' lack of success could be attributable to the inherent challenges of multi-level marketing, Plaintiffs' capabilities as salespeople and the extent of Plaintiffs' existing networks to whom Plaintiffs could sell ACN products and recruit new IBOs. The losses may also be attributable to the market for ACN products in the Plaintiffs' localities and ACN's business practices -- legitimate or otherwise -- separate from Defendants' role. These factors, contributing in whole or part to Plaintiffs' losses, make the question of Defendants' responsibility the sort of \"intricate, uncertain inquir[y]\" that the proximate cause requirement is intended to avert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    547 U.S. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The absence of a direct relation in this case can be illustrated by the following hypothetical. Suppose that two class members each paid $1,000 to ACN in registration fees and expenses, induced to invest by Defendants' endorsements. The class members are identical in all respects except for one -- Class Member A earned $700 in revenue from participating in ACN, but Class Member B earned only $200. As to each class member, what is the loss attributable to the Defendants' conduct? As the loss is the extent to which Plaintiffs did not recover their investments in ACN, conceivably Defendants could be charged with having caused a $300 loss to Class Member A and an $800 loss to Class Member B. Yet, if Plaintiffs' inability to recover their investments is attributable to their own sales capabilities or the extent of their existing networks, this would unmoor the loss from the Defendants' conduct. The $500 difference in Defendants' liability to Class Member A and Class Member B could not be imputed to anything that\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n   did, contravening the principle \"that the compensable injury flowing from a RICO violation necessarily is the harm caused by the predicate acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Hemi Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/#p9\">\n    559 U.S. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/#p9\">\n    130 S.Ct. 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/#p9\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/#p9\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582176\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/1/#p9\">\n    130 S.Ct. 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (proximate cause lacking when \"the conduct giving rise to the fraud\" is distinct from \"the conduct directly causing the harm\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is also unclear whether Defendants were the direct cause of Plaintiffs' payments to ACN.

Plaintiff Loe attended his first ACN meeting at the behest of a co-worker. As an IBO, he too paid to attend meetings, and when he missed meetings he was \"criticized and shunned.\" An IBO sent Plaintiff Roe a recruitment video \"that boasted of the lifestyle ACN would provide.\" The IBO pressured Roe to invest on multiple occasions, and once Roe did, the IBO would repeatedly call him to give \"ACN motivational speech[es].\" Plaintiff Moe was introduced to ACN by a family member.
