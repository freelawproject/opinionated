Dolan's grievance stems from JetBlue's undisclosed receipt of a portion of the fee that is charged for the insurance. Dolan sets forth four counts: a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (count one); unjust enrichment (count two); and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (count three) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (count four). JetBlue seeks dismissal of the complaint on several bases: (1) the Airline Deregulation Act preempts Dolan's state-law claims; (2) the McCarran-Ferguson Act bars Dolan's two RICO claims; (3) and, for various reasons, all four counts fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After careful review, the Court is largely unpersuaded by JetBlue's arguments and therefore\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   its motion to dismiss\n   <strong>\n    in large part, granting it to a limited extent\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 32\n   </strong>\n   ), as set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the process of purchasing airline tickets on JetBlue's website, consumers\n   are presented with an opportunity to purchase a trip insurance policy from an independent, third-party insurance company. Unbeknownst to the customer, however, JetBlue, in coordination with various third-party insurance entities, ultimately retains what Dolan characterizes as a kickback from every policy sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Dolan, JetBlue dupes its customers into believing the amounts paid for the insurance are a pass-through charge. The airline masks its own financial interest in the purchase of the insurance by identifying other parties as the producers and providers of the policies, failing to mention its own role as also acting as an insurance agent and receiving commissions. JetBlue also informs purchasers that the insurance is \"[r]ecommended by AGA Service Company, the licensed producer and administrator of this plan\" which is \"underwritten by Jefferson Insurance Company or BCS Insurance Company.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 27, ECF No. 17, 7 (emphasis in original omitted).) In completing the purchase, consumers are informed, \"By purchasing, you agree to Allianz Global Assistance's purchase agreement and privacy policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38 (emphasis in original omitted).) JetBlue also itemizes the cost of the insurance, separate from the cost of the ticket being purchased and confirmation of the transaction is sent separately from Allianz. All these representations and acts, says Dolan, further enhance the notion that the charge for the policy is entirely passed through to the insurance entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Dolan points out, the illegality of the scheme is demonstrated by a number of aspects of the operation. First, while JetBlue receives commissions from each policy sold, it has no license to actually do so. Second, there is no correlation between the actual insurance risk that is being underwritten and the policy cost. Third, the third-party insurance entities submit false filings to various state regulators to hide JetBlue's unlicensed commissions and to misstate how consumers are charged. And, lastly, the funds that are routed back to JetBlue are disguised as \"marketing\" or \"advertising\" fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dolan seeks to represent a nationwide class of consumers who purchased trip insurance policies while buying airline tickets on JetBlue's website. She seeks relief through FDUTPA, common-law unjust enrichment, and RICO. Her FDUTPA claim is based on monetary losses occasioned by JetBlue's receipt of funds paid to it as a result of its deceptive conduct. Her unjust-enrichment claim is premised on JetBlue's receipt of money through its deceptive representations and brokering insurance without a license. And her RICO claims are based on the scheme to defraud executed by JetBlue and the third-party insurance entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

JetBlue's argument is premised on its insistence that the complaint frames the offering of trip insurance, through JetBlue's website, as relating to the provision of the \"service of an air carrier.\" As explained by the Eleventh Circuit, though, \"three elements must be present for a particular service to be deemed a 'service' for purposes of the ADA.\"\n   <em>\n    Amerijet Intern., Inc. v.

Providing a mechanism whereby consumers can insure airline-ticket purchases through a third party is not unique or limited to the airline industry. Furthermore, if anything, from the face of the complaint, it appears JetBlue's offering of trip insurance merely serves to extract extra revenue for the airline from customers who have already decided to purchase a ticket; there is nothing in the record that substantiates JetBlue's contention that the ability to purchase trip insurance during booking \"attract[s] consumers\" who would not otherwise choose to fly on JetBlue. (Def.'s Reply at 4.) Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded by JetBlue's argument that Dolan's state-law claims should be dismissed as preempted by the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. McCarran-Ferguson Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   JetBlue next focuses on the McCarran-Ferguson Act and Dolan's RICO claims. According to JetBlue, Dolan's RICO claims are based on allegations that JetBlue is brokering insurance without a license, failing to disclose it is acting as an agent or broker, and improperly collecting a commission on those insurance transactions. (Def.'s Mot. at 7.) As alleged, these activities, says JetBlue, are regulated by various Florida insurance statutes: Florida Statutes sections 626.112, 626.9521, and 626.9531. Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act then, according to JetBlue, Dolan's RICO claims are barred because RICO affords her relief that would otherwise be unavailable to her under Florida law. Dolan, in opposition, argues, first, that none of the conduct alleged in her complaint relates to the business of insurance and, second, even if it did, applying RICO in this case would not in any way invalidate, impair, or supersede Florida insurance law. As such, says Dolan, McCarran-Ferguson would not bar her RICO claims. As far as its argument goes, the Court agrees with JetBlue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As set forth in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \"[t]he business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201012\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The act thus bars the application of federal law where three requirements are met: \"(1) the federal statute at issue does not specifically relate to the business of insurance; (2) the state statute at issue was enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance; and (3) application of the federal statute would invalidate, impair, or supersede the state statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Fla. Nov. 19, 2002) (Gold, J.) (\"the Florida Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act [ ] was 'enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' as enumerated by the United States Supreme Court, and thus meets the second requirement for McCarran-Ferguson preemption\"). Where the parties' positions diverge, rather, is whether: (1) the complained of conduct within Dolan's RICO claims is part of the \"business of insurance\" within the meaning of the act\n   and (2) the application of RICO here would \"invalidate, impair, or supersede\" the Florida Statute provisions at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dolan insists the alleged conduct \"plainly do[es] not relate to the business of insurance.\" (Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 39, 23.) Her position, however, is directly undercut by the very allegations set forth in her complaint. For example, within her allegations specific to her RICO claim, Dolan describes JetBlue's \"role in the sale of trip insurance policies on its website [as] materially equivalent to that of an insurance agent or broker\" and that JetBlue receives \"a commission or kickback for each trip insurance policy sold.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 115, 117, 119 (\"JetBlue ... is acting as an insurance agent\").) Dolan repeatedly describes the illegality of JetBlue's commissions: JetBlue \"is prohibited from receiving commissions stemming from sales of travel insurance policies\" because it \"lacks a license to conduct the business of insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 110, 119 (describing JetBlue as an \"unlicensed agent\"), 120 (\"JetBlue is not a licensed agent in any state\").) In further support of her RICO claim, Dolan alleges \"Allianz, BCS and Jefferson committed ... mail and wire fraud by submitting fraudulent documents to state regulators [which] failed to disclose the illegal payment of commissions to JetBlue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112, 119.) In her general allegations, Dolan alleges JetBlue \"attempts to hide its role in the travel insurance program through false statements\" because it \"knows it lacks the required license to transact the business of insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.) Her common allegations also repeatedly point to the fact that \"JetBlue is ... acting as an unlicensed insurance agent and/or broker, receiving insurance commissions to which it has no legal entitlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30, 40 (\"JetBlue plays the role of insurance producer\"), 41 (same), 46, 47, 48, 58.) Dolan also pointedly references \"Florida's prohibition of the unlicensed sale or brokerage of insurance, including the receipt of commissions by people or entities without a license.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) Dolan further points to the racketeering enterprise's submission of \"false filings to the various state regulators ... hid[ing] JetBlue's role in receiving unlicensed commission kickbacks and ... mistat[ing] how consumers are charged for these travel insurance policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) In the face of these unambiguous allegations, Dolan's persistent assertion that the alleged \"conduct is separate and distinct from any insurance activities and cannot be said to relate to the business of insurance\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 23) is simply untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Undeterred by the obstacle of her own allegations, Dolan points to the three criteria identified by the United States Supreme Court as being \"relevant in determining whether a particular practice is part of the 'business of insurance' \": (1) \"whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk\"; (2) \"whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured\"; and (3) \"whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Union Labor Life Ins.

Regarding these three criteria, Dolan argues, respectively, (1) \"JetBlue's concealment of its financial interest in trip insurance has nothing at all to do with spreading a consumer's risk of loss\"; (2) an \"undisclosed kickback is ... wholly unrelated to [the policy] relationship\"; and (3) \"JetBlue's undisclosed kickback is not limited to entities within the insurance industry.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 23-24.) Dolan's arguments land wide of the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To begin with, \"JetBlue's concealment of its financial interest in trip insurance\" and its receipt of an \"undisclosed kickback\" are\n   not the alleged activities JetBlue contends implicate McCarran-Ferguson. Instead, JetBlue's focus, with respect to its McCarran-Ferguson argument, is on Dolan's allegations (1) that JetBlue was acting as an insurance agent and accepting illegal commissions as an unlicensed agent; and (2) that, in furtherance of the RICO scheme, members of the enterprise submitted false regulatory insurance filings. The cases Dolan relies on, therefore, are inapposite: missing from those cases, but present here, are any allegations regarding the submission of false insurance filings and the defendant's acting as an unlicensed agent and accepting illegal commissions in that capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Group Life &amp; Health Ins.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   JetBlue points to Florida Statutes sections 626.112, 626.9521, and 626.9531, under Florida's Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act, as regulating the activities Dolan outlines in her complaint. Under section 626.112, one must be licensed in order to \"act as ... an insurance agent.\" Section 626.9521 prohibits a deceptive act or practice involving the business of insurance. And section 626.9531 dictates how insurance agents must identify themselves and their role in selling insurance. Fatal to Dolan's RICO claims, at least with\n   respect to her insurance-related allegations, is that none of these provisions affords a plaintiff a private right of action against a purported unlicensed agent who is selling insurance policies and Dolan does not otherwise identify any other state law that would afford a plaintiff such a right. To be sure, FUITPA allows certain private lawsuits-limited to suits against insurers who violate several specified provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.155\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing which provisions afford a plaintiff a private right of action, but only as against an insurer). Even these insurer suits, however, are themselves subject to various procedural and substantive restrictions: for example, Florida Statute section 625.155 contains a pre-suit notice requirement and also specifically prohibits class actions. The Court finds these limitations, taken together and in light of the alleged facts, express Florida's policy regarding private suits against violators of FUITPA: there is no private right of action-either under FUITPA or as otherwise identified by Dolan-arising out of non-insurer JetBlue's violation of the various provisions identified.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buell v.

Further hampering her argument here, Dolan has also not pointed to any other Florida statutory or common-law basis upon which her insurance-based RICO claims could be based. In short, Dolan fails to convince that applying RICO in the instant case, at least with respect to her insurance-based claims, would not impair Florida insurance law by affording her the opportunity to seek relief otherwise not available under any identified Florida law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kondell v.

While Dolan did herself no favors by turning a blind eye to all her insurance-centric allegations, JetBlue conversely overplayed its hand by failing to acknowledge that Dolan's allegations extend beyond insurance issues alone. In fact, much of Dolan's complaint centers on JetBlue's receipt of unearned, undisclosed, and, in fact, concealed, kickbacks and its alleged fraudulent representation that the price the consumer paid\n   was not grossly inflated by amounts received by JetBlue-allegations unrelated to any insurance-based claims. JetBlue does not argue that Dolan's RICO claims cannot survive without the allegations that are barred under McCarran-Ferguson. As a result, the Court only dismisses Dolan's RICO claims to the extent they rely on allegations that amount to FUITPA violations. To the extent her RICO claims are pleaded on other bases, as described above, they are, at least at this stage of the litigation, viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Once again the parties obscure the issue by narrowing their focuses to only the fraction of Dolan's allegations that support their respective positions and pretending as if no other allegations exist. The unwillingness of either party to realistically and in good faith evaluate their respective positions in this regard is counter-productive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite her dogged representation to the contrary, Dolan, in her complaint, and as set forth above, repeatedly supports her FDUTPA claim, at least in part, on JetBlue's illegal receipt of insurance commissions as an unlicensed broker.

Dolan has not rebutted JetBlue's arguments that these particular activities, as alleged, are violative of Florida Statutes sections 626.112, 626.9521, 626.9531, and 626.9541. Instead, she steadfastly maintains her \"FDUTPA claim is not predicated upon violations of any state insurance statutes.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 12.) Once again, Dolan's argument is directly belied by the allegations in her complaint.

In that case the defendant simply performed marketing services for a developer from whom the\n   plaintiffs there had purchased real property. Unlike here, the defendant there was not the actual conduit for the transaction at the center of the lawsuit. The relationship between the purchasers and the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Virgilio\n   </em>\n   was far more tenuous and indirect. Here, JetBlue was the direct conduit, actually facilitating the transaction itself. Also, in\n   <em>\n    Virgilio\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs' complaint stemmed from their claim that the defendant marketer \"failed to inform\" them about a nearby parcel that negatively affected the value of the plaintiffs' purchase. Here, in contrast, the allegations paint JetBlue as intimately involved with a scheme designed to extract unearned kickbacks and commissions from consumers who are deceived,\n   <em>\n    directly by JetBlue\n   </em>\n   , into thinking they are paying a pass-through fee, equal to the cost of the product they are actually buying. The reasons supporting the\n   <em>\n    Virgilio\n   </em>\n   court's dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim simply do not apply to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, the other two elements both flow naturally from the first element and the facts alleged in the complaint. Dolan alleges JetBlue voluntarily accepted and retained the amounts the insurer routed back to it. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. at \u00b6 2 (\"JetBlue retains or ultimately receives an undisclosed kickback from every policy sold.\").) Lastly, like the court found in\n   <em>\n    Zamber\n   </em>\n   , here too \"the circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for [JetBlue] to retain the money because it obtained the money through alleged deceptive acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Zamber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522607\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/1289/#p1300\">\n    282 F.

Thus \"even if [a] consumer is willing to pay the total price (with the overcharge) for the product or service,\" the misrepresentations or omissions related to the purported \"pass-through\" charge render the retention of the overcharge inequitable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522607\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/1289/#p1300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    E. RICO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Aside from the McCarran-Ferguson Act issues with Dolan's RICO claims, as addressed above in section 3.B., JetBlue also contends Dolan's \u00a7 1962(c) RICO claim fails for a number of other reasons as well: (1) a RICO claim cannot be premised on omissions unless the plaintiff establishes the defendant had a duty to disclose; (2) the allegations do not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards; (3) Dolan has not alleged proximate cause; (4) Dolan has not alleged the requisite injury to her business or property; and (5) Dolan has not adequately alleged an enterprise. For the most part, as set forth below, the Court is not persuaded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Dolan's RICO claim does not rest solely on JetBlue's failure to disclose how the insurance charge is ultimately distributed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court finds JetBlue's omissions argument misdirected. Dolan's complaint is not centered only on JetBlue's failure to disclose the alleged kickbacks it was receiving on each policy; rather much of her complaint focuses on how JetBlue's website presentation regarding trip insurance, as a whole, serves to proactively mislead consumers into thinking that the cost of the insurance is a pass-through charge. According to the complaint, JetBlue tricks consumers into thinking the charge is entirely passed through in a number of ways. For example, JetBlue identifies another entity \"as the company brokering the policy.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29, 41.) This, according to Dolan,\n   misleads consumers into thinking the other entity is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   company receiving a commission for the policy when, allegedly, JetBlue is also receiving a commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dolan also alleges JetBlue tells consumers that the licensed producer and administrator of the insurance policy recommends the purchase (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27) but that this statement is false (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Part of Dolan's claim also rests on the way JetBlue itemizes the cost of the policy, separately from the airfare charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) According to Dolan, this too serves to dupe consumers into thinking the cost of the insurance is a pass-through charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One link from JetBlue's website states that the trip insurance is \"from Allianz Global Assistance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) This again, Dolan alleges, leads one to presume that the fee charged is entirely passed through. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The cases JetBlue cites to are thus not on point. In those cases, there is no indication the plaintiffs were attempting to bring RICO claims based on anything more than failures to disclose or omissions.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

(RICO claims dismissed where the defendant itself was not the one who made any false statements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) JetBlue's argument with respect to the heightened pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) is not persuasive.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   JetBlue next argues Dolan's allegations do not adequately allege fraud as required by Rule 9(b). Its argument in this regard is woefully inadequate and fails to persuade. JetBlue lists the heightened Rule 9(b) pleading requirements and then asserts, \"Plaintiff ... has not adequately alleged mail or wire fraud.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 15.) In support, JetBlue simply claims Dolan \"does not allege which ... statements on JetBlue's website\n   <em>\n    she\n   </em>\n   actually saw, how the website allegedly misled\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   , or even the amount of her alleged injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (emphasis JetBlue's).) Not only is this argument short on support, it is inaccurate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McPherson v. Kelsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910581\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/989/#p995\">\n    125 F.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995-96 (6th Cir. 1997) (\"It is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.\" (internal quotation omitted)). Dolan, as detailed above, identifies specific statements on JetBlue's website, how those statements, collectively, misled her, duping her into funding a kickback to JetBlue while she thought she was only paying a pass-through charge to a third party. She pointedly alleges \"each consumer sees the same marketing language\" and that she herself relied on the misrepresentations in purchasing trip insurance. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 122.) The Court therefore denies JetBlue's motion to dismiss on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Dolan has adequately pleaded proximate cause.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   JetBlue also submits Dolan has not properly alleged that JetBlue's RICO violation was the proximate cause of her injury. In support, JetBlue points to Dolan's failure to \"allege[:] what she paid for her insurance\"; \"that comparable insurance would have cost less\"; she \"would not have purchased the voluntary trip insurance\" if she knew about the kickbacks; or that she \"would have purchased trip insurance elsewhere\" if she knew about the kickbacks. (Def.'s Mot. at 32.) JetBlue also points out Dolan fails to \"account for the many factors other than cost that might have induced [Dolan] ... to purchase the trip insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court is not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dolan specifically alleges she \"relied on\" JetBlue and the enterprise coconspirator's \"false statements and omissions ... that the full customer premium went to the cost of the travel insurance policy.\" (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 122.) Dolan says JetBlue tricked her into thinking \"the price displayed represented the cost of the policy\" when, \"[i]n reality, the insurance premium price include[d] a large kickback to JetBlue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106.) As a result, Dolan continues, the cost of the insurance premium was accordingly inflated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Assuming her allegations are true, as the Court must at this stage, Dolan was injured by JetBlue's scheme: as a direct result of JetBlue's deception, she paid not only for trip insurance, but, unknowingly, for a kickback to JetBlue as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridge v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 102-104, 108-111.) This is sufficient to survive JetBlue's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The court also denies JetBlue's request to dismiss Dolan's nationwide RICO class claims as well. JetBlue's argument relates to Dolan's insurance-statute-based allegations. Since the Court has determined that McCarran-Ferguson bars Dolan's RICO claims to the extent they are based on violations of Florida insurance statutes, JetBlue's quarrel here is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Dolan's nationwide class allegations with respect to her FDUTPA and unjust-enrichment claims are dismissed.
