CONLEY, District Judge\n   During Super Bowl LIII, defendant Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC, launched an advertising campaign highlighting plaintiff MillerCoors, LLC's use of corn syrup in brewing Miller Lite and Coors Light, as compared to Anheuser-Busch's use of rice in its flagship light beer, Bud Light. This lawsuit followed, with MillerCoors asserting a claim of false advertising under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the court is plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. (Dkt. #8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In keeping with the court's comments during oral argument on that motion on May 16, 2019, and for the reasons more fully explained below, the court will grant plaintiff a preliminary injunction, though more narrow in scope than that sought by plaintiff, enjoining defendant's use of the following statements: (1) Bud Light contains \"100% less corn syrup\"; (2) Bud Light in direct reference to \"no corn syrup\" without any reference to \"brewed with,\" \"made with\" or \"uses\"; (3) Miller Lite and/or Coors Light and \"corn syrup\" without including any reference to \"brewed with,\" \"made with\" or \"uses\"; and (4) describing \"corn syrup\" as an ingredient \"in\" the finished product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Light Beer Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Miller Brewing Company was founded in 1855, and Coors Brewing Company was founded in 1873. Plaintiff MillerCoors, LLC was formed in 2008 as a U.S. joint venture between the owners of the Miller Brewing Company and the Coors Brewing Company. Miller Lite and Coors Light\n   were both introduced to U.S. consumers in the 1970s. Defendant Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC is a multinational beverage company that sells numerous products, including Bud Light beer. Currently, Bud Light has the largest market share of the U.S. market for light beers, while Miller Lite and Coors Light have the second and third-highest share of the U.S. market for light beer, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MillerCoors market research reveals that the key reasons people buy Miller Lite and Coors Light are because the beers are (1) authentic, (2) a good value, (3) of high quality, and (4) refreshing. Plaintiff represents that its annual investment in advertising and promoting these two products in the United States has exceeded hundreds of millions of dollars per year, for the past ten years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a recent comparative advertising campaign, MillerCoors highlighted the difference in calories and carbohydrates between Miller Lite and Bud Light as depicted below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Harrison Decl., Ex. 20 (dkt. #40-22).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Beer Brewing Process and Ingredients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first step in brewing beer is to create a nutrient substrate, called \"wort,\" that yeast needs for fermentation. The sugars in the wort are sourced from malt, or from a combination of malt and starchy grains like corn or rice. Plaintiff asserts that the sugar source is selected based on the style and taste characteristics, which defendant does not dispute, although pointing out that cost may also be a factor. Defendant further represents that corn syrup is less expensive than rice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its brewing process for Miller Lite and Coors Light beers, plaintiff contends that it uses \"corn syrup, rather than another source of sugar, to aid fermentation because it does not mask or change the barley and hops flavors and aromas distinctive to Miller Lite and Coors Light beers.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #10) \u00b6 14.) Defendant contends that plaintiff has also \"publicly, attributed the taste of its beers, in part, to corn syrup, stating that 'corn syrup gives beer a milder and lighter-bodied flavor.' \" (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #30) \u00b6 14 (quoting Goeler Decl. (dkt. #31) \u00b6 24)).) There is no meaningful difference between using rice or\n   corn syrup as an ingredient in terms of health or safety of the resulting beer product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The yeast's natural fermentation process converts the corn syrup sugars into ethanol, flavors, aromas, carbon dioxide, heat and a next generation of yeast cells, leaving a small amount of residual sugars. Plaintiff represents -- and defendant disputes only on the basis that it lacks information and knowledge -- that \"[n]o corn syrup appears in the Coors Light and Miller Lite products at the end of the fermentation.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #10) \u00b6 18 (citing White Decl. (dkt. #12) \u00b6 5(d)).) Moreover, MillerCoors does not add corn syrup or any other sweetener (including high-fructose corn syrup) to the finished Coors Light or Miller Lite products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While defendant Anheuser-Busch uses corn syrup as an ingredient in fermentations of many of its other products,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bud Light uses rice as its sugar source. Presumably, no rice or any other sweetener appears in Bud Light at the end of the fermentation process either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Super Bowl Commercials and Subsequent Advertisements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 3, 2019, during the television broadcast of Super Bowl LIII, Anheuser-Busch launched a nationwide advertising campaigning featuring claims that Miller Lite and Coors Light are \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" corn syrup. A 60-second commercial, titled \"Special Delivery,\" first ran during the Super Bowl and has continued to run both in a full-length version, as well as shorter 15-second and 30-second \"cut down\" versions. (Reis Decl., Ex. 4 (dkt. #14-4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While defendant purports to dispute any description or paraphrasing of the \"Special Delivery\" advertisement, the commercial contains the following scenes in order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 The Bud Light King, the Bud Light Knight and a wizard discuss how Bud Light is brewed, with four barrels behind them labeled, \"Water,\" \"Rice,\" \"Hops,\" and \"Barley\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 One of the Bud Light King's knights then enters with a large barrel labeled \"Corn Syrup\" and announces, \"My King, this corn syrup was just delivered.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The Bud Light King responds, \"that's not ours. We don't brew Bud Light with corn syrup.\" The knight responds, \"Miller Lite uses corn syrup,\" to which the King respond, \"Let us take it to them at once.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The party then embarks on an arduous journey to deliver the barrel of corn syrup to the Miller Lite Castle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Once the Bud Light party arrives at the Miller Lite Castle, the Bud Light King announces, \"Oh brewers of Miller Lite, we received your corn syrup by mistake.\" The Miller Lite King, with a supply of Miller Lite at his side, responds, \"That's not our corn syrup. We received our shipment this morning.... Try the Coors Light Castle. They also use corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 The party then embarks on another arduous journey to deliver the barrel to the Coors Light Castle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Upon arrival, the Bud Light King again announces, \"Oh brewers of Coors Light, is this corn syrup yours?\" The Coors Light King answers, \"Well, well, well. Looks like the corn syrup has come home to be brewed. To be clear, we brew Coors Light with corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 The commercial closes with the written statement and voice over, \"Bud Light, Brewed with no Corn Syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 4 (dkt. #14-4); Harrison Decl., Ex. 32 (dkt. #40-32) (transcript).) Since the Superbowl, the \"Special Delivery\" commercial in its 30-second and 60-second versions has aired over 900 times on over 20 channels. (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #10) \u00b6 34; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #30) \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During the Super Bowl, Anheuser-Busch also aired two 15-second commercials, \"Medieval Barbers\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"Trojan Horse Occupants.\" (Reis Decl., Exs. 5, 6 (dkt. ##14-5, 14-6); Harrison Decl., Exs. 33, 34 (dkt. ##40-33, 40-34) (transcripts).) Collectively, these commercials, like Special Delivery, also state that Miller Lite and Coors Light are \"made with corn syrup.\" Since the Super Bowl, these ads have aired 257 and 566 times, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This year's Super Bowl advertising commanded between $ 5.1 and $ 5.3 million per 30 seconds of media placement, not including production costs. The \"Special Delivery\" ad, in particular, \"quickly became one of the night's most talked about ... with some observers hailing it as an advertising touchdown.\" (Reis Decl. (dkt. #14) \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Since the Super Bowl, Anheuser-Busch has run other, related commercials as part of its campaign, including a 15-second \"Bud Light Cave Explorers\" commercials. (Reis Decl., Ex. 10 (dkt. #14-10); Harrison Decl., Ex. 35 (dkt. #40-35) (transcript).) Again, defendant disputes any attempt to paraphrase the commercial, but the commercial contains the following scenes in order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Two medieval characters enter a cave bearing torches.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 One character reads out-loud what is written on the inside over the cave, \"Coors Light is made with barley, water, hop extract and corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 The other character reads out-loud another writing, \"Bud Light is made with barley, rice, water, hops and no corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 The first character responds, \"Good to know.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 The commercial closes with the same written statement as in Special Delivery, \"Bud Light, Brewed with no Corn Syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Anheuser-Busch also ran a 30-second commercial titled \"Bud Light Mountain Folk.\" (Reis Decl., Ex. 1 (dkt. #14-11); Harrison Decl., Ex. 35 (dkt. #40-36) (transcript).) While defendant objects to plaintiff's attempt to summarize the commercial, there is no dispute that it contains the following scenes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Medieval characters yell at each other from mountaintops.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 The first character yells, \"Coors Light is made with barley, water, hop extract, and corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Another character then yells, \"Miller Lite is made with barley, water, hops, hop extract, and corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 A third character, then yells, \"Bud Light is made with barley, rice, water, hops and no corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 After yelling good-byes, the commercial closes with the written statement as in the other commercials, \"Bud Light, Brewed with no Corn Syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to these television commercials, Anheuser-Busch has also launched print-media and billboard campaigns, including three sequential billboards which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   1. Bud Light 100% less corn syrup than Coors Light.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   2. and ... wait for it ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   3. 100% less corn syrup than Miller Lite.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 20 (dkt. #14-20).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Anheuser-Busch has also used its Twitter account to further this campaign. Three days after the Super Bowl, Anheuser-Busch's Twitter account displayed the following image:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 2 (dkt. #14-2).) A few weeks later, Anheuser-Busch Natural Light's Twitter account contained the following image, displaying a Miller Lite can next to a Karo corn syrup bottle as if in a family portrait:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 18 (dkt. #14-18).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the end of February, Anheuser-Busch ran two new commercials during the Oscars' broadcast. The first commercial ran 15 seconds and is titled, \"Thespians.\" It features two female actors exchanging the respective ingredients of Miller Lite and Bud Light. (Reis Dec., Ex 12 (dkt. #14-12); Harrison Decl., Ex. 37 (dkt. #40-37) (transcript).) Recognizing the same objection by defendant, the commercial contains the following scenes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 The first medieval actress enters the stage holding a bottle of Miller Lite and says, \"Miller Lite is made with barley, water, hops, hop extract, and corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 The second actress enters the stage holding a bottle of Bud Light and says, \"Bud Light is made with barley, rice, water, hops, and no corn syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 The audience applauds and otherwise reacts enthusiastically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 The commercial closes with the same written statement as in the other commercials, \"Bud Light, Brewed with no Corn Syrup.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second commercial contains the same two actresses, in a 24-second mock film preview. (Reis Decl., Ex. 13 (dkt. #14-13).) The advertisement contains no spoken words, but displays the following frames:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On March 20, 2019, Anheuser-Busch premiered a new commercial with the Bud Light King stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Miller, Miller, Miller. I've been made aware of your recent advertisement. I brought you your shipment of corn syrup, and this is how you repay me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Look if you're this set on imitating our kingdom, may I suggest also imitating us by putting an ingredients label on your packaging. People want to know what ingredients are in their beer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   But what do I know? I'm just the king of a kingdom that doesn't brew beer with corn syrup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 25 (dkt. #14-25); Harrison Decl., Ex. 38 (dkt. #40-38).) The commercial ends with the same language and voiceover, \"Bud Light, Brewed with no Corn Syrup.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In a New York Times article, dated March 21, 2019, Anheuser-Busch's vice president of communications stated, \"We stand behind the Bud Light transparency campaign and have no plans to change the advertising.\" (Reis Decl., Ex. 27 (dkt. #14-27).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Anheuser-Busch's Intent in Launching Campaign\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On February 7, 2019, Beer Business Daily reported that according to Andy Goeler, Anheuser-Busch's head of marketing for Bud Light, told its distributors that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [Anheuser-Busch] did focus-group the heck out of this [Special Delivery] ad, and found consumers generally don't differentiate between high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup, and that it is a major triggering point in choosing brands to purchase, particularly among women.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 21 (dkt. #14-21).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an interview with Food and Wine Magazine, in response to the question, \"What is wrong with corn syrup?,\" Goeler responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   People started to react to corn syrup, they started to react to no preservatives, and they started to react to no artificial flavors. There are things that consumers on their own had perceptions -- for whatever reason -- that there were ingredients they preferred not to consume if they didn't have to. So it was pretty clear to us what to highlight. If you look at our packaging, we highlight all three of those. No corn syrup. No artificial\n   flavors. No preservatives. It was purely driven by consumer desire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 22 (dkt. #14-22) 3.) The interviewer then noted that Anheuser-Busch had \"decided to focus on corn syrup instead of no preservative or things like that,\" and asked Goeler why he thought \"consumers see corn syrup as something they don't want?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) In response, Goeler explained, \"I think it's probably an ingredient some prefer not to consume is the simple answer.... [S]ome consumers -- for their own personal reasons -- have concluded that they prefer not putting something like corn syrup, if they had a choice, into their body.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In an interview with the Milwaukee Business Journal, Goeler purportedly indicated that Anheuser-Busch\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   will continue to run content focusing on ingredient transparency. We'll continue to run the current content until it starts to reach a certain level of saturation. We think it has a ways to go. Once it reaches that, like we do all the time, we'll start putting new pieces of content in. That's an ongoing piece of managing the brand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 26 (dkt. #14-26) 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In a trade publication, Anheuser-Busch's senior director of corporation communications, Josh Gold, in response to a Coors Light promotion to offer free beer anytime Bud Light talks about Coors Light on social or broadcast media, responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Free beer is a good thing. So is talking about ingredients inside of beer. We continue to remain focused on transparency because we know that is what consumers are looking for. Knowing what is and isn't in your beer -- whether you paid for it or not -- can only be good for the beer industry overall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 23 (dkt. #14-23) 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    E. MillerCoors' Consumer Survey\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In support of its motion for preliminary injunction, MillerCoors retained Dr. Yoram Wind, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business with expertise in consumer behavior and marketing, to conduct a survey of consumers. Wind surveyed 2,034 consumers who were shown either a test or control version of the \"Mountain Folk\" commercial described above. Of the total respondents, 1,016 were randomly assigned to view the test ad, and 1,018 were randomly assigned to view a control ad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The control ad was the same commercial as the test ad, but with an added, prominent disclaimer: \"While corn syrup is used during the brewing of Miller Lite and Coors Light,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     there is\n     <em>\n      NO\n     </em>\n     corn syrup in the Miller Lite and Coors Light you drink\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 15 (emphasis in original).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   According to Wind's analysis, \"61 percent of respondents who saw the test stimulus believe that corn syrup is in the Miller Lite and/or Coors Light you drink (3 percent who said 'In Drink' plus 58 percent who said 'Both Brewed with and in Drink'). In contrast, only 26 percent of\n   respondents who saw the control stimulus (3 percent who said 'In Drink' plus 23 percent who said 'Both Brewed with and in Drink') have that belief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Wind, further opined, that the difference in perception of 35% of consumers \"is both economically and statistically significant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8(a).) Wind also concluded based on an analysis of open-ended responses that the phrase \" 'made with' used in the Bud Light commercial to describe the relationship between Miller Lite and/or Coors Light and corn syrup is ambiguous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In support of its motion, plaintiff contends that the advertisements exploit or further misconceptions about corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup (\"HFCS\"). The corn syrup MillerCoors uses in its brewing process is a distinct substance from HFCS. Dr. John S. White, a biochemist with industry experience in \"products of the corn wet milling industry including starches, maltodextrins and corn syrups,\" represents that he \"has worked extensively on the divisive [HFCS] issue for the past 15 years,\" and that \"there is a common point of confusion about corn syrup and HFCS, despite the fact that they are very different products.\" (White Decl. (dkt. #12) \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5(d).) With respect to the survey, Wind concluded that \"more respondents who saw the test stimulus (24 percent) than who saw the control stimulus (19 percent) believed that the commercial says, suggests, or implies that corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup are the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Consumer Communications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In January 2019, before the launch of the advertising campaign at issue in this lawsuit, \"MillerCoors had received virtually no consumer communications related to corn syrup.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #30) \u00b6 92 (citing Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 93).) After the Super Bowl, through March 22, 2019, MillerCoors received 179 communications related to corn syrup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93 (citing Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 93).) Defendant disputes the significance of these communications on the basis that \"[t]his small number of communications after the Super Bowl consists of thoughts from a miniscule fraction of the overall relevant consumers, and Dr. Wind provided no evidence that his dataset of particular consumers who actively reached out to MillerCoors is representative of all potential MillerCoors consumers.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. #30) \u00b6 92 (citing Hauser Decl. (dkt. #36) \u00b6\u00b6 54-56).) Nevertheless, according to Wind's analysis, \"[t]wenty-two percent of consumer communications noted that the presence of corn syrup will have an impact on their likelihood of purchasing Miller Lite and/or Coors Light, with 18 percent likely to end or decrease their purchases of Miller Lite and/or Coors Light and 4 percent noting a likelihood to begin or increase their purchases of Miller Lite and/or Coors Light.\" (Wind Rept.

Voluble organized the posts into two categories: (1) Twitter posts in which an account authored by Anheuser-Busch mentioned corn syrup and subsequent retweets of those posts; and (2) online conversations\n   mentioning corn syrup in Bud Light, Miller Lite or Coors Light. As it did with the survey data, defendant challenges the reliability of this study as well. The court will address those challenges below. The first category generated 3,206,145 \"total impressions\"; the second category generated 314,587,587 \"total impressions.\" (Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6\u00b6 108-09, 112.) Based on this data, Wind concluded that \"[o]f the posts authored by consumers that included a mention of corn syrup and at least one of the three brands, more than twice as many expressed a negative sentiment as opposed to a positive one, 22.0% to 9.8%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.)

The ads draw a clear contrast between Arla cheese (high quality, nutritious) and cheese made from rbST-treated cows (impure, unwholesome).

In fairness, plaintiff's counsel rightly points out that this link may have been unnecessary\n   here, since at least some consumers appear to associate corn syrup, and particularly high fructose corn syrup, with harmful health consequences, or certainly defendant hoped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   However, instead of analyzing the commercial or the advertising campaign more broadly in order to demonstrate that these statements are misleading, plaintiff relies on open-ended questions in Wind's consumer survey, in which consumers interpreted \" 'made with' to mean, for example 'contains,' 'uses,' 'has,' 'is made with,' 'is in,' or 'is added.' \" (Pl.'s Opening Br. (dkt. #9) 29 (citing Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 78).) As an initial matter, certain of the respondents' descriptions -- namely, \"uses\" and \"is made with\" -- appear accurate, and contradict plaintiff's argument that \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" means \"is contained\" in the finished product. Indeed, responding that \"made with\" means \"is made with\" does not appear to be an interpretation of the phrase at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Putting aside these concerns about the quality of this proof, relying on survey evidence to find that an advertisement is \"misleading\" may well bring statements that merely are \"susceptible to misunderstanding\" within the scope of a Lanham Act violation, which the Seventh Circuit instructed is not appropriate in\n   <em>\n    Mead Johnson &amp; Company v.

In that case, an infant formula manufacturer brought a Lanham Act action against a competitor, based on the competitor's use of the statement \"1st Choice of Doctors\" in its advertisements. The district court entered a preliminary injunction, in part, based on its finding that the statement \"implies to consumers that a majority of physicians strongly prefer the product for strictly professional reasons,\" and the market research, while showing a plurality of support among physicians, did not show a\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757531\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/883/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757531\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/883/\">\n    at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consistent with these cases, plaintiff MillerCoors must point to something in the advertisement to allow a reasonable consumer to draw the inference that \"brewed with,\" \"made with\" or \"uses\" corn syrup means that corn syrup is\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   the final product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   When counsel for plaintiff was pressed at the hearing to identify a comparable characteristic in these advertisements, he appeared to rely on the scale of the campaign alone -- that is, Anheuser-Busch has produced a lot of advertisements, displayed them during high profile events, and mentioned \"corn syrup\" repeatedly. Specifically, plaintiff relied on the \"maxim of relevance,\" explaining that under this theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   if a speaker says something that is capable of more than one meaning and\n   knows that ... one of those meanings is something that's relevant and meaningful information to the listener and that the other meaning is something that is irrelevant and not meaningful to the listener, the listener will assume that the speaker means the meaningful, relevant statement because why would you be telling me something that's not important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (Hr'g Tr. (dkt. #56) 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Intuitively, the argument is appealing: why are these ads repeating \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" corn syrup if it does not mean that the corn syrup works its way into the final product?\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, plaintiff fails to direct the court to any case, and this court could not find any, relying on the pervasiveness or scale of an advertising campaign to find a neutral, truthful statement misleading within the meaning of the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Perhaps, as discussed below, the context of these television commercials should be judged by statements displayed in print advertisements and other commercials that cross the line from \"susceptible to misunderstanding\" to outright misleading. In other words, consumers could reasonably interpret \"made with\" and \"brewed with\" to mean corn syrup is in the final product because of defendant's other ads describing Bud Light as having 100% less corn syrup, or describing Miller Lite as \"corn syrup\" and Bud Light as \"no corn syrup\" without reference to the\n   <em>\n    brewing\n   </em>\n   process. Still, this theory may prove too much of a stretch given the relative exposure of the Special Delivery and other commercials only using the \"made with,\" \"brewed with,\" or \"uses\" language as compared with the billboard advertisements and other, apparently less pervasive commercials that use more troubling language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Finally, as noted, plaintiff argues that an advertisement may be misleading under the Lanham Act even if \"the 'context' comes in the form of preexisting beliefs,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Simeon Management Corporation v. Federal Trade Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874568\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/579/1137/#p1146\">\n    579 F.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (9th Cir. 1978). As indicated by its name, however, this case involved an order issued by the FTC requiring the plaintiff to disclose a lack of FDA approval, not a claim under the Lanham Act. As defendant points out in its opposition brief, FTC precedent is largely inapplicable to Lanham Act cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandoz Pharm. v. Richardson-Vicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528475\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/902/222/#p230\">\n    902 F.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (3d Cir. 1990) (declining plaintiff's \"invitation to blur the distinctions between the FTC and a Lanham Act plaintiff\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kraft, Inc. v.

As the court pressed during the hearing, there appear to be\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   Lanham Act cases that allow a plaintiff to rely solely on defendant's exploitation of consumer concerns to demonstrate that a truthful advertisement is misleading, at least where the truthful statement may well be properly understood, rather than necessarily misleading consumers. Indeed, such an approach\n   would appear entirely inconsistent with the Seventh Circuit's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Mead Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For all these reasons, the court concludes that plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success in demonstrating that the advertisements solely using the language \"brewed with,\" \"made with,\" or \"uses\" corn syrup are misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Bud Light has \"100% less corn syrup than Miller Lite or Coors Light\" or that it has \"no corn syrup\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that defendant's statements that Bud Light contains \"100% less corn syrup\" than Miller Lite and/or Coors Light and that Bud Light contains \"no corn syrup\" are misleading because they \"highlight this false dichotomy in a way that suggests consumers should care about it for important reasons such as health concerns.\" (Pl.'s Br. (dkt. #9) 30.) Unlike the \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" statement, these statements, while also literally true, support a reasonable interpretation that Miller Lite and Coors Light\n   <em>\n    contain\n   </em>\n   corn syrup. Thus, the court agrees with plaintiff that it has a likelihood of success in demonstrating that these statements are misleading. The same is also true for the second Thespians commercial, a mock film preview, which contains the following frames:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 13 (dkt. #14-13).) These advertisements, unlike the ones described above, do not contain any reference to Miller Lite and Coors Light being \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" corn syrup; instead, these advertisements -- either in stating what is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in Bud Light or in stating what\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in Miller Lite or Coors Light -- cross the line from simply being susceptible to misunderstanding to being misleading, or, at minimum, the court finds that plaintiff is likely to succeed in making such a showing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Ingredient\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Next, plaintiff points to references to \"corn syrup\" being an \"ingredient.\" As an initial point, it is not clear what constitutes an \"ingredient\" in the context of beer. As the parties acknowledged during the hearing, there are no labeling requirements with respect to ingredients for beer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.22\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring name, class, name and address of permit holder, net contents and alcohol content). Even in the food context, as far as this court could find, \"ingredient\" is not defined, but appears to cover items that are used in the production of a food product, even if not\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   the end product (e.g., leavening items).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.4\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (setting for designation of ingredients for food labeling). In an attempt to distance itself from any belief that corn syrup remains in the finished Miller Lite and Coors Light end products, plaintiff now refers to corn syrup as an \"adjunct.\" As defendant repeatedly points out, however, plaintiff at least at times has in the past (and apparently still does) listed corn syrup as an \"ingredient\" on its website, without any reference to it being used solely in the brewing process and not present in the end product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Putting this dispute aside, the use of \"ingredient\" must also be considered in context. In most of the advertisements, defendant uses the word ingredient or lists ingredients in conjunction with the \"made with\" or \"brewed with\" language. For example, in the Cave Explorers commercial, one character reads out-loud what is written on the inside of the cave, \"Coors Light is made with barley, water, hop extract and corn syrup,\" followed by another character reading out-loud from a different writing, \"Bud Light is made with barley, rice, water, hops and no corn syrup.\" (Reis Decl., Ex. 10 (dkt. #14-10); Harrison Decl., Ex. 35 (dkt. #40-35) (transcript).) The same is true for the first Thespians advertisement and the Mountain Folk advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reis Dec., Ex 12 (dkt. #14-12); Harrison Decl., Ex. 37 (dkt. #40-37) (transcript) (using \"made with\" to list ingredients in Bud Light and Miller Lite); Reis Decl., Ex. 1 (dkt. #14-11); Harrison Decl., Ex. 35 (dkt. #40-36) (transcript) (using \"made with\" to list ingredients in Bud Light, Miller Lite and Coors Light).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   There is one exception. In the most recent commercial, released March 20, 2019, the Bud Light King states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Miller, Miller, Miller. I've been made aware of your recent advertisement. I brought you your shipment of corn syrup, and this is how you repay me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Look if you're this set on imitating our kingdom, may I suggest also imitating us by putting an ingredients label on your packaging. People want to know\n   <em>\n    what ingredients are in their beer.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   But what do I know? I'm just the king of a kingdom that doesn't brew beer with corn syrup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (Reis Decl., Ex. 25 (dkt. #14-25); Harrison Decl., Ex. 38 (dkt. #40-38) (emphasis added).) For the same reason that the \"100% less corn syrup,\" \"no corn syrup\" or \"corn syrup\" language is problematic, the court also concludes that plaintiff is likely to\n   succeed in demonstrating that this language is misleading because it crosses the line to encourage a reasonable consumer to believe that corn syrup is actually contained in the final product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    4. \"Save money\" / \"less expensive\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, plaintiff points to statements that Miller Lite and Coors Light selected corn syrup to \"save money\" or because it is \"less expensive.\" Plaintiff contends that these statements \"falsely suggest ... [t]hat there is something inferior, wrong, or unhealthy about beer that is not brewed from rice.\" (Pl.'s Br. (dkt. #9) 31.) Plaintiff does not challenge the truthfulness of these statements. Instead, plaintiff appears to contend that representations about the relative cost of corn syrup is misleading because a consumer would conclude that it is less healthy. For reasons addressed above, however, this claim is too much of a stretch to warrant discussion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Intent to Deceive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   To date, plaintiff's strongest evidence is defendant's own statements indicating that in launching this campaign, it was both aware of and intended to exploit consumer concerns about corn syrup (and high fructose corn syrup in particular). As detailed above, defendant's head of marketing for Bud Light and senior director of corporation communications in various publications described the market research defendant engaged in before launching this campaign. Specifically, defendant found that \"consumers generally don't differentiate between high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup, and that it is a major triggering point in choosing brands to purchase\"; \"consumers on their own had perceptions -- for whatever reason -- that there were ingredients they preferred not to consume if they didn't have to\" and, therefore, \"it was pretty clear to us what to highlight\"; and that consumers \"have concluded that they prefer not putting something like corn syrup, if they had a choice, into their body.\" (Reis Decl., Exs. 21, 22, 23, 26 (dkt. ##14-21, 14-22, 14-23, 14-26).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   As the court indicated during the hearing, these statements support a finding that defendant was aware of consumer concerns about and the likelihood of confusion surrounding corn syrup and HFCS, and that defendant hoped consumers would interpret advertising statements about \"made with corn syrup\" or \"brewed with corn syrup\" as corn syrup actually being in the finished products. As acknowledged above, however, the Seventh Circuit has not yet embraced the doctrine that would create a rebuttable presumption of consumer confusion or deception based on an intent to deceive, though perhaps this evidence could serve to color the \"made with\" and \"brewed with\" statements to push them across the line to allow a reasonable finding that they are misleading, and not simply susceptible to misunderstanding. If either or both parties opt to appeal this decision to the Seventh Circuit, guidance on the use of intent in determining whether a statement is actually misleading under the Lanham Act would be of great value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Moreover, as discussed above, at least the Second and Third Circuit require a showing of \"egregious conduct\"\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   to intent to deceive to give rise to this rebuttable presumption. While other circuits have not required such a showing, from the court's review, the Second and Third Circuits have developed the law surrounding the role of intent in the Lanham\n   Act context and plaintiff itself relied on a Second Circuit case to pursue its intent theory.

Hauser, Sc.D., offers several challenges to the reliability of the survey and this 35% figure.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , defendant questions why Dr. Wind selected the \"Mountain Man\" commercial, instead of the \"Special Delivery\" commercial, on the basis that the \"Special Delivery\" commercial launched the adverting campaign, ran the most times and was seen by the most people. (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. #39) 30-31.) In its reply brief, plaintiff points out that the two ads both \"compare the respective beers and highlight corn syrup,\" and the \"Mountain Man\" ad \"is arguably the more neutral of the two.\" (Pl.'s Reply (dkt. #48) 5.) The court agrees with plaintiff that both ads compare Miller Lite and Coors Light with Bud Light, and defendant has not articulated a basis -- nor could its counsel when pressed during the hearing -- why using the \"Mountain Man\" advertisement would undermine the value of the survey. At minimum, this challenge would go to the weight the court might place on the survey and not a basis to reject it out of hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Hauser contends that Dr. Wind asked improper leading questions. Specifically, he takes issue with QF7a and QF7b. Q7Fa provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   Which, if any of the following statements does the TV commercial say, suggest or imply? (\n   <em>\n    Select one only\n   </em>\n   ):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   1.

If a respondent selected option 2 -- that Miller Lite and/or Coors Light is/are made with corn syrup -- then the respondents were shown QF7b (assuming that the question concerned Miller Lite), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   You said that Miller Lite is made with corn syrup. Being \"made with\" corn syrup may mean a number of different things. Which, if any, of the following statements does the TV commercial say, suggest, or imply about Miller Lite?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   1. Corn syrup is used\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   during the brewing process for Miller Lite, but is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in the Miller Lite you drink.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   2.

Dr. Hauser contends that QF7b improperly instructs respondents that the term \"made with\" is ambiguous, which deviates from accepted practice. (Hauser Decl. (dkt. #36) \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Instead, Hauser maintains that respondents either should have been asked if they viewed the \"made with\" statement as ambiguous, and then only those individuals should have been asked what they believed the statement meant, or respondents should have been asked an open-ended question as to the meaning of the term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its reply, plaintiff responds to other challenges in Hauser's report (ones not raised in defendant's opposition brief), but does not respond to this particular challenge. Regardless, the court concludes that this criticism also goes to the weight, rather than the admissibility, of this evidence, and that plaintiff has demonstrated at least some likelihood of persuading a reasonable jury of the risk of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Hauser criticizes Wind's testing of the respondents' views of the connection between HCFS and corn syrup. This criticism focuses in particular on QF8, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   Which, if any, of the following statements does the TV commercial say, suggest, or imply?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   1. Corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup are the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   2. Corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup are different from one another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   3. Neither of the statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   4. Don't know/ Unsure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   (Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 64.) Hauser contends that this question was improper because the ads do not mention HFCS, and also points to the results of a prior open-ended question of the test group, where only 1.4% of the respondents volunteered \"high fructose corn syrup\" in their answers. (Hauser Decl. (dkt. #36) \u00b6 46.) In response, plaintiff maintains that \"Dr. Wind did not pose this question to measure confusion caused by the ad, but rather to measure any pre-existing consumer misunderstanding of the relationship between corn syrup and HFCS.\" (Pl.'s Reply (dkt. #48) 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , defendant challenges the use of the disclaimer in the survey as a control. The thrust of defendant's criticism, as discussed above in the fact section, is that Dr. Wind's report contains two (slightly) different worded disclaimers. As plaintiff explains in the reply, Wind's report contained a typo; one of the versions was used in a prior version of the control ad which was pre-tested, but the control ad used in the formal survey consistently used the same disclaimer. (Pl.'s Reply (dkt. #48) 5.) Regardless, defendant's attempt to tease out any significance in the difference between the two disclaimers -- one says \"While Miller Lite and Coors Light are brewed using corn syrup\" with the other stating, \"While corn syrup is used during the brewing of Miller Lite and Coors Lite\" -- is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Perhaps these challenges cast some doubt on survey results showing a difference in perception between the control and test advertisement of 35% of consumers,\n   but defendant and its expert fall short of providing a basis to reject the survey results out of hand. Moreover, as plaintiff points out and as described above, the Seventh Circuit has repeatedly rejected the notion that survey evidence is required to obtain a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517369\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/375/#p381\">\n    893 F.3d at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on consumer communications, and Wind's analysis of those communications, finding that 18% indicated that they were \"likely to end or decrease their purchases of Miller Lite and/or Coors Light\" because of corn syrup. (Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 94.) As defendant points out persuasively, this analysis was based on 32 total communications, out of the approximately 100 million people who watched the Super Bowl. (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. #39) 35.) Moreover, defendant points out that of the ten comments Wind highlights, a number of them accurately described that Miller Lite and Coors Light use or are brewed with corn syrup, rather than plaintiff's alleged mistaken belief that corn syrup is in the final product. Viewed in isolation, the court agrees that these statements are insufficient to prove that a substantial segment of consumers are likely to be deceived by the advertisements, but it is some anecdotal support for the survey results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Finally, plaintiff relies on the social media reaction to the advertisements, and again to Wind's analysis of that data to opine that \"28.6% of consumer posts include information that indicates the author holds the mistaken belief that corn syrup used in brewing is present in the final product (the beer itself).\" (Wind Rept. (dkt. #15) \u00b6 124.) In response, defendant contends that this type of evidence is treated skeptically and that the \"study is not a scientifically accepted method of measuring whether an ad is misleading.\" (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. #39) 34.) Again, the court agrees that, viewed in isolation, this evidence may not carry the day in proving a likelihood of success in demonstrating consumer confusion, but it, too, provides anecdotal evidence to support the survey results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   In sum, the court finds that plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to support a finding at the preliminary injunction stage that it has some likelihood of success in proving defendant's advertisements deceived or have the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of consumers to believe that Miller Lite and Coors Light actually contain corn syrup. Of course, for the reasons explained above, these results are only relevant to those ads that the court concluded cross the line between susceptible to misunderstanding and misleading because of the language used and the context surrounding that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Irreparable Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   As indicated above, to succeed on a Lanham Act claim, plaintiff must also demonstrate that it \"has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the false statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517369\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/375/#p381\">\n    893 F.3d at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
