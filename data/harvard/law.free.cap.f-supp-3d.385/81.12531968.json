INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") published a final rule that regulates the marketing of prescription drugs. The rule requires drug manufacturers to disclose in any television advertisement the list price-also known as the wholesale acquisition cost-of a 30-day supply of the drug (\"WAC Disclosure Rule\"). The cost of prescription drugs has been increasing for years, and because of its role as health insurer for millions of Americans through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the United States government is the single largest payor of prescription drugs in the nation. HHS adopted the WAC Disclosure Rule to \"introduce[ ] price transparency that will help improve the efficiency of the Medicare and Medicaid programs by reducing wasteful and abusive increases in drug and biological product list prices.\" HHS pointed to its general power under the Social Security Act to make rules necessary for the efficient administration of the Medicare and Medicaid programs as the source of its authority to issue the Rule. The WAC Disclosure Rule will go into effect on July 9, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are three drug manufacturers and a marketing trade association that contend that the WAC Disclosure Rule is unlawful. Plaintiffs advance two primary arguments. First, they argue that the Rule exceeds HHS's authority, because Congress neither expressly nor impliedly granted HHS the power under the Social Security Act to regulate drug marketing. Second, they maintain that the WAC Disclosure Rule is compelled speech that violates the First Amendment. Plaintiffs have asked the court to halt the WAC Disclosure Rule before it goes into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Federal agencies typically enjoy expansive authority from Congress to formulate rules that have the force of law in areas germane to the statutes that they implement. But such authority is not unbounded. For a regulation to have the force of law, Congress must communicate through legislation, either expressly or impliedly, its intent for the agency to make rules in that specific area. When Congress has not communicated such intent, the agency has no power to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court finds that HHS lacks the statutory authority under the Social Security Act to adopt the WAC Disclosure Rule. Neither the Act's text, structure, nor context evince an intent by Congress to empower HHS to issue a rule that compels drug manufacturers to disclose list prices. The Rule is therefore invalid. In view of this holding, the court does not reach Plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To be clear, the court does not question HHS's motives in adopting the WAC Disclosure Rule. Nor does it take any view on the wisdom of requiring drug companies to disclose prices. That policy very well could be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. But no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized. The responsibility rests with Congress to act in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons addressed below, the court declares the WAC Disclosure Rule invalid and sets aside the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Proposed Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") issued a\n   policy statement titled \" Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs\" (\"the Blueprint\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C692\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 22,692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 16, 2018). The Blueprint's stated purpose was to halt rising drug prices and to lower out-of-pocket expenses that Americans pay for pharmaceutical products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C692\">\n    at 22,692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As one possible action, HHS announced that it would \"[c]all on [the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") ] to evaluate the inclusion of list prices in direct-to-consumer advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C692\">\n    at 22,695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Direct-to-consumer advertising is one of the most important ways pharmaceutical manufacturers communicate with consumers to inform them of new products, raise disease awareness, and encourage consultation with health care providers. Compl., ECF No. 1 [hereinafter Compl.], \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Five months after issuing the Blueprint, in October 2018, HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled \" Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulation to Require Drug Pricing Transparency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C789\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 52,789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 18, 2018). The Notice announced a Proposed Rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements for prescription drug and biological products to include the \"list price\" of the product for a 30-day supply, if the list price is more than $35 and the drug is covered under the Medicare or Medicaid program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C789\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C789\">\n    at 52,789, 52,799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"list price\" is a price that manufacturers set for sale to wholesalers before applying rebates or other price reductions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 52. The \"list price\" is also known in the industry as the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (\"WAC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C789\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2052%2C789\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Proposed Rule would require covered television advertisements to contain the following statement: \"The list price for a [30-day supply of] [typical course of treatment with] [name of prescription drug or biological product] is [insert list price]. If you have health insurance that covers drugs, your cost may be different.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 52,799.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   One of the unexpected features of the Proposed Rule was the HHS sub-agency that issued it. The Blueprint stated that HHS may \"call on the FDA to evaluate the inclusion of list prices in direct-to-consumer advertising.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 22,695. The issuing agency, however, turned out to be the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), acting pursuant to its rulemaking authority under the Social Security Act (\"SSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52,791 -92. HHS acknowledged that \"Congress has not explicitly provided HHS with authority to compel the disclosure of list prices to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52,791. Yet, it \"concluded that the proposed rule has a clear nexus to the Social Security Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HHS explained that \"Congress has explicitly directed HHS to operate Medicare and Medicaid programs efficiently,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and that the Proposed Rule was designed to advance that directive by lowering the costs that public health insurance programs pay for prescription drug benefits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52,791 -92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Final Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 10, 2019, HHS announced that it had decided to finalize the Proposed Rule with minor modifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulation to Require Drug Pricing Transparency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    84 Fed. Reg. 20,732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 10, 2019). The court will refer to the final rule as the \"WAC Disclosure Rule.\" Consistent with the Proposed Rule, the WAC Disclosure Rule requires the disclosure of drug prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, direct-to-consumer television advertisements of drugs covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs must communicate the list price, or WAC, for a 30-day supply of the drug, if it costs more than $35 per month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   HHS set the\n   effective date of the WAC Disclosure Rule as July 9, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   HHS adopted the WAC Disclosure Rule over numerous objections raised by the pharmaceutical industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20,735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Two primary objections are the focus of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first was that HHS lacks the legal authority to promulgate the Rule under the SSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,735 -36. In response to this criticism, HHS identified two provisions of the SSA, Sections 1102 and 1871, as the source of its rulemaking authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20,736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1102(a) provides in pertinent part: The Secretary of HHS \"shall make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201302\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Similarly, Section 1871(a) states that the Secretary of HHS \"shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs under this subchapter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395hh(a)(1). HHS defended its reliance on these general rulemaking provisions on the ground that the WAC Disclosure Rule's objective was to lower drug costs, thereby promoting the \"efficient administration of Medicare and Medicaid.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    84 Fed. Reg. at 20,736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second major objection concerned use of the WAC as the advertised price. The industry asserted that referring to the WAC risked misleading and confusing consumers, as the WAC rarely captures the actual out-of-pocket costs that most Americans pay for drug products due to, among other things, insurance coverage and patient assistance programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,739 -42. HHS responded that the WAC was a recognized benchmark of cost within the industry and correlated with out-of-pocket expenses, and that its disclosure would create an opportunity for patients to discuss the cost of drugs with their physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20,739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . HHS further stated that the second sentence of the disclosure-advising that if the buyer has health insurance, the cost of the drug may be different-would mitigate any confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n    at 20,741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It therefore dismissed the industry's concern.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The industry's opposition to using the WAC also manifested itself as a First Amendment argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     at 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,743 -48.

Statutory Text\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The court begins, as it must, with the text of the statutes upon which the WAC Disclosure Rule rests. Defendants point to Sections 1102 and 1871 of the SSA as the source of their rulemaking authority. Those provisions provide: (1) The \"Secretary of Health and Human Services ... shall make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which\" he is charged by the SSA, which include the Medicare and Medicaid programs,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201302\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) ; and (2) \"The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs under this subchapter,\" which establishes the Medicare program,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201302\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1395hh(a)(1). These are broad grants of rulemaking authority. About that there is no real dispute. But the words used by Congress matter. Plaintiffs focus on the word \"necessary\" contained in each provision to make their case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. at 25. The more important word, in the court's view, however, is \"administration.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The term \"administration\" means \"[t]he process or activity of running a business, organization, etc.,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    or \"[t]he management or performance of the executive duties of a government, institution, or business; collectively, all the actions that are involved in managing the work of an organization,\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). The word thus conveys the types of actions that are directed toward controlling the operation of something over which a person has executive authority. The SSA reflects this meaning of \"administration.\" It vests certain control in the Secretary of HHS, and it defines the objects of that control-i.e., what the Secretary is \"administering\"-as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Thus, the basic power that Congress gave to the Secretary was to establish rules and regulations for \"running\" or \"managing\" the federal public health insurance programs through CMS.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    HHS seeks to do more than that here. It has adopted a rule that regulates the conduct of market actors that are not direct participants in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are not health care providers, private plan\n    carriers,\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    or beneficiaries-each of whom plays a direct role in the public health insurance programs. They do not receive payment for their products from CMS. Their pricing decisions, of course, affect the cost of pharmaceutical benefits offered under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. But those decisions impact program costs in an indirect way. The plain statutory text simply does not support the notion-at least not in a way that is textually self-evident-that Congress intended for the Secretary to possess the far-reaching power to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Other provisions of the SSA confirm the court's conclusion. In both the Final Rule and briefing here, HHS points to various sections of the SSA for the proposition that \"[b]oth Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act reflect the importance of\n    <em>\n     administering\n    </em>\n    the Medicare and Medicaid programs in a manner that minimizes unreasonable expenditures.\" Defs.'

Sections 1842(b)(8) and (b)(9) require HHS to promulgate regulations describing the factors that it will use in determining reimbursement requests that are \"grossly excessive\" or \"grossly deficient\" and thus not \"inherently reasonable,\" and to consult with health care providers who submit such requests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395u(b)(8), (b)(9). Section 1860D-4(c)(3) directs HHS to require prescription drug plan sponsors to dispense covered Part D drugs in a manner that reduces waste associated with 30-day fills.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1395w-104(c)(3). Similarly, Section 1860D-4(c)(5)(H) commands HHS to establish rules and procedures to identify at-risk beneficiaries who are using prescription drugs \"outside normal patterns,\" which \"may indicate fraudulent, medically unnecessary, or unsafe use.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1395w-104(c)(5)(H)(ii).

And Sections 1893(g), 1902(a)(64), and 1936(b)(2) are all directed to programs or practices designed to prevent and combat fraud, waste, and abuse.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 1395ddd(g) (establishing Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program); 1396a(a)(64) (requiring state programs to have a mechanism for beneficiaries and others to report, and compile data concerning, waste, fraud, and abuse); 1396u-6(b)(2) (describing activities of the Medicaid Integrity Program). Other parts of the SSA that expressly address the \"administration\" of the programs are to the same effect.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    SSA \u00a7\u00a7 1808, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395b-9 (\"Provisions relating to administration\"); 1816, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h (Provisions relating to the administration of Part A); 1842, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u (Provisions relating to the administration of Part B); 1866B, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc-2 (Provisions for administration of demonstration\n    program); and 1874, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395kk (Administration).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    What these provisions have in common is this: each contains a congressional directive that concerns the day-to-day running and operation of Medicare and Medicaid as public health insurance programs, and each is directed in some way to a program participant or the program itself. None authorize HHS, in the name of attempting to reduce the costs, to regulate the health care market itself or market actors that are not direct participants in the insurance programs. Simply put, the delegation of authority that HHS says allows it \"to speak with the force of law\" on the marketing of prescription drugs is nowhere to be found in the vast statute that is the SSA.\n    <em>\n     Mead\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p229\">\n     533 U.S. at 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p229\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Medicare program came into existence over a half-century ago, in 1965. Yet, it would appear that HHS did not discover its purported authority to regulate drug marketing under the SSA until soon before HHS proposed the WAC Disclosure Rule in October 2018.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 52,791 -92. Indeed, when it released the Blueprint in May 2018, HHS said that it may \"[c]all on the\n    <em>\n     FDA\n    </em>\n    to evaluate the inclusion of list prices in direct-to-consumer advertising.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22,695 (emphasis added). Yet, a mere five months later, CMS became the issuing sub-agency. It thus would seem that HHS at first believed that the FDA, presumably under the FDCA, would be the proper sub-agency through which to promulgate the WAC Disclosure Rule, as opposed to CMS under the SSA. To be fair, the Blueprint also says that HHS may direct CMS to \"make Medicare and Medicaid prices more transparent\" and \"hold drug makers accountable for their price increases.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    It is telling, however, that HHS first announced the specific action in dispute here as falling within the purview of a different sub-agency. The WAC Disclosure Rule feels like agency action in search of a statutory home.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barnhart\n    </em>\n    , 535 U.S. at 222,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354957\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/212/#p222\">\n     122 S.Ct. 1265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (weighing \"the careful consideration the Agency has given the question over a long period of time\" as favoring deferring to the agency's action). It cannot find one in the SSA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Finally, as the court already has intimated, the WAC Disclosure Rule is far afield of any other type of rulemaking authority HHS has previously exercised under the SSA. This is not a case of interstitial rulemaking.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barnhart\n    </em>\n    , 535 U.S. at 222,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354957\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/212/#p222\">\n     122 S.Ct. 1265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This factor, too, counsels\n    against according deference to HHS's action here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Defendants respond to these points as follows. They argue that, unlike\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Williamson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Utility Air Regulatory Group\n    </em>\n    , this is not a case in which the agency has made a decision \"of vast economic or political impact.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 20. The WAC Disclosure Rule is not like the FDA announcing its regulation of the tobacco industry (\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Williamson\n    </em>\n    ) or the EPA expanding licensing requirements tenfold (\n    <em>\n     Utility Air\n    </em>\n    ). Instead, Defendants say, the rule here imposes only an \"exceedingly modest\" disclosure requirement that will cost the industry a \"relative pittance.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21 (estimating an annualized cost of $2.45 million, a \"relative pittance compared to the $4.2 billion spent on [direct-to-consumer] television advertising in 2017\") (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C732\">\n     84 Fed.

Therefore, they insist, the WAC Disclosure Rule is entirely compatible with the statutory scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    To be sure, the costs imposed by the WAC Disclosure Rule amount to a rounding error for the pharmaceutical industry. But that argument misses the point. It is the agency's incursion into a brand-new regulatory environment, and the rationale for it, that make the Rule so consequential. To accept the agency's justification here would swing the doors wide open to any regulation, rule, or policy that might reasonably result in cost savings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, unless expressly prohibited by Congress. Indeed, the agency identifies no limiting principle, aside from an express statutory withholding of authority. So, this case is not just about whether HHS can force drug companies to disclose their list prices in the name of lowering costs. Rather, the WAC Disclosure Rule represents a significant shift in HHS's ability to regulate the health care marketplace. Congress surely did not envision such an expansion of regulatory authority when it granted HHS the power to issue regulations necessary to carry out the \"efficient administration\" of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     D.
