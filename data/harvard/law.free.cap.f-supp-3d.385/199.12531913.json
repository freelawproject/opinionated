At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had no past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alterative, remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing: (1) the ALJ failed to properly weigh and consider the opinion of treating physician Dr. Myron Glick; (2) the ALJ's RFC finding is not supported by substantial evidence because he failed to properly take into account Plaintiff's inability to communicate in English; and (3) the ALJ erred as a matter of law in not eliciting testimony from a vocational expert. (Dkt. 12-1 at 9-15). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ failed to properly weight Dr. Glick's opinion and that this error necessitates remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Dr. Glick's Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Dr. Glick further opined that Plaintiff could walk only one city block \"without rest or severe pain,\" that she could sit for 15 minutes and stand for 10 minutes before needing to change position, that she was \"100% disabled\" and incapable of work, that she could rarely lift less than 10 pounds and could never lift more than 10 pounds, that she could never twist, stoop, or climb ladders and could occasionally climb stairs, that she was likely to be off-task for 25% or more of the workday, and that she was incapable of even low stress work.

With respect to the ALJ's one-sentence assertion that Dr. Glick's opinion \"contrasts sharply with the other evidence of record\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25), \"[u]nder the treating physician rule, an ALJ may not reject a treating physician's opinion based solely on such conclusory assertions of inconsistency with the medical record.\"\n   <em>\n    Marchetti v.

For example, while the ALJ asserts with elaboration that Dr. Glick's treatment notes show \"a full range of motion,\" a review of those treatment notes reveals Dr. Glick repeatedly recorded issues during physical examinations such as \"neck and trapezius tenderness pain with ROM of neck,\" \"lumbar and paravertebral tenderness,\" \"lumbar tenderness,\" \"pain with flexion of back,\" and \"pain with flexion.\" (Dkt. 7 at 375, 400, 408, 415). Additionally, as Dr. Glick noted in his medical source statement, MRIs performed in May 2013 and March 2015 showed that Plaintiff suffered from multiple disc herniations with stenosis and impingement of the nerve root. (Dkt. 7 at 278-282).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Turning to the ALJ's contention that Dr. Glick \"appears to have relied to a great extent on the subjective report of symptoms and limitations provided by [Plaintiff],\" (Dkt. 7 at 26), the ALJ provided no explanation for how he reached that conclusion. Dr. Glick's medical source statement specifically sets forth the clinical findings that informed his opinion, including the MRIs of Plaintiff's lumbar spine that showed multiple herniated discs and physical examinations showing positive straight leg raising tests on the left, lumbar tenderness, and decreased range of motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 551). Moreover, the Second Circuit has held that \"[t]he fact that [a treating physician] also relied on [a plaintiff's] subjective complaints hardly undermines his opinion as to her functional limitations, as [a] patient's report of complaints, or history, is an essential diagnostic tool.\"\n   <em>\n    Green-Younger v. Barnhart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533950\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/99/#p107\">\n    335 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that the ALJ failed to give good reasons for affording only little weight to Dr. Glick's opinion, in violation of the treating physician rule. This is particularly true in light of the fact that Dr. Glick's medical source statement was the only competent medical opinion in the record. This error by the ALJ warrants remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Remaining Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As set forth above, Plaintiff has identified additional reasons why she contends reversal or remand is warranted. However, because the Court has already determined, for the reasons previously discussed, that remand of this matter for further administrative proceedings is necessary, the Court declines to reach these issues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:15-CV-01160 (LEK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207017395\">\n    2016 WL 7017395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2016) (declining to reach arguments \"devoted to the question whether substantial evidence supports various determinations made by [the] ALJ\" where the court had already determined remand was warranted);\n   <em>\n    Morales v. Colvin,\n   </em>\n   No. 13 CIV. 06844 LGS DF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202137776\">\n    2015 WL 2137776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *28 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2015) (the court need not reach additional arguments regarding the ALJ's factual determinations \"given that the ALJ's analysis may change on these points upon remand\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 12) is granted to the extent that the matter is remanded for further administrative proceedings. Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 14) is denied. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    When referencing the page number(s) of docket citations in this Decision and Order, the Court will cite to the CM/ECF-generated page numbers that appear in the upper righthand corner of each document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
