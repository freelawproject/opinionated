(collectively, \"Ralph Lauren\"), and Ralph Lauren's marketing company, Vibes Media, LLC (\"Vibes\"). Hudson thereafter filed this putative class action lawsuit against Defendants for violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , claiming that Defendants violated the TCPA by sending him text messages using an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\") without his express consent and by failing to include opt-out instructions in each message. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Court finds that the first amended complaint does not conclusively establish the existence of prior express consent to receive the number of messages Defendants sent Hudson and that Hudson has sufficiently alleged the use of an ATDS. But because the TCPA and its regulations do not provide a basis for Hudson's claim for failure to include opt-out instructions in each text message, Hudson cannot pursue this aspect of his TCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ralph Lauren works with Vibes, a marketing company, to promote the Ralph\n   Lauren retail and clothing brand through advertising and promotional campaigns sent to consumers through their mobile devices.

Defendants proceeded to send Hudson more than six messages a month, all from the same 894-48 SMS code. For example, in July 2016, Defendants sent Hudson ten text messages, and, in July 2017, Defendants sent him eight text messages. In total, he received at least thirty-two messages over the monthly limits to which he consented. Out of the approximately 188 text messages Hudson received from Defendants, eighty percent did not include instructions as to how to stop receiving the messages. All of the text messages marketed Ralph Lauren's products, and none addressed Hudson by name. Defendants sent similar text messages to other individuals as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint, not its merits.

Hudson responds, however, that he provided only limited consent to the receipt of text messages, with Defendants having exceeded the scope of consent with respect to the thirty-two messages they sent above the six-message monthly limit.

Defendants have provided a declaration from Jennifer Zanella, a Vibes employee, which attaches the text messages exchanged between Hudson and Defendants. Hudson does not object to the Court's consideration of these exhibits in deciding the motion to dismiss, and the Court finds doing so appropriate because Hudson refers to the text messages in his first amended complaint and they are central to his claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hecker v.

But Defendants' arguments rest on their interpretation of Hudson's consent, claiming that it had no limits despite language suggesting the contrary. As a result of the limiting language, the Court has found that Hudson has plausibly alleged that Defendants exceeded the scope of Hudson's consent, thus potentially exposing Defendants to TCPA liability for those messages that exceeded the scope of his consent. Therefore, the Court need not reach the due process or breach of contract arguments at this time. The Court also does not find Hudson waived his TCPA claim where he arguably addressed both the breach of contract and due process arguments together.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 45 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Seventh Circuit did consider a TCPA case where only three of the sixty text messages the plaintiff received included opt-out instructions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Blow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276950\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/793/#p805\">\n     855 F.3d at 803-04\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
