[D.E. 40]. Plaintiff responded on October 9, 2018 [D.E. 48] to which Carnival replied on\n   October 26, 2018. [D.E. 55]. On November 5, 2018, the Court granted Carnival's request to supplement its motion and Plaintiff responded on December 10, 2018 [D.E. 64] to which Carnival replied on January 2, 2019. [D.E. 69]. Therefore, Carnival's motion is now ripe for disposition. After careful consideration of the motion, response, reply, relevant authority, and for the reasons discussed below, Carnival's motion to dismiss should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Plaintiff alleges that, on July 6, 2017, the Decedent was a passenger aboard the Carnival\n   <em>\n    Freedom\n   </em>\n   where he sustained an injury which ultimately led to his death. Plaintiff claims that the Decedent was injured while participating in the Isla Pasion shore excursion in Cozumel, Mexico which was owned and operated by Defendant Operadora Isla de la Pasion (the \"Excursion Entity\"). Plaintiff's complaint contained five causes of action. On August 7, 2018, Judge Williams adopted the undersigned's Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") on Defendant's motion to dismiss. [D.E. 35]. On August 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint with four counts - three of which are aimed at Carnival.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [D.E. 38].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Although not definitive, Plaintiff's familiar connection with the decedent is undoubtedly strong. Therefore, Plaintiff has shown that there is a material likelihood that the appointment will ultimately be made. Consequently, Defendant's motion to dismiss on this basis should be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Having said that, of course, the entire matter may be revisited at a later stage of this litigation if it turns out that Plaintiff's promises are fading. Standing is a matter that can be raised at any time in a case. And certainly before any final judgment is ever entered Plaintiff's standing as personal representative cannot be in doubt.

The excursion was advertised as a \"getaway\n   to a private island for cruise guests, complete with food, beverages, and water float inflatable.\" [D.E. 1]. However, the water inflatables were in an area by a Mexican beach that was subjected to changing tides and shallow water. The Decedent dove into the shallow water, aiming for an inflatable.

The Decedent died on the shore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that DOHSA does not apply because (1) the events that led to the Decedent's death were not related to maritime activities, and (2) the injury occurred on the beach - not in navigable open waters.

Plaintiff, however, insists that the facts in\n   <em>\n    Moyer\n   </em>\n   are very distinguishable because the activities that led to the Decedent's death are more similarly aligned to a land-based excursion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our objective assessment of the dispute convinces us that Plaintiff's land-based argument holds little weight because the injury indisputably occurred in the water. The fact that the use of the water inflatables began as part of a shore excursion is beside the point because, like the snorkeling shore expedition in\n   <em>\n    Moyer,\n   </em>\n   such use ended up reaching the water as intended.

Based on these allegations, Plaintiff argues that the motion to dismiss or strike the punitive damages claim should be denied, at least at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We have conducted an extensive review of this issue and conclude, based upon the state of the law today, that punitive damages are unavailing in this case for two separate reasons. First, because we have found that DOHSA governs the damages recoverable in this case, punitive damages are not recoverable as a matter of law. We will discuss our analysis of that particular question in some detail. Second, we alternatively conclude that, even if punitive damages were still viable (either because DOHSA was later found not to apply or because punitive damages were still possible even in a DOHSA case) the allegations in this complaint do not support a plausible finding of intentional or wanton conduct necessary to sustain a punitive damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    (a) Punitive damages are barred under DOHSA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Fifth and Ninth Circuits expressly hold that punitive damages are barred as a matter of law under DOHSA for any wrongful death claims covered by the statute. Most district courts have followed suit. The Supreme Court, however, has never addressed the issue directly, and neither has the Eleventh Circuit as best as we can tell. Some in the admiralty bar, however, have advanced the argument that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   should reopen the question. And some commentary on the subject, both before and after\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding,\n   </em>\n   have described the issue, as settled as it may be among lower federal courts, to be an open question. In our view, however, the text and historical purpose of the DOHSA preclude such an interpretation. Congress is free to amend the statute to provide for a punitive damage recovery. But until it does, the majority view is sound and DOHSA currently precludes any recovery for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, we look back to the relevant historical context. Prior to the enactment of DOHSA, tort recoveries in admiralty cases were limited to applicable wrongful death statutes enacted by particular states. The Supreme Court in 1886 declined to recognize a common law wrongful death claim arising under general maritime law separate and apart from the scope and limits of any applicable state statute.\n   <em>\n    The Harrisburg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299708\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/199/#p200\">\n    119 U.S. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299708\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/199/#p200\">\n    7 S.Ct. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299708\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/199/#p200\">\n    30 L.Ed. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1886) (citing [\n   <em>\n    Mobile Life] Insurance Co. v.

By the use of that term, Congress obviously intended to adopt common law principles of \"compensation\" into the statute. And\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   that compensatory and remedial concept was included as evidenced by the next limitation that followed: \"for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit was brought ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"Pecuniary\" losses were also specifically recognized in the common law at the time as being limited to compensation for the actual wrong suffered by a plaintiff, and nothing more.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648323\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/91/489/#p492\">\n    91 U.S. at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is undoubtedly true that the allowance of anything more than an adequate pecuniary indemnity for a wrong suffered is a great departure from the principle on which damages in civil suits are awarded.\").

Congress only expressly sanctioned a compensatory damage award for actual damages and losses suffered by the decedent's survivors. Armed with that knowledge, Congress chose to pick and choose from the available remedies in determining what could be awarded under DOHSA for deaths on the high seas in admiralty. In doing so, Congress was certainly extending protections to the decedent's survivors that\n   <em>\n    The Harrisburg\n   </em>\n   had declined to award without legislative action. But those protections were expressly limited in scope. And they certainly\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   include exemplary or punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, Congress's use of that damage limitation was not novel. The Congress had already enacted a similar survivor's wrongful death statute, the Federal Employer's Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which had just been amended in 1908. That statute granted a right of recovery for injured workers or their survivors against railroad companies operating in interstate commerce, but also based on a similar damage limitation: \"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such\n   employee; ...\" Though the extent of \"damages\" available was not expressly defined in that statute, the Supreme Court recognized that using the common law term \"damages\" in isolation, like other survivor's statutes of the day, was tantamount to a limitation for only pecuniary losses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   This cause of action is independent of any cause of action which the decedent had, and includes no damages which he might have recovered for his injury if he had survived. It is one beyond that which the decedent had,-one proceeding upon altogether different principles. It is a liability for the loss and damage sustained by relatives dependent upon the decedent.\n   <em>\n    It is therefore a liability for the pecuniary damage resulting to them, and for that only\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Michigan Cent.

In\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   , after extended discussion and analysis, the Court limited the survivors in a maritime wrongful death action to recovery of their \"pecuniary losses.\" As a result, the Court denied recovery for damages for loss of society.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    498 U.S. at 30-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In considering this element of damages, the Court began its analysis by interpreting its DOHSA decision in\n   <em>\n    Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   . It noted that\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   rejected a claim for loss of society because Congress, in DOHSA, expressly limited recovery to \"pecuniary losses.\" It therefore declined to supplement the statute and allow more expansive damages. The Court emphasized the important language it relied on from\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   : \"But in an 'area covered by the statute, it would be no more appropriate to prescribe a different measure of damages than to prescribe a different statute of limitations, or a different class of beneficiaries.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    Id. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court then reasoned that its logic in\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham\n   </em>\n   controlled its decision in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   even though DOHSA did not directly apply. That opinion first acknowledged that, unlike the statutory language in DOHSA, neither the Jones Act nor FELA made explicit the \"pecuniary loss\" limitation. The Court concluded, however, that the limitation applied, as per\n   <em>\n    Vreeland\n   </em>\n   . The Court therefore squarely held that the recovery of the deceased seaman;' survivors under the Jones Act is limited to pecuniary losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   Court then turned to the issue in that case as to the scope of the survivor's recovery for unseaworthiness under the general maritime law. As the Court explained, \"our place in the constitutional scheme does not permit us to sanction more expansive remedies in a judicially created cause of action in which liability is without fault than Congress has allowed in cases of death resulting from negligence. We must conclude that there is no recovery for loss of society in a general maritime action for the wrongful death of a Jones Act seamen.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the Court held that the damages available under the general maritime law cause of action for wrongful death-which cause of action the Court recognized for the first time in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   -were likewise limited to recovery of pecuniary losses. It follows from\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   that the same result flows when a general maritime law personal injury claim is joined with a Jones Act claim as well as a DOHSA claim. So\n   <em>\n    Miles's\n   </em>\n   conclusion applies with equal force here: regardless of opposing policy arguments, \"Congress has struck the balance for us\" in determining the scope of damages.

An overly broad reading of Atlantic Sounding would make punitive damages available even in the absence of a showing of intentional misconduct. However, the Court believes that Atlantic Sounding's statement that \"[p]unitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful or outrageous conduct\" was simply a general description of the circumstances in which such damages are available at common law, and was not intended to announce a bright-line standard of liability governing recovery of punitive damages in all maritime tort claims. Again, the Court notes that Atlantic Sounding addressed only the availability of punitive damages in a cause of action for maintenance and cure, and did not specifically discuss personal injury claims brought by ship passengers. Given the relatively narrow scope of the issues presented in Atlantic Sounding, the Court does not believe that holding should be read so broadly as to find it in conflict with Amtrak. Therefore, the Court finds that Amtrak is controlling on this issue, and Plaintiffs in this action may recover punitive damages only upon a showing of intentional misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Crusan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013743473\">\n    2015 WL 13743473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (citations omitted). We agree with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Crusan\n   </em>\n   and hold that Plaintiff must plausibly allege a factual basis for intentional misconduct in order to recover punitive damages from Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To demonstrate intentional misconduct, the plaintiff must show \"the defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of the conduct and the high probability that injury or damage to the claimant would result and, despite that knowledge, intentionally pursued that course of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Mee Industries v.

Plaintiff's amended complaint does not even come close. It wholly fails to allege intentional misconduct on the part of Defendant and resorts, instead, to a straightforward gross negligence theory: \"Defendant intentionally chose to promote the use of the water inflatables without warning guests of the dangers associated with the excursion.\" [D.E. 48]. Adding the word \"intentionally\" to that allegation is useless because the wrongful act is still at its core a lack of warning. There is nothing\n   extraordinary about \"intentionally promoting\" or \"intentionally using\" water inflatables. And neither act can be deemed \"misconduct.\" What can be negligent conduct is the failure to warn of a dangerous condition or a troubled excursion operator. That is all that this complaint alleges. So, in other words, Plaintiff's entire liability theory is a negligent failure to warn. That is clearly not sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   and DOHSA to support a punitive damage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Intentional or grossly reckless conduct in this circumstance would be a claim that an employee on the vessel sabotaged the inflatable. Or a claim that the shore operator told Defendant that it used inflatables that were known to fail. Or a claim that an employee of the vessel intentionally pushed the Plaintiff onto the inflatable when he knew it was not yet safe to do so. Something, anything, that would come close to an \"exceptional circumstance\" or \"intentional misconduct.\" Clearly\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   and DOHSA do not envision punitive damages arising from traditionally negligent conduct, like failures to warn or failures to supervise excursion operators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint, in so far as it includes a claim for punitive damages in this case, must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the references to punitive damages should be\n   <strong>\n    STRICKEN\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.\n     <em>\n      Count I - Negligence\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Turning then to other substantive arguments in the motion, in our initial R &amp; R on Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint, we found that Plaintiff's original complaint failed to allege any supporting facts showing that Defendant had notice as to the dangerous condition giving rise to their duty to warn, and imposed heightened duties on Defendant beyond the duty to warn. [D.E. 33]. We also found that Plaintiff's initial claim for negligent hiring or selection was insufficiently pled and recommended that the count be dismissed. The District Judge adopted the R &amp; R and entered an Order of dismissal over Plaintiff's objections. [D.E. 34, 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint, filed in response to the R &amp; R and the dismissal Order, asserted revised negligence claims in four counts, three of which related to liability against Carnival. Defendant, however, has once again moved to dismiss those counts on the grounds that the complaint still fails to adequately allege notice against Carnival to give rise to liability, that it fails because the condition was open and obvious as a matter of law, and that it effectively seeks to heighten the standard of care against Carnival in derogation of maritime law principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In assessing these revised claims, we begin with the rule that, to state a negligence claim, \"a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular injury; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach actually and proximately caused the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaparro v.

As Plaintiff notes in her response to Defendant's motion, Count III is based on an alternative theory supporting her negligence count, that Defendant is liable for the Excursion Entity's negligence because it held that company out as its agent.
