New York City Chapter (\"AHRC\"), CBRE, Inc. (\"CBRE\"), and Universal Protection Services (\"UPS\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging discrimination on the basis of race arising out of several encounters in the lobby of 83 Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan. Plaintiff alleges six causes of action against all Defendants, claiming violations of three provisions of the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"), N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-107(4), 8-107(6), and 8-107(7) ; the common-law tort of negligent retention, and two federal anti-discrimination statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985. Defendant UPS moves to dismiss all counts against it on the basis of failure to state a claim. For the reasons set forth in the remainder of this Opinion, the Court grants the motion with respect to Plaintiff's federal claims, the negligent retention claim, and the NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(7) claim, and denies the motion with respect to\n   Plaintiff's claims under NYCHRL \u00a7\u00a7 8-107(4) and 8-107(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an Asian-American man who resides in Queens, New York. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). Defendant AHRC is a New York corporation with its principal place of business at 83 Maiden Lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Defendant CBRE is a New York corporation that provides building management services to 83 Maiden Lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8). Defendant UPS is a New York limited liability company that contracted to provide security services to 83 Maiden Lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The June 21, 2016 Lobby Incidents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 21, 2016, Plaintiff entered the lobby of 83 Maiden Lane to make an appointment with Access Community Health Center (\"Access\"), a tenant of the building. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, 20). While Plaintiff was in the lobby, a porter, Sammy Rivera, repeatedly uttered \"Ni Hao,\" a Mandarin greeting, to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). Plaintiff informed Rivera that he was Korean, not Chinese, and after Rivera asked how to say hello in Korean, provided the Korean word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rivera repeated the Korean greeting and then walked to the building's security desk and spoke with Justin Brooks, a UPS employee and the security guard on duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges that within his earshot, Rivera said to Brooks, \"That chink says he's not Chinese, he said he's Korean. How can I tell the difference? All chinks look the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He further alleges that both Rivera and Brooks laughed after this comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff proceeded to visit Access, but, upon returning to the lobby, heard Rivera utter further racial epithets, including \"ching chong.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). Brooks and Rivera laughed together in response to these comments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The June 22, 2016 Report and Lobby Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 22, 2016, Plaintiff returned to 83 Maiden Lane for an appointment with Access and scheduled a follow-up appointment for August 2016. (SAC \u00b6 22). Plaintiff also inquired at the front desk in the lobby where he could file a complaint regarding Rivera's and Brooks's behavior the prior day, and he was directed to AHRC's offices in the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff spoke with Steve Williams, AHRC's employee relations manager, who informed him that Pamela Minkoff, another AHRC employee, would follow up regarding investigating the claims and potential disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon departing and returning to the lobby, Plaintiff again crossed paths with Rivera and Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Plaintiff states that Rivera glared at him and called out \"What's up boss?\" to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Brooks, who was standing nearby remarked\n   of Plaintiff, \"He ain't gonna say nothing to you\" (the \"June 22 Remark\"), and Rivera and Brooks both laughed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Williams reached out to Plaintiff later that day, and Plaintiff informed him of this additional incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The AHRC Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Minkoff investigated the incident and spoke with Brooks at some point between June 22, 2016, and July 7, 2016. (SAC \u00b6 35). Brooks initially denied that anything had occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After receiving an email from Plaintiff, Minkoff informed Dawn Shillingford, a CBRE employee, that she believed that Brooks knew more than to which he had admitted in their prior meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). Minkoff and Shillingford met with Rivera on July 7, 2016, to discuss the incident and then spoke with Brooks a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). After this second conversation, Brooks wrote an incident report on UPS letterhead, in which he provided his description of the incident and its aftermath. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He wrote that an individual of Asian descent \"came into the building ... and was greeted by the porter in a language that he didn't speak[,] he was offended by the approach. The issue went to [Minkoff]. We had a meeting to discuss the matter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 14, 2016, AHRC concluded its investigation and informed Plaintiff that it could not substantiate his allegations. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 36-44). Plaintiff states that he received an email from Williams in response to this conclusion, in which Williams expressed surprise at the lack of punishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). Plaintiff alleges that he did not attend his August 2016 follow-up appointment at Access, as he feared further racial harassment from Rivera and Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 28, 2018, Plaintiff filed this suit in New York State Supreme Court against AHRC and CBRE, alleging discrimination on the basis of race, and on March 28, 2018, CBRE filed a notice of removal to this Court. (Dkt. #6). On March 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint adding UPS, Brooks's employer, as a defendant. (Dkt. #18). On July 10, 2018, UPS filed a letter requesting leave to file a motion to dismiss the claims against it. (Dkt. #30). On July 31, 2018, the Court held a pre-motion conference, during which it granted Plaintiff leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (the \"SAC\"), and ordered Defendants to move or otherwise respond to the SAC on or before September 14, 2018. (Dkt. #34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed the SAC. (Dkt. #35). On September 14, 2018, Defendants CBRE and AHRC filed answers, and Defendant UPS moved to dismiss all claims against it. (Dkt. #38, 39, 40-21). Plaintiff filed his opposition to UPS's motion on October 15, 2018. (Dkt. #47). UPS replied to Plaintiff's opposition submission on October 29, 2018. (Dkt. #48). Accordingly, the motion is fully briefed and ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Pl. Opp. 5-13). UPS, in turn, argues that the SAC is deficient for three reasons. (Def. Br. 5-10).\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff fails to plead that Brooks's conduct rose to the level of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has not alleged the violation of an enumerated right protected by Section 1981. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9).\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff fails to allege that Brooks was acting within the scope of his employment, such that\n   UPS can be held liable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiff Adequately Pleads an Intent to Discriminate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that the allegations against Brooks are sufficient at this stage to show an intent to discriminate. Plaintiff alleges that the laughter at two separate incidents of racial abuse by Rivera on June 21, 2016, and the June 22 Remark are all evidence of Brooks's intent to discriminate. (Pl. Opp. 6). UPS counters that laughter in response to racial abuse is insufficient to state a claim for discrimination, and that the June 22 Remark has no racial connotation that can be fairly inferred. While the Court agrees with UPS regarding the latter, it finds that the two instances of laughter in response to racist slurs are enough to show an intent to discriminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Courts have found laughter at racial slurs to be evidence of discriminatory intent in the employment context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swinton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Potomac Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466968\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/794/#p801\">\n    270 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801-10 (9th Cir. 2001) (referring to supervisor's laughter at racist jokes as evidence of discrimination);\n   <em>\n    Rodrigues\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Motorworld Auto.

While UPS is correct that numerous instances of discrimination were alleged, the Ninth Circuit's finding regarding the individual dean was that the laughing response to this slur was itself evidence of discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    Chuang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11234918\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/1115/#p1128\">\n    225 F.3d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiff alleges that Brooks laughed in response to Rivera's use of \"chink\" as Plaintiff entered the lobby and to Rivera's use of the words \"ching chong\" as Plaintiff left. (Pl. Opp. 6). While the exact point at which laughter at racially insensitive remarks constitutes evidence of intent to discriminate is unnecessary to define, the Court finds that allegations of repeated laughter in response to racist slurs in two separate incidents is sufficient to plead an intent to discriminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   By contrast, the Court does not find that the allegations concerning the June 22 Remark suffice to show an intent to discriminate. The words \"he ain't gonna say nothing to you\" contain no reference to race, and Brooks took no action towards Plaintiff at that time. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Ezell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edwards Theatres, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 104 Civ. 6533 (SMS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203782698\">\n    2006 WL 3782698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2006), and\n   <em>\n    Feacher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Intercontinental Hotels Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091644\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/563/389/\">\n    563 F. Supp. 2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. 2008), for the proposition that words or conduct without express reference to race can constitute racial discrimination. (Pl. Opp. 7-8). However, and as UPS notes, in both cases the words were spoken alongside racially discriminatory conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 2-3). Here, the June 22 Remark came after Rivera said, \"What's up, boss?,\" itself not a racially explicit remark. (SAC \u00b6 35). Plaintiff argues that the June 22 Remark implied that Asians were physically inferior to other\n   races, and that this implication can be discerned from the context in which the statement was made. (Pl. Opp. 8 (\"[W]hen put into context of the repeated incitement from the day before, the phrase suggests Brooks held a derogatory stereotype that Asians, particularly Asian males, are physically inferior to other races.\")). This allegation is nowhere in the SAC, however, and the Court sees no grounds for inferring such a meaning from a statement that refers neither to Asian-Americans nor to physical attributes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court declines to find that the June 22 Remark is evidence of an intent to discriminate. However, given the Court's finding that the allegations concerning Brooks's laughter at Rivera's explicitly racist remarks are adequate, the Court turns to the third element of the Section 1981 claim, i.e., whether the conduct concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff Has Failed to Plead the Denial of a Protected Right\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff offers two rights that he alleges Brooks's conduct violated: (i) his right to a contracted-for experience with Access, and (ii) his right to full and equal benefit of the laws, which he alleges was impaired by Brooks's alleged violation of the NYCHRL. (Pl. Opp. 8-13). Neither claim suffices. As described herein, the Court finds that the SAC does not adequately allege a violation of a contract between Plaintiff and Access and, further, that violations of the NYCHRL do not create a cause of action under Section 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Contracted-for Experience Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff cites to numerous cases for the principle that customers can bring claims against businesses they patronize when discriminatory conduct prevents them from engaging in the experience for which they contracted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 8-9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lizardo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Denny's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20976808\">\n    2000 WL 976808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. 2000),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9462646\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/94/\">\n    270 F.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2001) )). This argument, however, misses a critical point: Plaintiff fails to allege the existence of a contractual relationship with UPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The cases Plaintiff cites universally involve discrimination by the businesses themselves, and not by third parties. As a sister court in this District has explained, \"liability under [ Section] 1981 for interference with a third-party contract attaches only to persons who actually had the power or authority to prevent the plaintiffs from contracting with the third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Ginx, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soho All.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087099\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/720/342/#p358\">\n    720 F.

Plaintiff makes no allegation that Brooks was aware of Plaintiff's contract with Access, or that he or anyone else at UPS possessed sufficient authority to interfere with Plaintiff's ability to contract with Access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff cites a single, out-of-district case for the principle that a third party can be liable for obstructing a plaintiff's right to contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 11). However, in that case,\n   <em>\n    Vakharia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swedish Covenant Hospital\n   </em>\n   , the third party was the plaintiff's employer, which, in terminating her employment, prevented her from making contracts with her patients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7385239\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/765/461/#p471\">\n    765 F. Supp. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471 (N.D. Ill. 1991). To summarize this case is to distinguish it, inasmuch as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Vakharia\n   </em>\n   clearly had the power to prevent a contract between the plaintiff and others. Here, however, Brooks lacked authority over or even awareness of the relationship between Plaintiff and Access. Plaintiff has thus failed to allege that UPS can be held liable for interference with Plaintiff's contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to plead that the contractual relationship with Access included his experience while walking through the lobby of 83 Maiden Lane. As UPS notes, several courts in this District have held that walking through a lobby is not part of a patron's contract with a business. (Def. Reply 4).

The court found that once the plaintiff's purchase had occurred, the contractual relationship with the store ended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 392.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff rejoins that to receive services from Access, one must walk through the lobby, and reasons from this fact that the relationship must necessarily extend to entrances and exits. (Pl. Opp. 11). The Court concludes that while blocking physical access to the lobby might prevent the formation of a contract with Access, Plaintiff has failed to allege that the contractual relationship with Access extended to interpersonal dealings he might have in the lobby while entering or exiting the building.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elliott,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11116027\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/135/1312/#p1315\">\n    135 F.

UPS responds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the NYCHRL and, in the alternative, that Section 1981's enumerated right requirement cannot be satisfied by the violation of a parallel anti-discrimination statute. (Def. Reply 5). The Court will address the merits of Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims later in this Opinion. At this point, the Court concludes generally that Plaintiff cannot bootstrap a Section 1981 claim onto an NYCHRL violation, because the \"full and equal benefit clause\" of Section 1981 requires a connection to state (and not municipal) law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To establish a violation of Section 1981's guarantee of \"full and equal benefit\" of laws, a plaintiff must \"[i] allege racial animus ...; [ii] identify a relevant 'law or proceeding for the security of persons and property;' and [iii] allege that defendants deprived them of the 'full and equal benefit' thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"61984\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/414/385/\">\n    414 F.

Plaintiff attempts to argue that Brooks engaged in a separate conspiracy with Minkoff to deny him rights under Section 1981. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 14). In support, Plaintiff alleges that Minkoff told her supervisors that she suspected Brooks knew more than he let on and re-interviewed Brooks based on this suspicion; Brooks later wrote up an incident report providing a version of events that differed from Plaintiff's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). The Court finds that these allegations fail to demonstrate any meeting of the minds to further an unlawful end. Plaintiff's allegation that Minkoff knew that \"Brooks was lying to cover up his discrimination of Benzinger\" is asserted in a wholly conclusory fashion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Beyond the allegation that Minkoff doubted Brooks's initial lack of recollection and accepted his later version of events, Plaintiff pleads no facts suggesting that Brooks and Minkoff ever reached an agreement to further unlawful ends. Where, as here, \"a complaint pleads facts\n   that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

UPS does not dispute here that the building was a place of public accommodation. Instead, it argues for dismissal on the basis that Plaintiff has alleged nothing more than stray remarks, and stray remarks cannot sustain a claim for discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def Br. 12-13; Def. Reply 7-8). However, the cases on which it relies arose at the summary judgment stage. In\n   <em>\n    Fruchtman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   , the First Department upheld a grant of summary judgment in favor of an employer in a case of gender discrimination, finding that the employer had provided compelling evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons for the dismissal and finding that stray remarks with no apparent connection to any employment action failed to demonstrate gender bias.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273352\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/129/500/\">\n    129 A.D.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273352\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/129/500/\">\n    11 N.Y.S.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 (1st Dep't 2015).

The Court does not find these cases to be comparable. UPS has not argued that there are legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for Brooks to laugh at Rivera's use of racial slurs. More fundamentally, the Court readily understands why Plaintiff would consider such conduct to be an indirect declaration that he was unwelcome due to his race. NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(4)(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff spends much of his briefing suggesting that Brooks incited Rivera and offering his own analysis of Brooks's June 22 Remark. (Pl. Opp. 20-22). As UPS notes, the argument that Brooks's laughter constituted incitement was not advanced until Plaintiff's opposition. (Def. Reply 1 n.3). The Court agrees; in any event, it does not find that Brooks incited Rivera, nor does it (as discussed above) agree that the June 22 Remark was racial in nature. However, the Court does not find that such allegations are necessary to allow the claim to proceed under the NYCHRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The New York City Human Rights Commission has found that a comment by\n   a taxi driver to a gay couple to stop kissing while they were in his cab could \"on its own...establish a violation of the NYCHRL.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Commission on Human Rights ex. rel.

Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Under NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(7)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(7) creates liability where a defendant \"retaliate[s] or discriminate[s] in any manner against any person because such person has opposed any practice forbidden under this chapter.\" NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(7). To make out the claim, Plaintiff must show that (i) he has engaged in protected activity; (ii) Defendant was aware that he participated in such activity; (iii) he suffered an adverse action based upon his activity; and (iv) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forrest\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jewish Guild for the Blind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456511\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/295/#p312\">\n    3 N.Y.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312-13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456511\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/295/#p312\">\n    786 N.Y.S.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456511\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/295/#p312\">\n    819 N.E.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). It is undisputed that Plaintiff has alleged protected activity in the form of reporting Brooks and Rivera. Plaintiff further alleges two types of adverse action.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , he alleges that UPS retaliated against him by failing to suspend Brooks, leaving him free to retaliate against others. (Pl. Opp. 29).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that by denying that an incident occurred and writing a false report, Brooks engaged in retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). The Court finds these actions, even if proven, do not suffice to state a claim for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments in this regard run into the immediate difficulty that nearly every retaliation case arises in the employment context. Indeed, Plaintiff's own description of the elements of the offense states that the Plaintiff must show \"a causal connection exist[s] between the protected activity and the adverse\n   <em>\n    employment\n   </em>\n   action.\" (Pl. Opp. 28 (emphasis added)). In each of the cases Plaintiff has cited (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30), the plaintiff alleged that an employer took some action specifically directed at them in response their reporting.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York City Hous. Auth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936942\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/62/\">\n    61 A.D.3d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936942,3916902\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/872/27/\">\n    872 N.Y.S.2d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dep't 2009) (\"[Plaintiff allege[d] that ... she had to do work outside of her regular duties.\"). Putting aside that this incident occurred outside the employment context, Plaintiff has failed to allege that either Brooks's retention of his job or Brooks's reporting of the incident was an adverse action towards Plaintiff based on his protected conduct. Indeed, neither of these actions was directed at Plaintiff. To be sure, Plaintiff has alleged that neither Brooks nor UPS responded adequately to the incident; while this may suffice to plead aiding and abetting liability under the NYCHRL, it does not suffice to state a claim for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Negligent Retention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff's final claim can be dispensed with quickly. To state a claim for negligent retention, a plaintiff must allege that a defendant \"knew of the employee's propensity to [commit the alleged misconduct] or that defendants should have known of such propensity had they conducted an adequate hiring procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251858\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/239/755/\">\n    239 A.D.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251858\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/239/755/\">\n    657 N.Y.S.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Dep't 1997). Plaintiff makes no such allegation. In Plaintiff's opposition, he states that UPS knew of Brooks's propensity for harassment once Plaintiff reported the initial incident to Williams on June 21, 2016. (Pl. Opp. 31-32). Significantly, however, Plaintiff provides the wrong date in his opposition, as he alleges in the SAC that he spoke with Williams on June 22. (SAC \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Using the correct date, Plaintiff alleges that UPS was on notice after the meeting with Williams on June 22, and should have acted prior to the second lobby incident on June 22. (Pl. Opp. 32). The problem with this claim is clear from the preceding sentence: Plaintiff presumably is stating that UPS could have learned from Williams, an AHRC employee, of the June 21 incident and disciplined or terminated Brooks in the time between when Plaintiff left Williams's office and entered the lobby. The Court does not consider this a plausible allegation that UPS knew or should have known of Brooks's alleged propensity to violate the anti-discrimination laws and dismisses Plaintiff's negligent retention claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons above, UPS's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiff's negligent retention, NYCHRL \u00a7 8-107(7), and Sections 1981 and 1985 claims are dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff's NYCHRL \u00a7\u00a7 8-107(4) and 8-107(6) claims continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The parties are hereby ORDERED to provide a joint letter and case management plan in accordance with this Court's Individual Rules of Practice in Civil Cases to the Court on or before July 12, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The facts in this section are drawn principally from the Second Amended (\"SAC\"), the well-pleaded allegations of which are taken as true for purposes of this motion. (Dkt. #35). The Court focuses on the factual allegations concerning movant UPS.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    For ease of reference, the Court refers to Defendant UPS's Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion to Dismiss as \"Def. Br.\" (Dkt. #42); to Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss as \"Pl. Opp.\" (Dkt. #47); and to UPS's Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion to Dismiss as \"Def. Reply\" (Dkt. #48). Plaintiff's opposition brief does not comply with Rule 4.B of the Court's Individual Rules of Practice in Civil Cases, which limits opposition briefs to 25 pages. While the Court has considered the arguments contained therein, future submissions that exceed the Court's page limits will be stricken and disregarded.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Plaintiff does not argue that his decision not to return to Access for his follow-up appointment in August 2016 gives rise to a Section 1981 claim. The Court finds that Plaintiff must plead he was directly denied the benefits of his contract, not that the conduct affected his decision not to continue engagement with a contractual partner. In the retail context, for example, courts have found that a plaintiff's allegation that he was scared away from returning goods is insufficient to state a Section 1981 claim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Garrett\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Tandy Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410067\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/94/#p102\">\n     295 F.3d 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 102 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"The naked assertion that a party might have elected to return a previously purchased product had he believed the environment to be more welcoming is simply too ephemeral a hook from which to hang a cause of action under [Section] 1981.\").\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    Additionally, even were the Court to consider Plaintiff's follow-up appointment a sufficiently definite element of his contract with Access, the SAC still fails to plead that Brooks had the power to prevent Plaintiff from contracting with Access.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    UPS states in the same paragraph that Brooks was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. (Def. Reply 6). This fact does not appear in the SAC, and it cannot be considered by the Court at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
