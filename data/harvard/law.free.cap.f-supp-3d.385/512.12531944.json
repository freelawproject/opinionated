Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The EEOC is a federal agency created by Congress to administer the nation's employment-nondiscrimination laws. The EEOC enforces these laws according to the scheme established by Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   As relevant to this dispute, the EEOC typically investigates alleged violations of a nondiscrimination law after receiving a charge of discrimination filed by an aggrieved employee, a job applicant, or a Commissioner of the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. The latter method is known as a Commissioner's charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When it completes an investigation, the EEOC makes a \"reasonable cause\" determination-an official determination on whether there is reasonable cause to believe an employer has violated a nondiscrimination law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the EEOC finds reasonable cause, it may sue the employer or issue a right-to-sue notice to inform an aggrieved person that he or she has the right to file his or her own suit within a specified time. Importantly, private parties are generally precluded from suing an employer during the early stages of an EEOC investigation.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   This guides employment-discrimination issues through an administrative process with the hope of\n   encouraging steady oversight and conciliation rather than rampant litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, BNSF received notice of a Commissioner's charge indicating the EEOC would begin investigating BNSF for purported violations of the ADA and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 8b, ECF No. 1.

BNSF dealt frequently with the EEOC's Denver field office. Though BNSF worked with the EEOC on several requests, it also challenged some and declined others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 29, 2018, the EEOC issued right-to-sue letters to 54 individuals.

First, BNSF contends the letters fixed legal rights \"in a very straightforward manner\"-they explicitly \"purport[ ] to grant others the '\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   ' to sue BNSF, a '\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   ' BNSF contends EEOC granted in derogation of EEOC's statutory responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (emphasis added).

Issuing right-to-sue letters, as the name suggests, is an action \"by which rights or obligations [are] determined, or from which legal consequences ... flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawkes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597316\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1807/#p1814\">\n    136 S. Ct. at 1814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Title VII erects an intricate infrastructure for the enforcement of nondiscrimination policies that balances regulatory oversight with the right of individuals to pursue their own discrimination claims, all while protecting employers from frivolous prosecution. As part of this delicate scheme, Title VII establishes when and to whom the EEOC\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   issue right-to-sue letters and\n   <em>\n    mandates\n   </em>\n   that recipients not file suit more than \"ninety days after the giving of such notice.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In other words, \"an employee must obtain a right-to-sue letter before bringing suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Mach Mining, LLC v.

Right-to-sue letters therefore determine a recipient's \"right\" to sue and have the \"legal consequence\" of concluding the EEOC's monopoly on a given enforcement matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   this theory alone, the Court finds the EEOC's issuance of right-to-sue letters satisfies the second traditional condition of finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is worth addressing, however, the second theory under which BNSF suggests the right-to-sue letters caused the requisite legal consequences. According to an emerging body of law, there is reason to believe agency action contravening a statutory obligation is per se reviewable under the APA.

BNSF argues that, by ignoring the confidentiality requirements of Title VII, the EEOC violated important procedural protections guaranteed under the law.

This relief is something BNSF \"could seek ... in any lawsuit that is actually filed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1357648\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/638/873/#p879\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   BNSF counters that the \"EEOC cites no authority, and BNSF is aware of none, holding that EEOC's violation of its confidentiality obligations would be a defense available to BNSF in such a lawsuit.\" Pl.'s Resp. 21, ECF No. 12. And even if it could raise such a defense in individual law suits, BNSF continues, \"the unique nature of the statutory process here means that the EEOC will not be a party to any litigation filed as a result of EEOC's issuance of the challenged right-to-sue notices,\" so that \"even if BNSF prevails in the litigation, EEOC would not be bound by the ruling and therefore would remain free to repeat\n   its 'shenanigans' until ordered by a court to stop.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1357648\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/638/873/#p879\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Even assuming the EEOC is correct that BNSF could raise its claims about the EEOC's violation of various statutory obligations in individual lawsuits, the Court finds this would be an inadequate alternative remedy to APA review.

Far from duplicating existing procedures, allowing BNSF to initiate APA review here would allow the company a single venue and single proceeding-and would offer the EEOC the same efficiency and convenience-to address what it sufficiently alleges is illegal agency activity. Allowing review in these circumstances makes eminent sense because, while today BNSF alleges the illegal issuance of only 54 letters, the EEOC's proposed theory would mean it could send an employer chasing after hundreds or even thousands of potentially illegal right-to-sue letters.
