Martinez, United States District Judge\n  Plaintiff Central Bancorp, Inc., operates a full-service bank under the name \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" in Colorado Springs. A little more than five miles away, but still in Colorado Springs, Defendants recently opened a bank branch under the name \"Central Bank.\" Plaintiff now sues Defendants for trademark infringement and unfair competition, seeking to bar Defendants from operating branches anywhere in Colorado under a name that includes the word \"Central.\"\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Currently before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 16) and associated briefing (ECF Nos. 32, 43, 53, 54). The Court held an evidentiary hearing on May 1, 2019. For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction against Defendants' use of \"Central Bank\" or \"Central Trust Bank\" in El Paso County, but not in the entire state of Colorado. Such an injunction is conditioned on a $100,000 bond from Plaintiff.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  Because Defendants cannot simply change the name of their Colorado Springs branch overnight (due to the need for regulatory approval, at a minimum), the Court will order Defendants to begin the planning process for a name change and to submit a status report with a realistic timeline for carrying out the name change.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From the testimony and exhibits received at the hearing, the Court finds as follows. Because the parties dispute which of them is the senior user of the \"Central Bank\" mark in Colorado, the Court will present the facts in strict chronological order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Missouri Origins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Central Bancompany is a bank holding company that owns and controls Defendant Central Trust Bank and Defendant Mortgage Central, LLC. Central Trust Bank began as the Central Missouri Trust Company in Jefferson City, Missouri, in 1902. In the late 1960s, it changed its name to Central Trust Bank. In 1987, it received permission from the appropriate regulators to operate under the name \"Central Bank.\" Throughout, it has remained headquartered in Jefferson City and has a significant, visible presence in Missouri. For example, it has had extensive business dealings with the Missouri state government, and it is the official banking sponsor of the St. Louis Cardinals and the University of Missouri-meaning that a person wanting to have Cardinals-themed or Mizzou-themed checks or debit cards must go through Central Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Central Bancompany also owns and controls Jefferson Bank, which is not a defendant here. Jefferson Bank operates exclusively in Jefferson City under its own branding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Operations in Colorado Before 2010\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    FSA Servicing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning in 1998, Defendant Central Trust Bank became the Flexible Spending Account (FSA) servicer for Colorado state employees, other than University of Colorado\n   employees; and in 2004, became the FSA servicer for University of Colorado employees as well. In practical application, this meant that an employee with an FSA would submit a claim for reimbursement through a company called ASI Flex, which is not owned or controlled by Defendants. ASI Flex would determine eligibility for reimbursement, and Central Trust Bank (using the name \"Central Bank\") would fund any reimbursement, usually through a mailed check. The following check image, although dated in 2012, is a representative of what such a check would have looked like during the relevant time period (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before Plaintiff began operations in January 2010):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Defendants' Exhibit (\"DX\") S.) As will become clear below, the stylized flower logo at the top, just left of center, is meant to represent a dogwood flower and is now Defendants' federally registered trademark and a ubiquitous part of their brand presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Central Trust Bank remains the Colorado state government's and University of Colorado's FSA servicer bank to this day. Together, more than 8,000 employees currently participate in those two FSA programs. Defendants presented no evidence of the enrollment numbers just before Plaintiff began operations in January 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Hunting &amp; Fishing License Payment Processing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the late 1990s, Central Trust Bank developed a system to speed up approval and issuance of hunting and fishing licenses. Previously, standard practice in most states required filling out a form and mailing it in. Central Trust Bank created a process whereby a party seeking a fishing license at a local bait shop, for example, could fill out an application, pay the fee (which was wired to Central Trust Bank), and immediately receive approval, giving the bait shop authority to print a license on the spot. From 2002 through 2008, Central Trust Bank was the contractor for the Colorado Department of Natural Resources to process payments for hunting and fishing licenses under this system. By the end of that term, Central Trust Bank was administering the same system in many other states, including Missouri and Kansas. (DX C at 10.) It had also served Nebraska and Wyoming at some point in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the six years Central Trust Bank administered this system in Colorado, about 1,700 vendor shops made it available to license applicants. Employees of those vendor shops operating the license approval system may have had exposure to the name \"Central Bank\" or \"Central Trust Bank,\" but there is no evidence in the\n   record that license applicants had any notion of Central Trust Bank's role in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Servicing Account Holders Living in Colorado\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants have records of 3,886 account holders with mailing addresses in Colorado who interacted or continue to interact with Defendants as \"Central Bank,\" counting from as far back as Defendants' records go (at least the 1950s) until the present, including closed accounts. (DX Z at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These account holders variously held or hold all the sorts of accounts one would expect from a consumer bank (checking, savings, money market, investment, IRA, etc.). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-151.) But Defendants' evidence makes it impossible to discern how many individuals began banking with Central Bank before 2010, as opposed to how many accounts were opened before 2010. Also, it is impossible to tell how many individuals interacted with Defendants from El Paso County. In any event, Defendants have acquired most of these account holders through their Missouri connections,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , they opened an account in Missouri and then moved to Colorado, or they applied for an account with Defendants to get Cardinals-branded checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over the years, Defendants also have loaned money to Colorado residents, or persons buying real property in Colorado. (DX A-1.) The vast majority of this lending has occurred since 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Some of it has been to residents of, or related to property in, El Paso County, but little or none of that lending took place before 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Operations in El Paso County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Inception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff is a bank holding company formed in 2006 with the intent to start a new bank in Colorado Springs. The application to start that bank, however, got bogged down in the FDIC approval process, so Plaintiff pursued a different strategy. It acquired an existing-and therefore already FDIC-approved-bank in New Mexico known as Farmers &amp; Stockmens Bank. It then established \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" in Colorado Springs as a branch of Farmers &amp; Stockmens Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Operations as \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" Since January 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Central Bank &amp; Trust opened its doors at 1 South Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs, in January 2010, and has remained there ever since. It has no other branches in Colorado. The hearing evidence established that, as banks go, it is a fairly small operation, with two tellers, about twenty walk-in customers per day, about six package deliveries per week, and $100 million in deposits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through a mortgage division, it closes between fifteen and thirty mortgage loans per month. Most of\n   Central Bank &amp; Trust's primary commercial banking business is in El Paso County, although it has some statewide recognition as an SBA lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Since the beginning, Central Bank &amp; Trust has represented itself to the public under the following mark, which it has never federally registered:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (ECF No. 43-1 at 10.) On the exterior of its Colorado Springs office, it uses a variant of the logo where the words and the mountain logo are separated by some of the building's windows and lighting fixtures:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Excerpt from Plaintiff's Exhibit (\"PX\") 4 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Excerpt from\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff has advertised and sponsored events in the Colorado Springs community. Some of this advertising is under the \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" name and other advertising is under the \"Central Bancorp\" name (the same logo as above, but with \"Central Bancorp\" beneath the mountain graphic).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the Colorado Springs area, the public often refers to \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" simply as \"Central Bank.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Federal Registration of Defendants' Mark and Rebranding of Defendants' Various Charters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By 2014, Defendants were operating banks under various names in Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Defendants then chose to rebrand all of them, save for Jefferson Bank, as \"Central Bank\" branches. Part of that process involved obtaining federal registration of the following mark, which was applied for in September 2014 and officially registered in January 2016:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Excerpt from DX A-3 at 1.) The dogwood flower is an integral part of the mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the federal application was pending, Defendants went ahead with the changes necessary to convert branches into \"Central Bank\" branches, including regulatory approval, signage changes, customer notification, and so forth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Defendants' Expansion into Colorado\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 2017, Defendant Mortgage Central opened a loan production office at 5278 North Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs, about five-and-a-half miles north of Plaintiff's Central Bank &amp; Trust. A loan production office, or \"LPO,\" finds potential borrowers,\n   helps them to apply for loans, and then forwards the applications to a bank for approval-in this case, to Defendant Central Trust Bank. The LPO on North Nevada went by the name \"Mortgage Central\" with an accompanying dogwood flower logo. Beyond the flower logo, Defendant specifically chose not to display any public association with Central Trust Bank or \"Central Bank\" because it would minimize impact to Defendants' broader reputation if the LPO failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Apparently the LPO did not fail, because Defendants decided in 2018 to convert it into a full-service banking branch under the \"Central Bank\" brand. Under a Colorado statute,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [any] bank or bank holding company that intends to acquire control of any Colorado financial institution or to conduct interstate branching in Colorado shall provide the [state banking division] with the name or names under which it proposes to conduct the business of such bank, bank holding company, or branch. The bank or bank holding company shall not be eligible to conduct interstate branching or make any such acquisition if the proposed name is either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) Identical to or deceptively similar to the name of any existing Colorado financial institution; except that this paragraph (a) shall not apply if the bank or bank holding company obtains express written consent of the affected existing Colorado financial institution; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (b) Likely to cause the public to be confused, deceived, or mistaken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2011-104-202\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 11-104-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). Without investigating or otherwise conducting any due diligence into whether any other \"Central\" banks existed in the area, Defendants submitted the required application under this section, although the application states that the branch would be known as \"The Central Trust Bank.\" (DX E at 12.) Defendants also applied for approval from their federal regulator (the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) and the Missouri state banking division. As part of the approval process, Defendants published a small notice in the\n   <em>\n    Colorado Springs Gazette\n   </em>\n   on June 20, 2018, announcing the intent to establish \"The Central Trust Bank\" at the North Nevada location. (DX F.) The Colorado state banking division also likely sent a broadcast e-mail announcing the application to whomever is on an opt-in e-mail distribution list. In response to a question from the Court, Plaintiff's COO, Mr. Coutts, stated under oath that he did not know if anyone employed by Plaintiff was on that distribution list but that he would have been made aware of it if an employee had received an e-mail announcing another \"Central\" bank coming to town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sometime in June 2018, or perhaps a little later, the Mortgage Central location on North Nevada changed its signage and began representing itself as \"Central Bank.\" It now appears from the outside as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (DX A-13 at 2.) It also advertises on a sign near the street showing the various businesses in the shopping center:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Around the same time the North Nevada location converted to \"Central Bank,\" Defendant established \"Central Bank\" branches in the Denver Tech Center, Pagosa Springs, and Durango.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Plaintiff's Denver Presence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In October 2018, Plaintiff's leadership approved a plan to expand into the Denver market, and hired a well-known Denver banker to lead that effort. So far, however, Plaintiff's only presence in Denver is a \"CB Insurance\" office in the Denver Tech Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Beginnings of this Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff's employees first learned of Defendants' North Nevada location in January or February 2019. Plaintiff filed this\n   lawsuit on February 19, 2019 (ECF No. 1), filed an amended complaint on February 26, 2019 (ECF No. 15), and moved for a preliminary injunction on February 27, 2019 (ECF No. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court will set forth additional factual findings below as they become relevant to the many issues requiring consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II. REQUESTED INJUNCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Plaintiff requests an order enjoining and restraining Defendants\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   from directly or indirectly conducting business as a full service banking branch located within the State of Colorado under any name or trademark including the term 'Central' or any colorably similar term.\" (ECF No. 16 at 9.) This request does not extend to Defendants' LPO-only locations (although Plaintiff reserves the right to seek such relief at the end of the suit, through a permanent injunction). (ECF No. 53 at 12 n.9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy; accordingly, the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Flood v. ClearOne Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776288\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/1110/#p1117\">\n    618 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (10th Cir. 2010). A movant must show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a threat of irreparable harm, which (3) outweighs any harm to the non-moving party, and (4) that the injunction would not adversely affect the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Awad v.

Among those elements, \"a showing of probable irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite.\"\n   <em>\n    Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v.

Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Int'l Registration Plan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3253017\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/455/1107/#p1113\">\n    455 F.3d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1113 (10th Cir. 2006). The Tenth Circuit abrogated this standard in 2016, announcing that \"any modified test which relaxes one of the prongs for preliminary relief and thus deviates from the standard test is impermissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9 Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177691\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1276/#p1282\">\n    839 F.3d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282 (10th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Heightened Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although the Tenth Circuit has abrogated relaxed standards, the Tenth Circuit continues to endorse a heightened standard for \"[d]isfavored preliminary injunctions,\" which do not\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   merely preserve the parties' relative positions pending trial. Instead, a disfavored injunction may exhibit any of three characteristics: (1) it mandates action (rather than prohibiting it), (2) it changes the status quo, or (3) it grants all the relief that the moving party could expect from a trial win. To get a disfavored injunction, the moving party faces a heavier burden on the likelihood-of-success-on-the-merits and the balance-of-harms factors: She must make a strong showing that these tilt in her favor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v.

But the Tenth Circuit has never described the \"strong showing\" requirement in terms of a quantum of evidence or heightened burden of persuasion (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , clear and convincing). Rather, it is a charge to the district court to \"more closely scrutinize[ ]\" the likelihood-of-success and balance-of-harms factors \"to assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in the normal course.\"\n   <em>\n    O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v.

Does Plaintiff Request a \"Disfavored\" Injunction?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   An injunction is \"mandatory\" if \"the requested relief affirmatively requires the nonmovant to act in a particular way, and as a result places the issuing court in a position where it may have to provide ongoing supervision to assure the nonmovant is abiding by the injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Schrier v.

(ECF No. 16 at 10-11.) That is probably the correct interpretation of \"status quo,\" but Plaintiff fails to address the other two types of disfavored injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff's requested injunction would be mandatory. Although Plaintiff nominally seeks an injunction only prohibiting the use of the word \"Central\" as part of Defendants' bank branding in Colorado, this amounts to a mandate that Defendants change their signage, uniforms, letterhead, and so forth.

In other words, Plaintiff has presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of seniority.

July 25, 1990). The doctrine is nearly always discussed as part of the likelihood-of-confusion element, and specifically the similarity-of-goods consideration within the likelihood-of-confusion element. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.4, below.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HealthONE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847254\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/872/1154/#p1182\">\n    872 F.

That said, it stands to reason that if Defendants, invoking the related goods doctrine, could have won a trademark infringement claim against Plaintiff when Plaintiff opened Central Bank &amp; Trust in January 2010, then Defendants should be deemed the senior user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants have not satisfied their burden in this regard. Although Defendants have remotely served banking customers in Colorado since the 1950s, Defendants presented only ambiguous evidence of the extent of their penetration into Colorado, and particularly the penetration and recognition of their mark in El Paso County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part I.B.3, above.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In addition, from what the evidence\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   reveal, most of Defendants' general banking customers in Colorado came to Colorado from Missouri and maintained their banking relationship with Defendants, or specifically sought out Defendants because of the rights accompanying Defendants' Missouri sponsorships. Defendants have provided no authority for the proposition that consumers who view a bank specifically as a Missouri brand-and affiliate with it because of its Missouri connections-can establish that brand's senior rights in another state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, Defendants' status as FSA servicer bank for Colorado state employees, and former status payment processor for Colorado hunting and fishing licenses, is immaterial. Even if the hunting and fishing license service had not ended in 2008 (before Central Bank &amp; Trust opened), neither that service nor the FSA service exposed Colorado consumers to \"Central Bank\" as a brand in any appreciable way. For those receiving FSA reimbursement checks, for example, it is unclear how many noticed or even thought about the notion that Central Bank of Jefferson City, Missouri, had issued the check. The dogwood flower logo on those checks actually appears closer to the ASI Flex address and logo than to Central Bank's address. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part I.B.1, above.) And only employees at hunting and fishing license vendors would have had any reason to see that a bank named \"Central Bank\" was on the other side of the transaction. There is no evidence of how many of them actually noticed Central Bank's role or gained any awareness of \"Central Bank\" as a brand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are unlikely to rebut Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of seniority, and so Plaintiff is likely to succeed in proving that it is the senior user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Natural Zone of Geographic Expansion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"A senior user that has constantly expanded its business prior to the junior user's adoption of the mark may be entitled to exclusive rights in a zone of natural expansion, even if that zone ousts a junior user from its current territory.\"\n   <em>\n    Tana v.

Here, if looked at from a nationwide perspective, Defendants are the senior user. But, as far as the evidence before the Court reveals, the closest \"Central Bank\" to Colorado that Defendants have ever operated before 2018 has been in Lawrence, Kansas, and it did not operate under the \"Central Bank\" name until 2015 or thereabouts. Even if that bank had been operating as a \"Central Bank\" before 2010, there is no evidence to suggest that the Colorado Front Range is a zone of natural expansion for a bank from Lawrence, Kansas, particularly for deeply Missouri-based firms such as Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants are not likely to succeed under the zone-of-natural-expansion principle,\n   and Plaintiff is concomitantly likely to sustain its argument that it is the senior user, at least in El Paso County, despite Defendants' senior use outside of Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Element Two: Defendants' Use of the Mark in Connection with Good or Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This element is uncontested and uncontestable in light of the evidence recounted above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part I.E.) Accordingly, Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the second element of its Lanham Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Element Three: Likelihood of Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The third and final element of a Lanham Act claim is likelihood of confusion.

By sight, the parties' marks are easily distinguishable based on typeface, the addition of \"&amp; Trust\" to Plaintiff's mark, the addition of the stylized mountain graphic to Plaintiff's mark, and the addition of the dogwood graphic to Defendants' mark. By sound, the marks are identical until one reaches the \"and Trust\" portion of Plaintiff's mark-and it is doubtful how often a normal consumer adds the \"and Trust\" when referring to Plaintiff. By meaning, the marks are essentially identical. The only possible distinction would be a savvy consumer who understands that \"and Trust\" means something potentially more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Intent of the Alleged Infringer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   An inquiry into the defendant's intent is deemed relevant under the presumption that some alleged infringers adopt a similar mark\n   <em>\n    hoping\n   </em>\n   that consumers will be confused and thereby mistakenly give their business to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23:110 (\"if defendant intended confusion, this tends to show confusion of customers in fact\"). Here, there is no evidence of this sort of intent. Indeed, Defendants operated as \"Central Bank\" in Missouri many years before creating a Central Bank branch in Colorado Springs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   However, the Court finds it appropriate to consider under this factor Defendants' due diligence, or lack thereof. Both Defendants' general counsel (Mr. Medin) and its\n   executive vice president of marketing and retail banking (Mr. Westhues) testified at the evidentiary hearing that they essentially expect to find other \"Central\" Banks wherever they might expand (a well-grounded assumption,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.6, below), and they simply hope to work it out once they get there. Mr. Westhues testified that some amount of confusion usually does result, at least for a short time, when Defendants expand. Thus, although the Court has no evidence that Defendants expanded into Colorado under the \"Central Bank\" name in hopes of confusing and drawing away Plaintiff's customers, it is nonetheless relevant that Defendants expect that their actions will cause confusion, at least temporarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of Actual Confusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \"Although by no means strictly necessary, evidence of actual confusion is often considered the best evidence of likelihood of confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    First Savings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637840\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/645/#p654\">\n    101 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   656 n.14.

The mother had an account with \"Central Bank\" in her home state and wanted to open an account for her son with the same bank. Ms. Rockwell could not locate an account under the mother's name, and after some discussion, it became clear that the mother had an account with Defendants, not Plaintiff. The mother then departed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 Also in March 2019, Ms. Rockwell interacted with a man who came in with an insurance check made payable to him, another person, and \"Central Trust Bank,\" and asked that the check be \"put back into escrow.\" Ms. Rockwell confirmed that the man was mistaking Central Bank &amp; Trust for Defendants' Central Bank branch on North Nevada.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \u2022 Beginning in late 2018, Central Bank &amp; Trust has noticed a dramatic increase in calls from purported customers having trouble logging into its online banking system. It turns out that most of these customers had gone to the wrong \"Central Bank\" website. Ms. Rockwell was able to determine that \"some\" of those callers had actually intended to call Defendants' branch on North Nevada.

It is suggestive rather than arbitrary or fanciful. Moreover, it is common in the banking industry. According to the Federal Reserve's database of American financial institutions, there are 169 financial institutions in the United States (counting the parties here and their affiliates) that call themselves something beginning with \"Central,\" including numerous other \"Central Banks\" (or \"Central Bank of [location]\"), and even a few that add \"and Trust.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX A-9.) In the past, there have been multiple \"Central Banks\" even in El Paso County, including ones with titles like \"Central Bank Colorado Springs.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 60 at 1.) But, according to the same database, there is only one\n   <em>\n    active\n   </em>\n   financial institution in Colorado beginning with the word \"Central,\" and that is Central Bancorp (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Accordingly, \"Central Bank &amp; Trust\" has little conceptual strength, but-until Defendants came to town-it was the only \"Central Bank\" in the state, and had developed substantial recognition in El Paso County through its business dealings, advertising, and sponsorships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Synthesis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Again, none of the foregoing factors is considered dispositive.\n   <em>\n    Universal Money\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515793\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/1527/#p1530\">\n    22 F.3d at 1530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Weighing them all together, the Court finds that the balance decisively tips toward Plaintiff. This is so particularly considering the evidence of actual\n   confusion; Defendants'\n   <em>\n    expectation\n   </em>\n   that other \"Central\" banks will exist wherever they expand, likely creating at least temporary confusion; and the fact that Central Bank &amp; Trust on South Nevada and Central Bank on North Nevada offer substantially overlapping services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   However, this conclusion is limited to El Paso County, Colorado. Plaintiff has failed to present evidence that bank consumers outside of El Paso County are likely to be confused, largely because Plaintiff does not have a physical presence or substantial recognition outside of El Paso County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 McCarthy \u00a7 26:29 (discussing territorial extent of unregistered marks). Also, the Court does not find a likelihood of success in barring Defendants' from using \"Central\" anywhere in their name. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II, above.) The Court does not find that \"Central Mortgage\" (one of the signs on the outside of Defendants' North Nevada location) raises the same concerns as \"Central Bank,\" and the Court can imagine many other bank names that feature \"Central\" somewhere in the title that would not create a likelihood of confusion with Plaintiff's bank. Plaintiff's likelihood of success is therefore limited to Defendants' use of \"Central Bank\" and \"Central Trust Bank.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Accordingly, having \"closely scrutinized\" the likelihood-of-success element,\n   <em>\n    O Centro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9150911\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/973/#p975\">\n    389 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2004), the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a \"strong showing,\"\n   <em>\n    Free the Nipple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520230\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/792/#p797\">\n    916 F.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , within the geographic confines of El Paso County regarding Defendants' use of \"Central Bank\" and \"Central Trust Bank.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Plaintiff argues that irreparable harm should be presumed when likelihood of success is demonstrated. (ECF No. 16 at 17.) The Court is sympathetic to Plaintiff's argument in this trademark context,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   but\n   <em>\n    Din\u00e9 Citizens\n   </em>\n   emphatically states that \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   modified test which relaxes one of the prongs for preliminary relief and thus deviates from the standard test is impermissible.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177691\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1276/#p1282\">\n    839 F.3d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, the Court must have evidence of a threatened irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \"Evidence of loss of control over business reputation and damage to goodwill could constitute irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Herb Reed Enterprises, LLC v. Fla. Entm't Mgmt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727074\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1239/#p1250\">\n    736 F.3d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (9th Cir. 2013). Plaintiff has presented evidence in this regard. In particular, Ms. Rockwell and Ms. Schrepfer testified that callers who call Plaintiff's bank thinking they are calling Defendants' bank often end up confused, flustered, or embarrassed, and sometimes the conversation devolves into an argument. This creates a situation in which Plaintiff's reputation and goodwill are somewhat out of its control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that the time spent having to deal with confused potential or purported customers is an irreparable harm. Some of these calls can take up to fifteen minutes. Theoretically, those minutes could be added up and converted into a dollar figure, but there is also an opportunity cost incurred that is much more difficult to quantify. Every minute spent discerning whether a caller means to call Central Bank &amp; Trust or Central Bank-and if the latter, every minute spent explaining the difference-is a minute Plaintiff's employees cannot spend with current or potential customers. Such opportunity cost, although real, is also very difficult to quantify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Court also agrees with Plaintiff, in light of the evidence of actual confusion, that there exists a substantial possibility of the following scenario: Through advertising, referral, or other means, a person decides she will open an account at, or obtain a loan from, Plaintiff's bank. She mistakenly takes her business to Defendants' bank, and neither she, Plaintiff's bank, nor Defendants' bank ever learns that she made this mistake-because no one has reason to ask, \"Did I/you really intend to visit\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   'Central Bank'?\" Thus, Plaintiff loses business, yet it is difficult to calculate how much because it is difficult if not impossible to determine how often this scenario has already played out, or in the future will play out absent the injunctive relief Plaintiff seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff established a threat of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. BALANCE OF HARMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Plaintiff has invested substantially in building awareness of itself and its mark in El Paso County, along with its business reputation. With Defendants' bank on North Nevada, Plaintiff potentially stands to lose some of that investment, and to suffer the irreparable harms noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Against this, the Court must balance the cost to Defendants of requiring the North Nevada bank to operate under another name. At the evidentiary hearing, Defendants' evidence in this regard was ambiguous and, at times, somewhat misleading to the Court. Mr. Westhues (Defendants' executive vice president of marketing and retail banking) at first testified in a manner suggesting that forcing the North Nevada location to change its name would be tantamount to forcing the entire Central Bank system to change its name, with all the associated regulatory and structural burdens and costs. Then, at a later point, he retreated from this position and testified regarding an exhibit showing the conversion of two specific banks to the \"Central Bank\" name and branding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX A-12.) The actual outlays were \"$138,141 for App Dev hrs., $14,300 for Infrastructure hrs. and $16,445 for PMO hrs,\" plus \"[f]acilities cost (bank signage, vendor expense and supplies)\" of $59,463 at the smaller of the two banks and $761,071 at the larger one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The total is $989,420 for converting both banks, but obviously there was an enormous disparity in the \"facilities cost\" between the two locations. Moreover, Mr. Westhues testified that changing the \"Mortgage Central\" signage at the North Nevada location and at least one other Colorado location cost about $18,000 in total. And Defendants' manager for Colorado operations, Ms. Stout, testified that the signage change cost somewhere between $14,000 and $17,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In other words, Defendants' evidence does not assist the Court in understanding the burden Defendants would face to change the North Nevada location to a different name. But at least the following is clear:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   First, the bulk of the harm to Defendants is quantifiable-actual dollars Defendants will need to pay to make the conversion happen. And Defendants have a trademark infringement insurance policy with a $100,000 deductible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 at 12-13.) Although insurance proceeds are not \"free money\" and insurance companies sometimes deny coverage, the fact remains that a policy exists that appears to cover the hard costs at issue here, above $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Second, to the extent there is unquantifiable harm to Defendants' reputation, the North Nevada location is currently less than a year old. Whatever reputation Defendants have built there is comparatively very shallow when viewed alongside the reputation Plaintiff has built in El Paso County over the last decade. Thus, Plaintiff stands to lose much more in this regard than Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Third, Defendants know how to convert bank branches to operate under new names. They did it for many bank branches in 2014 and 2015 under a well-thought-out and efficient system, and they have preserved what they learned from that experience. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX A-10, A-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Fourth, Defendants know how to operate banks under separate names. They operated under several names before 2014 and 2015, and they still operate branches under two names-Central Bank and Jefferson Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Fifth, Defendants elected to expand into Colorado Springs under the \"Central Bank\" name, and did so under their general expectation that they will encounter other \"Central\" banks wherever they expand. Defendants have therefore assumed the risk of creating the very sort of problem at issue here. Plaintiff perhaps assumed small amount of similar risk by choosing to call itself \"Central,\" which is relatively common in bank names. Accordingly, it may have been foreseeable that some other \"Central\" bank might attempt to expand into Colorado. But there were no other \"Central\" banks in Colorado when Plaintiff opened its doors, and Plaintiff built its brand in El Paso County, undisturbed, for eight-and-a-half years before Defendants arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a strong showing that the balance of harms tips in its favor. The Court fully understands that a name change requires approval of various regulators and that executing the name change takes some months of preparation. Again, however, Defendants have done this many times before, and so there is no reason to believe that it cannot be done again. It does not raise a question of whether an injunction should issue, but only of how the injunction should be fashioned, which the Court addresses below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. PUBLIC INTEREST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The public interest favors an injunction here. The consequences of confusion in the banking industry are potentially much greater than the consequences of confusion in, say, the clothing industry. As emphasized by Mr. Grebe (manager of Plaintiff's mortgage division), banking documents tend to contain important and highly confidential financial information about banking customers. It is important to minimize the circumstances in which such private information is accidentally disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has satisfied all four preliminary injunction factors. A preliminary injunction will issue upon terms the Court will set in consultation with the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. BOND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Court must normally impose a bond on the plaintiff as a condition of preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). On the present record, the Court finds that the amount of Defendants' insurance deductible-$100,000-is the appropriate bond amount. Should Defendants' insurance carrier dispute coverage for amounts in excess of the deductible (assuming any), Defendants may move to modify the bond amount to account for the risk that Defendants might not receive the insurance proceeds they would otherwise expect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   1. Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 16) is GRANTED to the extent Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from conducting business as a full-service banking branch located within El Paso County, Colorado, under the names \"Central Bank\" or \"Central Trust Bank,\" but otherwise DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   2. Most of the terms of the Court's preliminary injunction must be set by later order after consultation with the parties, but, upon Plaintiff's posting of a $100,000 bond, Defendants are immediately ENJOINED to begin the internal preparations necessary to convert Defendants' \"Central Bank\" branch at 5278 North Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs (\"North Nevada Branch\"), to a different a name;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   3. On or before\n   <strong>\n    May 22, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , Defendants shall file a status report describing, in good faith, a realistic timeline and necessary steps (assuming that regulatory approval is not unusually delayed) for completing the conversion of the North Nevada Branch to a different name as soon as practicable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   4. On or before\n   <strong>\n    May 29, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , Plaintiff may respond to Defendants' status report;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   5.

The question is whether Defendants could rebrand the North Nevada location as \"Central Trust Bank,\" and the answer is no.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    In the trademark context, the point is to preserve the distinctiveness of a mark, and\n    <em>\n     likelihood\n    </em>\n    of confusion-not necessarily actual confusion-is the injury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(A). It would be a rare case in which the Court could allow a defendant to continue using a mark confusingly similar to the plaintiff's and simply set up a forward-looking damages regime to handle the fallout from ongoing confusion. Assuming such a regime is feasible, it would nonetheless destroy the distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
