ELLIS, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs, eight Chicago Public School (\"CPS\") students and their parents, have filed this putative class action against Defendants the Board of Education of the City of Chicago and Dr. Janice Jackson, the Chief Executive Officer of CPS (collectively, the \"CPS Defendants\"), and the Illinois State Board of Education (\"ISBE\") and Dr. Tony Smith, the State Superintendent of Education (collectively, the \"ISBE Defendants\"). Plaintiffs claim that the CPS and ISBE Defendants systematically fail to provide CPS students with disabilities, whose parents are Limited English Proficient (\"LEP\"), with a free appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") as required by federal law because the CPS and ISBE Defendants do not provide translations of documents or competent interpretation services for the LEP parents during the individualized education program (\"IEP\") process. Specifically, in the first amended complaint (\"FAC\"), Plaintiffs allege violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (count I against the CPS and ISBE Defendants and count II against the ISBE Defendants); Title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 (\"Title VI\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (count III against the CPS and ISBE Defendants and count IV against the ISBE Defendants); the Equal Educational Opportunities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201701\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (count V against the CPS and ISBE Defendants and count VI against the ISBE Defendants, with both counts solely on behalf of the Student Plaintiffs); and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (count VII against the CPS Defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The CPS Defendants have moved for dismissal of all the claims against them (Counts I, III, V, and VII).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court concludes that no exception exists to the exhaustion requirement, because E.V. and his parents exhausted their claims and they are not moot, the remaining Plaintiffs need not pursue the administrative process before proceeding on similar claims here. H.P. and his parents, however, cannot proceed on their claims against the CPS Defendants because they received the relief requested in this lawsuit through the administrative process.

As relevant here, CPS must obtain informed written parental consent to provide special education services, initial evaluations, and reevaluations.

The due process hearing system is the primary way to challenge decisions made with respect to the IEP process and the provision of a FAPE to a child with disabilities. The ISBE is responsible for establishing and administering this administrative review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CPS' Provision of Services Required Under the IDEA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the 2016-2017 school year, CPS reported that 52,093 students enrolled in CPS had IEPs. Of those students, forty-two percent have LEP parents. Over 19,000 LEP households communicate in Spanish, over 300 in Polish, almost 300 in Arabic, and almost 200 in Chinese. CPS collets information regarding the household language of all CPS students through a Home Language Survey. Every IEP notes the parents' primary language and whether an interpreter is needed to communicate with the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite having such information, CPS does not have a policy or practice of providing written translations of IEP process documents to LEP parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   CPS does not provide independent interpreters for LEP parents at IEP and other special education meetings. It sometimes uses CPS personnel as interpreters on an ad hoc basis, but CPS has no policy to determine their competence, including their proficiency and knowledge of specialized IEP terms and vocabulary in both languages and their ability to adhere to their roles as interpreters without deviating to another role. CPS also does not provide training or guidance on the standards of interpretation. As a result, CPS personnel acting as interpreters have often summarized reports instead of providing them in full, editorialized reports, failed to fully and accurately interpret parents' statements, and failed to properly convey technical vocabulary to the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Individual Plaintiffs' Experiences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. H.P., Victoria G., and Hector P.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   H.P., a twelve-year-old seventh grade student at Finkl Elementary School, qualifies\n   for special education services. His parents, Victoria G. and Hector P., are native Spanish speakers. H.P.'s IEPs indicate that his household mainly speaks Spanish and that his parents need an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 11, 2016, Victoria G. and Hector P. attended H.P.'s IEP meeting to discuss plans for the following school year. H.P.'s school social worker, who has no interpretation training, served as the interpreter in addition to providing input for the IEP. The IEP team discussed transferring H.P. to his neighborhood school and removing his bus transportation. Victoria G. and Hector P. believed they voiced their disagreement with these recommendations, but the IEP team adopted them. At the end of the meeting, Hector P. signed an Agreement to Proceed with IEP Meeting, which was only in English. Hector P. did not understand the document, which gave consent to CPS to complete the IEP and provide a copy to H.P.'s parents the following day. H.P.'s parents did not receive the IEP the following day, and, when they did, it was only in English. The IEP removed H.P.'s transportation and behavioral support services and returned H.P. to his neighborhood school. H.P.'s parents did not understand the IEP's conclusions and instead returned to Finkl several days before the 2016-2017 school year's start to obtain a supply list for H.P. Finkl reported that H.P. was not enrolled there. On September 3, 2016, Victoria G. and Hector P. requested mediation, and H.P. missed the first week of school while CPS considered their complaint. Ultimately, H.P. returned to Finkl but without bus transportation or behavioral support services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 5, 2017, Victoria G. and Hector P. filed a due process complaint notice contending that CPS' failure to provide translated IEP process documents and competent interpreters denied H.P. a FAPE. In a pre-hearing ruling on their complaint, the hearing officer struck all systemic requests for relief for lack of jurisdiction. After the filing of the due process complaint, CPS continued to send Victoria G. and Hector P. documents only in English, including a document seeking consent for psychological and other evaluations of H.P., which Hector P. signed despite not understanding its content. On June 9 and June 19, 2017, Victoria G. and Hector P. participated in eligibility and IEP meetings for H.P. The bilingual specialist at H.P.'s school served as an interpreter, but she did not have any interpretation training and indicated confusion with special education terminology. Victoria G. and Hector P. requested the IEP process documents in Spanish but did not receive them. They also did not fully understand the discussions that took place at these meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A hearing officer held a four-day hearing in September 2017 on H.P.'s parents' due process complaint. She ruled in H.P.'s favor, concluding that CPS' failure to provide qualified translators and translated documents violated H.P. and his parents' rights under the IDEA. The hearing officer ordered CPS to provide qualified interpreter services to H.P.'s parents at all future IEP meetings and required those interpreters to undergo specific training and have certain certifications. The hearing officer indicated that the interpreters were not to play any other role at IEP meetings to ensure neutrality and impartiality. The hearing officer also required CPS to translate H.P.'s vital IEP process documents into Spanish. As of the filing of the FAC, CPS had not complied with the order, failing to provide a translated IEP document from a November 7, 2017, IEP meeting and H.P.'s IEP progress report. Victoria G. and Hector P. also did not receive a copy of the hearing officer's October 2, 2017, order or any other documents\n   related to the due process hearing in Spanish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hector P. participated in additional state-sponsored mediation on January 9, 2018, to address another issue with H.P.'s placement. The initial interpreter was a CPS aide who had not received training in interpretation and did not interpret significant portions of the initial statements and summarized key information. Hector P. requested a new interpreter. Subsequently, H.P.'s case manager, who has not received interpretation training, translated for Hector P. The parties did not reach a resolution during the mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. E.V., Aixia H., and Carlos V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   E.V., a twelve-year-old seventh grade student in the cluster program at Talcott Elementary, qualifies for special education services. His parents, Aixia H. and Carlos V., are native Spanish speakers. E.V.'s IEPs indicate that the family primarily speaks Spanish at home and that his parents need an interpreter. Despite this knowledge, CPS did not provide Aixia H. and Carlos V. with vital IEP process documents in Spanish, causing Aixia H. to use web-based translation services, such as Google Translate, in an attempt to understand the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both Aixia H. and Carlos V. attended an IEP meeting on March 7, 2016, at which CPS did not provide an interpreter. Aixia H. and Carlos V. did not understand much of the meeting and could not convey information to the IEP team about E.V.'s behavior and transition difficulties. CPS provided the IEP to E.V.'s parents only in English, with Aixia H. again spending several hours using Google Translate to understand the IEP. Aixia H. then wrote a letter to CPS in Spanish, using Google Translate to translate it into English, expressing her concerns about services not included in E.V.'s IEP. CPS thereafter asked Aixia H. to sign an IEP Revision, which Aixia H. did not understand but signed because she believed that E.V. would not get the IEP services unless she signed it. The IEP did not address Aixia H. and Carlos V.'s concerns about E.V.'s behavior and instead reduced E.V.'s social work support and kept in place the same behavior intervention plan. Aixia H. spoke with E.V.'s social worker on February 14, 2017, to request that further communications occur only in Spanish. Because CPS continued sending documents only in English, Aixia H. and Carlos V. did not understand that CPS was reevaluating E.V. and trying to schedule an IEP meeting in March 2017. Aixia H. wrote a letter in Spanish asking for an IEP meeting on March 7, 2017, but CPS never responded. No IEP meeting took place in March 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Aixia H. and Carlos V. filed a due process complaint notice, claiming that E.V. did not receive a FAPE because CPS failed to translate vital IEP process documents and interpreters for special education meetings. The hearing officer struck E.V.'s systemic requests for relief for lack of jurisdiction in a prehearing ruling. On November 24, 2017, after a five-day hearing, the hearing officer concluded that CPS' failure to provide interpreters or translated documents did not deny E.V. a FAPE. E.V. and his parents received a copy of the hearing officer's decision in Spanish on January 3, 2018. But ISBE has not provided them with any of the other documents related to the due process hearing in Spanish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After receiving the hearing officer's order, CPS held a meeting on November 27, 2017, to plan for E.V.'s reevaluation. Aixia H. and Carlos V. asked for written translations of the documents discussed, which CPS did not provide them before or at the meeting. The principal served as the interpreter and failed to interpret large parts of\n   the meeting. On December 4, 2017, CPS held an eligibility and IEP meeting to discuss the evaluation reports. CPS again did not provide these reports in Spanish to Aixia H. and Carlos V. Both the principal and assistant principal acted as interpreters and again did not interpret significant parts of the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. R.L. and Mireya L.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R.L., a nineteen-year old post-twelfth grade student at Whitney Young High School, qualifies for special education services. Mireya L., R.L.'s mother, is a native Spanish speaker. R.L.'s IEPs indicate that his household primarily speaks Spanish and that parent communications require an interpreter. Despite knowing this, CPS did not provide Mireya L. with translated vital IEP process documents or competent interpretation services. To the extent an interpreter was present during IEP meetings, the translator inaccurately summarized information, added her own opinions, answered questions herself, and misinterpreted technical terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On January 12, 2017, Mireya L. attended an IEP meeting. Although CPS indicated a school staff member would act as an interpreter, no interpreter attended. Mireya L. did not understand the substance of the meeting, which took place in English, and she received an English copy of R.L.'s IEP. She believed R.L. would continue attending Whitney Young and receiving vision itinerant services, transportation, speech therapy, and orientation and mobility services for the next school year. But instead, R.L. was scheduled to graduate, terminating his special education eligibility. Mireya L. only learned of this at the start of the 2017-2018 school year. Ultimately, CPS reversed R.L.'s graduation and reinstated him three months into the school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    D. O.L. and Xi Long L.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   O.L., a nine-year-old fourth grade student at Finkl, qualifies for special education services. O.L.'s father, Xi Long L., is a native Mandarin speaker and reads and writes Chinese Simplified. Xi Long L. completed CPS' Home Language Survey and believed he requested to receive documents in Chinese Simplified and Mandarin interpretation services. O.L.'s IEPs indicate that her family primarily speaks Mandarin at home and that parent communications require an interpreter. But CPS did not provide translated IEP process documents or an interpreter to Xi Long L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At O.L.'s October 3, 2017, IEP meeting, Xi Long L. requested at least a teleinterpreter, but CPS denied the request, indicated it could not find a Mandarin interpreter, and used Google Translate to communicate with Xi Long L. Xi Long L. attempted to request additional speech and occupational therapy services and use of an augmentative communication device for O.L. He also wanted to ask more about O.L's academic program, her lack of progress, and what he could do to support O.L.'s progress at home, but the lack of an interpreter hindered his ability to do so. Upon receiving O.L.'s IEP, Xi Long L. took it to O.L.'s private speech pathologist, who informed him that the IEP did not incorporate changes recommended by O.L.'s private therapists. In December 2017, Xi Long L. found an assistive technology referral in English in O.L.'s backpack, which O.L.'s private speech pathologist explained to him. Xi Long L. sought to discuss the referral more fully with O.L.'s IEP team, but no such meeting was held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    E. J.M. and Rosalba C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   J.M., a seven-year-old second grade student at Octavio Paz charter school, qualifies for special education services. Rosalba\n   C., J.M.'s mother, is a native Spanish speaker. J.M.'s IEPs indicate that his household primarily speaks Spanish and that his mother needs an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At a November 10, 2016, eligibility meeting to discuss J.M.'s speech evaluation, CPS did not provide an interpreter, and Rosalba C. did not receive a copy of the evaluation report in Spanish. The IEP team told Rosalba C., in English, that J.M. would be exited fully from special education services. Rosalba C. could not properly respond to this decision. She requested additional evaluations on November 16, 2016, and January 10, 2017, but CPS, in English, denied these requests. CPS did reevaluate J.M. after he obtained legal representation and again found him eligible for special education services on December 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    F. J.B. and Miriam B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   J.B., an eight-year-old third grade student at Mozart Elementary School, qualifies for special education services. Her mother, Miriam B., is a native Spanish speaker. J.B.'s IEPs indicate that the household primarily speaks Spanish and that her mother needs an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 24, 2016, during a meeting to discuss a reevaluation, the school special education case manager served in the dual roles of interpreter and case manager. The case manager did not interpret the entire discussion or fully explain the evaluation process to Miriam B. Miriam B. also did not receive Spanish translations of documents describing the assessments CPS intended to conduct. Nonetheless, Miriam B. signed the Consent for Reevaluation form. The plan did not provide for assessments required to determine whether J.B. would receive certain services that Miriam B. requested at the meeting. On June 9, 2016, CPS held an eligibility meeting to discuss the results of J.B.'s evaluations. Miriam B. again did not receive Spanish translations of the evaluation reports. The IEP team determined J.B. did not qualify for social work services because she had not had a social work evaluation. The IEP team agreed to conduct this additional assessment and, on December 15, 2016, ultimately determined that J.B. qualified for social work services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    G. G.G. and Asencion G.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   G.G., a sixteen-year-old tenth grade student at Acacia Academy, qualifies for special education services. Her mother, Asencion G., is a native Spanish speaker. G.G.'s IEPs indicate that her household primarily speaks Spanish and that her mother needs an interpreter. Despite multiple requests from Asencion G. to receive written translations of IEP documents, CPS did not provide her with such Spanish translations, except for IEP progress reports in G.G.'s sixth grade year. Asencion G. has turned to a bilingual advocate or attorney outside of CPS to understand the IEP documents she receives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At a February 16, 2016, IEP meeting, CPS changed G.G.'s placement to a therapeutic day school. CPS provided an interpreter who served in another role at the meeting as well and did not accurately interpret the conversation. CPS also denied Asencion G.'s request to translate the IEP into Spanish and her request for information on therapeutic day schools in Spanish. Around March 23, 2016, Asencion G. received a letter assigning G.G. to Acacia, a therapeutic day school with which CPS contracts. After she obtained a translation of the letter, on April 4, 2016, Asencion G. visited Acacia and began the intake process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

M.P.'s mother, Izabela P., is a native Polish speaker. M.P.'s IEPs indicate that the household speaks primarily Polish and that parent communications require an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At a March 1, 2017, IEP meeting, CPS did not provide Izabela P. with a written translation of M.P.'s progress reports. Izabela P. also did not receive a written translation of the IEP that resulted from that meeting. Izabela P. defers many educational decisions to her daughter, who speaks English, and relies on her daughter to understand the IEP documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint, not its merits.

However, both hearing officers did provide some individual relief to H.P. and E.V. and their parents with respect to translation and interpretation services.

The hearing officer ordered that CPS provide qualified interpretation services\n   at all future IEP meetings and translations of key special education documents to H.P.'s parents.

Plaintiffs first argue that H.P.'s claim remains viable because CPS has not complied with the hearing officer's order.

The CPS Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegations demonstrate that each parent meaningfully participated in the IEP process and obtained substantive relief for their child through that participation. But the Court cannot make this determination at the motion to dismiss stage, where it must take Plaintiffs' allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the Parent Plaintiffs faced significant difficulties in their attempts to participate in the IEP process because CPS did not provide translations of vital documents or competent interpreters.

But here, Plaintiffs do not rely solely on the delay in receipt of services to support a violation, and the allegations suggest that the lack of translation and interpretation significantly impeded the Parent Plaintiffs' participation in the IEP process and caused additional harms to the Student Plaintiffs.

Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that they have alleged intentional discrimination, specifically that CPS knows of the Parent Plaintiffs' need for competent interpretation and translation services but nonetheless intentionally and systematically fails to provide these services. They provide specific instances where CPS has denied requests for such services. According to Plaintiffs, these actions, done with knowledge of the LEP parents' need for services, deny the Parent Plaintiffs the ability to meaningfully participate in the IEP process. At this stage, this is all Plaintiffs must allege to suggest intentional discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marcial v. Rush Univ. Med.
