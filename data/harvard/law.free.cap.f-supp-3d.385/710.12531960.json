On direct appeal, the Indiana Court of Appeals summarized the relevant facts and procedural history as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Schmid has an extensive history of psychological problems that began when she was a young girl. By 2001, when she was twenty-eight years of age, she had been married and divorced and was living with her boyfriend, Tony Heathcote (Heathcote), the victim. Schmid's prior marriage had produced a daughter, and, on March 2, 2001, Schmid was informed that Heathcote allegedly had molested her daughter. Upon receiving this news, Schmid became very upset. Two days later, on March 4, 2001, Schmid and Heathcote were having sexual relations at their home using restraints, a dog collar, a leash, and a blindfold when Heathcote suggested that Schmid play the part of the little girl and Heathcote would play the part of the daddy. This statement caused Schmid to think of her daughter. At that time, Schmid obtained a knife and began stabbing Heathcote who was blindfolded and restrained at the ankles. Heathcote was stabbed thirty-nine\n   (39) times and died. Later, Schmid indicated that at the time of the stabbing she had heard a voice telling her that she was the messiah and that Heathcote was evil and needed to be eliminated. Following a jury trial, Schmid was convicted with verdicts of guilty but mentally ill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Schmid v.

The court reappointed Dr. Rahdert and Dr. Desai, who evaluated Ms. Schmid on January 22 and 23, 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Although both found her competent, the court did not make a competency determination. On February 6, 2002, the trial judge changed. Judge David J.

On August 23, 2002, despite 1) his lack of personal knowledge of the proceedings before he took the bench three weeks prior; 2) the eight months that had passed since Ms. Schmid's last evaluation, during which her medications had been adjusted on several occasions; and 3) without any further evaluations or a hearing to determine Ms. Schmid's present mental state, the court entered a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   competency determination backdated to\n   February 8, 2002. Dkt. 66-4, p. 5. On September 19, 2002, the court granted Mr. Smith's motion to withdraw as counsel. Dkt. 66-3, p.77. Ms. Hutchinson continued to assist Mr. Hennessy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Trial by jury began on September 30, 2002. Mr. Hennessy presented evidence of Ms. Schmid's mental illness, including the testimony of three psychiatrists. Dr. Desai testified to her psychiatric history, stating \"she had a history of hallucinations from about age five ... [and] a history of several psychiatric hospitalizations.\" Trial Tr. 613. His diagnosis was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   she suffered from dissociative disorder not otherwise specified [and] ...bipolar disorder with psychotic features. The evidence for this is the history of auditory hallucinations, hearing voices, the visual hallucinations, seeing angels and devils, delusional belief that [Heathcote] was the devil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 621. Dr. Desai opined that at the time of Mr. Heathcote's death, Ms. Schmid \"was not able to appreciate the nature and quality of her act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 622. Similarly, Dr. Rahdert and Dr. Coon each diagnosed Ms. Schmid with schizoaffective disorder and both found that she was legally insane at the time of the killing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 688-91, 741-42. On the other hand, Dr. Crane, the prosecution's witness, testified that he believed Ms. Schmid was able to appreciate the wrongfulness of her acts at the time of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the trial, Schmid's attorneys had increasing concerns as to her competence. In a sidebar on October 2, 2002, Mr. Hennessy stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court's aware from previous competency and restoration of competency pretty much the mental condition of Ms. Schmid. Yesterday she was having some problems and the voices were starting and it's typical of the schizophrenic aspect of the mental disease that they start as whispers and build and to a crescendo and that's where they were. Through the day we'd get a break and that helped her and then last night [Ms. Hutchinson] went to see her and [Ms. Hutchinson] has some real concerns after that meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Hutchinson added that Ms. Schmid had been experiencing severe shaking, was hearing voices, and that her eyes would \"just fixate on one spot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225. The judge responded, \"I don't want to question [Ms. Schmid] because that's probably not appropriate.\" He then asked Ms. Hutchinson if Ms. Schmid knew \"enough to let you know when she's having a problem or does someone have to observe her and let us know?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Hutchinson stated she thought Ms. Schmid could let her know when she was having a problem and that they would let the Court know if they questioned her competence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Without further inquiry, the Court resumed the trial. The following day, the prosecutor requested a ruling from the court that Ms. Schmid was competent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 328. Judge Busch asked counsel if there was any objection and stated that from his observations, Ms. Schmid appeared aware of the proceedings and had been communicating with counsel. In response, Mr. Hennessy stated, \"[w]e would stipulate to that ... she's been communicating with counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Hutchinson stated, \"[s]he gets-she can talk to me about the trial last night as well, it's just the auditory voices and her eyes, I had some concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329. The Court found her no reason to find Ms. Schmid incompetent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury returned its verdict on October 5, 2002, finding Ms. Schmid guilty, but mentally ill, of murder and other related charges. Dkt. 66-1, pp. 32-33. The court sentenced Ms. Schmid to 55 years' incarceration,\n   with five years suspended. Dkt. 66-3, pp. 56-58. Ms. Schmid's conviction was upheld on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274635\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/804/174/#p177\">\n    804 N.E.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After her petition to transfer was denied by the Indiana Supreme Court, Ms. Schmid sought state post-conviction relief. On appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, she argued that: 1) her attorneys were ineffective for failing to raise the defense of use of justifiable reasonable force; 2) \"she was incompetent to stand trial, and the attorneys were ineffective for failing to bring to the court's attention her deteriorated mental condition\"; 3) her attorneys were ineffective for failing to communicate a plea offer; and 4) her trial attorneys were ineffective for failing to explore the possibility that she testify. Dkt. 61-9. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of postconviction relief on August 13, 2012. Dkt. 6-11. On transfer to the Indiana Supreme Court, Ms. Schmid reasserted her claims, and the Indiana Supreme Court denied transfer on November 8, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Schmid filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus on February 11, 2014. This Court denied her petition as untimely on June 24, 2014. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case with instructions to consider holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of equitable tolling. Dkt. 49. A hearing was held on February 15, 2019. Dkt. 101. The Court found that Ms. Schmid was entitled to equitable tolling, dkt. 108, and now turns to the merits of her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To conclude that Ms. Schmid was competent at the time of trial, the Indiana Court of Appeals relied on two facts. First, the Indiana Court of Appeals stated that \"[b]ased on [the] testimony of [Ms. Schmid's trial counsel], Ms. Schmid was able to assist and communicate with her attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7121137\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/972/949/#p951\">\n    972 N.E.2d at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Indiana Court of Appeals altered the quote from the trial court's decision on post-conviction which stated that \"[b]ased on testimony of Amy Hutchinson and Phil Smith, Ms. Schmid was able to assist and communicate with her attorneys.\" PCR App. 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The original quote makes clear that the post-conviction court and, by adoption, the Indiana Court of Appeals relied only on the testimony of Ms. Hutchinson and Mr. Smith to conclude that Ms. Schmid was able to assist her attorneys. This is significant because Mr. Smith had withdrawn from representing Ms. Schmid before trial. He testified at the state post-conviction hearing that once Mr. Hennessy appeared in the case, \"the public defender's office felt their participation was not necessary.\" PCR Tr. 416. Amy Hutchinson also testified that she took a supporting role to attorney David Hennessy who was Ms. Schmid's lead counsel at trial. PCR 432. CHECK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As Ms. Schmid's lead attorney at trial, Mr. Hennessy's assessment of Ms. Schmid's ability to participate in her defense should have been key to any determination by the state post-conviction court about whether there was a bona fide doubt Ms. Schmid was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the state post-conviction evidentiary hearing Mr. Hennessy stated that if he had attempted to convey a preliminary plea offer to Ms. Schmid before trial, she would have given him a \"blank stare.\" PCR Tr. 407-08. Therefore, he did not bother to discuss it with her. When asked whether he thought Ms. Schmid was able to assist in her defense, Mr. Hennessy testified: \"I think she could understand what you're saying but she was heavily medicated and it-I don't know almost like being immobilized.\" PCR Tr. 366.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   While Ms. Hutchinson testified that Ms. Schmid was able to assist in her defense after she initially regained competency, she also testified that \"Anastasia was fairly psychotic at times. And would talk about voices and things like that and the biggest issue comes in to making sure that she is dealing in reality and not responding to voices.\" PCR Tr. 441, 443.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second fact the Indiana Court of Appeals relied upon to find that Ms. Schmid was competent at the time of trial was that Dr. Rahdert and Dr. DeSai found Ms. Schmid competent to stand trial. But the Court of Appeals failed to confront the fact that their competency evaluation took\n   place eight months before trial. Dkt. 66-3, p. 86. In\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit rejected a trial court's reliance on eight-month-old psychiatric evaluations as they \"could not have addressed [petitioner's] current psychological condition because of the numerous changes made to his prescriptions in the eight months between the examination and the start of trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7121137\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/972/949/#p951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Here, Ms. Schmid's medications were adjusted several times in the eight months between Dr. DeSai and Dr. Rahdert's evaluations and the commencement of her trial. Dkt. 42-4, PCR Confidential Exhibit Vol. 1, pp. 17-24, 51-54, 72-78, 83-84; PCR App. 56-57. Furthermore, Ms. Schmid's mental illness left her prone to psychotic episodes triggered by stressful or traumatic situations. Trial Tr. 622-23, 690. Consequently, a psychiatric evaluation conducted eight months prior would provide little insight into Ms. Schmid's mental fitness at the time of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Indiana Court of Appeals unreasonably applied federal law when it held that neither prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   had been satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held that the Illinois state court unreasonably applied\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   when it held that Mr. Burt's attorney's failure to request a competency hearing contemporaneous with his trial did not prejudice Mr. Burt.\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931911\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/557/#p569\">\n    422 F.3d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like in\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   , the Indiana Court of Appeals ignored key evidence of Ms. Schmid's potential incompetence when it analyzed the prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . And by relying on Dr. DeSai and Dr. Rahdert's evaluations to determine both that Ms. Schmid's counsel did not perform deficiently and that she was not prejudiced by the lack of competency hearing at the time of her trial, the Indiana Court of Appeals unreasonably applied federal law as established in\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pate\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931911\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/557/#p569\">\n    422 F.3d at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the Indiana Court of Appeals' decision \"was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 786-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is well settled that \"where the evidence raises a 'bona fide doubt' as to a defendant's competence to stand trial,\" the trial court, either on its own motion or at the request of counsel, must conduct a competency\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    Pate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171240\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/375/\">\n    383 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171240\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/375/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    420 U.S. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These Supreme Court cases leave no room for a trial attorney to strategically decide not to request a competency hearing when he has a bona fide doubt as to the defendant's competence, as Ms. Schmid's counsel did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The testimony of Ms. Schmid's counsel that she was psychotic, heavily medicated, and would have stared blankly had Mr. Hennessy attempted to discuss a plea offer with her, raised a bona fide doubt as to her competence to stand trial, particularly when one takes into account that she had previously been declared incompetent during the same proceedings. Her counsel's failure to request a competency hearing, and instead to stipulate to her competency when the prosecution raised the issue during trial was deficient performance. And because the evidence raises a bona fide doubt as to her competence to stand trial, she has \"establish[ed] a reasonable probability that [she] would have been found incompetent ... if [her] attorneys had requested a competency hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931911\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/557/#p569\">\n    422 F.3d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Ms. Schmid's petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   because she failed to receive effective assistance of counsel during trial in violation of her Sixth Amendment rights.
