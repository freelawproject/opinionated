TIGAR, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 16, 2019, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") published a joint interim final rule, entitled \"Asylum Eligibility and Procedural Modifications\" (the \"Rule\" or the \"third country transit bar\"). The effect of the Rule is to categorically deny asylum to almost anyone entering the United States at the southern border\n   if he or she did not first apply for asylum in Mexico or another third country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under our laws, the right to determine whether a particular group of applicants is categorically barred from eligibility for asylum is conferred on Congress. Congress has empowered the Attorney General to establish additional limitations and conditions by regulation, but only if such regulations are consistent with the existing immigration laws passed by Congress. This new Rule is likely invalid because it is inconsistent with the existing asylum laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Congress has already created a bar to asylum for an applicant who may be removed to a \"safe third country.\" The safe third country bar requires a third country's formal agreement to accept refugees and process their claims pursuant to safeguards negotiated with the United States. As part of that process, the United States must determine that (1) the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of a protected characteristic if removed to that third country and (2) the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection there. Thus, Congress has ensured that the United States will remove an asylum applicant to a third country only if that country would be safe for the applicant and the country provides equivalent asylum protections to those offered here. The Rule provides none of these protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Congress has also enacted a firm resettlement bar, pursuant to which asylum is unavailable to an alien who was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States. Before this bar can be applied, however, the government must make individualized determinations that an asylum applicant received an offer of some type of permanent resettlement in a country where the applicant's stay and ties are not too tenuous, or the conditions of his or her residence too restricted, for him or her to be firmly resettled. Again, the Rule ignores these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, there are serious questions about the Rule's validity given the government's failure to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment rules. The government made the Rule effective without giving persons affected by the Rule and the general public the chance to submit their views before the Rule took effect. The government contends that it did not need to comply with those procedures because the Rule involves the \"foreign affairs\" of the United States. But this exception requires the government to show that allowing public comment will provoke \"definitely undesirable international consequences,\" which the government has not done. Indeed, the Rule explicitly\n   <em>\n    invites\n   </em>\n   such comment even while it goes into effect. Thus, the government will still suffer the ill consequences of public comment - which, to be clear, are entirely speculative - but without gaining the benefit to good rule-making that public comment would provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, the Rule is likely invalid because the government's decision to promulgate it was arbitrary and capricious. The Rule purports to offer asylum seekers a safe and effective alternative via other countries' refugee processes. As the Rule expressly contemplates, this alternative forum will most often be Mexico. But the government's own administrative record contains no evidence that the Mexican asylum regime provides a full and fair procedure for determining asylum claims. Rather, it affirmatively demonstrates that asylum claimants removed to Mexico are likely to be (1) exposed to violence and abuse from third parties and government officials; (2) denied their rights under Mexican and international law, and (3) wrongly returned to countries from which\n   they fled persecution. The Rule also ignores the special difficulties faced by unaccompanied minors. Congress recognized these difficulties by exempting \"unaccompanied alien child[ren]\" from the safe third country bar. The Rule, which applies to unaccompanied minors just as it does to adults, casts these protections to one side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lastly, the balance of equities and the public interest tip strongly in favor of injunctive relief. While the public has a weighty interest in the efficient administration of the immigration laws at the border, it also has a substantial interest in ensuring that the statutes enacted by its representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat. Also, an injunction in this case would not radically change the law - or change it at all. It would merely restore the law to what it has been for many years, up until a few days ago. Finally, an injunction would vindicate the public's interest - which our existing immigration laws clearly articulate - in ensuring that we do not deliver aliens into the hands of their persecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For these reasons, and the additional reasons set forth below, the Court will enjoin the Rule from taking effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The government similarly asserts that the Rule need not resemble the safe third country bar because that bar, as implemented by the United States' sole safe third country agreement, (1) requires consideration of withholding of removal in Canada and (2) allows an alien to seek relief in the United States if Canada denies the asylum claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.13\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.30\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The government's focus on the type of conduct that is subject to each bar, or any difference in consequences that flow from its application, is misplaced. ECF No. 28 at 18, 21-22. If a country is not a safe option, there is no reason to infer that an alien's failure to seek protection there undermines her claim. For purposes of the particular question of safety, it makes no difference whether the safe option is one that the alien had or has (in the case of the firm resettlement bar), will have (in the case of the safe third country bar) or forewent (in the case of the Rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In sum, when Congress barred asylum to an applicant with an alternative safe option in another country, it required \"reasonable assurance that he will not suffer further harm or persecution there,\"\n   <em>\n    Andriasian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11668741\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/1033/#p1044\">\n    180 F.3d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in keeping with the long-held understanding that these bars apply to those who have somewhere else to turn,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of B-R-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20119\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Why is there no objective evidence to link a similar announcement and a spike in border crossings or claims for relief?

Reg. at 33,841. The government also cites two articles reporting that Mexico experienced an influx of migrants when it implemented a humanitarian visa program. AR 663-65, 683. While these do provide some additional support for the government's theory, the government makes no effort to address the similarities and differences between the two situations.

Nor has the government provided any reasoned explanation for the Rule's assumption that the failure to seek asylum in a third country is so damning standing alone that the government can reasonably disregard any alternative reasons why an applicant may have failed to seek asylum in that country. These deficiencies support a finding that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   review, however, also encompasses additional points the Court has not previously addressed, and the Court discusses them in greater detail here. First, the government suggests that its determination that \"asylum in Mexico is a feasible alternative to relief in the United States\" supports the Rule. ECF No. 28 at 31. The argument appears to run that, even if the Rule\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   provides inadequate safeguards for identifying third countries where transiting aliens should first seek asylum, it will provide such safeguards\n   <em>\n    in practice\n   </em>\n   because applicants subject to the Rule must necessarily transit through Mexico. Putting aside the legal sufficiency of the analysis, the factual premise \"runs counter to the evidence before the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   , 463 U.S. at 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The government's explanation on this point falters at the outset because, as the Organizations correctly note, the \"feasible alternative\" determination is based on a post hoc attempt to rewrite the Rule's supporting findings. \"[T]he principle of agency accountability ... means that 'an agency's action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

In the Rule's preamble, the agencies noted that \"[a]ll seven countries in Central America plus Mexico are parties to both the Refugee Convention and the Refugee Protocol.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 33,839. They then found that \"Mexico has expanded its capacity to adjudicate asylum claims in recent years, and the number of claims submitted in Mexico has increased,\" from 8,789 asylum claims filed in 2016, to 12,716 claims filed in the first three months of 2019 alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These facts do not make asylum in Mexico a \"feasible alternative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The statistics regarding the number of claims submitted in Mexico contradict the government's suggestion that Mexico provides an adequate alternative. While the Rule notes that Mexico has expanded its system's capacity, it also projects that, independently of the Rule, Mexico will receive over five times the claims in 2019 that it received in 2016. 84 Fed. Reg. at 33,839. The Rule does not discuss whether Mexico is adequately processing this unprecedented increase, let alone whether Mexico has capacity to handle additional claims. At the same time, the Rule notes that USCIS received 99,035 credible fear claims in 2018, that the immigration courts received over 162,000 asylum applications in 2018, and that \"non-Mexican aliens ... now constitute the overwhelming majority of aliens encountered along the southern border with Mexico, and the overwhelming majority of aliens who assert claims of fear.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33,838. By any reasonable estimation, the Rule anticipates that tens of thousands of additional asylum claimants - i.e., most of the persons who would otherwise seek asylum in the United States - will now seek relief in Mexico. The Rule does not even acknowledge this outcome, much less suggest that Mexico is prepared to accommodate such a massive increase. To the contrary, the record contains\n   reports that Mexico's \"increased detentions have overwhelmed capacity at [an] immigration center,\" AR 698, and that the head of Mexico's refugee agency \"was so overwhelmed that he had turned to [the United Nations] for help,\" AR 700. Again, the administrative record fails to support the conclusion that asylum in Mexico is a \"feasible alternative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In its opposition, the government attempts to declare its way past the issue, arguing \"the government determined that Mexico is a signatory to and in compliance with the relevant international instruments governing consideration of refugee claims, that its domestic law and procedures regarding such relief are robust and capable of handling claims made by Central American aliens in transit to the United States, and that the statistics regarding the influx of claims in that country support the conclusion that asylum in Mexico is a feasible alternative to relief in the United States,\" followed by a string citation to the administrative record. ECF No. 28 at 31. But nowhere in the Rule do the agencies find that Mexico \"is in compliance with the relevant international instruments governing consideration of refugee claims.\" ECF No. 28 at 31. Nor does the government cite any finding in the Rule that Mexico's \"domestic law and procedures regarding such relief are robust and capable of handling claims made by Central American aliens in transit to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court cannot \"accept [government] counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency action,\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   , 463 U.S. at 50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , these arguments do not help the Rule survive arbitrary and capricious review. Moreover, the record cites actually weaken the government's position. With limited exceptions that are at best unresponsive to the question,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the cited evidence consists simply of an unbroken succession of humanitarian organizations explaining why the government's contention is ungrounded in reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, the government cites a report from the international organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res,\n   <em>\n    Forced to Flee Central America's Northern Triangle: A Neglected Humanitarian Crisis\n   </em>\n   (May 2017). AR 286-317. The report found that, during transit through Mexico, \"68.3 percent of people from the [Northern Triangle of Central America (\"NTCA\") ] reported that they were victims of violence,\" and that \"31.4 percent of women and 17.2 percent of men had been sexually abused.\" AR 296-97. Moreover, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res concluded that \"[d]espite the exposure to violence and the deadly risks ... face[d] in their countries of origin, the non-refoulement principle is systematically violated in Mexico.\" AR 306.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the report\n   noted that Mexico had made some official attempts to improve its system, it observed a significant \"gap between rights and reality,\" citing \"[l]ack of access to the asylum and humanitarian visa processes, lack of coordination between different governmental agencies, fear of retaliation in case of official denunciation to a prosecutor, [and] expedited deportation procedures that do not consider individual exposure to violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, \"[t]he lack of safe and legal pathways effectively keeps refugees and migrants trapped in areas controlled by criminal organizations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Second, an April 2019 factsheet from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\"UNHCR\") lists \"strong obstacles to accessing the asylum procedure\" in Mexico, including \"[t]he absence of proper protection screening protocols for families and adults, the lack of a systematic implementation of existing best interest determination procedures for unaccompanied children and detention of asylum-seekers submitting their claim at border entry points.\" AR 534. Further, \"[t]he abandonment rate of asylum procedures, especially in Southern Mexico is a key protection concern. This situation, compounded by insufficient resources and limited field presence of [Comis\u00edon Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados (\"COMAR\") ] in key locations in Northern and Central Mexico, continues to pose challenges to efficient processing of asylum claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The UNCHR also observed that \"[p]ersons in need of international protection often take dangerous routes to reach COMAR offices\" and that \"[w]omen and girls in particular are at risk of sexual and gender-based violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While UNCHR indicated that it was partnering with Mexico on various initiatives, it did not suggest that these problems would be easily solved, let alone consider how a massive influx of claimants might affect the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Third, the government cites to the UNCHR's July 2018 review of Mexico's refugee process. AR 638-57. The report notes two positive developments in response to a prior round of recommendations, AR 639, but documents a host of additional problems. For instance, the UNCHR stated that \"concerns persist regarding the rise in crimes and the increased risk towards migrants throughout the country, the high levels of impunity for crimes committed against migrants, and the difficulties that migrants who are victims of crime and asylum-seekers continue to face in accessing justice and obtaining regularization for humanitarian reasons under article 52 of the\n   <em>\n    2011 Migration Act.\n   </em>\n   \" AR 640. In addition, the UNCHR highlighted ongoing problems in the areas of (1) \"[s]exual and gender-based violence against migrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees\"; (2) \"[d]etention of migrants and asylum seekers, particularly children and other vulnerable persons\"; and (3) \"[a]ccess to economic, social and cultural rights for asylum-seekers and refugees.\" AR 640-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Fourth, the government relies on a November 2018 factsheet from Human Rights First, which asks: \"Is Mexico Safe for Refugees and Asylum Seekers?\" AR 702. Answering in the negative, the factsheet explains that \"\n   <em>\n    many refugees face deadly dangers in Mexico. For many, the country is not at all safe.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). Human Rights First notes that \"refugees and migrants face acute risks of kidnapping, disappearance, sexual assault, trafficking, and other grave harms in Mexico,\" based not just on \"their inherent vulnerabilities as refugees but also on account of their race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other reasons.\" AR 703 (emphasis omitted). The factsheet also concludes that \"[d]eficiencies, barriers, and flaws in Mexico's asylum\n   system leave many refugees unprotected and Mexican authorities continue to improperly return asylum seekers to their countries of persecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). For example, \"refugees are blocked from protection under an untenable 30-day filing deadline, denied protection by COMAR officers who claim that refugees targeted by groups with national reach can safely relocate within their countries, and lack an effective appeal process to correct wrongful denials of protection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Fifth, the government cites to a 2018 report from Amnesty International entitled \"Overlooked, Under-Protected: Mexico's Deadly\n   <em>\n    Refoulement\n   </em>\n   of Central Americans Seeking Asylum.\" AR 704-27. As its title suggests, the report concludes that \"the Mexican government is routinely failing in its obligations under international law to protect those who are in need of international protection, as well as repeatedly violating the\n   <em>\n    non-refoulement\n   </em>\n   principle, a binding pillar of international law that prohibits the return of people to a real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations. These failures by the Mexican government in many cases can cost the lives of those returned to the country from which they fled.\" AR 708. Among its highlights include testimony that Mexican officials systematically coerced asylum seekers into waiving their right to asylum, including by denying detainees food, AR 718, and \"a number of reports of grave human rights violations committed by ... officials during the moments of apprehension as well as in detention centres,\" AR 722.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Sixth, the government points to a New York Times article,\n   <em>\n    'They Were Abusing Us the Whole Way': A Tough Path for Gay and Trans Migrants\n   </em>\n   (July 11, 2018). AR 756-66. The article notes that \"[t]rans women in particular encounter persistent abuse and harassment in Mexico at the hands of drug traffickers, rogue immigration agents and other migrants.\" AR 758. It then goes on to recount the story of one migrant who was robbed and sexually exploited in transit. AR 760.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Additional portions of the administrative record not cited by the government bolster the already overwhelming evidence on this point. The Women's Refugee Commission likewise concluded that \"Mexico is clearly not a safe, or in many cases viable, alternative for many refugees and vulnerable migrants seeking international protection.\" AR 771.

The Court notes also that Mexico's example demonstrates for a second time why two of the Rule's critical assumptions are arbitrary, not just as to Mexico, but as a general matter. First, even though Mexico is a party to the agreements listed in the Rule, the unrefuted record establishes that it is categorically not a \"safe option[ ]\" for the majority of asylum seekers.\n   <em>\n    Matter of B-R-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20119\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Reg. at 33,839 n.7. First, the Rule notes that Congress did not exempt those children from every statutory bar to asylum eligibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As just explained, however, that does not mean that the agencies need not consider whether\n   such an exception was appropriate. Second, the Rule reasons that an exception is unnecessary because unaccompanied children can still apply for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This explanation suggests that the agencies at least considered the problem of unaccompanied minors. But there are at least serious questions whether this conclusion was supported by the record. For one, the agencies did not expressly consider whether the Rule's rationale applies with full force to those children. Given that children have more difficulty than adults pursuing asylum claims in Mexico, AR 641-42, 778-86, the agencies have not explained why it is rational to assume that an unaccompanied minor's failure to apply has the same probative value on the merits as an adult's - assuming for the moment that an adult's failure has any meaningful value. Also, as the Court has previously explained, the availability of alternative forms of immigration relief, which are subject to a higher bar and different collateral consequences, are not interchangeable substitutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

Last, the agencies did not address whether placing unaccompanied minors in the more rigorous reasonable fear screening process, combined with the higher standard for withholding of removal and protection under CAT, creates a significantly greater risk that even those alternative claims will be decided wrongly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, the Organizations assert that the Rule is counterproductive because applicants whose claims have already been denied in third countries are likely to have weaker rather than stronger claims. ECF No. 3-1 at 27. The Organizations' argument is based on a misunderstanding of the Rule's purposes. As the government points out, the Rule's intent is to incentivize putative refugees to seek relief at the first opportunity, preferably elsewhere. ECF No. 28 at 31.
