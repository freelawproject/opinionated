(<em>See</em> Dkt. 4, Complaint). Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on January 29, 2015, (<em>see</em> Dkt. 26, \"FAC\"), and the operative Second Amended Complaint on July 7, 2015. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 70, \"SAC\"). In the SAC, plaintiffs assert three claims against DHCS and the current DHCS Director, Jennifer Kent (collectively, \"defendants\") for violations of: (1) the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131</extracted-citation>, <em>et</em> <em>seq.</em> ; (2) the Rehabilitation Act, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794</extracted-citation>, <em>et</em> <em>seq.</em> ; and (3) California Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 11135 &amp; 11139. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at \u00b6\u00b6 124-153</extracted-citation>).</p><p id=\"p-11\"><em><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-12\">Plaintiffs are California residents who \"all have significant physical disabilities and were institutionalized but now live in their own homes with Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant care[.]\" (<em>See</em> Dkt. 194, Parties' Joint Memorandum of Points and Authorities Re: Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment [ ] (\"Joint Br.\") at 1). \"Medicaid, called Medi-Cal in California, is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for eligible low-income people.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 4). Plaintiffs receive home care pursuant to the Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Home and Community-Based Services Waiver program (\"NF/AH Waiver\" or \"Waiver\"), which \"is intended to provide in-home services for Medicaid recipients with disabilities who qualify for placement in nursing facilities and other institutions.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 1). The NF/AH Waiver program is operated by the DHCS, (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at 6</extracted-citation>), but its administration is overseen by a federal agency called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (\"CMS\"). (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at 5</extracted-citation>). In general, the DHCS cannot modify the Waiver program without first submitting a proposal to, and obtaining approval from, the CMS. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at 5-7</extracted-citation>).</p><p id=\"p-13\">When the instant Motion was filed, the NF/AH Waiver program provided that eligible patients \"may receive services ... if they require a level of care otherwise available in an institution\" such as a hospital or nursing facility. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 112, Statement of Interest of the United States of America (\"SOI\") at 2). In that circumstance, the \"cost of services available to\" the patient is \"capped according to that <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1051\" href=\"#p1051\" id=\"p1051\">*1051</a>individual's designated level of care.\" (<em>Id.</em> ). \"Although the caps correspond to the type of institution in which the individual would otherwise receive services, the Waiver caps are lower than the average cost of providing care in the corresponding institution.\" (<em>Id.</em> ). Despite the Waiver's cost limits, defendants \"have administered treatment plans for individuals on the [W]aiver with costs in excess of the applicable limit.\" (<em>Id.</em> ). Here, the DHCS sent letters to all three plaintiffs on December 2, 2015, stating that if the costs of plaintiffs' medically necessary services exceed the Waiver's current individual cost limit, the DHCS will nonetheless continue to pay for those services. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 20, 22 &amp; 25).</p><p id=\"p-14\">After the instant Motion was filed, the CMS approved an amendment to the Waiver program. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 305, Defendants' Ex Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority [ ] (\"Defs.' Application\") at 4-5). The amendment \"purports to remove the individual cost limitations\" from the Waiver program. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 171, Supplemental Statement of Interest of the United States of America (\"Supp. SOI\") at 1). However, plaintiffs contend that the amendment \"simply embedded the cost limits into a different section of the Waiver document ... and now calls them 'cost amounts' \" instead of \"cost limits.\" (<em>See</em> Dkt. 306, Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Ex Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority [ ] (\"Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Application\") at 10). Indeed, the amended Waiver program sets forth the same cost limit figures as it did before the amendment took effect. (<em>Compare</em> Dkt. 305-2, Defs.' Application, Exh. A, Application for a 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waiver at ECF 31939 (amended Waiver program) <em>with</em> Dkt. 197-22, Declaration of Elissa Gershon [ ] (\"Gershon Decl.\"), Attachment (\"Att.\") 66, Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital (NF/AH) Transition and Diversion Waiver at ECF 25149 (Waiver program before amendment)).</p><p id=\"p-15\">According to plaintiffs, the amended NF/AH Waiver program will continue to encourage a \"practice of imposing individual cost limits far below institutional rates[,]\" (<em>see</em> Dkt. 306, Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Application at 12), which forces participants \"to utilize lower cost Waiver services (i.e., unlicensed attendant care instead of nurses) or reduce the amount of services the participant receives.\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 7). In addition, plaintiffs state that \"participants with service needs in excess of the individual cost limits may also be disenrolled from the Waiver and 'will have no other option but be admitted to nursing facilities to ensure their health and safety.' \" (<em>Id.</em> ). Plaintiffs therefore \"seek injunctive and declaratory relief ... requiring Defendants to take steps to ensure that Plaintiffs ... can get the services they need to remain safely at home[.]\" (<em>Id.</em> at 1).</p><p id=\"p-16\">Further, although the DHCS \"has stated that Plaintiffs can receive all medically necessary waiver services without regard to the cost limits[,]\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 3), plaintiffs contend that the DHCS \"has still refused to approve all of the services recommended by their doctors.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 1). In late 2015, all three plaintiffs submitted updated requests for Waiver services to the DHCS. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at 26</extracted-citation>). The requests were signed by each of plaintiffs' treating physicians. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em> ). The DHCS responded by sending letters to each plaintiff stating that it would continue paying for all medically necessary Waiver services above the Waiver's cost limits, but that it also would \"continue to conduct utilization management to determine whether requested services [we]re medically necessary and consistent with applicable law.\" (<em>Id.</em> ). To date, the DHCS has not provided plaintiffs with all the services identified in their 2015 <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1052\" href=\"#p1052\" id=\"p1052\">*1052</a>requests. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\"> at 26-27</extracted-citation>). According to plaintiffs, \"Benison remains without 46 hours per month of services to fulfill his need for 24-hour 'direct care' services per day.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 27). Further, neither Thomas nor Palomares have received any further communication regarding the outcome of the DHCS's review. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">id.</extracted-citation></em> at 26 &amp; 27).</p><p id=\"p-17\"><em><strong>LEGAL STANDARD</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-18\">Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict. <em>See</em> <em>Anderson v.

It is undisputed that, for the time being, the DHCS \"has authorized all medically necessary Waiver services to allow Plaintiffs to remain safely in their homes, even if those services exceed the individual cost limits.\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 35; <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 20, 22 &amp; 25 (describing letters sent to plaintiffs by the DHCS stating that the DHCS will pay for medically necessary Waiver services that exceed the Waiver's current individual cost limit)). However, the parties vigorously dispute the long-term implications of the DHCS's <em>ad</em> <em>hoc</em> decision to suspend the Waiver's cost limits with respect to plaintiffs. The DHCS contends that plaintiffs \"face no risk of institutionalization\" because it \"has authorized all three Plaintiffs to receive at least 24 hours of care per day.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 35). Plaintiffs respond that the DHCS's \"opaque and unwritten <em>ad</em> <em>hoc</em> exceptions policy ... does not ensure that individuals who require additional care to remain in the community will have the necessary alternative services identified and put in place to avoid unnecessary institutionalization.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 32).</p><p id=\"p-30\">The court is troubled by the fact that the DHCS could, at any time, rescind its letters to plaintiffs authorizing medically necessary services above the Waiver's cost limits, and that the DHCS is essentially \"refus[ing] to commit to provide Plaintiffs with ongoing services[.]\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 33). Importantly, \"Defendants have no written policy or process for authorizing exceptions to the cost ceilings.\" (Dkt. 112, SOI at 2). These facts tend to show that plaintiffs are at risk of institutionalization as a result of the cost limits imposed by the Waiver program. However, there are material factual disputes regarding whether that risk is \"serious\" for purposes of the ADA's integration mandate. <em>See</em> <em>Dreyfus</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622470\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/706/#p733\">697 F.3d at 734</extracted-citation>. For example, defendants have offered evidence showing that plaintiffs \"have been well cared for and have remained safely in their homes\" at all times while receiving their currently authorized services. (<em>See</em> Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 36) (\"Plaintiffs' contention that they are fighting to remain in their homes is vehemently disputed and contradicted by the evidence.\"). Defendants have also offered evidence showing that their <em>ad</em> <em>hoc</em> decisions to except plaintiffs and other patients from the Waiver program's cost limits - although based on unwritten policy - add up to an \"effectively working\" deinstitutionalization <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1056\" href=\"#p1056\" id=\"p1056\">*1056</a>scheme.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (<em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 12) (noting \"the large Waiver population and the competing budgetary restraints\"); <em>Sanchez</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944639\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/1051/#p1067\">416 F.3d at 1067-68</extracted-citation> (holding that the court must consider \"existing budgetary constraints and the competing demands of other services that the State provides\" in determining whether a state's deinstitutionalization scheme is \"effectively working\"). Thus, while the court has serious concerns about whether the Waiver program comports with the ADA's integration mandate, the court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate at this time. <em>See</em> <em>Barlow</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1856082\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/943/1132/#p1134\">943 F.2d at 1134</extracted-citation> (holding that, at the summary judgment stage, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party).</p><p id=\"p-31\">Similarly, there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether plaintiffs are \"without medically necessary direct care\" because the DHCS has not authorized \"all the services that Plaintiffs' doctors have recommended.\" (<em>See</em> Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 32-33). Specifically, defendants have presented the opinion of Dr. Rajiv Dhamija, who evaluated all three plaintiffs and concluded that their currently-authorized services are sufficient to ensure that they remain safely in their homes. (<em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 19, 22 &amp; 24). While the DHCS maintains the right to determine - through the appropriate administrative process - what services are medically necessary for Waiver program participants in the first instance, (<em>see</em> Dkt, 194, Joint Br. at 37); <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2014059.5\">Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 14059.5</extracted-citation> (defining a \"medically necessary\" service), it is unclear to what extent the DHCS is obligated to consider or otherwise take into account the opinions of plaintiffs' medical providers. In light of that uncertainty and given the factual disputes regarding what services are medically necessary for plaintiffs, the court is persuaded that summary judgment is not appropriate at this time.</p><p id=\"p-32\"><em><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-33\">Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p><p id=\"p-34\">1.
