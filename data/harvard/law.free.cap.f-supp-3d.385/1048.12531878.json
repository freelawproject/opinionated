In general, the DHCS cannot modify the Waiver program without first submitting a proposal to, and obtaining approval from, the CMS. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n       at 5-7\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      When the instant Motion was filed, the NF/AH Waiver program provided that eligible patients \"may receive services ... if they require a level of care otherwise available in an institution\" such as a hospital or nursing facility. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 112, Statement of Interest of the United States of America (\"SOI\") at 2). In that circumstance, the \"cost of services available to\" the patient is \"capped according to that\n     individual's designated level of care.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). \"Although the caps correspond to the type of institution in which the individual would otherwise receive services, the Waiver caps are lower than the average cost of providing care in the corresponding institution.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Despite the Waiver's cost limits, defendants \"have administered treatment plans for individuals on the [W]aiver with costs in excess of the applicable limit.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Here, the DHCS sent letters to all three plaintiffs on December 2, 2015, stating that if the costs of plaintiffs' medically necessary services exceed the Waiver's current individual cost limit, the DHCS will nonetheless continue to pay for those services. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 20, 22 &amp; 25).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      After the instant Motion was filed, the CMS approved an amendment to the Waiver program. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 305, Defendants' Ex Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority [ ] (\"Defs.' Application\") at 4-5). The amendment \"purports to remove the individual cost limitations\" from the Waiver program. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 171, Supplemental Statement of Interest of the United States of America (\"Supp. SOI\") at 1). However, plaintiffs contend that the amendment \"simply embedded the cost limits into a different section of the Waiver document ... and now calls them 'cost amounts' \" instead of \"cost limits.\" (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 306, Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Ex Parte Application to: Notify the Court of New Authority [ ] (\"Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Application\") at 10). Indeed, the amended Waiver program sets forth the same cost limit figures as it did before the amendment took effect. (\n      <em>\n       Compare\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 305-2, Defs.' Application, Exh. A, Application for a 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waiver at ECF 31939 (amended Waiver program)\n      <em>\n       with\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 197-22, Declaration of Elissa Gershon [ ] (\"Gershon Decl.\"), Attachment (\"Att.\") 66, Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital (NF/AH) Transition and Diversion Waiver at ECF 25149 (Waiver program before amendment)).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      According to plaintiffs, the amended NF/AH Waiver program will continue to encourage a \"practice of imposing individual cost limits far below institutional rates[,]\" (\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 306, Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Application at 12), which forces participants \"to utilize lower cost Waiver services (i.e., unlicensed attendant care instead of nurses) or reduce the amount of services the participant receives.\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 7). In addition, plaintiffs state that \"participants with service needs in excess of the individual cost limits may also be disenrolled from the Waiver and 'will have no other option but be admitted to nursing facilities to ensure their health and safety.' \" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Plaintiffs therefore \"seek injunctive and declaratory relief ... requiring Defendants to take steps to ensure that Plaintiffs ... can get the services they need to remain safely at home[.]\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 1).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      Further, although the DHCS \"has stated that Plaintiffs can receive all medically necessary waiver services without regard to the cost limits[,]\" (Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 3), plaintiffs contend that the DHCS \"has still refused to approve all of the services recommended by their doctors.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 1). In late 2015, all three plaintiffs submitted updated requests for Waiver services to the DHCS. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n       at 26\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ). The requests were signed by each of plaintiffs' treating physicians. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      ). The DHCS responded by sending letters to each plaintiff stating that it would continue paying for all medically necessary Waiver services above the Waiver's cost limits, but that it also would \"continue to conduct utilization management to determine whether requested services [we]re medically necessary and consistent with applicable law.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). To date, the DHCS has not provided plaintiffs with all the services identified in their 2015\n     requests. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n       at 26-27\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ).

Defendants have also offered evidence showing that their\n      <em>\n       ad\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       hoc\n      </em>\n      decisions to except plaintiffs and other patients from the Waiver program's cost limits - although based on unwritten policy - add up to an \"effectively working\" deinstitutionalization\n     scheme.\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n      (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 12) (noting \"the large Waiver population and the competing budgetary restraints\");\n      <em>\n       Sanchez\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944639\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/1051/#p1067\">\n       416 F.3d at 1067-68\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (holding that the court must consider \"existing budgetary constraints and the competing demands of other services that the State provides\" in determining whether a state's deinstitutionalization scheme is \"effectively working\"). Thus, while the court has serious concerns about whether the Waiver program comports with the ADA's integration mandate, the court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate at this time.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Barlow\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1856082\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/943/1132/#p1134\">\n       943 F.2d at 1134\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (holding that, at the summary judgment stage, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      Similarly, there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether plaintiffs are \"without medically necessary direct care\" because the DHCS has not authorized \"all the services that Plaintiffs' doctors have recommended.\" (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. 194, Joint Br. at 32-33). Specifically, defendants have presented the opinion of Dr. Rajiv Dhamija, who evaluated all three plaintiffs and concluded that their currently-authorized services are sufficient to ensure that they remain safely in their homes. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 19, 22 &amp; 24). While the DHCS maintains the right to determine - through the appropriate administrative process - what services are medically necessary for Waiver program participants in the first instance, (\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Dkt, 194, Joint Br. at 37);\n      <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2014059.5\">\n       Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 14059.5\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (defining a \"medically necessary\" service), it is unclear to what extent the DHCS is obligated to consider or otherwise take into account the opinions of plaintiffs' medical providers. In light of that uncertainty and given the factual disputes regarding what services are medically necessary for plaintiffs, the court is persuaded that summary judgment is not appropriate at this time.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      1.
