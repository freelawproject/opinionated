(\"Wilenchik\"), counsel for Wyo Tech (Doc. 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court held a telephonic hearing on the discovery dispute on February 27, 2019\n   (Doc. 103) and then requested supplemental briefing on three issues (Doc. 109), which the parties have provided (Docs. 113, 114). Afterward, on April 8, 2019, the Court held another round of oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As explained below, the Court has now reached conclusions as to the three legal issues addressed in the supplemental briefing. Specifically, the Court concludes that (1) the Judgment Creditors complied with New York law when they issued the restraining notice to Wells Fargo, (2) the validity of the restraining notice is irrelevant now that the restrained funds have been interpleaded, and (3) the Judgment Creditors are entitled to conduct discovery in this interpleader action. Based on these conclusions, the Court will deny Wyo Tech's two pending motions and order Wilenchik and Beus Gilbert PLLC (\"Beus Gilbert\") to comply with the subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The Judgment Creditors Obtain A $ 7 Million Judgment Against Danzik, Then Utilize A \"Restraining Notice\" To Freeze Wyo Tech's Bank Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2016, the Judgment Creditors obtained a $ 7,033,491.13 judgment against Dennis Danzik and one of Danzik's companies, RDX Technologies Corporation (collectively, \"Judgment Debtors\"), in New York state court. During that litigation, the New York court also held Danzik in civil and criminal contempt, concluding that Danzik is the \"epitome of a recalcitrant, contemptuous, and incorrigible litigant\" who \"lie[d],\" \"deliberately did not disclose\" relevant records, \"coerced\" a witness into \"submitting false affidavits,\" and \"perjured himself before a Canadian bankruptcy court.\" (Doc. 89-3 at 9-10, 12, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2017, the Judgment Creditors' attorneys attempted to collect on the outstanding judgment by freezing a particular bank account at Wells Fargo bank. Notably, this account wasn't held in the name of either of the Judgment Debtors-it was held in the name of Wyo Tech, an LLC doing business in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To freeze this bank account, the Judgment Creditors' attorneys utilized a procedural tool known as a \"restraining notice,\" which is governed by section 5222 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"CPLR\"). That statute provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] restraining notice may be issued by ... the attorney for the judgment creditor as officer of the court\" and that it is permissible to serve a restraining notice \"upon a person other than the judgment debtor or obligor\" so long as the issuing attorney \"has stated in the notice that ... the judgment debtor or obligor has an interest in specified property in the possession or custody of the person served.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5222(a), (b). In other words, CPLR \u00a7 5222 allows a judgment creditor to freeze a bank account held by a third party based solely on an assertion by the judgment creditor's attorney that the judgment debtor holds an interest in the account-there is no requirement that the judgment creditor establish this interest to a judge before the restraining notice may issue.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global Tech., Inc. v.

Whether issued by a court or an attorney acting as an officer of the court, a restraining notice is an injunction and 'disobedience is punishable as a contempt of court.' \") (quoting CPLR \u00a7 5222(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After being served with the restraining notice, Wells Fargo froze Wyo Tech's account, which held $ 546,282.55. When Wyo Tech learned its account had been frozen, it immediately complained to the Judgment Creditors and to Wells Fargo, disputed whether the Judgment Debtors held any interest in the account, and threatened to sue. In response, Wells Fargo filed an interpleader action in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Arguments And Rulings Concerning Whether The Judgment Creditors Should Be Allowed To Conduct Discovery In The Interpleader Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the outset of this case, the Judgment Creditors and Wyo Tech presented sharply different views about how the litigation should proceed. In the parties' initial Rule 26(f) report, which was filed in July 2018, the Judgment Creditors argued they should be allowed to conduct \"discovery ... to determine who has an interest in the funds at issue, who owns Wyo Tech, how Wyo Tech gets its money, why it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Danzik's company, wife, daughter, and cronies, why Danzik's wife and daughter had control of Wyo Tech's funds, and why Wyo Tech has paid thousands of dollars of Danzik's legal fees, among other things.\" (Doc. 62 at 11.) Wyo Tech, in contrast, argued that the Judgment Creditors shouldn't be allowed to conduct any discovery and that the Court should immediately decide who was entitled to the interpleaded funds. (Doc. 62 at 13 [\"Wyo Tech ... believes that discovery in this case should be deferred until such time as the Court rules on the motion for summary judgment Wyo Tech intends to file within 30 days after the ... Scheduling Conference.\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 24, 2018, the Court held a Rule 16 scheduling conference. (Doc. 63.) During this conference, the Court noted Wyo Tech's preference to postpone discovery until the Court had decided certain motions but ordered the parties to provide proposed discovery dates in a new filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 16, 2018, Wyo Tech filed a motion entitled \"Motion for Immediate Release of Wrongly Restrained Funds.\" (Doc. 72.) In this motion, Wyo Tech argued, among other things, that \"Wyo Tech anticipates that Judgment Creditors and their Counsel will attempt to delay a ruling on this Motion by claiming that they need to conduct 'additional' discovery. Any such request should be denied ... [because] Judgment Creditors and their Counsel[']s defense of their actions must be done based on the evidence they claim to have had in their possession at the time they issued the wrongful restraining notice....\" (Doc. 72 at 4 n.1, emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 20, 2018, the parties filed a supplemental Rule 26(f) report. (Doc. 75.) It stated that the parties should have until August 9, 2019, to complete discovery and that dispositive motions shouldn't be due until September 6, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 27, 2018, the Court issued its Rule 16 scheduling order. (Doc. 79.) In it, the Court approved the approach set forth in the parties' supplemental Rule 26(f) report, adopting the parties' proposed dates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 9, 2018, the Judgment Creditors filed an opposition to Wyo Tech's\n   motion for immediate release of funds. (Doc. 88.) Among other things, the Judgment Creditors argued that (1) they \"are entitled to take discovery, pursuant to the Court's scheduling order, before the funds are summarily released\" and (2) Wyo Tech's request for an immediate ruling was inconsistent with \"its counsel['s] previous[ ] stipulat[ion] to an extensive discovery schedule.\" (Doc. 88 at 13-15 &amp; n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 31, 2018, this case was reassigned to the currently-assigned judge. (Doc. 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 19, 2018, the Court issued an order resolving several pending matters, including Wyo Tech's motion for immediate release of funds. (Doc. 94.) The Court concluded the motion was \"premature, because the discovery deadline is over eight months away,\" and thus held that \"Wyo Tech may refile a summary judgment motion in compliance with the Local Rules after the parties have had the opportunity to conduct discovery.\" (Doc. 94 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Issues from Supplemental Briefs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    Did The Judgment Creditors Comply With CPLR \u00a7 5222(b) When They Issued The Restraining Notice To Wells Fargo In October 2017?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Wyo Tech, the restraining notice is invalid because there is a \"clear rule of law\" establishing \"that a court must have previously determined that an entity is the 'alter ego' of [a] judgment debtor prior to a restraining notice being validly issued.\" (Doc. 113 at 3.) However, Wyo Tech cites only one case-\n   <em>\n    JSC Foreign Econ. Ass'n Technostroyexport v.

The court held that New York state cases \"support the proposition that a judgment creditor may restrain the assets of a judgment debtor wherever those assets may be\" but \"do not support the proposition that the assets of third parties may be restrained in anticipation of a finding that those third parties are alter egos or hold assets of alleged alter egos of the judgment debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055694\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/295/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9055694\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/295/366/\">\n    at 392-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court respectfully disagrees with the\n   <em>\n    JSC\n   </em>\n   court's interpretation of New York state law.

The dispute concerns a subpoena issued by the Judgment Creditors on Wilenchik on February 11, 2019. (Doc. 101.) The subpoena seeks documents sufficient to show all payments made to Wilenchik by Wyo Tech and by third party Inductance Energy Corporation (\"Inductance\") and the client(s) on whose behalf and the matter for which the payments were made.

They argue that \"the more money Wyo Tech paid for Danzik's and his cronies' legal fees-especially in matters in which Wyo Tech has no interest-the more probable it is that Danzik has an interest in the disputed funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) They further claim that, because \"just weeks before [the Judgment Creditors' counsel] restrained the disputed funds, Danzik's daughter wrote a $ 25,000 check from Wyo Tech's account for the 'opening' of an Inductance account,\" \"if Inductance is paying Danzik's or his cronies' legal fees using money derived in part from Wyo Tech, it makes it more probable that Danzik has an interest in the disputed Wyo Tech funds-and merely diverted those funds (and future funds he acquired) to Inductance to continue paying his expenses after the CWT Parties restrained Wyo Tech's account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Wilenchik objects on the sole ground that the documents sought by the subpoena are irrelevant. Wilenchik provides three main arguments in support of this objection: (1) \"[Inductance] is not a party to this litigation\"; (2) \"a Restraining Notice's validity rises or falls on the information known at the time of issuance\"; and (3) \"evidence of payment for the benefit of another is not sufficient to issue a Restraining Notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The test for \"relevance,\" in the context of a Rule 45 subpoena to a non-party, is no different than the test under Rules 26 and 34.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Transcor, Inc. v.

In April 2018, the bankruptcy court issued an order lifting the automatic stay in part so that Wyo Tech and the Judgment Creditors could continue litigating this interpleader action. (Doc. 99 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 95-1 at 2 [\"[T]he [bankruptcy] court entered its order terminating the automatic stay allowing the interpleader action to proceed.\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Later, two of the Judgment Creditors, CWT Canada II Limited Partnership and Resource Recovery Corporation, asked the bankruptcy court to grant them \"derivative standing\" to assert additional claims-specifically, \"fraudulent transfer and conspiracy to commit fraudulent transfer claims\"-in the interpleader action on behalf of Danzik's estate. (Doc. 95-1 at 2.) In July 2018, the bankruptcy court issued a five-page order denying this request. (Doc. 95-1.) After summarizing the law concerning the \"implied right for a creditor ... to be granted permission to pursue avoidance actions on behalf of the bankruptcy estate when the trustee or debtor-in-possession refuses to do so\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2), the court concluded the Judgment Creditors' request should be denied because (1) they hadn't asked Danzik's estate for permission to assert the fraudulent transfer claims, (2) they hadn't provided any \"specific factual allegations\" to support their accusation that Danzik had fraudulently transferred any property to Wyo Tech, and (3) they hadn't proved that the Danzik\n   estate's failure to assert claims in the interpleader action was unjustified or unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, in February 2019, the bankruptcy court dismissed the case. (Doc. 100-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Wyo Tech moves to dismiss, or, alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings, asking the Court to release the interpleaded funds to Wyo Tech on the ground that the Judgment Creditors are barred from making a claim on the interpleaded funds because their main contention here is that Danzik has an interest in the funds, yet \"the Bankruptcy Court has already, unequivocally and specifically, ordered that the CWT Parties are not authorized to pursue such a claim in this action.\" (Doc. 95 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In response, the Judgment Creditors argue the Court should deny this motion for four reasons: (1) Wyo Tech is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine from seeking the same relief it sought in its unsuccessful August 16, 2018 motion (Doc. 72); (2) this is a disguised motion for reconsideration of the Court's August 1, 2018 order (Doc. 69), and Wyo Tech has no basis for reconsideration here; (3) this motion is premature because its asks the Court to decide the merits of the parties' claims before discovery closes; and (4) the bankruptcy court order on which Wyo Tech relies cannot have preclusive effect and is not preclusive here. (Doc. 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Wyo Tech's motion will be denied for several reasons. First, the Court is not persuaded that the bankruptcy court's July 2018 order should be construed as a determination, on the merits, that the Judgment Creditors lack any legitimate claim to the $ 546,282.55 in interpleaded funds. Notably, in April 2018, the bankruptcy court agreed to lift the automatic stay so the Judgment Creditors could pursue claims in this interpleader action. The July 2018 ruling, in contrast, addressed a technical, bankruptcy-specific issue as to whether the Judgment Creditors had \"derivative standing\" to assert particular claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. It would be anomalous to interpret the July 2018 ruling as implicitly overruling the April 2018 ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, the July 2018 ruling merely noted that the Judgment Creditors hadn't attempted to offer any specific allegations in support of their claim that Danzik had fraudulent transferred certain assets to Wyo Tech. In other words, the court was identifying a pleading deficiency. This is different from a determination, on the merits, that no fraudulent transfer occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, it appears the primary reason why the bankruptcy court denied the Judgment Creditors' request for derivative standing was because they didn't make a request to the trustee of Danzik's estate before filing their motion, which is a procedural prerequisite under the relevant bankruptcy laws. This is, again, much different from a determination, on the merits, that no fraudulent transfer occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, it is also worth noting that, in February 2019, the bankruptcy court dismissed Danzik's bankruptcy case. This raises questions about whether any earlier orders issued by the bankruptcy court may be said to have a collateral estoppel effect. After all, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), the dismissal of a debtor's bankruptcy case \"revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case.\" \"The basic purpose of [ \u00a7 349(b) ] is to undo the bankruptcy case, as far as practicable, and\n   to restore all property rights to the position in which they were found at the commencement of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6508443\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/156/43/#p45\">\n    156 B.R. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (9th Cir. BAP 1993) (citation omitted). Thus, because \"dismissal of the bankruptcy case revests the property of the estate in the party that owned it prior to the filing of the petition, there is no bankruptcy estate after the dismissal has been entered.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Steenstra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9271118\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/307/732/#p738\">\n    307 B.R. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (1st Cir.

Nevertheless, the Court notes that the July 2018 order addressed the narrow issue of whether the Judgment Creditors had derivative standing to assert certain claims on behalf of Danzik's estate. Yet a party wouldn't need the bankruptcy court's permission to assert claims on behalf of a bankruptcy estate that no longer exists. Accordingly, any orders addressing a party's standing to assert claims on behalf of that nonexistent bankruptcy estate have arguably been are rendered moot by the dismissal of Danzik's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (1) Wyo Tech's \"Motion To Dismiss/Motion For Judgment On The Pleadings\" (Doc. 95) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (2) Wyo Tech's \"Emergency Motion To Enjoin CWT Parties From Attempts To Utilize New York Restraining Notices To Restrain Funds of Nondebtors And Nondebtor Assets Located Outside of New York And Motion To Amend Complaint\" (Doc. 98) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (3) To the extent the parties' joint notice of summary dispute (Doc. 101) may be construed as a motion to compel filed by the Judgment Creditors, that motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (4) Wilenchik and Beus Gilbert must produce the documents requested by the subpoenas by April 26, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Since 2012, a handful of federal courts have issued unpublished decisions adopting\n    <em>\n     JSC\n    </em>\n    's views on this issue.\n    <em>\n     Capitol Records, LLC v.
