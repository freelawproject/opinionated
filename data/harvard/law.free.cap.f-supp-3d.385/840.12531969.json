The State filed its objections to the out-of-market rates. However, while the motion was pending, the parties notified the court that they were working on a resolution. The parties ultimately filed a joint stipulation to fees and costs and requested the Court's approval. Order,\n   <em>\n    Gerlich\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-00264-JEG (S.D. Iowa Mar. 21, 2018), ECF No. 94. In performing that review, the Court reasoned that \"even with th[e] essential conclusion\" that the relevant legal market was Des Moines, certain counsel from Washington, D.C., who \"came to the case with substantially extended experience specifically applicable to the case[,] ... would command a higher rate in that market, albeit somewhat lower than the amount in the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Ultimately, the Court approved the stipulated fee amount without further reducing the amount agreed to by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, although\n   <em>\n    Gerlich\n   </em>\n   is instructive in what the Court should consider in determining whether out-of-market rates are appropriate, that case alone does not support Defendants' efforts to reduce all rates to align with the local market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants also argue that in similar prior challenges in other courts, such as those brought in Idaho and Utah, Chen, Marceau, and Strugar did not seek out-of-market rates like they do here. Defendants argue the attorneys' increase in rates over such a short period-\"an increase of between 25% to 80% over an approximate 3-year time period\"-demonstrates the excessive\n   nature of Plaintiffs' current request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs.' Br. 7, ECF No. 97. Plaintiffs counter that the rate increases account for additional years of experience and the fact that the expertise attorneys Chen, Marceau, and Strugar brought to this action was being developed in the Idaho and Utah cases. Plaintiffs also point out that local rates in Boise and Salt Lake City are in fact typically lower than in Des Moines, and-despite that-Chen, Marceau, and Strugar still sought \"hourly rates between $440 and $475 in the Utah action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.' Reply Br. 5, ECF No. 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that the relevant legal market for determining fees is Des Moines.\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1953078\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1042/#p1048\">\n    272 F.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Court finds Chen, Marceau, and Strugar brought specialized expertise to this action to support rates not solely determined by the Des Moines market, their levels of expertise do not support the requested rates. Prior to 2011, Strugar's\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   legal experience involved cases of police and government misconduct and the rights of persons with disabilities.

While the record does support a finding that Strugar has experience in the area of litigation particular to this case, the Court does not find it so extensive or specialized as to justify the requested rate in the Des Moines market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184302\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/826/#p831\">\n    764 F.3d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, Chen and Marceau are tenured professors of law at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, where they each have full-time responsibilities related to teaching and scholarship. Aside from their experience in the cases most similar to this one, their academic responsibilities are reflected in the roles they often play in litigation-they often serve as expert consultants, expert witnesses, and authors of amicus curiae briefs. While the Court recognizes their expertise, it cannot justify their requested fees in the Des Moines market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184302\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/826/#p831\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the reasons provided, the rates for Strugar, Chen, and Marceau will be adjusted to account for the relevant market as follows: Matthew Strugar's rate will be decreased from $550/hour to $475/hour; Alan Chen's rate will be decreased from $650/hour to $500/hour; and Justin Marceau's rate will be decreased from $550/hour to $475/hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendants object as to the hours worked by Strugar on the initial motion, requesting a 6-hour reduction of his 16.2 hours recorded, based on the similarities between declarations filed in the Utah and Idaho cases and those filed in this case. While Strugar admits the declarations are similar, he argues he billed little time to the declarations in this action. Pls.'

The record supports Strugar's description of his billing, Strugar Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 93-2; and Defendants do not adequately explain why a 6-hour reduction is appropriate.
