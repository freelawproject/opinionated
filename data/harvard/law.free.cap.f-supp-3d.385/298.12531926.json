Instead, while the safe harbor requires some causal connection between user storage and the alleged infringement, the Second Circuit has explained that \"the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor extends to software functions performed [by the service provider] for the purpose of facilitating access to user-stored material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Oath argues that the alleged infringement at issue here occurred by reason of user storage because Kim added Downs's photograph to her article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oath SJ Mem. 10-12; Oath SJ Opp. 9-14. Moreover, Oath contends, the safe harbor applies even though HuffPost screened articles for offensive and illegal content, and even though Cohn added content tags and a related video link to Kim's article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oath SJ Opp. 10-12. Oath points to the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ventura Content, Ltd. v.

Oath contrasts\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   with\n   <em>\n    Mavrix Photographs, LLC v. Livejournal, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which the court held that there was a triable issue as to whether infringement occurred by reason of user storage where the defendant website's moderators \"review[ed] submissions and publicly post[ed] only about one-third of submissions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266661\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1045/#p1056\">\n    873 F.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1056 (9th Cir. 2017). Because Kim's article was posted directly to HuffPost and Cohn conducted only cursory screening and modification, Oath argues, the instant case is closer to\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   than it is to\n   <em>\n    Mavrix\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oath SJ Opp. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Downs responds that the alleged infringement did not occur by reason of user storage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Downs SJ Reply 4-6. First, Downs argues, there is no evidence that Kim, rather than Cohn, added the photograph to the article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In fact, Downs suggests, it is \"\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   that [Cohn] added the Photograph\" to Kim's article because Cohn also added content tags and a related video link.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Second, Downs argues, even if Kim added the photograph, Cohn \"ultimately\n   <em>\n    optimized\n   </em>\n   and substantively\n   <em>\n    enhanced\n   </em>\n   the Article ... [and] made the Article ready for mass publication to audiences worldwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Downs contends that Cohn \"made editorial decisions as to what articles were indexed and which were not,\" and that Kim's article was therefore \"subject to a selection process by virtue of Cohn's optimization for Google search indexing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beginning with the issue of who added the photograph to the article, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that it was Kim, not Cohn. As noted above, Oath has put forth screenshots of the article's edit history,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26, Ex. 3, as well as a sworn declaration from Victor Brand, who was Standards Editor for HuffPost at the time the article was published, Brand Decl. \u00b6 9. Downs, in opposition, has offered nothing more than speculation that Cohn may have added the photograph because she added a video link as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Downs SJ Reply 4. This is insufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether Kim added the photograph (not to mention grossly inadequate to support Downs's claim that Cohn \"likely\" added the photograph). Moreover, while Downs complains that Oath failed to submit supportive affidavits from Cohn and \"Chin\" - by whom Downs presumably means Kim - Downs could have deposed these individuals himself, and he chose not to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moving to the question of whether Cohn's cursory screening and modification place Kim's article outside of the safe harbor's protections, the case law supports Oath's position over Downs's. As the Tenth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Clarity Digital Group, LLC\n   </em>\n   , \"if the infringing content has merely gone through a screening or automated process, the [service provider] will generally benefit from the safe harbor's protection.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256376\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/1175/#p1181\">\n    820 F.3d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1181 (10th Cir. 2016) ; see\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516344\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/597/#p607\">\n    885 F.3d at 607-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussed above);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CoStar Grp., Inc. v.

Here, contributors like Kim published their articles directly to HuffPost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the addition of content tags does not deprive Oath of immunity under \u00a7 512 (c).

There, defendant Vimeo operated a website to which users uploaded videos.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs argued that Vimeo had red flag knowledge of infringement in cases where an employee viewed a \"video containing all or virtually all of a recognizable, copyrighted song.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n    at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Second Circuit rejected plaintiffs' argument for several reasons. As relevant here, the court explained that an \"employee's viewing might have been brief,\" such that the employee did not ascertain that the video contained a copyrighted audio recording.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n    at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the court continued, the employee might not have been aware that the video contained a copyrighted audio recording because the employee might have been viewing the video for \"many different business purposes.\" such as \"classification by subject matter\" or \"sampling to detect inappropriate obscenity or bigotry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And even assuming that the employee was aware of the copyrighted recording, the court concluded that the employee could not be expected to distinguish between infringements, on the one hand, and fair or authorized uses, on the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n    at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Applying this reasoning to the instant case, the Court holds that HuffPost did not have red flag knowledge of the alleged infringement in Kim's article. As in\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   , Cohn's viewing of Downs's photograph may have been brief. And as in\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   , Cohn was viewing Kim's article for multiple purposes, including subject matter classification and screening for offensive content. It is of course possible that Cohn saw the\n   <em>\n    New York Daily News\n   </em>\n   photo credit, but\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   makes clear that this possibility is not enough to create a triable issue as to red flag knowledge. Instead, \"the burden f[ell] on [Downs] to demonstrate that [Cohn] acquired knowledge of ... facts and circumstances from which infringing activity was obvious,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p93\">\n    at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Downs failed to take discovery or otherwise adduce evidence sufficient to make this showing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, even if Downs showed that Cohn was aware of the\n   <em>\n    New York Daily News\n   </em>\n   photo credit,\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   suggests that Oath still would be entitled to summary judgment on the issue of red flag knowledge. Although the fair use and licensing issues raised by the inclusion of a sound recording in a video are not identical to those raised by the inclusion of a photograph in a blog post, the Court does not see how Cohn, any more than the employees in\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   , could be expected to distinguish between infringements\n   and fair or authorized uses. Accordingly, the Court holds that Downs has failed to create a triable issue as to red flag knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Financial Benefit and the Right and Ability to Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Apart from the foregoing knowledge provisions, the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor provides that an eligible service provider must 'not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Viacom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755875\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/19/#p38\">\n    676 F.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B) ). Downs argues that Oath fails to satisfy this requirement because HuffPost received a financial benefit from the commercial advertisements that were visible on the face of Kim's article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Downs SJ Mem. 12; Downs SJ Opp. 10. Furthermore, Downs contends, Oath had the right and ability to control Kim's article because HuffPost \"engag[ed] in\n   <em>\n    human supervision and review\n   </em>\n   [of] content posted to the Website.\" Downs SJ Mem. 13; Downs SJ Reply 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both of these arguments fail. Beginning with the question of whether HuffPost \"receive[d] a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,\" it is not enough for Downs to show that HuffPost ran commercial advertisements on its website. If that were sufficient, then practically every revenue-generating website would satisfy the financial benefit prong of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Instead, Downs must put forth evidence of a connection between the allegedly infringing activity and the financial benefit that HuffPost received. In\n   <em>\n    Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fung\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Ninth Circuit held that advertising revenue met the financial benefit prong where the defendant \" 'promoted advertising by pointing to infringing activity; obtained advertising revenue that depended on the number of visitors to his sites; attracted primarily visitors who were seeking to engage in infringing activity ...; and encouraged that infringing activity.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551851\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1020/#p1045\">\n    710 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045 (9th Cir. 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the court held that the financial benefit prong was not met where the defendant \"did not advertise itself as a place to get pirated materials.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516344\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/597/#p607\">\n    885 F.3d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the court recognized that the more content hosted on defendant's website, \"the more users it would attract, and more views would lead to more advertising revenue,\" the court explained that \"[t]he words 'the' and 'directly' in [ \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B) ] ... must mean that some revenue has to be distinctly attributable to the infringing material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516344\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/597/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, Downs has made no showing that the advertising revenue HuffPost received was \"distinctly attributable\" to infringing activity. There is no evidence that HuffPost encouraged infringement, or that it promoted advertising by pointing to infringement, or even that its users primarily engaged in infringing conduct. To the contrary, the undisputed evidence shows that HuffPost simply ran advertisements on user-generated articles, some of which inevitably contained infringing material. This case is thus much closer to\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   than it is to\n   <em>\n    Fung\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the financial benefit analysis likely favors Oath even more than it did the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   , as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   operated a website that hosted nearly 13 million pornographic photographs and videos that were uploaded by users.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516344\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/597/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516344\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/597/#p607\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court suspects that infringing content was a more significant driver of advertising revenue on the\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   defendant's website than it was on HuffPost's contributor platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if the Court were to assume,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that HuffPost \"receive[d] a financial\n   benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,\" Downs has nevertheless failed to show that HuffPost had the \"right and ability to control such activity.\" As the Second Circuit has explained, the \"right and ability to control\" must \"require[ ] something more than the ability to remove or block access to materials posted on a service provider's website.\"\n   <em>\n    Viacom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755875\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/19/#p38\">\n    676 F.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Otherwise, the ability to remove or block access, which is a \"prerequisite to safe harbor protection under \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A)(iii) &amp; (C) would at the same time be a disqualifier under \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755875\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/19/#p38\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755875\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/19/#p38\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, the undisputed evidence shows that contributors self-published their articles directly to the website and that HuffPost engaged in cursory screening and modification. This level of involvement is insufficient as a matter of law to establish that HuffPost had the \"right and ability to control\" infringing activity by members of its contributor platform. Accordingly - and for the reasons discussed above - the Court holds that Oath is not disqualified from the DMCA's safe harbor by reason of failure to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, the undisputed evidence shows that: (1) the allegedly infringing use of Downs's photograph occurred \"by reason of ... storage at the direction of a user,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (1) ; (2) HuffPost was \"not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity [wa]s apparent,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 512(c) (1) (A) (ii) ; and (3) HuffPost did \"not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which [it] ha[d] the right and ability to control such activity,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B).
