Defendant did not make an isolated order or two; the relationship with Roxx Allision spanned multiple years and substantial purchases. Indeed, this case is materially indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Mahendra\n   </em>\n   , in which the First Department upheld the exercise of jurisdiction over an out-of-state diamond retailer who placed telephone orders with a New York wholesaler, even though \"defendant's employees did not travel to New York on business.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027764\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/125/454/#p457\">\n    125 A.D.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027764\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/125/454/#p457\">\n    3 N.Y.S.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That decision virtually dictates the result here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Next, defendant suggests that the exercise of jurisdiction would be improper because Roxx Allison initiated the relationship and was the driving force behind it. But as the New York courts have stated, \"it is not necessarily who initiated contact that is determinative, but rather, the nature and quality of the contacts and the relationship established as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimaldi v.

Defendants admits to initiating at least some of the communications at issue in this case, and to reaching out to plaintiff to place orders. It is clear, then, that this was not a one-sided arrangement. Moreover, plaintiff has submitted a declaration claiming that defendant \"frequent[ly]\" made inquiries about, or placed orders for, plaintiff's merchandise. Alibayof Decl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 19. That assertion is supported by exhibits containing what appear to be over twenty emails from a representative of The Jewelers, reaching out to Roxx Allison for the purpose of placing orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

Jan. 4, 2012) (Rakoff, J.). But on reflection, the Court is no longer persuaded that the \"center of gravity\" test accurately reflects the law as it is applied by New York courts. Indeed, the phrase seems to appear in New York State court decisions only in the context of choice-of-law analysis, not personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Regardless, New York is plainly at least one center of gravity of the transactions at issue. The communications concerned the\n   purchase of jewelry located in New York. Perhaps Nevada, as the ultimate destination of the shipment, was also a center of gravity - but it would be strange indeed to say that New York was not the focal point of a transaction concerning goods located in New York and sold by a seller located in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the end, most of defendant's arguments boil down to the contention that the parties' transactions had more to do with Nevada than New York. Maybe so. But personal jurisdiction does not exist only in the \"best\" forum, or the one with the closest relationship to the transaction at issue. As long ago as 1970, the New York Court of Appeals observed that \"in this day of instant long-range communications, one can engage in extensive purposeful activity here without ever actually setting foot in [New York].\"\n   <em>\n    Parke-Bernet Galleries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20N.Y.S.2d%20337\">\n    308 N.Y.S.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20N.E.2d%20506\">\n    256 N.E.2d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In an era of ubiquitous remote negotiations and contracts executed from different countries, let alone states, it would blink reality to permit defendants to argue that they could not have anticipated being called into court in a state simply because they never physically traveled there. To be sure, it is easy to imagine abuses of this rule. But, as previously discussed, this case does not involve an isolated transaction, nor was the defendant unaware of plaintiff's location. Defendant entered this relationship with eyes open. Proceeding in this forum will work no grave injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"By purposefully creating a continuous relationship with a New York corporation and by maintaining constant communications with it,\" a defendant avails himself or herself \"of the benefits and privileges of transacting business in New York and is therefore subject to jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    N.Y.

Supp. 2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that personal jurisdiction existed over purchaser who approached New York diamond seller at Las Vegas trade show, maintained continuous communication with seller, and placed several orders). Here, regardless of who first approached whom, defendant purposefully and voluntarily maintained a years-long relationship with plaintiff, during which time defendant placed many orders for jewelry worth a great sum of money. Accordingly, The Jewelers transacted business within New York within the meaning of C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1). There is no serious dispute that the instant suit \"aris[es] from\" that transaction of business. The Court therefore finds that personal jurisdiction is proper under New York's long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, while defendant does not raise a constitutional objection to the exercise of personal jurisdiction, the Court further concludes that due process is not offended by the maintenance of this suit. Although \" section 302(a)(1) of New York's long-arm statute and constitutional due process are not coextensive,\" it is \"rare\" for a case where \"personal jurisdiction [is] permitted under the long-arm statute\" to \"be prohibited under due process analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Licci ex rel.
