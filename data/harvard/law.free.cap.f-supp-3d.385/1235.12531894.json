On March 26, 2019, and April 22, 2019, Plaintiff Paul Meyer (\"Meyer\") filed Memorandums of Law in Opposition to Defendants' motions and requested a hearing. (Docs. 11; 15). For the following reasons, Defendants' motions are granted in part and denied in part and Plaintiff's motion for a hearing is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an action brought under the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FDCPA\"), and Florida's Consumer Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559\">\n    Fla.

Fay Servicing, a debt collection company, acquired Meyer's delinquent home mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). On October 29, 2018, Meyer, through counsel, requested reinstatement and payoff figures for his loan. (Doc. 1-1). Nine days later, Meyer received a demand letter from MRLP, a law firm providing debt collection services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The letter outlined the amounts required to pay off and reinstate Meyer's mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Meyer alleges the letter fails to properly itemize and disclose all the fees and costs included in the reinstatement amount and fails to specify what fees are included in the \"corporate advances\" category (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 12). He is therefore unable to determine the validity of the amounts alleged to be owed to Fay Servicing. Consequently, Meyer maintains this letter violates the FDCPA and FCCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). First, Defendants argue Plaintiff lacks standing and, therefore, this Court should dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Docs. 7 at 8-9; 12 at 3-5). Next, Defendants argue Meyer fails to state a claim for relief under the FCCPA and FDCPA. (Docs. 7 at 4-7; 12 at 3-7). Lastly, MRLP contends this Court should refrain from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FCCPA counts. (Doc. 12 at 7-8).

Plaintiff has invoked 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, which creates a right to receive truthful representations of the character and amount of a debt, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f, which prohibits the use of unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.

Jun. 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds the above cases persuasive. Here, the reinstatement letter did not, as\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   suggests would be proper, \"itemize the various charges that comprise the total amount of the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9208746\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/562/\">\n    383 F.3d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. 1-1). Although the FDCPA does not affirmatively require itemization, the issue is whether, by failing to itemize, a debt collector misleadingly conveyed the amount owed or unfairly sought to collect a debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez v. Niemann &amp; Heyer, L.L.P.\n   </em>\n   , 1:16-CV-119 RP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203562148\">\n    2016 WL 3562148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (W.D. Tex. June 24, 2016). And this issue \"is a context-specific inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203562148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Considering the above, it is\n   <em>\n    plausible\n   </em>\n   that the corporate advances line item could mislead or be unfair to the least sophisticated consumer. Indeed, the least sophisticated consumer might assume that the figure under the corporate advances line item does not include attorney's fees, late charges, or other fees associated with the debt. The letter, by failing to break down the charges, plausibly gives the least sophisticated consumer in Meyer's shoes a misleading impression about the character of the debt. And, as the Seventh Circuit reiterated in\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is unfair to consumers under the FDCPA to hide the true character of the debt, thereby impairing their ability to knowledgeable assess the validity of the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9208746\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/562/\">\n    383 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   566 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. Therefore, Meyer has stated a plausible claim that the way the demand letter conveyed the debt violated the FDCPA. Counts I and III thus survive the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
