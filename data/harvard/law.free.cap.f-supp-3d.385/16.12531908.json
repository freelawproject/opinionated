Plaintiffs contend that under the Creek Treaty of 1866, they should have the rights and privileges of MCN citizens, regardless of their \"blood status.\" Plaintiffs further contend that, despite the Creek Treaty of 1866, they have been wrongfully denied MCN citizenship. Accordingly, Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit requesting declaratory and injunctive relief to secure the rights and privileges of MCN citizenship. In response to Plaintiffs' suit, Defendants David Bernhardt and the United States Department of the Interior (\"federal Defendants\") filed a Motion to Dismiss, contending that dismissal is appropriate because the statute of limitations has run on Plaintiffs' claims. Additionally, Defendant James Floyd, the Principal Chief of the MCN, filed a Motion to Dismiss, raising various grounds for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court will GRANT Defendant Floyd's Motion to Dismiss and DENY WITHOUT PREJUDICE federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their tribal remedies. Plaintiffs do not allege that they ever applied for citizenship and were denied citizenship by the MCN. Accordingly, the Court will DISMISS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffs' Complaint in order to allow Plaintiffs to exhaust their tribal remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed without prejudice based on Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their tribal remedies by applying for citizenship and appealing any adverse determinations. Accordingly, the Court's explanation of the factual background will focus on the details relevant to the discussion of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1866, the MCN and the United States executed a treaty which provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [I]nasmuch as there are among the Creek many persons of African descent...it is stipulated that hereafter these persons, lawfully residing in said Creek country, under their laws and usages, or who have been thus residing in said country, and may return within one year from the ratification of this treaty, and their descendants and such others of the same race as may be permitted by the laws of said Nation to settle within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Creek Nation as citizens [thereof], shall have and enjoy all the rights and privileges of native citizens, including an equal interest in the soil and national funds; and the laws of said Nation shall be equally binding upon and give equal protection to all such persons\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 12, \u00b6 38 (quoting Treaty of 1988, Art. 2). In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act of 1887. Pursuant to the Dawes Act as well as other acts of Congress, the MCN created the \"Dawes Rolls,\" which were citizenship lists dividing members into the \"Creek Nation Creek Roll,\" allegedly comprised of Creek citizens with Creek blood and the \"Creek Nation Freedmen Roll,\" allegedly comprised of Creek citizens who were formerly enslaved and devoid of Creek blood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-50. The Dawes Rolls closed in 1907.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1975, the MCN submitted a draft constitution to the United States Department of the Interior (\"DOI\") which \"(1) stripped individuals on the 1906 Creek Freedmen Rolls and their then-living lineal descendants of their MCN citizenship; and (2) prevented the unborn lineal descendants of individuals who were enrolled on the 1906 Creek Freedmen Rolls from becoming citizens of MCN.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. In 1979, the DOI approved the MCN constitution, and the MCN held an election formally adopting the new constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Under the new constitution, ratified by the DOI, Freedmen descendants were not entitled to MCN citizenship and were not recognized as citizens of the MCN.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that between 1979 and today eligible Freedmen descendants have been summarily denied citizenship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. Plaintiffs specifically allege that between 1983 and 2003, the MCN Citizenship Board repeatedly denied the applications of two Freedmen descendants who are not parties in this lawsuit, Fred Johnson and Ron Graham.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Graham appealed their denials to the MCN District Court. In 2006, the MCN District Court found that the Citizenship Board had not followed MCN law mandating that the Board process Mr. Johnson's and Mr. Graham's citizenship applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. Despite the court order, Plaintiffs contend that the MCN Citizenship Board still refused to process the applications. And, in 2007, the MCN Supreme Court reversed the MCN District Court decision but did not rule on the validity of the citizenship provisions in the Treaty of 1866.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. Plaintiffs do not provide any other examples of Freedmen descendants who were denied citizenship, and Plaintiffs do not allege that they have ever applied for MCN citizenship and been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated the Treaty of 1866 when the DOI approved and the MCN passed the 1979 constitution excluding Freedmen descendants from tribal citizenship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73. Plaintiffs further argue that Defendants have continually violated the Treaty of 1866 from 1979 until the current day. Plaintiffs contend that the MCN has violated the treaty by excluding Plaintiffs from elections and other tribal activities. Plaintiffs further contend that federal Defendants have violated the treaty by approving tribal elections and by providing funding for the MCN, despite the exclusion of Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 20, 2018, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit requesting declaratory and injunctive relief providing Plaintiffs and other Freedmen descendants with the full rights and privileges of MCN citizenship. Both federal Defendants and Defendant Floyd have filed Motions to Dismiss, citing numerous grounds for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint on various grounds. For reasons explained below, the Court finds that Defendant Floyd's request for dismissal on exhaustion grounds is dispositive. As such, the Court will focus on that\n   standard for dismissal. Because the exhaustion of tribal remedies is a matter of judicial comity rather than a jurisdictional bar to suit, motions to dismiss for failure to exhaust trial remedies are considered under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Farmers Union Ins.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal Defendants and Defendant Floyd present many arguments as to why this case should be dismissed. However, the Court finds that Defendant Floyd's argument as to Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their tribal remedies is dispositive. Accordingly, the Court's Memorandum Opinion will address only that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant Floyd argues that this case should be dismissed as Plaintiffs failed to allege that they have exhausted their tribal remedies. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs make the conclusory allegation that they have been denied enrollment in the tribe. Am. Compl., ECF No. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, 8-10. Plaintiffs' denial of enrollment could be based on the mere presence of a \"blood status\" requirement in the MCN constitution. And, nowhere in their Complaint do Plaintiffs allege that they actually applied for enrollment in the tribe. In their Opposition to Defendant Floyd's Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs summarily state that \"[b]etween 1979 and the present, Creek Freedmen and their descendants, including Plaintiffs, have applied for citizenship in the MCN.\" Pls.' Opp'n to Def. Floyd, ECF No. 25, 5. Plaintiffs cannot now amend their Complaint by way of an Opposition to a Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Kingman Park Civic Ass'n v. Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304117\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/142/\">\n    27 F.

Moreover, even if the Court were to consider Plaintiffs' Opposition, Plaintiffs do not provide any details about their applications for citizenship such as which Plaintiffs have applied and whether or not Plaintiffs appealed any denials of citizenship. Plaintiffs' conclusory statement, made in an Opposition to a Motion to Dismiss, is insufficient to allege exhaustion of remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Seemingly acknowledging their failure to allege exhaustion, in making their arguments against dismissal, Plaintiffs also do not contend that they actually applied for enrollment in the tribe and were denied. Instead, Plaintiffs make two arguments as to why this case should not be dismissed for failure to exhaust. First, Plaintiffs contend that they were not required to exhaust their tribal remedies because the tribal court does not have jurisdiction over federal Defendants. Second, Plaintiffs contend that exhaustion should be excused\n   because exhaustion of tribal remedies would be futile. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When a tribal court has jurisdiction over a claim, a plaintiff must exhaust tribal remedies prior to bringing suit in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Farmers Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n    471 U.S. at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[u]ntil petitioners have exhausted the remedies available to them in the Tribal Court system, it would be premature for a federal court to consider any relief\" (internal citation omitted)). There are multiple reasons that courts require tribal exhaustion. First, tribal exhaustion promotes the \"orderly administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n    at 856-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, tribal exhaustion allows federal courts to obtain tribal \"expertise\" in tribal matters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, requiring that plaintiffs first seek remedies through the tribal system furthers the congressional \"policy of supporting tribal self-government and self-determination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210207\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/845/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds that these first two factors weigh in favor of requiring tribal exhaustion in this case. The orderly administration of justice in the federal court will be served by permitting a full factual record to be developed through the tribal administrative and judicial processes. Moreover, Plaintiffs' pursuit of citizenship through the tribal process will provide the Court with valuable information. On the one hand, exhaustion will provide the tribal administration and courts the opportunity to accept Plaintiffs' citizenship applications, thereby avoiding the need for federal courts to wade into the murky issue of tribal citizenship. On the other hand, if Plaintiffs are denied citizenship, tribal exhaustion will provide the tribal administration and courts with the opportunity to explain precisely why they refuse to grant citizenship. The benefit of tribal expertise in matters of tribal citizenship will assist the federal court in making its subsequent citizenship determination. Additionally, by providing a ground or grounds for denying citizenship, the federal court will better be able to narrow the issues and target its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court similarly finds that the third factor weighs in favor of requiring tribal exhaustion. Requiring tribal exhaustion to promote tribal self-governance is particularly appropriate here, where the issue before the Court concerns tribal membership. A tribe's authority to determine its own membership is an important component of tribal self-governance and independent sovereignty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iowa Mutual Ins. Co. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   , the court was deciding whether or not to allow the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint in order to add the Cherokee Nation and its officials as defendants. The Cherokee Nation argued that amendment would be futile because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their tribal remedies.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775517\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/56/\">\n    467 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   , at the time that the court was deciding whether or not tribal exhaustion was necessary, the lawsuit was against only a federal defendant. The Cherokee Nation had been granted limited intervention for the purposes of challenging jurisdiction but was not yet included as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775517\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/56/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775517\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/56/\">\n    at 59-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, at the time of the decision, there were no defendants\n   in the lawsuit against whom tribal courts could exercise jurisdiction. Here, Plaintiffs have sued the chief of the tribe, against whom tribal courts exercise jurisdiction, in addition to federal Defendants. Accordingly, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   , in this case, there are Defendants against whom Plaintiffs could bring suit in a tribal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the Court's case based on the nature of relief sought. In\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were descendants of Cherokee Freedmen who had been prevented from participating in a 2003 election. The plaintiffs requested a court order declaring the 2003 election invalid and enjoining the Secretary from recognizing the results of elections until the plaintiffs were permitted to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775517\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/56/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775517\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/56/\">\n    at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the nature of relief requested by the plaintiffs, as set out by the court, was the sort that could be given only by the Secretary, not by a tribal court. Conversely, here, Plaintiffs request, in part, an order declaring that \"Creek Freedmen Descendants are Creek citizens.\" Am. Compl., ECF No. 12, Prayer for Relief. This relief could potentially be granted through the tribal administrative and judicial process if plaintiffs applied for tribal citizenship. Accordingly, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   , a tribal court would have jurisdiction over Plaintiff's request for relief. For these reasons, the Court is not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Vann\n   </em>\n   is applicable.

The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court made clear that even if it had found that it had subject matter, the defendants' motion to dismiss \"would nonetheless be granted because the Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their tribal court remedies.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7846813\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/875/1353/#p1366\">\n    875 F.

Additionally, while the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   had a pending tribal court suit, unlike Plaintiffs here, Plaintiffs fail to explain why the presence of a pending suit in tribal court would be anything but a distinction without a difference.

Finally, while the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court did not directly address the lack of jurisdiction against the federal defendants, the decision remains applicable to the facts currently before the Court. In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , what mattered was that, even if the parties differed, the issue before the tribal court was \"premised on the same conduct and membership determinations as the underlying claims in [the federal court] proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7846813\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/875/1353/#p1366\">\n    875 F.

Similarly, here, Plaintiffs' request for citizenship through the tribal administrative and judicial process would be premised on the same conduct and membership determinations as the claims in this proceeding.

In reviewing Plaintiffs' renewed claims, the federal court will have the benefit of a developed factual record and the expertise of tribal bodies on issues of tribal membership. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are required to exhaustion their tribal remedies despite the tribal court's lack of jurisdiction over federal Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Futility of Tribal Exhaustion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that, even if tribal exhaustion were required, exhaustion should be excused as it would be futile. According to Plaintiffs, even if they had applied for citizenship through the tribal administrative and judicial process, they would have been denied.

The United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"D.C. Circuit\") has not interpreted the futility exception in the context of tribal exhaustion. But, the D.C.

Compl., ECF No. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 64-71. Between 1983 and 2003, Plaintiffs contend that the MCN Citizenship Board repeatedly denied Mr. Johnson's and Mr. Graham's citizenship applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. In 2004, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Graham litigated the issue of citizenship before the MCN District Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exhibit B, ECF No. 25-1 (MCN District Court decision). In tribal court, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Graham argued that the MCN Citizenship Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously and that all Freedmen descendants were eligible for citizenship pursuant to the Treaty of 1866, the MCN Constitution, and the MCN Citizenship Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. In 2006, the MCN District Court issued a decision. The court did not reach the plaintiffs' substantive claims, instead finding that the Citizenship Board had not followed MCN law which required the Citizenship Board to process the plaintiffs' citizenship applications and the applications of other Freedmen descendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. However, Plaintiffs allege that the Citizenship Board refused to comply with the district court order to process Mr. Johnson's and Mr. Graham's citizenship applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. And in 2007, the MCN Supreme Court reversed the district court's decision and refused to rule on the applicability of the citizenship provisions of the Treaty of 1866.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the MCN Supreme Court cursorily concluded that there was \"no evidence that the Citizenship Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\" Exhibit C, ECF No. 25-1 (MCN Supreme Court decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on Mr. Johnson's and Mr. Graham's experiences with the tribal administrative and judicial citizenship process, Plaintiffs argue that it would be futile for them to apply for citizenship. Plaintiffs contend that it is clear from the face of their pleadings that relief from the MCN Citizenship Board or the tribal courts is at best \"hypothetical.\" Pls.' Opp'n to Def. Floyd, ECF No. 25, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence of two other Freedmen descendants, not parties to this lawsuit, who applied for and were denied citizenship over a decade ago is insufficient to establish futility. The MCN Citizenship Board, created by the tribal constitution, is tasked with making citizenship determinations. Exhibit 2, ECF No. 21-3, Art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4. Additionally, the tribal code contains an explicit, written procedure for applying for citizenship and appealing adverse determinations\n   through the tribal courts. Exhibit 3, ECF No. 21-4, Tit. 7. The Court finds the presence of a detailed written procedure for applying for citizenship and for appealing adverse determinations to be evidence that a tribal remedy exists and is more than hypothetical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Failed attempts to obtain a grant of citizenship from the MCN Citizenship Board as well as refusals by the tribal courts to reconsider adverse determinations may show that tribal exhaustion would be futile. But, Plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence that a remedy through the tribal process would be illusory in this case. Plaintiffs have cited only two other Freedmen descendants who were denied citizenship. These two Freedmen descendants are not parties in this case, and it is not clear how similarly situated the two men are to Plaintiffs. Additionally, the two Freedmen descendants were denied citizenship through the tribal process over a decade ago. Plaintiffs present no evidence that the same result would occur if they applied for citizenship today. Moreover, in assessing the claims of the two Freedmen descendants, the tribal courts never actually considered their substantive claims. Accordingly, the past decisions of the tribal District Court and the tribal Supreme Court cited by Plaintiff are not dispositive of Plaintiffs' citizenship claims. For these reasons, Plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence to establish that the exhaustion of tribal remedies would be futile if Plaintiffs applied for citizenship today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197784\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/140/94/#p101\">\n    140 F.

Circuit has erected an \"extraordinarily high hurdle ... for plaintiffs who wish to have the exhaustion requirement excused\" based on futility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court has already determined that Plaintiffs were required to exhaust their tribal remedies. Plaintiffs argue that, if exhaustion is required, it should be excused as exhaustion would be futile. However, Plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence that applying for citizenship through the MCN Board of Citizenship, and appealing any adverse decisions through the tribal courts, would be futile. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust is not excused.

Plaintiffs were required to exhaustion their tribal remedies prior to bringing suit in this Court. Plaintiffs have not established that exhaustion should be excused due to the presence of federal Defendants in this lawsuit or due to futility. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff's Complaint pending the exhaustion of tribal remedies. Because the Court grants dismissal on exhaustion grounds, it need not consider at this time the other arguments made in Defendant Floyd's Motion or the arguments made in federal Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \u2022 Mem. of Points and Authorities in Support of Fed.
