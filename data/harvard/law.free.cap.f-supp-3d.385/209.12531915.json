Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \"District [c]ourts must analyze a Rule 60(b) motion challenging denial of a previous habeas petition to determine whether it is genuinely a Rule 60(b) motion or instead a successive habeas petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Chen v.

Feb. 3, 2016). In this context, a genuine Rule 60(b) motion is one that attacks the integrity of the original habeas proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

Because Santiago does not identify any flaw in his original habeas proceeding, but instead challenges his sentencing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 60 Motion at 5, 7-11), the Court finds that the Rule 60 Motion does not attack the integrity of the original habeas proceeding and therefore is not a genuine Rule 60(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon finding that a purported Rule 60(b) motion does not attack the integrity of the original habeas proceeding, a district court can either \"treat the Rule 60(b) motion as 'a second or successive' habeas petition, in which case it should be transferred to [the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit] for possible certification, or ... simply deny the portion of the motion attacking the underlying conviction 'as beyond the scope of Rule 60(b).' \"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
