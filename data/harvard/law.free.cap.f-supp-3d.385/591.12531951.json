He is charged with assessing all taxable properties in Cook County for purposes of taxation based on their market values and at uniform assessment levels within each property class. He is sued in his official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County is a government entity and is the Illinois county responsible for funding the Collector and Assessor's offices. The County is liable for any monetary judgment entered against Collector or Assessor in their official capacities and is only named for this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To understand the dispute underlying this case, a brief overview of Illinois property tax law is necessary. Illinois maintains a system of\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   property taxation governed by the state constitution. The constitution provides that real property can be broken down into categorical classifications for taxation purposes. However, such classifications need to be reasonable, and assessments need to be uniform within each class. Ill. Const. 1970, Art. IX, \u00a7 4 (b). Furthermore, the assessment level of the highest class in a county may not exceed two and a half times the assessment level of the lowest class in that county.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To satisfy these requirements, the County enacted the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance (\"Classification Ordinance\"), Code of Ordinances of Cook County \u00a7 74-60\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Classification Ordinance separated properties into single-family residential, not-for-profit, commercial, and industrial classes, as is relevant here. The Classification Ordinance mandated that Assessor assess single-family residential properties at sixteen percent of their market value; not-for-profit properties at thirty percent; commercial\n   properties at thirty eight percent; and industrial properties at thirty six percent. Code of Ord. \u00a7 74-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From 2000 to 2008, Assessor allegedly undervalued most, but not all, single-family residential, commercial, and industrial property in the County. This practice brought the assessment levels to approximately nine percent for single-family residential properties, twenty five percent for commercial properties, and twenty percent for industrial properties-rates far below the level required by law. Based on these assessment levels, Collector issued tax bills and collected taxes from property owners. Plaintiffs allege that the assessment rates actually utilized were concealed from the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2008, then-Assessor James Houlihan announced a proposal to recalibrate the classification system to decrease the statutory assessment levels to ten and twenty five percent of the market value, depending on the type of property involved. He noted that this proposal would marry the assessment levels with the current market values and codify the County's existing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs are taxpayers whose properties were assessed at or above the level required by law, as opposed to the widely utilized underassessment rate. Plaintiffs allege that this valuation discrepancy caused them to pay taxes at a higher rate than most other taxpayers in the same class and above the maximum level permitted by Illinois' laws and constitution. Plaintiffs claim to have overpaid property taxes by the following amounts: A.F. Moore by $ 805,019; Anderson by $ 755,611; Prime Group by $ 8,648,343; AAOS by $ 458,263; Eide by $ 1,199,006; and Fox Valley and Simon Property by $ 16,434,354.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs objected to their overpayment and requested refunds in the Cook County Circuit Court pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Illinois Property Tax Code, which was amended in 1995. 35 ILCS 200/23-15. Plaintiffs claim that the 1995 amendments have left them with an inadequate remedy at the state court level, asserting that the procedures are riddled with uncertainty and delay. Specifically, Plaintiffs complain of the statutory presumption that the assessment valuations are correct, the \"clear and convincing evidence\" burden to overcome that presumption, the inability to name Assessor as a defendant to the action, the inability to introduce evidence of Assessor misconduct, the prohibition on class actions, and that Collector is not required to answer their complaint. Moreover, Plaintiffs emphasize that their case has been litigated at the Cook County Court for over a decade, yet it remains in the discovery stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on the underlying tax assessments and the remedial procedures experienced thereafter, Plaintiffs filed the instant complaint, alleging equal protection and due process violations pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Illinois Constitution, along with state law claims regarding the property tax code. On October 17, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Assessor filed a separate motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6), setting forth statute of limitations defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) challenges the jurisdictional sufficiency of the complaint, but it is otherwise \"analyzed as any other motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    United Phosphorus Ltd. v.
