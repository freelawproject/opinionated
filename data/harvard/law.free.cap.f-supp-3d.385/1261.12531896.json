The Court, having reviewed the filings, and being otherwise\n   advised in the premises, concludes that Plaintiff's Motion should be granted in part. The Court will conditionally certify a class of Office Managers, excluding Office Managers who signed a valid arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Joan McGuire (\"Plaintiff\") worked for Defendants Intelident Solutions, LLC and Coast Dental Services, LLC (collectively \"Defendants\") as an Office Manager (\"OM\") from approximately February of 2013 to March of 2017. She alleges herself and all other OMs who worked for Defendants during the relevant class period are owed unpaid overtime wages. Plaintiff alleges Defendants willfully misclassified OMs as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and failed to keep accurate time records. Plaintiff also alleges OMs primarily engage in work related to customer service, operations, and administration, including answering phones and entering data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff moves to conditionally certify a class of all OMs, or people with similarly titled positions, who worked at a Coast Dental location any time after May 16, 2015, through a date the parties dispute. Defendants filed a Memorandum in Opposition and Plaintiff filed a Reply.

There, reviewing the district court's decision to grant conditional certification of a class of employees, the Fifth Circuit held it was error for the district court to direct notice be sent to the entire class when some of the employees in the class signed arbitration agreements. Of note, at least one named plaintiff was subject to a binding arbitration agreement and the plaintiffs \"did not intend to contest the validity or enforceability of the agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520192\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/494/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at. 498.

Nov. 7, 2016) (\"Defendant also argues that because some putative plaintiffs signed arbitration agreements, they are not similarly situated.

Morgan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff does not challenge the validity or enforceability of any arbitration agreement in her Reply. In fact she can't, because she did not sign one. Since there is no challenge to the validity of the arbitration agreements some OMs signed, the Court turns to whether notice should be sent to those OMs who signed agreements. The Court agrees with the Fifth Circuit that employees who signed a binding arbitration agreement are not \"potential plaintiffs.\" The Court also agrees with Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   concerns about sending notice of this action to employees who cannot participate. Therefore, OMs who may be subject to a valid arbitration agreement should be excluded from this collective action at this notice stage.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dearth v.

The interest from opt-in plaintiffs is proportionate to the number of offices in each state. The Court is not aware if any of these opt-in plaintiffs signed a binding arbitration agreement. But as it stands, enough opt-in plaintiffs have expressed a desire to join this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Similarly Situated OMs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants also argue the OMs are not similarly situated.
