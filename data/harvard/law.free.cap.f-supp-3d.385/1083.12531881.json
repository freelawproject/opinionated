The Loewys missed several mortgage payments over the following years, although the parties disagree about the number of payments missed and the total arrearages owed.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 4; Kelbaugh Decl., Dkt. 32-2, at \u00b6 5. In early 2015, the Loewys first applied to CMG for a mortgage modification.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Kelbaugh Decl. at \u00b6 6. Around this same time, the Loewys also applied to Keep Your Home California (\"KYHC\"), a state program designed to assist delinquent homeowners at risk of foreclosure.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Loewy Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. In July 2015, KYHC approved the Loewys' application for mortgage assistance and sent $100,000 to CMG to be applied to the Loewys' loan.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 12.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-12\">\n       CMG informed the Loewys that, under the KYHC guidelines, the use of these funds was contingent on the parties entering into a loan recast or modification agreement, and that the funds must first be applied to arrearages, with the balance going to principal.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Kelbaugh Decl. at \u00b6 8. Over the next year, the parties went back and forth regarding various potential modifications. One of the key problems, at least according to CMG, was that the Loewys' loan was federally insured by the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\"). See\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The requirements imposed by KYHC (on how the funds must be applied) combined with the requirements of the FHA (on the terms of any recast or modification) made it unusually difficult to come up with a modification that was palatable to all parties involved.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       For example, CMG notified the Loewys on August 12, 2016 that they were ineligible for an FHA standard modification because \"[their] income is insufficient to qualify for any foreclosure alternative programs,\" and that they did not qualify for an FHA home affordable modification because their \"housing expense to income ratio ... does not meet the requirement for a loan modification.\"\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       at Ex. 9. Further complicating matters, the Loewys objected to the way CMG sought to apply the KYHC funds. Arguing that it was bound by the KYHC guidelines, CMG conditionally applied the $100,000 first to arrearages owed, with the balance (roughly $70,000) going to principal.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 9. The Loewys argued that\n       <em>\n        all\n       </em>\n       the KYHC funds should go to principal reduction, or, at a minimum, that CMG was misrepresenting the arrearages actually owed.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. And if all that wasn't enough, the Loewys went into Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2016, which hampered CMG's ability to modify the loan for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 15.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-13\">\n       In an attempt to streamline matters, CMG purchased the Loewys' FHA loan from its original owner, Ginnie Mae, in October 2016, purportedly so that it could offer the Loewys additional recast/modification options not available under the FHA regulations.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 17. But the parties were still unable to reach a mutually\n      acceptable agreement as to how the loan should be modified and how the KYHC funds should be applied. Once the deadline for applying the KYHC funds passed in late 2016 and the parties were still unable to reach an agreement, CMG returned the money to KYHC. The KYHC program is now closed and the Loewys claim they are ineligible to receive any further funds.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Loewy Decl. at \u00b6 37. The Loewys have made no further mortgage payments, but CMG has not foreclosed on the property.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Kelbaugh Decl. at \u00b6 21.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-14\">\n       The Loewys brought this suit in San Diego Superior Court in January 2017, alleging four causes of action against CMG: (1) violation of the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"), (2) violation of the federal Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), (3) negligence, and (4) violation of California's Rosenthal Act.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Complaint, Dkt. 1-2. CMG timely removed the case to this Court.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-15\">\n       <strong>\n        ANALYSIS\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-16\">\n       CMG moves for summary judgment on each of the Loewys' four causes of action.

The first was an email sent to CMG on or about September 8 or 9, 2016, while the Loewys were in bankruptcy.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Joint Statement of Undisputed Fact (\"SUF\"), Dkt. 34, at \u00b6 I.1. The second was a letter sent to CMG on October 20, 2016.\n       <em>\n        See\n        <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.36\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       at \u00b6 I.2.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-24\">\n       It's undisputed that the Loewys did not send the original email to CMG's designated QWR address,\n       <footnotemark>\n        1\n       </footnotemark>\n       so the Court finds that CMG had no legal obligation to respond to that request, even if it ultimately did so. As to the subsequent letter, the parties dispute whether it was correctly addressed (and therefore whether CMG had a duty to respond). Arthur Loewy attaches a purported copy of the letter to his declaration.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Loewy Decl., Ex. 9. That letter lists the recipient's address as \"PO Box 77423, Ewing, NJ,\" which is the same address CMG designated for QWR inquiries.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.36\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       Based on this, the Loewys argue that the second letter was a perfected QWR. CMG submits that the Loewys actually sent the letter to a PO Box located in Trenton, New Jersey, and that CMG never received the QWR at all.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       SUF \u00b6 2; Kelbaugh Decl. at \u00b6 16. Indeed, the USPS tracking information provided by the Loewys suggests that the letter was delivered to Trenton, not Ewing, which supports CMG's argument that the QWR was unperfected.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Loewy Decl., Ex. 10.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-25\">\n       But regardless of whether the QWRs were properly perfected, the undisputed evidence shows that CMG timely responded under RESPA, so summary judgment is warranted. The Loewys' original email was sent on September 8, 2016, meaning that CMG had at least until October 21, 2016-or 30 business days-to either respond to the QWR or request a 15-day extension.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n        12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (e)(2) (a servicer must respond to a QWR within \"30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays)\"). CMG responded to the Loewys on October 13, 2016, advising that its research was \"taking longer than anticipated\" and that it would \"respond within 15 additional business days from our originally expected response date.\" Kelbaugh Decl., Ex. 11. This request for an extension was proper under\n       <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n        12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (e)(4) and extended CMG's response period through November 14, 2016-or 15 business days from the date CMG's original response was due. CMG responded to the QWR in full on November 7, 2016.\n       <footnotemark>\n        2\n       </footnotemark>\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Kelbaugh Decl., Ex. 12.

Summary judgment is warranted against the Loewys on this claim for the simple reason that the TILA's provisions do not apply once a borrower goes into bankruptcy. While a mortgage servicer is generally required to provide a borrower with a \"periodic statement ... for each billing cycle,\" a servicer becomes \"exempt from the[se] requirements\" if \"any consumer on the mortgage loan is a debtor in bankruptcy.\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.41\">\n        12 CFR \u00a7 1026.41\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a)(2) ;\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.41\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 1026.41(e)(5)(i)(A).

The Loewys filed for bankruptcy on August 11, 2016.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.41\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 II.2. CMG therefore acted properly in halting periodic statements after July 2016.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-30\">\n       The Loewys argue that even if CMG wasn't required to send periodic statements while they were in bankruptcy, it was required to begin sending statements again after the bankruptcy was discharged. But the language of the TILA forecloses this argument, too. Once a debtor emerges from bankruptcy, he or she\n      must either \"reaffirm personal liability for the loan [or] request in writing that the servicer provide a periodic statement.\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.41\">\n        12 CFR \u00a7 1026.41\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (e)(5)(ii). Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence that they either reaffirmed personal liability or requested in writing that CMG begin sending periodic statements once they emerged from bankruptcy. The Loewys' claim for violation of the TILA fails as a matter of law and CMG's motion for summary judgment as to this claim is\n       <strong>\n        GRANTED.\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-32\">\n       In addition to the Loewys' two federal claims-which are dismissed for the reasons discussed above-CMG moves for summary judgment as to their two state law claims, negligence and violation of the Rosenthal Act. But without the federal claims, this Court must first decide whether to retain and rule on the state claims or to remand the claims to state court.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-33\">\n       In choosing whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent state law claims, a district court should \"consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.\"\n       <em>\n        Carnegie-Mellon University v.
