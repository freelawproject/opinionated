Dkt. No. 205 at 1. This is not a fair characterization of the complaint's allegations against Sybo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The complaint sufficiently alleges Sybo's involvement for 12(b)(6) purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , KAC \u00b6 6 (Sybo \"co-developed Subway Surfers\"); \u00b6 8 (\"in addition to developing and marketing Subway Surfers, Sybo owns the intellectual property rights for Subway Surfers, and is responsible for developing the game play, graphics, and in-game programming\"); n.2 (Sybo's \"website contains animated graphics of Subway Surfers\" and \"links to another page identifying the vendors where consumers can download the game\"); \u00b6 9 (\"Kiloo and Sybo equally split between them all revenues derived from Subway Surfers, including all revenue derived from advertising.\").
