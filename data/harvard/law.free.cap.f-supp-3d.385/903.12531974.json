There is no denying EPA's clear failure to meet its nondiscretionary duties. But that alone does not dictate deadlines. The Court is now faced with the question of feasibility. And nothing about past recalcitrance in any practical sense changes the feasibility of timelines moving forward.

EPA adds that the presumptively reasonable timeframe is the four months afforded under the regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And indeed, EPA proposes a four-month timeframe for completing its review of state plans outside of EPA Region 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   EPA, however, proposes dramatically protracted deadlines for state plans from within EPA Region 9, without a satisfactory\n   explanation. Ms. Lassiter claims that EPA Region 9 is \"operating with seriously reduced resources; [has] a significant existing backlog of actions to complete; and [has] limited staff expertise in the MSW landfill source category.\" Lassiter Decl. \u00b6 16. EPA adds that although California submitted a plan it considers \"equivalent\" to the relevant requirements underlying the Landfill Emission Guidelines, EPA \"anticipates that a line-by-line analysis will be necessary to determine\" if that is true because California's existing program predates the relevant requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   EPA contends that these factors support an eight-month timeframe for the Arizona proposals and a twelve-month timeframe for the California proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court takes EPA's representations about the phases required to conduct rulemaking for final action on state plans at face value and proceeds to analyze its proposed timetables on a phase-by-phase basis. In the review-and-analysis phase (Phase I), EPA Regions review the state plans \"to determine whether [they] conform[ ] to the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.\" Lassiter Decl. \u00b6 18.

For the development of rule proposal package phase (Phase II), EPA performs some technical analysis, briefs the Regional EPA Administrator, and drafts regulatory text ultimately leading to a proposed rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. EPA uses a \"tiering\" approach at this phase, based on the complexity of the rulemaking actions, and concedes that the present \"types of rulemakings\" typically fall in the least complex category.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, EPA estimates that this phase will take thirty days for state plans submitted in regions outside of EPA Region 9, forty days for the Arizona plans, and seventy-five days for the California plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tbls. 1-2. The next phase is the notice and comment period (Phase III), which is the ordinary period for public comment on the approval or disapproval of state plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Publication in the Federal Register typically takes two weeks, after which the public comment period is thirty days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   EPA thus estimates that this phase will take forty-five days for all state plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tbls. 1-2. Following notice and comment is the summarization of comment phase (Phase IV), wherein EPA \"drafts a comment summary document.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. EPA estimates that this phase will take fifteen days for state plans submitted in regions outside of EPA Region 9, sixty days for the Arizona plans, and 120 days for the California plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tbls. 1-2. Last is the final rule phase (Phase V), which includes briefing the Regional EPA management and producing the final regulatory package.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. EPA estimates that this phase will take fifteen days for state plans submitted in regions outside of EPA Region 9 and sixty days for the Arizona and California plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tbls. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court begins by adopting the four-month deadline for state plans outside of EPA Region 9, which is the presumptively reasonable timeframe. Turning then to state plans within EPA Region 9, EPA has an \"especially heavy\" burden to prove that it is infeasible to approve or disapprove state plans in four months.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n    658 F. Supp. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds EPA has not met this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Starting with Phase I, EPA's fifteen-day estimate for non-Region 9 plans seems imminently reasonable for the Region 9 plans as well. Although Ms. Lassiter claims that EPA may need to conduct a thorough review, including potentially a \"line-by-line\" analysis of California's plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Lassiter Decl. \u00b6 16, the California plan is twenty\n   pages long,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 87-13. The Court sees no reason why even a line-by-line analysis of a twenty-page document requires sixty-five days, as EPA suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As to Phase II, EPA only indicates that more time is needed in Region 9 because of \"resource constraints\" and \"a backlog\" of other work. Defs.' Mot. at 21. The Court finds two flaws in this explanation. First, these points are true for both the Arizona plans and the California plan, and yet EPA does not explain why it purportedly needs thirty-five\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   days for the California plan. Second, Ms. Lassiter concedes in her declaration that under EPA's \"tiering\" approach, the rulemaking actions at issue here fall within the least complex category of actions. Accepting that as true, the Court finds the thirty days EPA proposes for non-Region 9 state plans is reasonable across the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning next to Phase III, Plaintiffs contend that EPA could avoid a full-blown notice-and-comment process by approving the state plans with a \"direct final rule,\" which would be effective \"without requiring further notice.\" Pls.' Reply at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Approval and Promulgation of State Plans for Designated Facilities and Pollutants: California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C447\">\n    64 Fed.

As EPA responds, however, \"it is not clear that [the discretionary direct final rule mechanism] is appropriate\" and, more important, the exemplary direct final rule Plaintiffs cite states that the reception of adverse comments would render a direct final rule ineffective.

Reg. at 51,447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If EPA receives such comments, then it will publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register informing the public that this rule will not take effect.\"). The Court thus finds it unreasonable to mandate that EPA employ the direct final rule mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As to Phase IV, EPA provides no explanation whatsoever for why it can complete the summarization phase for state plans outside of Region 9 in fifteen days, but needs\n   <em>\n    sixty\n   </em>\n   days for the Arizona plans and\n   <em>\n    120\n   </em>\n   days for the California plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 21 (stating summarily that \"Phase IV ... will take 60 and 120 days, for the Arizona plans and the California plan, respectively\"). The Court finds that EPA has not met its \"especially heavy\" burden of demonstrating it needs more than fifteen days with such conclusory statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n    658 F. Supp. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Last, as to Phase V, EPA again provides no explanation whatsoever for why it can complete the final rule phase for state plans outside of Region 9 in fifteen days, but needs sixty days for the Arizona and California plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 21 (\"For the same reasons, Phase V, development of final rule package, is estimated to take 60 days.\"). The Court again finds that EPA has not met its \"especially heavy\" burden of demonstrating it needs more than fifteen days with such conclusory statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n    658 F. Supp. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For these reasons, the Court adopts the four-month timetable EPA set forth for state plans outside of Region 9, but finds that EPA must meet the same timetable for plans within Region 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Federal Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the presumptively reasonable timeframe to promulgate a federal plan is six months-given the regulations-Plaintiffs argue that EPA needs no more than five months to propose a single federal plan, receive comments, and finalize it. Pls.' Mot. at 20-21. EPA counters that it needs twelve months-twice the regulatory timeframe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 21-25. To this end, Ms. Lassiter details six phases to the rulemaking process for finalizing a federal plan, which are the same\n   five phases described for action on state plans \"plus a prefatory project kick-off phase.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21 (citing Lassiter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Ms. Lassiter again provides a summary of the tasks necessary to complete each phase as well as an estimate of how long she estimates EPA will need to complete those tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although the Court takes EPA's representations about the phases required to conduct rulemaking for final action on a federal plan at face value, it rejects EPA's overall timetable for promulgation of a federal plan. Due to EPA's delinquency, it bears an \"especially heavy\" burden to prove that six months is infeasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n    658 F. Supp. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Merely describing what tasks must be performed in the various phases as EPA does is thus unhelpful, as those steps presumably have always been required. It is EPA's burden to go beyond a description of the process and instead explain why it cannot complete the process within six months. And on this point EPA cites to only one factor: EPA staff members \"with responsibility for rule writing\" and the requisite knowledge and expertise \"required for the development of a federal plan ... are working on\" other matters with court-ordered deadlines.

Put differently, EPA seeks additional time to complete a nondiscretionary duty it failed to meet until ordered to act by the Court, because it faces other court orders to perform other unmet nondiscretionary duties. The Court finds EPA's self-inflicted inconvenience, by itself, does not satisfy the \"especially heavy\" burden necessary to warrant more than six months to promulgate a federal plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402720\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/658/165/#p171\">\n    658 F.
