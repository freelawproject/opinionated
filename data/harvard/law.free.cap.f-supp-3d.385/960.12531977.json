CHEN, United States District Judge\n   Title X of the Public Health Service Act provides federal funding for family-planning services. In the quarter-century since 1993, the Department of Health and Human Services' (\"HHS\") guidelines, while prohibiting funding of abortion services pursuant to Title X, have required Title X grantees to provide neutral, factual counseling to pregnant clients and to maintain financial separation between their Title X activities and their abortion services. This permitted grantees to operate effectively while complying with Title X. On March 4, 2019, HHS promulgated new regulations implementing Title X which substantially changes those guidelines in a manner that jeopardizes the provision of essential and counseling and care to thousands of women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n    84 Fed. Reg. 7714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) (the \"Final Rule\"). According to Plaintiffs, the Final Rule will create daunting barriers to California women seeking timely, effective reproductive health care, impose medically and ethically unsound restrictions on Title X providers attempting to provide patient-centered care, and inflict severe public health consequences and costs on the State. They contend the Final Rule violates recent acts of Congress, substantive and procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), and the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Final Rule goes into effect on May 3, 2019. Plaintiffs in these coordinated actions, the State of California and Essential Access Health, seek to preliminarily enjoin the implementation of the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless enjoined, the Final Rule will irreparably harm individual patients and public health in California as a whole. The Final Rule commands medical professionals to provide incomplete and misleading information to women seeking to terminate their pregnancies contrary to what patients want and need, delaying and potentially frustrating their attempts to obtain time-sensitive care, and thereby jeopardizing their health and welfare. The Final Rule threatens to decimate the network of Title X providers in California and drastically restrict patients' access to a wide range of vital services, including contraceptive resources and screenings for sexually transmitted infections, reproductive cancers, and HIV. As a result, the Final Rule is likely to inflict significant public health consequences and costs on the State and frustrate Essential Access's organizational mission to promote access to quality healthcare. In contrast, Defendants are unable to articulate any real harm they will suffer if the Final Rule is preliminarily enjoined during the pendency of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs have shown that the Final Rule likely violates Congressional directives that Title X providers must be permitted to give pregnant patients neutral, factual information regarding the full range of their medical options, and must not be compelled to act in a way that is contrary to medical ethics. The record evidence\n   indicates that HHS promulgated the Final Rule, which represents a sharp break from prior policy, without engaging in any reasoned decisionmaking. In particular, HHS cited speculative, unsubstantiated fears about the misuse of Title X funds as justification for its change in policy and touted anticipated benefits of the Final Rule that have no basis in the record, while cursorily dismissing overwhelming evidence of the significant adverse impact the Rule will have. The Final Rule is thus contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Having considered the parties' briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral argument of counsel and amici briefs filed herein, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established they are likely to succeed on the merits on several of their claims, are likely to suffer irreparable injury if the Final Rule is not enjoined, and the balance of hardships and the public interest tip sharply in favor of granting injunctive relief. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court enjoins implementation of the Final Rule but limits the injunction to California.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-292\">\n    The recent injunction issued against Defendants' implementation of the Final Rule by Judge Bastian in\n    <em>\n     State of Washington v.

However, the agency had long interpreted Title X to allow grantees to provide pregnant women with nondirective counseling and referrals about their medical options, including abortion. The initial regulations, issued in 1971, stated that Section 1008 only required that a Title X \"project will not provide abortions as a method of family planning.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018%2C465\">\n     36 Fed.

This distinction was reaffirmed in 1981, when HHS issued guidelines \"requir[ing] nondirective 'options counsleling' [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] on pregnancy termination (abortion), prenatal care, and adoption and foster care when a woman with an unintended pregnancy requests information on her options, followed by referral for these services if she so requests.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%202922\">\n     53 Fed.

First, they provided that a \"Title X project may not provide counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning or provide referral for abortion as a method of family planning,\" even in response to a client's specific request.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2059.2\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 59.8(a)(1).

The\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs objected to the regulations on statutory and constitutional grounds. They argued that the regulations were arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the Secretary's authority under Title X, that the regulations' proscription of abortion counseling and referral violated the First Amendment, and that the regulations violated a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/\">\n     at 183, 192, 201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/\">\n     111 S.Ct. 1759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Supreme Court found none of these claims availing.

Indeed, in the light of the enforcement history noted above, it is not unreasonable to say that the standard of \"physical\" separation has, as a practical matter, had little relevance or applicability in the Title X program to date. Moreover, the practical difficulty of drawing lines in this area, both as experienced prior to 1988 and as evident in the history of the Gag Rule itself, suggests that this legal interpretation is not likely ever to result in an enforceable compliance policy that is consistent with the efficient and cost-effective delivery of family planning services.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    65 Fed.

Reg. 7714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Final Rule represents a sharp break from the 2000 regulations, and a return in many aspects to the 1988 regulations. Its key provisions are detailed below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Restrictions on Abortion Counseling and Referrals\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Final Rule contains several overlapping provisions regarding abortion counseling. It directs that Title X grantees may \"[n]ot provide, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2059.5\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 59.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(5) (2019).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Similarly, it provides that \"[a] Title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family planning.\" \u00a7 59.16(a)(1). And \"[a] Title X project may not perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning, nor take any other affirmative action to assist a patient to secure such an abortion.\" \u00a7 59.14(a). The Final Rule does not define what it means to \"encourage,\" \"promote,\" or \"support\" abortions. Nor does it fully illuminate the lines between permissible provision of information and impermissible encouragement, promotion, and support.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    However, when a Title X client is confirmed to be pregnant, the Final Rule requires that the client \"shall be referred to a health care provider for medically necessary prenatal health care.\" \u00a7 59.14(b)(1). Such referral is mandated even if the client has decided not to carry the pregnancy to term. The \"Title X provider may\"-but is not required to-provide \"[n]ondirective pregnancy counseling.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2059.5\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That counseling can only be \"provided by physicians or advanced practice providers [ (\"APPs\") ],\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2059.5\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , defined as \"a medical professional who receives at least a graduate level degree in the relevant medical field and maintains a license to diagnose, treat, and counsel patients,\" \u00a7 59.2. As a result, medical professionals without a graduate level degree, such as registered nurses or licensed practical nurses, cannot provide such counseling.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Final Rule forbids Title X grantees from making referrals for abortion services.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 59.5(a)(5) (A Title X project \"must.... [n]ot provide, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.\"); \u00a7 59.14(a) (\"A Title X project may not ... refer for ... abortion as a method of family planning, nor take any other affirmative action to assist a patient to secure such an abortion.\"). Even if a client specifically requests a referral to an abortion provider, the Title X project can at most provide \"[a] list of licensed, qualified, comprehensive primary health care providers (including providers of prenatal care).\" \u00a7 59.14(b)(1)(ii), (c)(2). The list cannot include specialty clinics that do not also provide comprehensive primary health care. Further, the referral list \"may be limited to those that do not provide abortion.\" \u00a7 59.14(c)(2). If the referral list includes abortion providers, those providers may not comprise \"the majority\" of the providers on the list, and \"[n]either the list nor project staff may identify which providers on the list perform abortion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2059.5\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Hence, a Title X project may provide a client seeking an abortion a referral list of only providers who do not perform abortions without so indicating. A Title X project responding to a client's request for an abortion referral can, at most, provide a\n    list on which more than half of the providers do not provide abortions. And the project cannot tell the patient which of the providers actually performs abortions. With respect to medical emergencies, the Final Rule states: \"In cases in which emergency care is required, the Title X project shall only be required to refer the client immediately to an appropriate provider of medical services needed to address the emergency.\" \u00a7 59.14(b)(2). The Final Rule provides as the single example of a qualifying emergency \"an ectopic pregnancy.\" \u00a7 59.14(e)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    These counseling and referral restrictions represent a sharp break from the 2000 regulations, as well as the prior 1981 guidelines effective since 1993.

Both will be undermined by the Final Rule qualitatively and quantitatively.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , the Final Rule will directly compromise providers' ability to deliver effective care and force them to obstruct and delay patients with pressing medical needs. Abortion is a time-sensitive procedure; the medical risks and costs associated with it \"increase with any delay.\" Kost Decl. \u00b6 93. Yet, the Final Rule erects barrier after barrier between patients trying to make an informed decision about whether to continue their pregnancies and their clinicians. A clinician\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    refer a pregnant patient to prenatal care that focuses on carrying the pregnancy to term, even if the patient has made clear her decision to terminate her pregnancy.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 87, 91. The clinician\n    <em>\n     cannot\n    </em>\n    refer the patient to a provider of abortion services, even if the patient specifically requests such a referral.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 88. At most the clinician may provide a referral list. Most of the list must be non-abortion providers-in other words, most of the list must\n    be\n    <em>\n     non-responsive\n    </em>\n    to what the patient requests.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    And the clinician is\n    <em>\n     barred\n    </em>\n    from even identifying to the patient which providers on the referral list are the ones she asked for (providers of abortion services), so the patient must expend further time and effort figuring out for herself which providers on the list in fact can give her the care she wants and needs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Incredibly, the Final Rule does not require a clinician who furnishes a patient with a referral list that is wholly non-responsive to even\n    <em>\n     notify her that the list does not contain a single provider of the services she requested. Id.\n    </em>\n    This pregnancy counseling process is thus, as the President of Essential Access aptly puts it, a \"charade\" from beginning to end. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 50. The overall effect of the Final Rule is to \"harm and confuse all patients\" during a medically and emotionally sensitive period and \"ultimately threaten their health and well-being.\" Kost Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 90, 92, 94.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , the Final Rule threatens to drastically reduce access to the wide array of services provided by Title X projects by driving large numbers of providers out of the program. Compliance with the physical separation requirement, which in many cases effectively requires providers to establish \"mirror\" facilities and staff, would be cost-prohibitive for many providers in California's Title X network.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 43; Nestor Decl. \u00b6 13; McKinney Decl. \u00b6 10; Forer Decl. \u00b6 31. In addition, a significant number of Title X projects have indicated that they will likely drop out of the program because they believe the Final Rule compels them to compromise the quality of care they provide and violate their ethical obligations. Sub-recipients of Essential Access's Title X funds representing 233 clinic sites serving over 774,000 patients \"would leave or consider leaving\" Title X if they are prohibited from referring patients for abortion services. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 42. Sub-recipients representing 194 clinic sites serving over 682,000 patients \"will leave or consider leaving\" if they are required by the Final Rule to encourage family involvement where an adolescent patient seeks confidential services.\n    <em>\n     Id.; see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Nestor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; McKinney Decl. \u00b6 9. Likewise, \"Planned Parenthood affiliates and their health centers\"-which serve over 40% of all Title X patients nationwide-\"would be forced to discontinue their participation in Title X if the Proposed Rule takes effect.\" Rich Decl., Exh. M at 15-16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The net effect of so many providers leaving Title X will be a significant reduction in the availability of important medical services. The substantial Title X funding Essential Access currently receives-approximately $ 20 million per year-provides \"comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care for more than 1 million\" patients in California annually. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13-15. Essential Access has submitted evidence that the vast majority of its sub-recipients-85 percent-would be forced to lay off staff, cut training, and reduce outreach and education activities without that funding.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 44. A third would have to reduce clinic hours.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Some would have to shut down core services and programs entirely.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Thomas Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13 (Fresno Economic Opportunities Commission \"will not be able to operate\" HEARTT, its family planning and reproductive health service for youth, without Title X funds); Nestor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-10, 14 (Without Title X funds, the San Francisco Department of Public Health will have to \"substantially curtail\" its training programs, public education and outreach projects, and \"special projects to address emerging public health challenges\"); Marshall Decl. \u00b6 28 (\"Without Title X funding, CommuniCare will not run the outreach services that inform young\n    people of its teen clinic services, nor provide teen clinic services at all.\"); Wilburn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-21, (\"The loss of Title X funds will be nearly fatal to [the Community Action Partnership of San Luis Obispo County]'s Health and Prevention Division,\" including its outreach programs, teen program, and Hepatitis C testing services).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    If Title X funding is reduced, patients in California accordingly stand to lose access to a wide range of \"vital health services,\" many of which have nothing to do with abortion, since Title X providers \"serve as a trusted entry point for medical care generally.\" California Mot. at 24;\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 12 (\"In 2017 alone, Essential Access sub-recipients ... provided more than 1.6 million family planning visits\" and administered \"more than 148,000 Pap tests, more than 118,000 clinical breast exams, more than 642,000 chlamydia screenings, more than 700,000 gonorrhea screenings, and more than 341,000 HIV tests.\"); Brindis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Tuttle Decl. \u00b6 8; McCarthy Decl. \u00b6 7; Wilburn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. In particular, \"[i]n less populous regions, the Rule will create 'contraceptive deserts' where women in need of Title X-funded contraceptive services will be unable to find an affordable, well-qualified provider within their county.\" California Mot. at 21. Nationwide, in one-fifth of U.S. counties the only safety-net family planning center is a Title X site. Kost Decl. \u00b6 78. Should any of these sites drop out of the Title X program as a result of the Final Rule, many individuals would have no access to high-quality, affordable family planning care in their counties at all.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In California specifically, eighteen counties would be left without a single Title X-funded health center if all the family planning providers that perform abortions were to close. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 43.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Even among providers who remain in Title X, service capacity will decrease because the requirement that pregnancy counseling can only be provided by physicians and APPs excludes \"vast numbers of medical professionals\" who currently provide such counseling. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 52; McKinney Decl. \u00b6 11; Kost Decl. \u00b6 86. This will compound an already \"severe crisis in physician and nurse practitioner availability,\" creating even more critical shortages in counseling resources. Castellano-Garcia Decl. \u00b6 11. Many Title X grantees do not have enough physicians and APPs on staff to serve their patients, so those patients will have to either wait for much longer to receive counseling that is often time-sensitive, or simply will not receive the family-planning information they need.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , McKinney Decl. \u00b6 11; Forer Decl. \u00b6 30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n    , the quality of Title X services will be compromised. Patients served by Title X-funded providers use more effective contraceptive methods at higher rates than those served by non-Title X-funded providers. Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 46. Title X patients \"are more likely [than non-Title X patients] to adopt or continue using long-acting and reversible contraceptive methods ('LARCs'),\" which \"are highly effective [in preventing pregnancy] because they obviate the need for daily administration or use at the time of intercourse.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Kost Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 119-121 (describing a 35 percent reduction in women using LARCs after Texas \"made a series of changes to its family planning program ..., which included disqualifying agencies providing abortion\"). \"Diminishing access to LARCs may result in a greater number of unintended pregnancies.\" Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 46. Moreover, the Final Rule's separation provision requires health centers to maintain duplicate records systems. Such non-integrated records systems threaten patient health by increasing the risk of error due to \"incomplete medical histories, missing data, lost test results, incorrect\n    medication, dosage instructions, and allergy warnings, and other miscommunications across patient records.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 70.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Ultimately, the consequence of the reduced availability and quality of health services is worse health outcomes for patients and the public as a whole. The number of unintended pregnancies will increase, which is \"likely to result in premature births, low birth weight infants, and congenital defects.\" Cantwell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29; Brindis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-55. Indeed, the Final Rule could have the perverse effect of\n    <em>\n     increasing\n    </em>\n    abortion rates, since \"[o]ver half of unintended pregnancies end in miscarriage or abortion.\" California Mot. at 23; Tosh Decl. \u00b6 25 (citing report documenting that 45% of unintended pregnancies result in abortion, and another 13% result in miscarriages). Instances of STIs and other conditions that would otherwise be diagnosed by Title X-funded testing will also likely increase.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brindis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-65 (citing study estimating that in 2017, Title X-funded testing \"averted approximately 90 to 400 cases of HIV and 47,740 to 56,670 other STIs,\" diagnosed \"many pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) cases, ectopic pregnancies, ... infertility cases\" and \"reproductive cancers\"); Kost Decl. \u00b6 82.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In short, there is substantial evidence in the record before the Court which establishes that California's public health and Essential Access's mission to promote quality sexual and reproductive care will be irreparably harmed unless the Final Rule is enjoined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Economic Harm to California\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Next, the economic harms that flow from the Final Rule's detrimental effects on public health also constitute irreparable harm to California.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     California v.

As detailed above, Planned Parenthood has stated unequivocally that its whole network of health centers \"would be forced to discontinue their participation in Title X if the Proposed Rule takes effect.\" Rich Decl., Exh.

The inverse correlation between the availability of publicly-funded contraceptives and the rate of unintended pregnancies is well-documented in the record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brindis Decl., Exh.

Plaintiffs have also cited three case studies documenting the adverse health consequences that directly resulted when family planning services providers that offer abortion-related services were excluded from public funding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brindis Decl., Exh.

Castellano-Garcia Decl. \u00b6 11; McKinney Decl. \u00b6 11; Forer Decl. \u00b6 30. The resulting shortfall in service capacity caused would manifest immediately, before any final decision on the merits in this case will be reached.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2948.1 (3d ed. 2013) (\"Perhaps the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration that if it is not granted the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.\").

Defendants point to HHS's claim in the Final Rule that it \"does not anticipate that there will be a decrease in the overall number of facilities offering [Title X] services, since it anticipates other, new entities will apply for funds, or seek to participate as subrecipients, as a result of the final rule.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

In fact, at oral argument, when pressed for any record evidence substantiating this (highly consequential) assertion, Defendants' counsel could offer none. Counsel insisted that it is \"just intuitive\" that new grantees will fully replace departing ones in the \"fluid marketplace\" for medical services. Intuition is no rebuttal to Plaintiffs' evidence of threatened irreparable harm. Nor is Defendants' \"intuition\" presumed as a matter of logic and common sense. Plaintiffs note that nationwide, in one-fifth of U.S. counties, including rural counties in California, the only safety-net family planning center is a Title X site. Kost Decl. \u00b6 78;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 51 (stating that in some rural areas of California, a patient would have to travel more than five hours in order to access an abortion provider that qualifies for a referral under the Final Rule). It defies common sense to assume that in these regions, new healthcare centers will simply materialize and seamlessly assume the client load of exiting grantees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , Defendants insist that the claimed harm to Essential Access is not imminent. Opp. at 43-44. This argument is unavailing for the same reason that the expected harm to California is not speculative-Plaintiffs' evidence demonstrates that access to and the quality of family planning services will be adversely affected as soon as the Final Rule goes into effect. With respect to compliance costs, the process for establishing a physically and financially separate \"mirror\" office would \"requir[e] Essential Access to expend resources on planning and implantation of operational changes\n    <em>\n     immediately\n    </em>\n    after the Final Rule takes effect.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 66 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 68. The same time pressure extends to Essential Access's sub-recipients. McKinney Decl. \u00b6 10. Furthermore, as to Essential Access' ability to deliver quality health care, it cannot be ignored that abortion is a time-sensitive procedure, and the medical risks and costs associated with it \"increase with any delay.\" Kost Decl. \u00b6 93;\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chalk v.

The Final Rule, by requiring Title X projects to provide incomplete and perhaps even misleading information to patients, and prohibiting projects from referring patients to abortion providers, forces patients to expend more time and effort to secure information and referrals regarding abortions. In doing so, it increases the health risks and limits the care options for pregnant women, whether they have already decided to obtain an abortion or are simply seeking more information to guide their determination of whether to continue their pregnancies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Kost Decl. \u00b6 94 (\"[T]he inability to make a fully informed decision on how to proceed with a pregnancy would be especially harmful for women with severe diabetes, heart conditions, HIV/AIDS and estrogen-dependent tumors-all conditions that could be exacerbated by continuing a pregnancy.\"). In other words, the Final Rule is likely to jeopardize patients' welfare as soon as it is implemented, thus impairing both patient health and Essential Access' central mission.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n    , Defendants argue that the alleged harm to Essential Access's sub-recipients and Title X patients is not harm to Essential Access itself.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 43. This argument misses the point. As noted above, Essential Access's organizational mission is to \"promote quality sexual and reproductive health care for all.\" Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 3. It works toward this mission in part by distributing Title X funds to its sub-recipients to facilitate their provision of family planning services to patients.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 6. Thus, the potentially detrimental impact the Final Rule will have on those sub-recipients' capacities to provide services to Title X patients is just one manifestation of the harm that Essential Access will suffer with respect to its organizational mission.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     Fourth\n    </em>\n    , Defendants recite the proposition that \"ordinary compliance costs are typically insufficient to constitute irreparable harm.\" Opp. at 45 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Freedom Holdings, Inc. v.

Indeed, at oral argument, Defendants' counsel agreed with Plaintiffs that Section 1008 and the Nondirective Counseling Provision can be read in harmony-requiring pregnancy counseling under Title X to be nondirective does not necessarily run afoul of Section 1008's general proscription that no Title X funds \"shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\" That is demonstrated by HHS's 2000 regulations, which proscribed funding of abortions but permitted nondirective pregnancy counseling.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The question is whether the Final Rule, as one interpretation of Section 1008, is inconsistent with the Appropriations Acts' mandate that \"pregnancy counseling\" be \"nondirective.\" HHS does not dispute that it has an obligation to comply with the Nondirective Counseling Provision. It wrote in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the Final Rule that \"[s]ince it originally created the Title X program in 1970, Congress has, from time to time, imposed additional requirements on it,\" including \"the annual Title X appropriation includes the provisos that 'all pregnancy counseling shall be nondirective.' \"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2025502\">\n     83 Fed.

[n]ondirective pregnancy counseling\" to a pregnant patient. Plaintiffs contend, on the other hand, that the Final Rule is inconsistent with the Nondirective Counseling Provision because it mandates referrals to prenatal care while categorically barring referrals for \"abortion as a method of family planning,\" and imposes unreasonable restrictions on the provision of referral lists for patients seeking an abortion. Plaintiffs also argue that even without the referral prohibition and restrictions, the Final Rule \"effectively prohibits nondirective counseling ... by issuing a vague prohibition on providers who 'encourage' or 'promote' abortion.\" California Mot. at 11. Plaintiffs believe this \"unclear guidance will likely cause providers to forgo discussions altogether for fear of violating the Rule.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    i.\n    <em>\n     \"Nondirective Counseling\" Includes Referrals\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The first part of the parties' dispute focuses on whether \"nondirective counseling\" under the Appropriations Acts encompasses referrals. It does, as indicated by statute, regulations, and industry practice. First, Congress expressed its understanding in the PHSA that \"nondirective counseling\" includes referral.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254c-6(a)(1)\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    (providing that HHS shall make training grants \"providing adoption information\n    <em>\n     and referrals\n    </em>\n    to pregnant women on an equal basis with all other courses of action\n    <em>\n     included in nondirective counseling\n    </em>\n    to pregnant women\") (emphases added). The PHSA and the HHS Appropriations Acts appear to be the only instances in which Congress has used the term \"nondirective counseling,\" and Defendants have not argued otherwise. Notably, the Final Rule, in interpreting Title X, incorporates the definition of \"nondirective counseling\" from \u00a7 254c-6(a)(1) of the PHSA in the context of adoption.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

To Defendants, the conjunction \"and\" indicates that counseling and referral are discrete activities. Absent any other interpretive guidance, this may be a plausible reading. But given the express references to counseling as \"including\" referral in the PHSA, elsewhere in HHS regulations, and in the Final Rules, the phrase \"counseling and referral\" occasionally used by HHS is more sensibly read as simply describing sequential aspects of the same process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Finally, Defendants cite a 1992 bill that expressly sought to \"reverse[ ] the regulations issued in 1988 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 to restrict the provision of information on abortion to Title-Ten patients.\" Opp. at 17 (quoting H.R Rep. No. 102-204, at 1 (1991)). The bill, which was passed by Congress but vetoed by President George H. W. Bush, defined \"pregnancy management options\" to mean \"nondirective counseling and referrals.\" S. 323, 102nd Cong. \u00a7 2 (1992). Defendants contend that Congress' later enactment of the Nondirective Counseling Provision\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    specific mention of \"referral\" as in the 1992 bill signifies that Congress intended to exclude referral from the scope of nondirective counseling mandated by the subsequent Appropriations Acts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 18. This argument ignores important context. The 1992 bill was introduced in the immediate wake of and as an explicit\n    response to the\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    decision. Because\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    upheld the 1988 regulations that expressly banned abortion counseling and referrals, it is not surprising that Congress felt the need to specify in explicit terms that it was putting both abortion-related counseling and referral back on the table. But by the time Congress enacted the Nondirective Counseling Provision in 1996, the pre-1988 regulatory scheme that treated abortion referrals as a part of counseling had already been restored.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%207462\">\n     58 Fed.

This differential treatment is not \"nondirective.\" The mandate compels providers to present the options in a coercive manner and pushes patients to pursue one option over another; it does not allow \"clients [to] take an active role in processing their experiences and\n    identifying the direction of the interaction.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

Indeed, Defendants conceded at oral argument that if referral is considered a part of counseling, \u00a7 59.14(b)(1) violates the Nondirective Counseling Provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Defendants also acknowledged that the referral list restrictions in \u00a7 59.14(c)(2) stand and fall together with the prohibition on abortion referrals in \u00a7 59.14(a). Section 59.14(c)(2) allows Title X projects to provide a client with a referral list \"limited to those that do not provide abortion,\" even if the client specifically requests an abortion referral. It further prevents projects from providing a referral list on which \"the majority\" of the providers perform abortion services, and from \"identify[ing] which providers on the list perform abortion.\" Far from meaningfully presenting a patient with her medical options, such a \"non-referral referral list\" (as Plaintiffs' counsel labels it) is likely to cause confusion and delay in her attempt to obtain care. The patient would have to spend time working through the list to determine which referrals actually provide the services she asked for-time she may not have given the time-sensitive nature of decisions about pregnancy and related care. Imposing these onerous restrictions only on abortion information does not place abortion on an equal basis with all other courses of action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     The Final Rule's Counseling Restrictions Violate the Nondirective Counseling Provision Apart From Referrals\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    There is also merit to Plaintiffs' contention that, the referral prohibition aside, the Final Rule one-sidedly chills counseling regarding abortion. Sections 59.5(a)(5) and 59.14(a) bar providers from doing anything to \"promote\" or \"support\" abortion.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 59.16(a)(1) (\"A Title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family planning.\"). At oral argument, Defendants' counsel struggled to draw a clear boundary between mentioning or describing abortion as a pregnancy option within the permissible scope of nondirective counseling and \"promoting\" or \"supporting\" abortion impermissible under \u00a7\u00a7 59.5(a)(5) and 59.14(a). Essentially, counsel was only able to offer a circular definition: A provider can avoid \"promoting\" or \"supporting\" abortion by counseling nondirectively, and a provider can counsel nondirectively by not \"promoting\" or \"supporting\" abortion. This interpretive murkiness is telling. It suggests that providers desiring to explain the abortion option have to walk on eggshells to avoid a potential transgression of the Final Rule, whereas those describing the option of continuing the pregnancy face no comparable risk. This lack of symmetry created by \u00a7\u00a7 59.5(a)(5) and 59.14(a) is likely to chill discussions of abortion and thus inhibits neutral and unbiased counseling.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that sections 59.14(a), 59.14(b)(1), and 59.14(c)(2) violate the Nondirective Counseling Provision of the Appropriations Acts and are thus not in accordance with law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Section 1554 of the ACA\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Plaintiffs next argue that the Final Rule violates Section 1554 of the ACA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    California Mot. at 12-13; Essential Mot. at 10-13.

Defendants reason that the prefatory language in Section 1554, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this Act,\" limits the scope of Section 1554 to the ACA.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018114\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This meaning is underscored by the expansive second clause of Section 1554: \"the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not promulgate\n    <em>\n     any regulation\n    </em>\n    ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018114\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The literal text of Section 1554 does not support Defendants' construction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    That Section 1554 has application beyond the ACA is neither surprising nor unusual; surrounding provisions do too.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018116\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (nondiscrimination provision that extends to all federally-funded health programs). Moreover, where Congress wanted a provision to apply only to the ACA, it said so explicitly. For example, Section 1553 directs that \"[t]he Federal Government, and any State or local government or health care provider that\n    <em>\n     receives Federal financial assistance\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     under this Act\n    </em>\n    ... may not subject an individual or institutional health care entity to discrimination....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018113\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18113\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 1555 provides that \"[n]o individual, company, business, nonprofit entity, or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any Federal health insurance program\n    <em>\n     created under this Act.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018115\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

Neither advances Defendants' cause. The first is the \"principle that Congress 'does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.' \" Opp. at 20 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Whitman v.

And as noted above,\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    merely upheld one interpretation of Title X; it did not purport to definitively interpret Title X itself.

The pre-Final Rule regulatory scheme gives effect to both.

The statutory mandates of Section 1554 are far more specific than the constitutional requirement asserted in\n    <em>\n     Rust.\n    </em>\n    The claim under Section 1554 is a matter of statutory interpretation to which\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    is inapposite.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Moreover, as a factual matter, the Final Rule's referral list restrictions go far beyond anything in the 1988 regulations. The new restrictions: (1) permit a Title X project to give a patient who\n    <em>\n     specifically requests\n    </em>\n    a referral for abortion a referral list\n    that contains\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    abortion providers; (2) require the project to compile a list of providers, a majority of whom are\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    responsive to the patient's request; (3) prevents the project from identifying which providers on the list\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    responsive to the patient's needs; and (4)\n    <em>\n     does not require the project to even alert the patient that the list is incomplete and non-responsive. See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 59.14(c)(2). Because of these provisions, patients in need of time-sensitive medical care will be delayed or altogether prevented from obtaining that care because they will receive referrals that they do not realize are not for the services they requested.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rich Decl., Exh. K at 2. In other words, under the Final Rule, the Government would be subsidizing the misdirection of unsuspecting patients. Unlike in\n    <em>\n     Rust\n    </em>\n    , the Final Rule may well make patients\n    <em>\n     worse\n    </em>\n    off than if they had not sought help from a Title X project to begin with.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     The Final Rule Violates Section 1554\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Having found that Plaintiffs' claim under Section 1554 is not foreclosed, the Court must determine whether the Final Rule in fact violates that provision of the ACA. Plaintiffs assert that the Final Rule's restrictions on counseling and referral and requirement for providers to encourage family participation in family planning decisions are contrary to Section 1554. The Court agrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The Court has already detailed extensively the ways in which the Final Rule's overlapping restrictions on pregnancy counseling (including referral and referral lists) obfuscate and obstruct patients from receiving information and treatment for their pressing medical needs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Parts III.A.1 and III.C.1.a.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ; Kost Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 88-93; Rabinovitz Decl. \u00b6 50; Marshall Decl. \u00b6 22. There is no question that these restrictions \"create[ ] ... unreasonable barriers to the ability of individuals to obtain appropriate medical care,\" \"impede[ ] timely access to health care services,\" \"interfere[ ] with communications regarding a full range of treatment options between the patient and the provider,\" and \"restrict[ ] the ability of health care providers to provide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions\" in violation of subparts (1)-(4) of Section 1554. Defendants do not even contest this.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Separately, the Final Rule's prohibition on providing abortion referrals, restrictions on the content of referral lists, and mandate on referrals for prenatal care are also squarely at odds with established ethical standards and therefore Section 1554(5). Indeed, they are inconsistent with HHS's own QFP Guidelines, which provide that once a patient receives a positive pregnancy test:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n    Referral to appropriate providers of follow-up care should be made at the request of the client, as needed. Every effort should be made to expedite and follow through on all referrals. For example, providers might provide a resource listing or directory of providers to help the client identify options for care. Depending upon a client's needs,\n    the provider may make an appointment for the client, or call the referral site to let them know the client was referred.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    QFP Guidelines at 14. The QFP Guidelines further instruct that \"[p]roviders of family planning services should offer pregnancy testing and counseling services as part of core family planning services, in accordance with recommendations of major professional medical organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13. In turn, ACOG explains that physicians have an ethical obligation to \"provide a pregnant woman who may be ambivalent about her pregnancy full information about all options in a balanced manner, including raising the child herself, placing the child for adoption, and abortion.\" Rich Decl., Exh. G at 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    Clearly, the Final Rule's blanket prohibition on abortion referrals does not comport with providers' ethical obligation to provide \"[r]eferral to appropriate providers of follow-up care ... at the request of the client.\" QFP Guidelines at 14. And \u00a7 59.14(c)(2)'s restrictions that prevent Title X from providing any abortion referrals to a patient who specifically requests such a referral, and from identifying which providers on a referral list perform abortion services, do not \"help the client identify options for care.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Comments in the record show that associations of medical professionals overwhelmingly agree that the Final Rule's counseling and referral restrictions violate principles of medical ethics and informed consent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Rich Decl., Exh. B at 4-5 (California Medical Association stating that restrictions \"directly conflict[ ] with the requirements of medical professional associations, including [ACOG].\"); Exh. D at 4 (American Academy of Nursing stating that restrictions \"violate[ ] basic ethics of the profession,\" including the Code of Ethics for Nurses); Exh. E at 7 (Guttmacher Institute stating that restrictions \"constitute[ ] an unacceptable repudiation of the doctrine of informed consent by denying Title X patients factual, unbiased information on abortion\"); Exh.

As ACOG explains, this provision \"require[s] the provision of counseling, information, and referral for services that the patient has clearly stated she does not wish to receive.\" Rich Decl., Exh. G at 3, 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Moreover, as the American Public Health Association details, \u00a7 59.14(b)(1) also violates ethical principles because while it allows Title X providers to abstain from providing nondirective counseling due to moral or religious reasons, \"it does not contain any requirement that those providers advise patients of their refusal.\" Rich Decl., Exh. K at 2. \"Therefore, patients will not even know if they are getting complete information.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Finally, the Final Rule's \"family participation\" requirement also violates ethical\n    standards. Title X itself only asks grantees to \"encourage family participation\" in Title X projects \"[t]o the extent practical.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). But Section 59.5(a)(14) directs Title X grantees to \"[e]ncourage family participation in the decision to seek family planning services; and, with respect to each minor patient, ensure that the records maintained document the specific actions taken to encourage such family participation (or the specific reason why such family participation was not encouraged).\" There is an exception to the documentation requirement where a provider \"suspects the minor to be the victim of child abuse or incest.\" \u00a7 59.2(1)(i). The American Academy of Pediatrics (\"AAP\") notes that healthcare professionals already \"highly encourage[ ] the involvement of families in the care of adolescents and young adults as much as possible,\" and \"[a]s a consequence, most adolescents already involve their families in decisions about family planning.\" Rich Decl., Exh. N at 6. However, the new requirement in the Final Rule for \"clinicians to take 'specific actions' to encourage family participation, even after they have learned that this involvement is not practicable,\" is \"contrary to medical ethics.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    AAP explains that \"clinicians sometimes learn of circumstances (short of abuse) in a minor's family that make it not 'practicable,' or unrealistic or even harmful to encourage the minor to involve their parents or guardian.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In these situations, requiring clinicians to nevertheless encourage family participation and document those efforts would both force them to breach their ethical obligations and \"drive some minors away from returning for critical health services.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Other commenters, including ACOG, echo AAP's conclusion that \u00a7 59.5(a)(14) violates medical ethics.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , Exh.

The flaws in this leap of logic are myriad. Fundamentally, the poll did not ask doctors anything about Title X specifically. For example, does the permissive ability to provide nondirective abortion counseling and referral actually violate their beliefs? Have the 2000 regulations deterred them from participating in Title X because of their beliefs? Would they join Title X projects if they were not required to provide nondirective counseling and referral for abortions? More to the point, have these doctors been deterred from joining Title X projects because other projects do not have physically separate facilities? On its face, this would seem to be a non-sequitur. There is particular reason to question the assumption that large numbers of doctors are being discouraged from joining Title X because of their beliefs about abortion because HHS has already implemented rules that, since 2008, have recognized that Title X program requirements must be enforced consistent with federal laws that protect moral and religious conscience.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2078072\">\n     73 Fed.

But this does not concern grantees which\n    <em>\n     do not\n    </em>\n    have moral or religious objections to abortion. The conscience laws do not provide a basis for HHS to bar\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    Title X grantees from providing abortion referrals. Given the lack of a reasoned basis for the counseling and referral restrictions, those provisions of the Final Rule are arbitrary and capricious under the traditional\n    <em>\n     State Farm\n    </em>\n    analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    As with the physical separation requirement, this aspect of the Final Rule, which significantly alters the longstanding prior regulatory scheme requires a more detailed justification under\n    <em>\n     Fox Television.\n    </em>\n    The counseling and referral restrictions are based in part on factual findings discussed in the Final Rule that contradict those which underlay the 2000 regulations. In 2000, HHS justified its formal rescission of the 1988 \"gag rule\" on the following grounds: it \"endangers women's lives and health by preventing them from receiving complete and accurate medical information\"; it \"interferes with the doctor-patient relationship by prohibiting information that medical professionals are otherwise ethically and legally required to provide to their patients\"; \"requiring a referral for prenatal care ... where the client rejected those options would seem coercive and inconsistent with the concerns underlying the 'nondirective' counseling requirement\"; and it is \"consistent with the prevailing medical standards recommended by national medical groups.\" 65 Fed. Reg. at 41270-75. In contrast, HHS now asserts the restrictions in the Final Rule are warranted because \"it is not necessary for women's health that the federal government use the Title X program to fund abortion referrals, directive abortion counseling, or give to women who seek abortion the names of abortion providers\"; \"[r]eferring for adoption or prenatal care, but not for abortion, does not ... make pregnancy counseling directive\"; and the restrictions \"will [not] require health care professionals to violate medical ethics, regulations concerning the practice of medicine, or malpractice liability standards.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

It has not done so.

Essential Mot. at 18; California Mot. at 18-19. Defendants offer two responses, both of which make little sense. First, Defendants point out that the Final Rule is more permissive than the Proposed Rule, because the Proposed Rule restricted pregnancy counseling to physicians only, whereas the Final Rule allows physicians and APPs to take on counseling duties. Opp. at 32-33. This observation is neither here nor there, because neither the Proposed Rule nor the Final Rule explains\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    pregnancy counseling should be limited to physicians or APPs. The physician-and-APP limitation, while more permissive than the physician-only limitation initially proposed, is just as arbitrary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Second, Defendants claim that \"HHS considered which types of health care professionals to include [as qualified to provide pregnancy counseling], and reasonably drew the line at APPs, who have 'advanced medical degrees, licensing, and certification requirements.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p513\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

But this merely recites the Final Rule's definition of APP; again, Defendants cannot point to any part of the Final Rule where HHS explains\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    \"advanced medical degrees, licensing, and certification requirements\" are necessary\n    to qualify someone to provide pregnancy counseling. The agency certainly did not address voluminous evidence that non-APP personnel with the proper training have long been capably providing pregnancy counseling.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Kost Decl. \u00b6 86 (citing Guttmacher Institute report that in 2010, 65% of Title X sites \"rel[ied] on trained health educators, registered nurses and other qualified providers (excluding physicians and advanced practice clinicians) to counsel patients in selecting contraceptive methods\"); Forer Decl. \u00b6 29.

HHS has articulated no explanation at all for the APP requirement and thus fails both tests.

Again, they are correct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    HHS provided one justification for removing the \"medically approved\" language.

As Plaintiffs point out, however, HHS cannot identify a single instance in the eighteen years since the 2000 regulations added the \"medically approved\" requirement where a regulated entity has expressed confusion about the meaning of the term. Indeed, numerous comments submitted during rulemaking demonstrated that Title X providers understood \"medically approved\" to mean contraceptive methods that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, because that is what HHS has made clear it means. Throughout its QFP Guidelines, HHS emphasizes repeatedly that providers of family planning services should provide \"a full range of\n    <em>\n     FDA-approved\n    </em>\n    contraceptive methods.\" QFP Guidelines at 7 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 2, 10, 11, 23, 24, 39. Numerous medical associations and experts in reproductive health told the agency that they understood \"medically approved\" to mean \"FDA approved.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Rich Decl., Exh.

K at 5 (APHA).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    The only confusion evinced anywhere in the record is of the agency's own creation. In the Final Rule, instead of citing its QFP Guidelines, HHS hypothesized: \"Family planning methods and services are often provided through licensed health care professionals. Thus, it is true of all family\n    planning methods or services provided by Title X providers that at least one medical professional or clinic has 'approved' the method or service, by virtue of providing it to the client.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

All three are baseless. First, HHS claims that the Final Rule \"is likely to\n    <em>\n     decrease\n    </em>\n    unintended pregnancies ... because clients are more likely to visit clinics that respect their views and beliefs and to use methods that they desire and that fit their individual circumstances.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed. Reg. at 7743\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis). The agency cites as the basis for this belief \u00a7 59.5(a)(1) of the Final Rule, which clarifies that Title X projects need not provide every family planning method or service. But HHS provides no evidence or analysis suggesting a connection between \u00a7 59.1(a)(1) and decreased unintended pregnancies. The agency does not, for example, provide any basis for believing that under the current regulations, patients are choosing not to avail themselves of Title X care because their \"views and beliefs\" are disrespected by clinics providing nondirective counseling.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-251\">\n    Second, HHS insists that \"[c]ommenters offer no compelling evidence that this rule will increase unintended pregnancies or decrease access to contraception.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

To the extent this conclusory assertion stems from the assumption that the Final Rule will prompt large numbers of new grantees to join Title X, that assumption is debunked by record evidence, as detailed above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Third, HHS offers an excuse for disregarding the costs associated with higher instances of unintended pregnancies:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n    [T]he Department is not aware, either from its own sources or from commenters, of actual data that could demonstrate a causal connection between the type of changes to Title X regulations\n    contemplated in this rulemaking and an increase in unintended pregnancies, births, or costs associated with either, much less data that could reliably calculate the magnitude of that hypothetical impact. Therefore, the Department concludes that those are not likely or calculable impacts for the purpose of the Executive Order.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n     84 Fed.

This rationale does not withstand even deferential scrutiny.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-255\">\n    For one thing, \"[t]he mere fact that the ... effect[ ] [of a rule] is\n    <em>\n     uncertain\n    </em>\n    is no justification for\n    <em>\n     disregarding\n    </em>\n    the effect entirely.\"\n    <em>\n     Pub.

While\n    the portions of the declaration on which Plaintiffs rely address the many Title X providers around the country will leave the program because of the Final Rule, the record does not indicate that preserving the current Title X network in other states is \"necessary to redress the injury shown by the\n    <em>\n     [P]laintiff[s].\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Azar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/#p581\">\n     911 F.3d at 584\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

According to Plaintiffs, recipients of Title X funding are \"interconnected\" because if Title X grantees in some areas claim less funding, grantees in other areas would receive commensurately more. Even so, however, an injunction limited to California would allow grantees within the state to maintain and deploy their regular allotment of Title X funds; grantees in other states would not be able to take away California's funds. It is difficult to discern on this record how a preliminary injunction limited to California will affect other states in a way that will harm Plaintiffs and their clients in California. In short, Plaintiffs have not shown at this juncture that a nationwide injunction is necessary to protect their interests.
