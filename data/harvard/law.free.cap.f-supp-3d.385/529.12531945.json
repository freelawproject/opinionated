The final pre-trial conference and voir dire were conducted on June 17, 2019. Testimony began on June 19, 2019. The Government learned that Harrison was a potential witness on June 18, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Factual Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ware, who was previously detained at the LaSalle Corrections Facility in Beaumont, Texas, was transferred to the Upshur County Jail on June 13, 2019, to be closer to Tyler, Texas, where his trial was scheduled to begin on June 17, 2019. Ware was placed in a six-person cell with five other prisoners, which was one of two cells reserved for federal inmates at the facility. Harrison had been housed in the cell since January 2019 and was awaiting sentencing for his participation in a crack cocaine conspiracy case pending before Judge Schroeder in Texarkana, Texas. The decision to place Ware in the cell was made by Sgt. Somer Monts (\"Sgt. Monts\") with the Upshur County Sheriff's Office Jail Division. Sgt. Monts placed Ware in the same cell as Harrison because both were federal detainees and had 4-Medium security classifications. Sgt. Monts followed the \"classification decision tree\" pursuant to jail policy to classify and house both inmates. Harrison was a defendant and cooperating witness in case number 6:18-cr-37,\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    States of America v. Jason Lee Allison, et al\n   </em>\n   . Harrison cooperated with the Government in his case from November 13, 2017, until he was indicted and surrendered to the custody of authorities on July 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 18, 2019, Harrison was sentenced for his role in case number 6:18-cr-37. At his sentencing hearing, Harrison's attorney informed Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") Ryan Locker, who was assigned to his case, that Harrison had information regarding Ware that might be of interest to the Government. Locker spoke briefly with Harrison and his attorney, learned that Harrison would be willing to speak with the AUSAs assigned to Ware's case, and instructed Harrison not to have any further conversations with Ware. Locker advised the AUSAs assigned to Ware's case of Harrison's willingness to speak with them regarding the instant case. After the sentencing hearing, Harrison was returned to the Upshur County Jail where he was interviewed by Special Agent Jonathan Dickard, AUSA Michelle Englade, and Special Agent Craig Redden (\"S.A. Redden\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the presence of his attorney, Jason Cassel. After the interview, Harrison was placed in solitary confinement and had no further contact with Ware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 19, 2019, the court held an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding Harrison's proffered testimony. It is undisputed that Harrison operated as a confidential informant under the direction of S.A. Redden from November 2017 until July 30, 2018, in regard to case number 6:18-cr-37. S.A. Redden confirmed under oath that he ceased contact with Harrison on July 30, 2018, the date he surrendered. Further, S.A. Redden had no knowledge that Harrison and Ware were housed together and did not expressly or implicitly instruct Harrison to inquire into Ware's case or trial strategy. The record reflects that until he spoke with the Government on June 18, 2019, Harrison had no contact with any representative of the Government for the past year. Harrison testified that, when Ware first entered the\n   cell, he asked Ware what he was doing there. Harrison and Ware are both from the small town of Carthage, Texas. Thereafter, according to Harrison's testimony, Ware spoke with Harrison and his other cellmates about various aspects of the instant case and showed him a variety of case-related documents. Harrison testified that aside from asking an occasional question, pointing out apparent inconsistencies in Ware's theory of his case, and feigning ignorance of S.A. Redden, Harrison merely listened to Ware's comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S. CONST. amend.

In\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   , a jailhouse informant, at the government's instruction, developed a relationship of trust and confidence with the defendant such that the defendant eventually revealed incriminating information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n    at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government argued that\n   <em>\n    Massiah\n   </em>\n   did not apply because the government instructed the informant not to question the defendant about his crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n    at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183478\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/264/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is important to note, however, that the Fifth Circuit has not explicitly addressed whether the same standard applies on direct appeal but, rather, has considered the proper standard only in the context of a\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   proceeding.

In this instance, the Government did not provide Harrison any instructions, either express or implied, to gather information about Ware. In fact, Harrison and Ware's being placed in the same jail and in the same cell was purely happenstance, resulting from Ware's case being tried in Tyler, the need to keep identified witnesses separated, and their common security classification. It was this fortuitous circumstance coupled with Harrison's hope for a sentence reduction, not the Government's instruction or agreement, that led Harrison to advise his lawyer and the Government that Ware had shared pertinent information about his case. \"[T]he Sixth Amendment 'does not protect a defendant against private individuals who wish to profit at his expense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790510\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/882/68/#p91\">\n    882 N.W.2d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.
