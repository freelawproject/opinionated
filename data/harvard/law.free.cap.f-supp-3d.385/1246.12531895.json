Upon consideration of all relevant filings, case law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant discharged her from employment in May 2016 because of her gender and age, in violation of Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), and the Florida Civil Rights Act (\"FCRA\"). (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 1). Plaintiff also alleges that she was subjected to unlawful sexual harassment and age harassment in violation of Title VII, the ADEA, and the FCRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is a non-profit, member-owned Generation and Transmission rural electric cooperative. (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 1). Plaintiff began her employment with Defendant in\n   February 1997 as a programmer, initially, and became a systems programmer supporting the mainframe computer in 1999. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 2). Plaintiff's job duties encompassed work with hardware and software on a mainframe-based computer system prior to Defendant's transition to a server-based environment. The Parties dispute Plaintiff's job duties after the mainframe was decommissioned. (Dkt. 8 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Julian Leon (\"Leon\") was originally Defendant's Manager of Technical Support who served as Plaintiff's direct supervisor. (Dkt. 43 at 6). After Leon's retirement in July 2011, through the time of Plaintiff's discharge, Rick Miller (\"Miller\") served as Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, reporting to Steve Saunders (\"Saunders\"), the Director of Information Technology. (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 2). In addition to Plaintiff, Miller also supervised the other employees who made up the Technical Support area, which included John Phillips, Will Simmons, Rishi Maharaj, and Michael Estevens. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 2012 through March 2014, Defendant began the process of transitioning from its mainframe computing environment to a PC and server-based computing environment. (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 3). During this time, Defendant transitioned all of its applications and functions from the mainframe to PCs and servers, culminating in the ultimate shutdown and decommissioning of Defendant's mainframe on March 13, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Defendant began the transition to a PC server-based computing environment, Plaintiff had no experience working in that environment. Rather, her expertise \"was on the mainframe side, not the server side,\" and she \"didn't have any real experience with the server system.\" (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 4). Plaintiff's educational background and training also focused exclusively on mainframe responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Other employees in the department had experience with server-based computing. (Dkts. 25 \u00b6 8; 35 \u00b6 9). Plaintiff testified that she was not aware of anyone else working for the Defendant whose experience was mainframe-based and who would need to acquire a new skill after the transition. (Dkt. 27 at 81). Plaintiff testified that no one specifically mentioned that her job would be eliminated, but that she was concerned that her position may be eliminated or that she would be laid off after the mainframe transition because what she had been doing \"was no longer going to be continuing in that format[.]\" (Dkt. 27 at 79-80). Plaintiff testified that she began to look for other jobs at the time, both internally and externally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiff was assigned a number of non-mainframe responsibilities to assist Plaintiff in gaining a working knowledge and expertise in a PC server-based environment. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 12). Specifically, Miller assigned Plaintiff to assist John Phillips with Defendant's IT hotline, which employees could call to get help on various computing issues, and to shadow John Valles on weekly trips to assist employees at the Defendant's power plant with computer issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Miller also approved Plaintiff's request for a week-long course on PC servers in 2012 and directed Plaintiff to take a week-long Microsoft training course on a specified product in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff attended two trainings in 2013, on Microsoft and Windows products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiff also sought courses to take outside of work in an effort to further improve her server skills and requested that Defendant purchase a training book for her, which Defendant did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant required each employee complete at least twenty hours of mandatory job-related training during Plaintiff's employment. (Dkts. 38 at 61; 42 at 15). Defendant\n   asserts that despite its efforts and patience, Plaintiff was unable to make a successful transition from the mainframe environment to the PC-server based environment. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 16). Defendant offers an internal list of department responsibilities to illustrate that Plaintiff was unable to assume the responsibility levels nearly equal to those of her co-workers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff disputes the efficacy of these so-called trainings and Defendant's characterization of trainings as unsuccessful. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Additionally, Plaintiff challenges the accuracy of Defendant's chart as an attempt by Defendant to minimize Plaintiff's responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff further contends that she was denied proper training and instruction to complete assigned tasks. (Dkt. 1 \u00b6 39). Specifically, Plaintiff argues that she was excluded from attending weekly management meetings by a co-worker in 2012, excluded from a vendor presentation for tech services, and was assigned clerical tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's Annual Performance Evaluations during the relevant time period range from a 4, exceeds expectations, to a 2, meets expectations. (Dkt. 27-1). In 2011, Plaintiff received a 4, exceeds expectations, and commented on her evaluation that she felt the review did not adequately represent her efforts through the past year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Plaintiff's 2012 evaluation reflects a 2.16, meets expectations; her 2013 review shows a 2.37, meets expectations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-61. In 2014, Plaintiff initially received an overall rating of 1.57, does not meet expectations, which Miller rounded up to a 2.0, meets expectations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. Miller's comments on Plaintiff's 2014 review note that Plaintiff attended class to prepare for and complete the installation of Microsoft System Center Service Desk Change Control software, but was ultimately unable to install the product, despite spending nearly six months on the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contests whether the substance of the training was sufficient to instruct her to complete the project but admits that she attended the training and spent a significant amount of time on the project. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6 17). Plaintiff comments in her 2014 review that she was using her own resources to buy her own books and research classes in an effort to make a successful transition from the mainframe environment to a server-based environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Plaintiff's 2014 review, Miller provided Plaintiff with a Performance Improvement Task Plan to help improve her performance and a report detailing her progress on these tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-75. The progress report notes that Plaintiff did \"well\" on two tasks, was \"running out of time\" on one task and that Miller \"would like to see more effort in troubleshooting by logging on each night to watch the jobs run\" on a third project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75. In 2015, Plaintiff received an overall performance evaluation of 3.2, meets expectations. (Dkt. 1 Ex. E). Miller commented on the 2015 review that Plaintiff accomplished most of her goals with efficiency and that Plaintiff's initial support of the JAMS technology system was not meeting expectations and had to be reassigned, but that Plaintiff was performing better after the reassignment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Miller issued a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") to Plaintiff on Mach 7, 2016 as a \"last ditch effort\" for Plaintiff. (Dkt. 36 at 75). Plaintiff, Miller, and Kelly Faircloth (\"Faircloth\"), a human resources representative of Defendant, met to discuss the PIP. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6 20). This was Plaintiff's first meeting with Faircloth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The PIP identified areas of concern, improvement goals, recourse, expectations, and progress checkpoints. (Dkt. 27-1 at 87-89). Moreover, the PIP established that the failure to meet or exceed identified expectations would result in further disciplinary\n   action, up to and including termination. The PIP explicitly stated that if there was no demonstrated, significant improvement indicating that the expectations and goals will be met, employment could be terminated prior to completion of the 90-day period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The PIP assigned five performance standards, including two specific projects, which Plaintiff was required to accomplish in order to demonstrate progress towards the achievement of Plaintiff's identified goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   First, Plaintiff needed to take over the Printer project from John Phillips and upgrade printer services with minimal assistance from other team members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Plaintiff needed to get the Help site for SharePoint forms operational with updated information for each form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88. Defendant asserts that it became evident, shortly after the PIP was issued to Plaintiff, that Plaintiff was relying too heavily on a co-worker to complete her responsibilities and was failing to make any appreciable progress on her PIP tasks. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 21-22). Plaintiff disputes this claim and presents conflicting evidence that Miller instructed Plaintiff to seek assistance from employees and that she did make appreciable progress with the Printer project. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Plaintiff does not dispute that the project was not yet complete at the time of her discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Defendant discharged Plaintiff on May 10, 2016, 64 days into the 90-day PIP review period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   William Barfied, a male younger than 40, was hired by Defendant after Plaintiff's discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During Plaintiff's employment, Defendant maintained a policy prohibiting sexual and age-related harassment and providing a reporting procedure for any employee who feels that he or she has been subjected to unwanted harassment. (Dkt. 34 \u00b6 5). The policy specifically prohibits sexual and age-related harassment, including such inappropriate conduct as off-color jokes, sexual comments, offensive age-based comments, and the like.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy also states that any employee who feels that he or she has been subjected to unlawful harassment \"should report the incident immediately to his or her immediate supervisor and to Human Resources, or any other member of management.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy continues that if the immediate supervisor is involved in the activity, the violation should be promptly reported to Human Resources, or any other member of management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant asserts that a training was held for all employees in 2014 and 2015, as part of a mandatory Business Ethics course which addressed the Company's policy prohibiting unlawful harassment and complaint-reporting procedures. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 25). Plaintiff admits that Defendant maintained and disclosed its anti-harassment policy as described but contends that Defendant mischaracterizes the Business Ethics course as a comprehensive training for the anti-harassment policy. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff claims that after Miller became her supervisor in July 2011, he treated her differently, talked down to her, and used foul language directed specifically at Plaintiff when he was upset. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 26). Plaintiff alleges that Miller made inappropriate age-related comments, such as \"you're old enough to remember that,\" which demonstrated that Miller was \"trying to push [her] out the door.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 35 \u00b6 32. Specifically, Plaintiff testified that shortly after Leon left and Miller became her manager, during a discussion about the future of the department between her and Miller, Miller said that he \"dreaded teaching somebody like me, my age, with no experience in the servers.\" (Dkt. 27 at 77-78). Plaintiff testified that Miller asked her several questions about retirement including: when she planned to retire, how\n   her 401(k) was allocated, and what her plans after working for Defendant entailed. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 32). Additionally, Plaintiff claims that Miller specifically lashed out at her and that he would curse and yell at her for trivial matters. (Dkt. 35-2 \u00b6 21). Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Miller would say \"Shit, why the hell doesn't this work?\" or \"what the 'F' are you doing?\" to her and that he did not curse at other employees the same way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff testified that Miller would direct sexually-laced comments towards Plaintiff when they were alone and this behavior was \"ongoing,\" and she testified, contradictorily, that it occurred \"once a week. It might be a couple of times over two, three weeks.\" (Dkt. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 28-30). Plaintiff testified that once, in response to Plaintiff's concern that she was having difficulty enlisting the assistance of other managers in updating the servers, Miller used the words \"pussy\" and \"tits,\" to say that she had \"the right equipment\" to secure assistance. (Dkts. 25 \u00b6 28; 27 at 159-86). Plaintiff also testified that Miller would make crude comments in her presence about \"getting his wife drunk and having his way with her\" and that he was \"heading to the bathroom to take care of himself.\" (Dkt. 21 \u00b6 30; Dkts. 27-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January 2012, Plaintiff reported an offensive joke with foul language and questionable humor, made by Miller, to Saunders. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 29). According to Plaintiff, Miller asked \"what do baby bears and women from Tennessee have in common,\" to which he replied, \"they both suck their paws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Saunders testified that after the report from Plaintiff he met with Miller to discuss the comment, asked Miller to apologize, and that Miller apologized to Plaintiff for the comment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Saunders further testified that he wrote himself a handwritten note detailing the incident and his response, but he conceded that no formal action was taken against Miller, nor was Human Resources informed of the incident. (Dkts. 37 at 50-51, 37-2). Plaintiff testified that the inappropriate language from Miller stopped immediately following her conversation with Saunders, but inappropriate comments by Miller resumed sometime later. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she reported Miller's use of profanity and foul language to Julian Leon while Leon was still the supervisor and she and Miller were co workers. (Dkt. 35 \u00b6 28). Leon testified that Plaintiff approached him about Miller's use of profanity in her presence and that he spoke with Miller and requested he refrain from the use of profanity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff testified that she did not report the discriminatory behavior by Miller beyond these initial conversations with Leon and Saunders because \"nothing changed\" when she previously reported Miller's conduct to Leon and Saunders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. Plaintiff also testified that she did not report this behavior because she had concerns about being terminated due to Defendant's discriminatory culture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Plaintiff testified that during a staff meeting in April 2012, Saunders made an inappropriate comment about choosing his seat at a baseball game based on the best view of women in the stadium. (Dkt. 25 \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 19, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Dual Charge of Discrimination against Defendant with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Florida Commission on Human Relations, charging Defendant with discrimination based on sex and age. The EEOC Tampa Director issued Plaintiff a Notice of Rights dated September 19, 2016, and Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on December 14, 2016. Plaintiff alleges six counts: Count I, Gender discrimination in violation of Title VII (Disparate Treatment); Count II, Gender discrimination in violation of Title VII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Harassment - Hostile Work Environment); Count III, Age discrimination in violation of the ADEA (Disparate Treatment); Count IV, Age discrimination in violation of the ADEA (Harassment - Hostile Work Environment); Count V, Gender discrimination in violation of the FCRA; and Count VI, Age discrimination in violation of FCRA. (Dkt. 1). Defendant has moved for summary judgment as to all counts. (Dkt. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that summary judgment is proper with respect to Plaintiff's gender and age discriminatory discharge claims because Plaintiff was not qualified to meet job performance expectations after Defendant transitioned from a mainframe computing environment to an environment based on PCs and servers. (Dkt. 25 at 1-2). Secondly, Defendant contends summary judgment is appropriate as to Plaintiff's allegations of unlawful harassment based on her gender and age because, even if Plaintiff's allegations are true, Plaintiff was not subjected to sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct and Defendant took sufficient, prompt remedial action in response to Plaintiff's report of Miller's conduct. Each claim is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

These individuals are John Phillips (\"Phillips\") and Rishi Maharaj (\"Maharaj\"). (Dkt. 35 at 18). Plaintiff asserts that her comparators were treated more favorably because they were never discouraged from collaborating with others and because only Plaintiff was placed on a PIP and terminated for performance reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-24. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that although both she and Phillips received an overall final performance evaluation rating of 3, meets expectations, for the 2014-2015 appraisal period, only Plaintiff was subsequently placed on a PIP and terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Phillips was given the opportunity to demonstrate improvement and was not subject to discipline despite a health problem that allegedly interfered with his ability complete his daily tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Plaintiff contends that Maharaj was not disciplined despite his flex work schedule, alleged attendance issues, and occasional failed jobs related to the JAMS servers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that Phillips is not a proper comparator because his performance-related conduct was attributable to a medical issue that was resolved once addressed by an accommodation required by\n   the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Dkt. 48 at 10). Defendant argues that Maharaj is not an adequate comparator because he did not suffer from the same performance deficiencies and that Plaintiff's discharge was not related to attendance. (Dkts. 25 at 16, 48 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit instructs that for comparators to be used to demonstrate pretext, they must be nearly identical, particularly with respect to job descriptions and material facts.\n   <em>\n    Trask v.

Here, the evidence demonstrates that the proffered comparators performed job responsibilities dissimilar from Plaintiff's job duties and both comparators came from markedly different educational and technological backgrounds. For example, Plaintiff was at one point assigned to shadow Phillips to learn to assist with his helpdesk duties, in addition to her other responsibilities. Although Phillips and Plaintiff shared the same technical job title of senior systems administrator, Phillips's job responsibilities were never dependent on the mainframe environment and did not change after the transition to the server. (Dkt. 27 at 84). Plaintiff testified that everyone's title in the department changed to Senior Systems Administrator in 2013 because they were not considered programmers any longer. (Dkt. 27 at 124). Likewise, Maharaj's entire job description and educational and professional experience was on PCs and servers; thus, he was not required to learn how to operate in an entirely new computing environment. Plaintiff does not point to any evidence that Maharaj was disciplined or counseled based on his failures in regard to any such transition. Further, Plaintiff specifically testified that she was not aware of anyone else working for the Defendant whose experience was mainframe-based and who would need to acquire a new skill. (Dkt. 27 at 81). Thus, neither Maharaj nor Phillips is an adequate comparator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because Plaintiff does not proffer adequate comparators or objective evidence that she could perform Defendant's job expectations, Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendant's reason for her termination is pretext for discrimination.

Defendant also asserts that courts have consistently found far more egregious facts warrant summary judgment in an employer's favor. In response, Plaintiff alleges that she was subject to daily hostility by Miller who, \"made a point of revealing his discriminatory motivation on numerous occasions and thus confirmed that his pattern of overall misconduct was based on [Plaintiff]'s age and gender.\" (Dkt. 35 at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To establish a hostile work environment claim, an \"employee must present concrete evidence in the form of specific facts, not just conclusory allegations and assertions.\"\n   <em>\n    Godoy v. Habersham County\n   </em>\n   , 211 Fed. App'x. 850, 854 (11th Cir. 2006). Plaintiff does not claim that Miller's conduct was physically threatening but asserts that Miller's \"profanity laced tirades directed at Plaintiff were solely due to her age and gender.\" (Dkt. 35 at 16). However, Plaintiff cites fewer than ten specific instances of conduct over a nearly five-year period. Such conduct is not sufficiently frequent to support a claim under prevailing law. Moreover, Miller's comments, though boorish and unacceptable, do not rise to the level of severity required to sustain a hostile work environment claim under prevailing standards. Plaintiff articulates a few specific remarks: the inappropriate Tennessee joke, at least one comment about Plaintiff's physical attributes, comments about his marital sex life, a perceived comment/innuendo about masturbation in the workplace restroom, and Miller's dread of training Plaintiff. Beyond those remarks, Plaintiff alleges the general use of profanity and discriminatory language by Miller. The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that profanity falls \"under the rubric of general vulgarity that Title VII does not regulate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. City of Aventura\n   </em>\n   , 383 Fed. App'x. 915, 918 (11th Cir. 2010). As Defendant notes, conduct significantly more severe than that at issue here has been deemed insufficient to establish a hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1738102\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/195/1238/#p1246\">\n    195 F.3d at 1247-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Defendant employs the so-called\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

(Dkt. 25 at 18-19). The Court does not reach the merits of this defense because the Court does not find Miller's conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to be actionable. Accordingly, summary judgment is proper as to Plaintiffs hostile work environment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
