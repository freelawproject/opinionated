Plaintiffs sue to prevent construction of the OPC on a specific site within Jackson Park. [91] \u00b6 1. Following this Court's ruling on Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, [92], the parties completed full discovery and filed cross-motions for summary judgment, [112] [122]. On June 11, 2019, this Court held a hearing, and heard oral argument only on those issues and counts which required consideration beyond the briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This order addresses the merits of the case. In doing so, this Court faces the same challenge presented to the Illinois Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Paepcke v.

As they put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   [T]his court is fully aware of the fact that the issues presented in this case illustrate the classic struggle between those members of the public who would preserve our parks and open lands in their pristine purity and those charged with administrative responsibilities who, under the pressures of the changing needs of an increasingly complex society, find it necessary, in good faith and for the public good, to encroach to some extent upon lands heretofore considered inviolate to change. The resolution of this conflict in any given case is for the legislature and not the courts. The courts can serve only as an instrument of determining legislative intent as evidenced by existing legislation measured against constitutional limitations. In this process the courts must deal with legislation as enacted and not with speculative considerations of legislative wisdom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20N.E.2d%2011\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20N.E.2d%2011\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Selecting the OPC Site\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2014, the Barack Obama Foundation (Foundation) initiated a search for the future site of the OPC. [112-1] \u00b6 4. Both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) proposed potential locations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19. UIC proposed two sites, generally located at: (1) the North Lawndale neighborhood; and (2) the east end of the school's campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19; [126-2] at 105098. The University of Chicago proposed three sites, generally located at: (1) the South Shore Cultural Center\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) Jackson Park; and (3) Washington Park. [112-1] \u00b6 5; [126-2] at 105098. At this time, the Park District owned both the Jackson Park and Washington Park parkland identified in the University of Chicago's proposal. [126-2] at 105098.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to these sites, nine entities from several locations throughout the country submitted proposals for the OPC, resulting in a total of 14 potential sites. [112-1] \u00b6 25. The Foundation performed an analysis of the proposals from all submitting entities, evaluating the sites based upon the following criteria:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Project Site and Access: desirability of site, surrounding community, control of site, local accessibility, global accessibility\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Project Execution: education impact, tourism impact, economic development impact, enhancements to the physical environment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Community Engagement: engagement plan, quality/breadth of partners, means of engagement\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Indications of Support: partnership structure, alignment of mission, financial capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578315,12701999\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; [117-5] at 5. The Foundation assigned numerical scores to each site based upon the above evaluation criteria, and ranked the sites based upon these scores. [112-1] \u00b6 26; [117-5] at 8-9. The Washington Park Site received the highest score at 122 out of 150; the Jackson Park site received the second highest score at 121 out of 150; and the UIC's proposed locations received a combined score of 120 out of 150, putting it in third place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 29, 2016, the Foundation issued a press release announcing that it chose Jackson Park as the OPC site.

Site Location\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The site selected for the OPC within Jackson Park comprises 19.3 acres, or 3.5 percent of the 551.52 acres comprising Jackson Park. [124] \u00b6 6. It lies on the western edge of Jackson Park and includes existing parkland bounded by South Stony Island Avenue to the west, East Midway Plaisance Drive North to the north, South Cornell Drive to the east, and South 62nd Street to the south.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The OPC site also includes land within the park that currently exists as city streets: the portion of East Midway Plaisance Drive North between Stony Island Avenue and South\n   Cornell Drive, and a portion of South Cornell Drive between East Midway Plaisance Drive South and East Hayes Drive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As part of the OPC construction, these street portions would be closed and removed \"to restore\" the landscape's connection to the Lagoon and Lake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The site lies approximately half a mile from Lake Michigan, separated by: (1) six-lane Cornell Drive; (2) the lagoons and Wooded Island of Jackson Park; (3) Jackson Park's golf driving range and other grounds; (4) Lake Shore Drive; and (5) a pedestrian and bike path.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. It sits entirely above ground, although the parties dispute whether the site formerly sat beneath Lake Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; [136] \u00b6 9 (Plaintiffs' response).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Site Components\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The OPC will consist of a campus containing open green space, a plaza, and four buildings: (1) the Museum Building; (2) the Forum Building; (3) a Library Building; and (4) a Program, Athletic, and Activity Center. [124] \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26. It will also include an underground parking garage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [91] \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Museum will comprise the OPC's principal building and \"central mission.\" [124] \u00b6 24. It seeks to \"tell the stories of the first African American President and First Lady of the United States, their connection to Chicago, and the individuals, communities, and social currents that shaped their local and national journey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. In doing so, the Museum will feature artifacts and records from President Obama's presidency, including items on loan from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; [125-5] (Exhibit D, Recital J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Forum Building will contain collaboration and creative spaces, including an auditorium, meeting rooms, recording and broadcasting studios, and a winter garden and restaurant. [124] \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Library Building will include a branch of the Chicago Public Library and a President's Reading Room, featuring curated collections and displays of archival material, including digital access to Obama\n   Administration records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; [125-5] (Exhibit D, (Sub) Exhibit \"C\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Program, Athletic, and Activity Center will host public programs such as \"presentations, events, athletics, and recreation.\" [124] \u00b6 29; [125-5] (Exhibit D, (Sub) Exhibit \"C\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The OPC's green space will include features such as: (1) play areas for children;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) \"contemplative spaces for young and old\"; (3) a sledding hill; (4) a sloped lawn for picnicking, recreation and community and special events; (5) walking paths; and (6) a nature walk along the lagoon. [124] \u00b6 30. The Foundation will also \"preserve and enhance\" the existing Women's Garden and Lawn, keeping it open and available as green space.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Site Accessibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to the Use Agreement between the City and Foundation, discussed in detail below, the OPC buildings must \"be open to the public at a minimum in a manner substantially consistent with the manner in which other Museums in the Parks are open to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26; [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7 6.2(a)(i)). All other portions of the OPC, such as the green space, must remain open to the public during regular Park District hours. [124] \u00b6 30; [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7 6.2(a)(ii)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The OPC will charge fees for entry into the Museum and for the parking garage. [112-1] \u00b6 43. It will, however, provide free public access to many interior spaces within the OPC, including portions of the garden and plaza levels in the Museum Building and the top floor of the Museum Building. [124] \u00b6 26. Moreover, the Foundation must operate the OPC in accordance with the free admission requirements of Illinois' Park District Aquarium and Museum Act, which mandates free admission to all Illinois residents at least 52 days out of the year and to all Illinois school children accompanied by a teacher.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The admission fee policy for members of the public who are City residents, or low-income individuals and their families participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or equivalent program), must also be \"substantially consistent with comparable general admission fee policies\" for such individuals maintained by \"other Museums in the Park.\" [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7 6.10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. OPC Municipal Approval Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Jackson Park's Creation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 1869, the General Assembly passed \"An Act to Provide for the Location and Maintenance of a Park for the Towns of South Chicago, Hyde Park and Lake\" (1869 Act). [112-1] \u00b6 17; Private Laws, 1869, vol. 1, p. 358. The statute provided for the formation of a board of public park commissioners to be known as the \"South Park Commissioners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Act authorized these commissioners to select certain lands, which, when acquired by said commissioners, \"shall be held, managed and controlled by them and their successors, as a public park, for the recreation, health and benefit of the public, and free to all persons forever.\" Private Laws, 1869, vol. 1, p. 360. Pursuant to this authority, the commissioners acquired the land now known as Jackson Park. [112-1] \u00b6 17; [139] \u00b6 17 (Defendants' response). The Illinois Legislature enacted the Park District Consolidation Act in 1934, which consolidated the existing park districts, including the South Park District, into the Chicago Park District. 70 ILCS 1505/1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Transfer From the Park District to the City\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In early January of 2015-before the Jackson Park site selection-the Foundation expressed \"concerns regarding the City's lack of control\" over the proposed\n   Jackson and Washington Park sites and indicated that \"consolidating ownership of the sites and local decision-making authority in the City was a prerequisite to a successful bid.\" [126-2] at 105098-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Subsequently, in February 2015-in an open meeting during which members of the public spoke and submitted written comments-the Park District's Board of Commissioners voted to approve the transfer of \"approximately 20 acres of property\" located in Washington Park or Jackson Park to the City. [124] \u00b6 11; [125-4] at 4, 11. Following this meeting, the OPC site's boundaries within Jackson Park shifted to the north and east. [124] \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In February 2018, after a public meeting, the Board of Commissioners confirmed authority to transfer the reconfigured site to the City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In March 2015, the City Council enacted an ordinance \"authorizing the execution of an intergovernmental agreement between the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District necessary to acquire selected sites in order to facilitate the location, development, construction and operation\" of the OPC. [124] \u00b6 12; [126-2] at 105096. In October 2018, following the Jackson Park selection, the City Council passed an ordinance finding it \"useful, desirable, necessary and convenient that the City acquire the OPC site from the Park District\" for the \"public purpose\" of constructing and operating the OPC. [124] \u00b6 12; [125-5] at 85886 \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. City Council Approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In January 2018, the Foundation applied to the City for a zoning amendment to build the OPC on the Jackson Park site as a \"planned development\"-a designation required for certain institutional and campus-oriented projects. [124] \u00b6 13; [126-3]. The Foundation also applied for approval under the City's Lake Michigan and Chicago Lakefront Protection Ordinance (LPO). [124] \u00b6 13. The City's Department of Planning and Development (DPD) subsequently reviewed both applications and prepared a report (DPD Study) as required by the City's Municipal Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DPD Study recommended approving both applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On May 17, 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission-which reviews proposals involving planned developments and the Lakefront Protection Ordinance within the City-held a public hearing on the Foundation's application for a planned development zoning amendment and for approval under the LPO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; [126-5]. Representatives from the City and the Foundation testified at the hearing, and over 75 members of the public commented on the proposals. [124] \u00b6 14. The presentation from DPD staff included a slideshow depicting various renderings of the OPC proposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the conclusion of this hearing, the Plan Commission found that the OPC project conformed with the LPO and approved the Foundation's application under the LPO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. In doing so, the Plan Commission adopted the DPD Study as its findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the City's Municipal Code, the Plan Commission serves as the final decisionmaker as to whether a project complies with the Lakefront Plan of Chicago and the purposes of the LPO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Municipal Code of Chicago (MCC) \u00a7 16-4-100(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Also at the May 17 hearing, the Plan Commission recommended approval of the Foundation's application for a zoning amendment. [124] \u00b6 16. Again, the Plan Commission adopted the DPD Study as the Commission's own findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the City's Municipal Code, after considering a zoning amendment application, the Plan Commission must refer the application to the City Council, which serves as the final decisionmaker on the amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; MCC \u00a7 17-13-0607.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, on May 22, 2018, the City Council's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards held a public hearing to consider the zoning amendment. [124] \u00b6 17. Following testimony from City and Foundation representatives and public comments, the Committee voted to recommend approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, the full City Council approved the amendment, enacting an ordinance that authorized construction of the OPC as a Planned Development; this ordinance controls the size and layout of the OPC's buildings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In October 2018, the City Council considered and approved two additional ordinances for the OPC project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. First, it considered the Operating Ordinance, which allows the City to accept title to the Jackson Park site from the Park District and to enter into agreements with the Foundation governing the Foundation's use of the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 11, 2018, the City Council's Committee on Housing and Real Estate held a public hearing on the Operating Ordinance, during which City and Foundation representatives testified about the ordinance and members of the public commented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Committee voted unanimously to recommend adopting the Operating Ordinance, and the full City Council unanimously approved it on October 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the City Council considered an ordinance authorizing the City to vacate portions of East Midway Plaisance Drive South and Cornell Drive within Jackson Park for conversion into parkland as part of the OPC site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. On October 25, 2018 the City Council's Committee on Transportation and Public Way held a public hearing on the ordinance, during which City and Foundation representatives again testified, and members of the public commented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Committee voted unanimously to recommend adopting the ordinance, and the full City Council unanimously approved it on October 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. The Use Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   One of the agreements authorized by the Operating Ordinance includes the Use Agreement, which sets out the terms by which the Foundation may use Jackson Park for the OPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; [125-5] (Exhibit D). The Use Agreement does not transfer ownership of the OPC site, nor does it lease the site to the Foundation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   [125-5] (Exhibit D); [112-1] \u00b6 46. Rather, section 2.1 of the Use Agreement provides the Foundation with the following rights with respect to the OPC site for a 99-year term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (a) the right to construct and install the Project Improvements\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (including the Presidential Center);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (b) the right to occupy, use, maintain, operate and alter the Presidential Center Architectural Spaces\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and\n   (c) the right to use, maintain, operate and alter the Presidential Center Green Space and Green Space.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Foundation will construct the OPC's buildings at its own expense and upon completion, transfer ownership of the buildings and other site improvements to the City at no charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 4.4; [124] \u00b6 34.

OPC Studies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The City did not perform a comparative analysis of the economic or other community impact on the City as a result of building the OPC at one particular location versus another. [112-1] \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Rather, the DPD Study looked at the Jackson Park site specifically, while studies performed by private institutions analyzed the impact of generally placing the OPC in Chicago and the State of Illinois. [124] \u00b6\u00b6 13, 55-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The DPD Study first looked at the environmental and community impact of placing OPC on Jackson Park.

Specifically, it found that by closing certain streets within Jackson Park, and by expanding or reconfiguring other streets in and around Jackson Park, the OPC would, for example: (1) improve access by pedestrians through the park, across the lagoons to the lake,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39; (2) offer unimpeded pedestrian and bike access to the Museum of Science and Industry from the South Side,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40; (3) replace some of the land currently occupied by Cornell Drive with a \"restful Woodland Walk,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41; (4) create new pedestrian access points and ADA compliant design features,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42; and (5) reduce air and noise pollution, improve existing bird habitats, and attract new wildlife to the OPC site area,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. In total, the DPD Study found that the roadway work conducted in connection with the OPC will create a net gain of an additional 4.7 acres of publicly available park space throughout Jackson Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The DPD Study also addressed the OPC's economic benefits.

Plaintiffs fail to note, however, that the map to which they site in the ISAS report documents the \"Late Pleistocene and early Holocene lake levels.\" [136-3] at 10. In other words, Plaintiffs invite this Court to find that because the OPC site may have been submerged approximately 11,000 years ago, it constitutes \"formerly submerged\" land for purposes of the public trust doctrine. [136-3] at 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Respectfully, this Court declines Plaintiffs' invitation.

But unlike in\n   <em>\n    Paepcke\n   </em>\n   , no state authorizing legislation existed from which the court could infer sufficient legislative intent. As such, the court analyzed the Jackson Park driving range according to the five Wisconsin factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   The property will still be controlled by the Park District. The mere fact that a fee is charged for the use of special facilities does not as such render the facility closed to the public, provided such fees are reasonable for the general population of the community. In this respect, we note nothing in the record to indicate the charges were unreasonable. Moreover, the designation of 11 acres as a driving range is small compared to the approximately 570 total acres in Jackson Park, and the public uses of the original area have not been destroyed or greatly impaired since picnicking, casual play activities, jogging, and meadow bird nesting are still possible elsewhere in the park. Finally, due to the small amount of land taken up by the driving range relative to total park acreage, the disappointment of those wanting to use the area for former purposes is likely to be slight - particularly since the range now offers the same convenience to south area public which has been provided in the north area for many years in Lincoln Park.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578315,12701999\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Ill.%20Dec.%20119\">\n    51 Ill.Dec. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20N.E.2d%20533\">\n    420 N.E.2d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Although this Court need not apply the Wisconsin factors here, both parties discuss them here in relation to the OPC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [137] at 4; [141] at 4. As such, this Court finds, as did the\n   <em>\n    Paepcke\n   </em>\n   court, that they provide helpful guidance under the public trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   An analysis of the OPC under the Wisconsin factors requires the same result as in\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   . If the Foundation ceases to use the OPC for its permitted purposes under the Use Agreement, the City may terminate the Agreement. [124] \u00b6 21; [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7\u00a7 6.1, 16.2). Only a portion of the OPC will require an entrance fee, and the Use Agreement and Museum Act require: (1) free admission to all Illinois residents at least 52 days out of the year; (2) free admission for Illinois school children accompanied by a teacher; and (3) an\n   admission fee policy for City residents and certain low-income individuals \"substantially comparable\" to those maintained by other museums in Jackson Park. [124] \u00b6 37; [125-5] (Exhibit D, \u00a7 6.10). The OPC will comprise only 19.3 acres, or 3.5 percent of Jackson Park's total 551.52 acres. [124] \u00b6 6. As in\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   , the site will not destroy or greatly impair the land's original use; activities such as picnicking, jogging, and meadow bird nesting will not only be accessible in other areas of the park, but also within certain parts of the OPC site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 47. And here, too, the small amount of land taken up by the OPC site relative to total park acreage means the disappointment of those wanting to use the area for former purposes remains slight, particularly given: (1) the OPC's proposed green space areas; and (2) that the Museum of Science and Industry already exists within the park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds that the OPC satisfies the Wisconsin factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. Plaintiffs' Alternative Legal Theories Fail\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiffs offer two alternative public trust theories in support of their motion for summary judgment: (1) a comparative, benefit-maximization analysis demonstrates that the choice to locate the OPC in Jackson Park constitutes an \"arbitrary\" or \"unreasonable\" legislative decision; and (2) the Foundation will not pay \"fair market value\" for use of the OPC site. [120-1] at 17-28. Neither theory exists under Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue that the City failed to perform an analysis of whether locating the OPC on public trust park land \"provides any benefit whatsoever over locating the Presidential Center on non-public trust property,\" and thus that the decision to locate the OPC within Jackson Park remains \"arbitrary\" and unreasonable.\" [120-1] at 17-20. In other words, Plaintiffs dispute whether Jackson Park is \"the best\" location for the OPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 18. But Plaintiffs fail to cite to any instance in the public trust jurisprudence in which courts have required government entities to pick \"the best\" location, much less require courts to review such assessments\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . Quite simply, Illinois law imposes no obligation upon this Court to revisit the cost-benefit assessments of state and local lawmakers or otherwise sift through impact studies on its own to determine whether the UIC proposed sites, Washington Park, or Jackson Park constitutes the best location for the OPC.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    River Park v.

Rather, as is discussed above, courts need only look to the relevant authorizing legislation and cited public benefits for a given project within the lawmakers' own analysis; in other words, \"value dependent assessment[s] of the best use of the property\" are \"highly subjective\" and \"irrelevant to an analysis of the propriety of a grant of public land.\"\n   <em>\n    Lake Michigan Fed'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7388570\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/742/441/#p444\">\n    742 F. Supp. at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Foundation's $ 10.00 payment, which forms part of its consideration for the Use Agreement, [125-5] (Exhibit D, Art. III), violates the public trust doctrine based upon a \"line of cases involving Mississippi's treatment of public trust property known as 'sixteenth section lands.' \" [120-1] at 24. According to Plaintiffs, these cases require the City to charge a \"reasonable rent\" with due regard\" for leases of public trust property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-28. This theory is also unavailing because, in short, Illinois law controls this case. Plaintiffs do not offer any Illinois court that has cited to Plaintiffs' line of Mississippi cases or adopted those cases' reasoning or analysis. Accordingly,\n   without addressing the possible implications of Mississippi's approach here, this Court declines to ignore controlling Illinois law in favor of an unprecedented rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Insolia v.

This Court's prior motion to dismiss opinion found that Plaintiffs failed to establish standing based upon their aesthetic or environmental harm theory, but found that Plaintiffs established standing based upon the public trust doctrine. [92] at 11-14. Because Defendants' 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss did not challenge Plaintiffs' Takings Clause theory based upon subject matter jurisdiction, this Court did not consider it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.

Plaintiffs' Public Trust Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   A procedural due process claim requires: (1) a cognizable property interest; (2) a deprivation of that interest; and (3) inadequate process.\n   <em>\n    Price v.

Here, Plaintiffs' public trust due process theory fails for two reasons. First, the parties spend considerable time disputing whether, under the public trust doctrine, Plaintiffs hold a sufficient property interest in the Jackson Park site to satisfy a procedural due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [120-1] at 28-34; [123-1] at 31-34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even assuming Plaintiffs hold a cognizable property interest, Plaintiffs' due process claim fails because they fail to demonstrate a deprivation of that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In particular, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants deprived them of adequate process because the \"Illinois legislature has not authorized the transactions at issue between the Park District, the City and the Foundation, nor has the Illinois legislature released the restriction on the Jackson Park Site.\" [120-1] at 28. But, as discussed in detail above with respect to Plaintiffs' public trust claim under\n   <em>\n    Paepcke\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly-through the Museum Act-has authorized the OPC; the Museum Act need not refer specifically to the alienation or disposition of the Jackson Park site itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paepcke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20N.E.2d%2011\">\n    263 N.E.2d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, this Court has already determined that neither the OPC nor the Museum Act violates the 1869 Act's restriction upon public parkland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Furlong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20N.E.%20510\">\n    151 N.E. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   511 ;\n   <em>\n    Clement v.

Thus, Plaintiffs fail to establish a deprivation of any interest under their procedural due process claim.

[91] \u00b6 99. First, Plaintiffs make the astounding argument that the OPC violates the Museum Act because it contains outdoor green spaces, in addition to buildings. [120-1] at 34. Second, Plaintiffs argue that\n   because the City itself will not use the OPC site for the term of the Use Agreement, the Park District's transfer of land violates the Illinois Property Transfer Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. Defendants argue that a plain reading of the relevant statutes dispels Plaintiffs' claim. [123] at 37-39. This Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Museum Act Authorizes the OPC's Green Space\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs' first theory proceeds in two parts, as follows. The Museum Act contains two provisions. The first states that the corporate authorities of cities and park districts have authorization to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   purchase, erect, and maintain within any such public park or parks\n   <em>\n    edifices\n   </em>\n   to be used as aquariums or as museums of art, industry, science, or natural or other history, including presidential libraries, centers, and museums, such aquariums and museums consisting of all facilities for their collections, exhibitions, programming, and associated initiatives \u2026\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   70 ILCS 1290/1 (emphasis added). In the same sentence, the Act clarifies that cities and park districts may also contract with directors or trustees relative to the building and operation \"of such aquarium or museum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The second sentence then begins:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a city or park district may enter into a lease for an initial term not to exceed 99 years, subject to renewal, allowing a corporation or society as hereinabove described to erect, enlarge, ornament, build, rebuild, rehabilitate, improve, maintain, and operate its aquarium or museum,\n   <em>\n    together with the grounds immediately adjacent to such aquarium or museum, and to use, possess, and occupy grounds surrounding such aquarium or museum\n   </em>\n   as hereinabove described for the purpose of beautifying and maintaining such grounds in a manner consistent with the aquarium or museum's purpose...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20N.E.2d%20390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Based upon this second provision, Plaintiffs argue that the Museum Act only authorizes the City to allow the Foundation to build and operate the OPC, together with the grounds immediately adjacent to the OPC, if the City leases the OPC site to the Foundation. [120-1] at 37. Because the Use Agreement does not create a lease between the City and Foundation, Plaintiffs maintain that the OPC site cannot contain any grounds surrounding the building \"edifices,\" and thus that the Use Agreement authorizing OPC green space constitutes\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; [112-1] \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Essentially, Plaintiffs ask this Court to find that a statute authorizing the construction of a presidential center within a green space prohibits preserving green space within such a center. This Court rejects such an absurd and bizarre reading of the statutory text and context. The Museum Act's first sentence-not relating to leases-defines museums to include presidential centers. 70 ILCS 1290/1. The plain language then goes on to clarify that museums include \"all facilities for their collections, exhibitions, programming, and associated initiatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Reading the Museum Act according to its express language, as this Court must, does not allow this Court to limit \"facilities\" to just buildings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

[124] \u00b6 30. According to the Museum's mission statement, these \"outdoor facilities\" will \"beautify and enhance the recreational opportunities on the site, creating a fun, safe environment for visitors to enjoy in all seasons.\" [125-5] (Exhibit D, (Sub) Exhibit \"C\"). These features thus comprise part of the OPC's facilities for programming and associated initiatives. Therefore, given the complete absence of any textual support for Plaintiffs' novel statutory construction, this Court cannot find that the Use Agreement, by authorizing the OPC's use of green space, constitutes\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Illinois Property Transfer Act Authorizes the OPC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiffs' second theory argues that the Illinois Local Government Property Transfer Act, 50 ILCS 605/0.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , does not authorize the Park District's transfer of the Jackson Park site to the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 2 of the Property Transfer Act provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   If the territory of any municipality shall be wholly within, coextensive with, or partly within and partly without the corporate limits of any other municipality...and the first mentioned municipality (herein called \"transferee municipality\"), shall by ordinance declare that it is necessary or convenient\n   <em>\n    for it to use, occupy or improve\n   </em>\n   any real estate held by the last mentioned municipality (herein called the \"transferor municipality\") in the making of any public improvement or for any public purpose, the corporate authorities of the transferor municipality shall have the power to transfer\n   <em>\n    all of the right, title and interest\n   </em>\n   held by it immediately prior to such transfer, in and to such real estate, whether located within or without either or both of said municipalities, to the transferee municipality upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the corporate authorities of both municipalities...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578315,12701999\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 605/2 (emphasis added). Based upon this language, Plaintiffs contend that the Park District maintains authority to transfer the Jackson Park site to the City only if the City itself will \"use, occupy, or improve\" the site for the OPC. [120-1] at 41. Because the Use Agreement provides the Foundation with the right to occupy, use, maintain, operate, and alter the OPC, Plaintiffs argue that the Park District's transfer constituted an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   activity. Defendants, on the other hand, maintain that: (1) the Property Transfer Act does not prohibit the acquiring municipality from contracting with third parties to assist in improving the transferred land; and (2) the Museum Act, Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, and Article VII, section 10(a) of the Illinois Constitution authorize such a contract. This Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   First, Article VII, section 10(a) of the Illinois Constitution permits units of local government to \"contract and otherwise associate with individuals, associations, and corporations\" in any manner not prohibited by law. Further, that same section allows local governments to \"transfer any power or function, in any manner not prohibited by law or ordinance\" to other units of local government. Likewise, the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, 5 ILCS 220/2 -3, allows units of local governments to exercise, combine, transfer, and \"enjoy jointly\" any of their \"powers, privileges, functions, or authority,\" except where expressly prohibited by law. Thus, read together with the Property Transfer Act, these provisions demonstrate that: (1) each Defendant, as an individual unit of local government, can separately contract with third parties on land that they already own; and (2) either Defendant can transfer land to the other, along with their power to contract with third parties on that land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that none of these provisions apply, because they only allow transfers not prohibited by law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [91] \u00b6\u00b6 63, 67. But Plaintiff fails to point to any law that prohibits such transfers. For instance, the Property Transfer Act is silent as to whether municipalities can contract with third parties to improve transferred land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   50 ILCS 605/2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wittman v.

And the Museum Act clearly authorizes the City to contract with the Foundation in constructing and operating the OPC. 70 ILCS 1290/1. Moreover, Plaintiffs' reading of the statute would create the nonsensical result of prohibiting transferee municipalities from ever contracting with engineers, architects, or builders to improve a site. This Court rejects Plaintiffs' theory and instead reads each of the relevant provisions of Illinois law within context together and gives each statute effect according to its plain terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this Court cannot find that\n   the Park District's transfer of the Jackson Park site to the City constitutes an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act under the Property Transfer Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   This Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count III and denies Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Count IV: Declaratory Judgment As to Inapplicability of the Illinois Museum Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Plaintiffs' theory as to Count IV also falls short. Ostensibly, Plaintiffs contend that the portions of the Museum Act amended in 2016 constitute retroactive changes, and therefore seek a declaratory judgment that the Museum Act cannot authorize the OPC. [91] \u00b6\u00b6 100-103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs' allegations as to Count IV proceed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   101. The 2016 Amendment to the Museum Act states on its face that it is not retroactive. The temporal reach of the 2016 Amendment states that the amendment is \"declaratory of existing law,\" and therefore the substance of the 2016 Amendment cannot be made retroactive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   102. However, the 2016 Amendment is not declaratory of existing law. Existing law at the time of the 2016 Amendment does not [ ] allow aquariums and museums on formerly submerged lands, does not allow undefined \"edifices\" for \"presidential libraries and centers\" on park land, and does not allow the gifting of park land to private entities by allowing multiple 99 year leases of park land to a private entity - all of which were added in the 2016 Amendment to the Museum Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   103. On information and belief, the Defendants will contend that the Illinois Museum Act allows a Presidential Center to be constructed on the Jackson Park Site. Therefore, an actual and justiciable controversy exists between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants related to the applicability of the Museum Act to the Presidential Center.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that: (1) the 2016 amendment had no retroactive effect on the Operating Ordinance, as the City Council enacted it in 2018; and (2) in any event, the General Assembly can lawfully apply the amendment retroactively. [123-1] at 39-40. Plaintiffs, however, fail to address Count IV in their response memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   [137]. Failure to respond to an argument results in waiver, and thus justifies granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count IV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonte v. U.S. Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3793754\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/461/#p466\">\n    624 F.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466 (7th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Nevertheless, this Court also agrees with Defendants that the Museum Act cannot retroactively apply to the OPC. To the extent Plaintiffs allege in their amended complaint that the Museum Act \"cannot be made retroactive,\" the City did not enact the Operating Ordinance, which authorized the City to accept the OPC site from the Park District and enter into the Use Agreement, until two years after the 2016 amendment. [124] \u00b6 19. Therefore, no record exists from which this Court can find the 2016 amendment to the Museum Act constituted an unlawful retroactive provision as applied to the OPC. This Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count V: Special Legislation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Count V seeks to void the Museum Act under the Illinois Constitution's Special Legislation Clause, which prohibits a \"special or local law when a general law is or can be made applicable.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, \u00a7 13. According to Plaintiffs, the 2016 amendment to the Museum Act \"expressly\" allowed a presidential center,\n   and thus constitutes special legislation. Defendants move for summary judgment as to Count V because the 2016 amendment does not create an exclusionary classification. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs spend the vast majority of their amended complaint and summary judgment briefing arguing that the Museum Act fails to authorize the OPC because it lacks specificity. In the same breadth, with respect to Count V, Plaintiffs also claim that the General Assembly acted in an improperly specific manner when it included \"presidential centers\" within the Act. [91] \u00b6 109. Count V falls, however, for the simple reason that it fails to survive Illinois courts' two-part test for special legislation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The special legislation clause prohibits the General Assembly from conferring \"a special benefit or privilege upon one person or group and excluding others that are similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Crusius v.
