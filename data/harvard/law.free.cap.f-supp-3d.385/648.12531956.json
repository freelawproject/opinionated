The undisputed facts, drawn primarily from police reports and search warrant applications, are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While investigating the Razny Jewelers robbery, Hinsdale detectives came to believe-based on witness statements, video surveillance, and an anonymous tip relayed by another law enforcement officer-that\n   the getaway vehicle was a 2003 Lexus RX with Michigan license plate number DPA 8960. Doc. 50-1 at 4-5; Doc. 56-1 at 2-4. The Lexus was registered to Diggs's wife, Devinn Adams. Doc. 49 at 1; Doc. 50-1 at 5. Adams bought the car on credit from Headers Car Care in July 2016. Doc. 55-1 at 2. Her contract with Headers includes this provision: \"If your vehicle has an electronic tracking device, you agree that we may use this device to find the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Although Adams owned the Lexus, Diggs \"regularly drove\" it. Doc. 55 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Hinsdale detectives issued an alert \"on multiple databases\" seeking information about the Lexus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. On April 4, 2017, a Headers employee told one of the detectives that the Lexus was equipped with a GPS tracking device serviced by Air Assault Asset Track GPS Systems. Doc. 49-1 at 3-4; Doc. 56-1 at 2-3. The Headers employee gave the detective her login credentials for Air Assault's website and authorized him to access \"all the GPS records associated with the Devinn Adams/Lexus RX account.\" Doc. 56-1 at 3. The GPS records included historical data tracking the Lexus's \"movement and global position.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Without first obtaining a warrant, the detective downloaded a spreadsheet containing GPS data for the period from March 1, 2017 through April 4, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 49-1 at 6, 8, 10. The spreadsheet sets forth time-stamped entries giving the Lexus's approximate street address (usually at the block level, such as \"5701-5799 S Campbell Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629\") each time it was turned on, approximately every five minutes while it was being driven, and each time it was parked. Doc. 56-1 at 3-4; Doc. 49-1 at 8. According to the detective, \"[g]reater detail\" beyond those approximate street addresses \"c[ould] be extracted from the map points\" using \"the software program that manages the GPS data,\" which allowed the detective to \"narrow[ ]\" each recorded location \"to specific latitude and longitude way points.\" Doc. 56-1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The GPS data reflect that the Lexus traveled to Hinsdale on the date of the robbery, March 17, 2017, and on each of the two previous days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The data also reflect that the Lexus traveled to and from all three defendants' \"family residence[s]\" from March 15 through March 17.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (capitalization altered). The March 17 data show the Lexus driving from Diggs's address to McClellan's, then to Hamberlin's, then to Hinsdale, and then back to Hamberlin's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5. The data place the Lexus on the same block as Razny Jewelers at the time of the robbery, and in the alleyway \"directly behind\" the store during the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Later on March 17, the Lexus was parked in the garage at Diggs's girlfriend Jessica Christian's mother's home, where it remained until the police seized it on April 4.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; Doc. 49-1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Diggs argues that the Hinsdale police's warrantless acquisition of the Lexus's long-term historical GPS data was an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government responds that acquiring the data was not a Fourth Amendment search because: (1) unlike in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the police made no physical intrusion on the Lexus, Doc. 55 at 10-12; and (2) under the third-party doctrine, Diggs lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data because he voluntarily provided it to the third party (Headers) from which the police obtained it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-10. The government submits in\n   the alternative that even if the Hinsdale police violated the Fourth Amendment, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies because the police adhered to binding appellate precedent in obtaining the data.

The Supreme Court unanimously held that a search occurred, but split evenly as to why.

In a concurrence joined by three other Justices, Justice Alito rejected the majority's \"trespass-based theory,\" concluding instead that \"the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses\" is a search because it \"impinges on expectations of privacy\" to a \"degree ... that a reasonable person would not have anticipated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    at 419-21, 424, 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice Sotomayor adopted both theories, joining the majority in holding that \"[w]hen the Government physically invades personal property to gather information, a search occurs,\" while agreeing with Justice Alito that long-term GPS monitoring implicates privacy concerns by \"enabl[ing] the Government to ascertain, more or less at will, [individuals'] political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    at 414-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sotomayor, J., concurring).

As the Court observed some forty years later in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \"held that a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties[,] ... even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   explained, however, that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not erect a bright-line rule: \"The third-party doctrine partly stems from the notion that an individual has a reduced expectation of privacy in information knowingly shared with another. But the fact of diminished privacy interests does not mean that the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture entirely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2219. Thus, even where an individual voluntarily provides information to a third party, courts must \"consider[ ] the nature of the particular documents sought to determine whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy concerning their contents.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   defeats the government's third-party argument here.\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   held that obtaining historical cell-site location information (\"CSLI\")-time-stamped records of a cell phone's connection to a cell tower-from a third party (a wireless carrier) was a search because it intruded on the target's \"legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through CSLI.\" 138 S. Ct. at 2211-12, 2217. The Court rejected the government's characterization of its acquisition of historical CSLI as \"a garden-variety request for information from a third-party witness,\" reasoning that \"[t]here is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \"-telephone numbers and bank records-\"and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2216-19. Given the heightened privacy concerns at play, the Court \"decline[d] to extend\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   to the collection of CSLI.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2219-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Applying the third-party doctrine to the GPS data here would require essentially the same extension of the doctrine that the Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   understood CSLI to present \"many of the qualities of the GPS monitoring ... considered in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   \"-both are \"detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled\"; both \"provide[ ] an intimate window into a person's life\"; and, in the context of historical information, both provide a \"tracking capacity [that] runs against everyone\" without any need for the police to \"know in advance whether they want to follow a particular individual, or when.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2216-18. Indeed, at the time of the search in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , CSLI was still \"less precise than GPS information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2218-19. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   compels the conclusion that, given the privacy concerns implicated by the \"detailed and comprehensive record of [Diggs's] movements\" captured by the Lexus's GPS tracker, \"the fact that the [police] obtained the information from a third party does not overcome [Diggs's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   claim to Fourth Amendment protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2217, 2220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government next argues that Diggs relinquished any reasonable expectation of privacy in the GPS data when he abandoned the Lexus in someone else's garage. Doc. 55 at 12-14. That argument rests on a misunderstanding of the privacy interests at play. Obtaining the GPS data implicated Diggs's privacy interest in the historical record of his location-as revealed by the Lexus's movements-over the month before he allegedly abandoned the Lexus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S. Ct. at 2217 (characterizing the relevant privacy interest as \"a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of [the target's] physical movements as captured through CSLI\"). The government's argument regarding Diggs's abandonment of the Lexus, by contrast, addresses only his privacy interest (or lack thereof) in the Lexus itself. Doc. 55 at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That distinction is crucial. If Diggs lacked a Fourth Amendment interest in the Lexus on April 4, 2017, the police could have searched the vehicle without implicating his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   , 138 S. Ct. at 1530 (\"[A] person must have a cognizable Fourth Amendment interest in the place searched before seeking relief for an unconstitutional search ....\"). But it would not follow that Diggs lacked a Fourth Amendment interest in the GPS data the Lexus transmitted to Air Assault before he abandoned the vehicle. Diggs's reasonable expectation of privacy in the GPS data arises from the story that data tells about his movements over the course of a month, not from any expectation of privacy in the vehicle's interior after he left it in someone else's garage. As Diggs observes, if a person who abandoned the physical object that created a set of data-but that did not itself hold the data-also abandoned his privacy interests in that data, then anyone who trades in his cell phone for a newer model would lose his privacy interests in the CSLI his wireless carrier had collected from the old device. Doc. 56 at 12-13. That is not how the Fourth Amendment works; rather, the reasonable expectation of privacy inquiry arises from the information that was searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S. Ct. at 2219 (\"[W]hen the Government accessed CSLI from the wireless carriers, it invaded Carpenter's reasonable expectation of privacy\n   <em>\n    in the whole of his physical movements.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the government takes no clear position, addresses the issue only in a footnote, and cites no authority for the proposition that a person who \"regularly drove\" the Lexus,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his location as revealed by long-term historical GPS data reflecting the vehicle's movements simply because he \"lacked a sufficient possessory interest in the Lexus,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.3, the issue is forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evergreen Square of Cudahy v.

Fourth Amendment \"standing\" is merely a \"shorthand for ... the idea that a person must have a cognizable Fourth Amendment interest in the place searched before seeking relief for an unconstitutional search,\" and thus is \"not distinct from the merits and is more properly subsumed under substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1526\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 1530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Because, as shown above, Diggs had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the GPS data, he had \"a cognizable Fourth Amendment interest\" in that data and accordingly may seek relief for law enforcement's intrusion on that interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1526\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Diggs need not also establish a property interest in the vehicle itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1526\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1526\">\n    at 1526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Expectations of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment ... need not be based on a common-law interest in real or personal property, or on the invasion of such an interest.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, the government's warrantless acquisition of historical GPS data revealing Diggs's movements over the course of more than a month was a search. The next question is whether the search was reasonable. It was not. As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , \"warrantless searches are typically unreasonable where a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

In the face of silence from the circuit in which an officer acted, it is entirely consistent to say that cases from other circuits authorizing a practice (1) suggest that the practice did not violate clearly established law, thereby entitling the officer to qualified immunity, but (2) do not constitute \"binding appellate precedent [that] specifically authorizes\" the practice,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928256,12450488\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/229/\">\n    564 U.S. at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450488,5928256\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2419/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted), and so do not support invocation of the good-faith exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, even if the Fourth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   specifically authorized the warrantless acquisition of long-term historical GPS data from a third party, they were not binding appellate precedent in the Seventh Circuit.

The reason is that neither Diggs nor Adams \"voluntarily turn[ed] over\" the GPS data to Headers, and the government has not identified any decision specifically authorizing law enforcement to gather information from a third party to which the information was not voluntarily provided.\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.

The contract states in pertinent part: \"If your vehicle has an electronic tracking device, you agree that we may use this device to find the vehicle.\" Doc. 55-1 at 4.

Yet by authorizing Headers to \"use [the] device to find the vehicle,\" Doc. 55-1 at 4, Adams did not also give Headers permission to continuously track the vehicle, and thus did not voluntarily turn historical\n   GPS information over to Headers for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   purpose. Given that the provision appears in a contract for the sale of a vehicle on credit, the only plausible reading is that it permits Headers to activate the GPS to determine the vehicle's current location if, for example, the buyer defaults and Headers exercises its right to repossess or if the vehicle is reported stolen.\n   <em>\n    See ibid.\n   </em>\n   (Indiana choice-of-law provision);\n   <em>\n    Vesuvius USA Corp. v.

As the government recognizes by distinguishing between \"locat[ing] the Lexus\" and \"determin[ing] its prior movements,\" Doc. 55 at 7, the continuous monitoring through which Headers in fact generated the GPS data had nothing to do with \"finding\" the vehicle in any ordinary sense of that word, and thus went beyond the kind of location monitoring that the contract authorized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BMD Contractors, Inc. v.
