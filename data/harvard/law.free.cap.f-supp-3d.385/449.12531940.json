Grimm, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   State Construction Corp. (\"State Construction\") has brought this federal lawsuit seeking compensation for labor, materials, and services it provided in the course of a protracted construction project on a military facility in Maryland. It accuses Defendants, including the project's prime contractor, of scheming to deny it the protections accorded under the Miller Act, a law that shields certain classes of subcontractors and suppliers on federally funded construction sites from the risk they will not be paid for their work. Defendants argue this Court lacks jurisdiction over the suit and that, even if jurisdiction does exist, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I agree with Defendants that, under the express terms of State Construction's subcontract, the company is a \"third-tier\" subcontractor without standing to bring suit under the Miller Act. I find, though, that the Amended Complaint adequately pleads a claim that the prime contractor breached an implied-in-fact contract to pay State Construction for costs associated with delays on the project and that this claim supplies a basis for federal jurisdiction. I\n   also conclude that Defendants are not entitled to a dismissal of State Construction's Miller Act bond claim, nor of its claims for breach of the implied-in-fact contract and unjust enrichment. I also am permitting the fraud claim against the prime contractor to proceed but am ordering State Construction to further amend its complaint to indicate precisely where the alleged misrepresentations were made and whether they were oral or in writing. The fraud claim against the putative first-tier subcontractor will, however, be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case involves five companies, all of which were involved, to varying extents, in a federally funded construction project at Fort Meade, a military installation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The differing roles each of these companies played in the project is critical to the resolution of the matter before me, and so, for the reader's sake, I will pause a moment to introduce them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I start with the defendants. Slone Associates, Inc. (\"Slone\") was the prime contractor on the project. Am. Compl. \u00b6 11, ECF No. 29. U.S. Specialty Insurance Co.

State Construction's theory is incompatible with this statement of law, as it would elevate Two Rivers to the status of \"subcontractor\" despite the absence of\n   an agreement between that company and Slone, the prime contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if I were to regard\n   <em>\n    Glens Falls\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Continental Casualty\n   </em>\n   as good law, I would hesitate to view these cases as applicable here. In\n   <em>\n    Glens Falls\n   </em>\n   , each of the two plaintiffs seeking to recover under the Miller Act had been told that the company with which they were negotiating, Whiteside Construction, was the \"framing subcontractor\"; the Tenth Circuit's opinion suggests that neither plaintiff had reason to know that Whiteside did not itself have an agreement with the prime contractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2094223\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/388/66/#p69\">\n    388 F.2d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . State Construction, by contrast, was under no illusions. The Amended Complaint makes clear it knew that Two Rivers's contract was not with Slone, but with C &amp; S Aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36. Plainly, State Construction executed its agreement with Two Rivers, and the accompanying Joint Check Agreement, without any reason to expect it would have recovery rights under the Miller Act. This much is evidenced by the fact that, when State Construction ultimately did attempt to preserve the possibility of a Miller Act payment bond recovery, it did not deliver the statutory notification directly to Slone, as a second-tier subcontractor would be entitled to do; rather, it pressed Two Rivers - the nominal second-tier subcontractor - to deliver the required notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   State Construction asserts that, had it \"known the truth that C &amp; S was a 'sham' subcontractor, under the control of Slone, then State never would have entered into the Subcontract with Two Rivers (including the Joint Check Agreement), and instead would have insisted on entering into a direct subcontract with Slone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Maybe so. But what is implicit in this argument is that State Construction entered into an agreement in which Miller Act protection was not a part of the bargain. This expectation was not incidental to the parties' bargaining position. Surely, a company that knows its agreement carries certain risks may bargain for a higher contract price as compensation for that risk. Here, in urging me to treat State Construction as a second-tier subcontractor, the company is urging me to unwind its agreement with Two Rivers and give it the benefit of a bargain it never struck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I decline to reform State Construction's agreement with Two Rivers, just as I decline to disregard C &amp; S Aircraft's agreement with Slone. Accordingly, I reject State Construction's argument that it may recover under the Miller Act as a second-tier subcontractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Had State Construction not amended its Complaint, my analysis would in all likelihood have ended there.

Compl. \u00b6 33; State-Two Rivers Agreement 17-18. But State Construction is not alleging that the implied-in-fact agreement took the place of preexisting agreements. Its claim, rather, is that Slone agreed to incur\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   obligations to prevent State Construction from withdrawing its personnel and equipment from the work site. To that end, the Amended Complaint alleges that specific named executives were engaged in a dialogue about the ongoing delays on the project; that an ostensibly neutral third party (the Government) had effectively blamed Slone for those delays; that Slone had reason to fear State Construction might pull its equipment and workers off the site; that, following the discussions, State Construction chose not to withdraw from the site; and that Slone promptly resumed making payments.

There, in its description of State Construction's subcontract with Two Rivers, it states only that this agreement required State Construction \"to install the underground utility (water, storm, and sewer) for the Project,\" and that this work was to be \"substantially complete in approximately a six (6) month duration or by the end of March 2016.\" Am.

While Defendants may yet seek to establish, on summary judgment, that the preexisting subcontract already obligated State Construction to do just this, that is a matter for another time.

In Count V, State Construction alleges that Slone (along with Two Rivers) \"misrepresented that C &amp; S Aircraft Services, Inc. was a first tier subcontractor to perform the grading and site excavation work on behalf of the prime contractor Slone Associates, Inc.,\" and that Two Rivers \"was C &amp; S's sub-subcontractor to perform certain excavation work and grading work for the Project, including the installation of the underground utility work.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 79. The Amended Complaint asserts that Defendants \"made these statements to entice\n   State to serve as a subcontractor on this Project with the false belief that it did not have any Miller Act rights against U.S. Specialty's Payment Bond and for State to rely solely on the Joint Check Agreement for payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As fraud claims go, this one is, admittedly, a shade out of the norm. More typically, a party alleging what effectively amounts to fraud in the inducement seeks relief from contractual terms that turned out to be less advantageous than the party was led to believe they would be at the time of execution. Here, though, as Defendants are quick to note, State Construction entered into its subcontract with Two Rivers without any expectation that it would have the benefit of Miller Act coverage. In other words, State Construction did not get the benefit of the deal it entered into, and it now seeks to recover in fraud on the basis of an assertion that it would have rejected the deal entirely, or might have sought a better one, had it not been misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This is not to say, though, that Count V cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The question, at this stage, is whether State Construction has pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is \"plausible on its face,\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

R. Civ. P. 9(b). To answer this question, I look to the elements of fraud under Maryland law. As a general matter, these are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) the falsity of the representation was either known to the defendant or the representation was made with reckless indifference to its truth, (3) the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and (5) the plaintiff suffered compensable injury as a result of the misrepresentation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

On that front, they argue it was not technically false for Slone to state, as the Amended Complaint alleges, that C &amp; S Aircraft \"was a first tier subcontractor to perform the grading and site excavation work\" on the project and that Two Rivers \"was C &amp; S's sub-subcontractor to perform certain excavation work and grading work.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 79. Granted, the way these statements are worded in the Amended Complaint leaves unclear whether Slone affirmatively asserted that C &amp; S Aircraft would itself perform the work specified in its subcontract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This, it is now clear, would have been a false statement. But Maryland law recognizes the possibility that statements that are not literally false may nevertheless be fraudulent. Most relevantly for present purposes, a defendant may be liable for fraud if he \"conceals facts that materially qualify affirmative representations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lubore v. RPM Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433165\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/312/\">\n    109 Md.App. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4433165\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/109/312/\">\n    674 A.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1996). That appears to be the allegation here, where\n   the Amended Complaint asserts that Slone Vice President William Slone told State Construction that C &amp; S Aircraft \"was a first tier contractor to perform\" specified work, but did not clarify that C &amp; S would not, in fact, be performing any of that work itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants next turn to the third element of fraud: the requirement that the defendant made the misrepresentation for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff. State Construction, they argue, \"has not pleaded any facts to indicate that Slone and C &amp; S entered into a subcontract agreement with the intention of defrauding State or any other party.\" Mot. to Dismiss 20. Even if this were true, it is beside the point. To plead a claim for fraud, State Construction does not need to trace Slone's purported bad intentions to July 15, 2015, the date on which Slone and C &amp; S Aircraft executed their subcontract. What it must do, rather, is allege that Slone harbored such intentions\n   <em>\n    at the time of the misrepresentation.\n   </em>\n   State Construction has done this. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that William Slone made the misrepresentation on September 24, 2015, more than two months after his company executed its subcontract with C &amp; S Aircraft; that he did so with the knowledge that his statement was false; and that he intended to induce State Construction President Joaquim Mendez to sign an agreement that would not include the benefit of Miller Act protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants also challenge State Construction's contention that the alleged misrepresentation caused it injury. They argue that any damages the company might have sustained \"are contractual damages limited to contract remedies against Two Rivers.\" Mot. to Dismiss 19. To be sure, State Construction is seeking contract damages. There is no reason, though, why it should not have the opportunity to assert an alternative theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Tusco, Inc. v. Clark Constr. Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268255\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/745/#p755\">\n    235 F. Supp. 3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 (D. Md. 2016). To that end, State Construction has alleged that its executives relied on Slone's misrepresentation in deciding to enter into a contract on suboptimal terms and that, because of those terms, the company has had to fight to recover what it is due. This is a sufficient allegation of injury to overcome Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue the Amended Complaint does not satisfy the heightened pleading standard for fraud claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss 21.

It states that William Slone and Two Rivers President Stephen Allen made fraudulent misrepresentations on September 24, 2015, the day that State Construction entered into its subcontract with Two Rivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Those statements, specifically, were \"that C &amp; S Aircraft Services, Inc. was a first tier subcontractor to perform the grading and site excavation work on behalf of the prime contractor Slone Associates, Inc. on the Project ... and that Two Rivers Site Development, Inc. was C &amp; S's sub-subcontractor to perform certain excavation work and grading work for the Project, including the installation of the underground utility work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.

And, relatedly, I note that it does not specify whether the misrepresentations were made orally or in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   These are oversights, to be sure. As a practical matter, though, I do not view them as fatal. As the Fourth Circuit has explained, the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b) serves several purposes. Most especially, it seeks to put the defendant on notice of its alleged misconduct and to prevent plaintiffs from filing \"frivolous suits ... 'in which all the facts are learned after discovery.' \"\n   <em>\n    Takeda Pharm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536437\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/451/#p455\">\n    707 F.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11611126\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/176/776/#p784\">\n    176 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   784 ). Here, State Construction has pleaded its claim with enough particularity to alleviate any concern that its suit is a mere fishing expedition. Its Amended Complaint alleges that particular individuals made particular statements on a specified date, while the parties were wrapping up negotiations on State Construction's subcontract with Two Rivers. State Construction should have no difficulty amending the Amended Complaint to indicate where William Slone and Allen were when they made the alleged misrepresentations and whether they made those misrepresentations orally or in writing. Accordingly, I decline to dismiss the fraud claim against Slone, and I grant State Construction leave to further amend the Amended Complaint for this limited purpose only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The same analysis does not apply to C &amp; S Aircraft. The Amended Complaint does not allege that anyone from C &amp; S Aircraft made false representations on or before September 24, 2015 (or, for that matter, any misleading statements that might have imposed on the company a duty to correct a misimpression). In fact, the Amended Complaint states that the company \"was not part\" of State Construction's negotiations with Slone and Two Rivers \"or any other negotiations State was involved in.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 18. The response in opposition to the Consolidated Motion to Dismiss further acknowledges that State Construction executives \"never met or talked to\" Charles Adon Clark, who, along with his wife, was the sole shareholder of C &amp; S Aircraft. Opp'n 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   State Construction notes that C &amp; S Aircraft was a party to the Joint Check Agreement, which labeled the former a \"third tier subcontractor\" and the latter the \"first tier subcontractor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 30-31. But the parties did not execute that agreement until October 16, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 81; Opp'n 31. That is nearly a month after State Construction made the allegedly fateful decision to enter into its subcontract with Two Rivers under terms that, as William Slone and Allen had already made clear, would not entitle State Construction to Miller Act protection.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 79. There is simply no way State Construction could have detrimentally relied on any statements in the Joint Check Agreement in making that decision. Accordingly, the fraud claim against C &amp; S Aircraft must be dismissed. And as this was the only claim asserted against C &amp; S Aircraft, the Clerk shall dismiss that company as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendants' Consolidated Motion to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part. State Construction may proceed to seek relief under all of the challenged counts. The fraud claim (Count V) survives, but only as to Slone and Two Rivers. In proceeding on this claim, State Construction may amend its Amended Complaint for the limited purpose of indicating where Slone Vice President William Slone and Two Rivers President Stephen Allen were when they made the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation on September 24, 2015, and whether they made the misrepresentation orally or in writing. No other revisions to the Amended Complaint are authorized. The fraud claim against C &amp; S Aircraft is dismissed, as the Amended Complaint fails to allege that that company made any false statements upon which State Construction could have detrimentally relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    All facts are taken from the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 29) and are assumed to be true for purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parker v.
