The defendant filed a timely objection to the recommendation, dkt. no. 223, and the government responded, dkt. no. 225. Because the court finds that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment's hallway or the exterior of the apartment building's entrance, the court adopts Judge Jones's recommendation and denies the defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But the defendant does not explain why that fact makes a difference. It is also true that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Concepcion\n   </em>\n   lived in the apartment building where the officers searched the common areas and the defendant in this case did not, but that fact cuts against the defendant's argument that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant urges the court to compare his facts to those in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   .

No. 195 at 7. The video camera does the same thing-it sits on top of the pole, or resides across the hallway, and conducts surveillance. It does exactly what a human law enforcement agent could do. That distinguishes the video camera from the narcotics dog, because \"a trained drug-sniffing dog is a sophisticated sensing device not available to the general public.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255788,4255284\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/849/\">\n    820 F.3d at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant does not argue that the video cameras had any heightened capabilities (such as infrared technology) or that they allowed law enforcement to see what was going on inside the apartment, or what was going on after the defendant left the apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant argues that a pole camera\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   do something that human law enforcement agents can't do-it can conduct surveillance continuously for a longer period at lower cost and with less likelihood of detection. This is true. And there are courts who have expressed concern that 24/7 surveillance of the outside of a person's house for an extended period raises questions about privacy, because it gives law enforcement a view of many aspects of the resident's life that traditional, human-eye surveillance could not obtain. But the duration of the surveillance is relevant only if the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of the Martin Luther King Blvd. apartment complex-and he didn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant asserts that, despite binding Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a tenant (and certainly a non-tenant visitor) does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment complex, Judge Jones should have considered decisions from other courts.

The court conceded that there were other courts that had concluded that pole camera surveillance did not constitute a search \"based on controlling precedent in\n   the respective circuit\n   <em>\n    or because the area surveilled was not a home or the defendant's home\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335414\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/903/101/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335414\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/903/101/#p107\">\n    at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   court was not constrained in those ways, it analyzed the facts under the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p351\">\n    389 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p351\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and concluded that the surveillance constituted a search. The final case the defendant argues that Judge Jones failed to consider is\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14-10296-LTS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205145537\">\n    2015 WL 5145537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. Sept. 1, 2015). In a case involving installation of a public pole camera that captured the door to the defendant's apartment and a law-enforcement camera that captured the lot where he parked. Like the defendant in this case, Garcia-Gonzalez argued that these two cameras captured \"the aggregate of all of his coming and going from the home, all of his visitors, all of his cars, all of their cars, and all of the types of packages or bags he carried and when.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. They recorded all the defendant's visitors, the people with whom he traveled, the cars he drove, what he carried in and out of his house, the times when he was home and when he was away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court opined that \"the pole camera was akin to stationing a police officer at the front door by whom every person and object must pass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court stated that \"[l]engthy, sustained surveillance of a person's home during which the police observe (and record) every coming and going to the home raises substantial privacy concerns,\" and noted that other courts had expressed the same concern.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Nonetheless, the court denied the motion to suppress because it was bound by First Circuit precedent to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Even if Judge Jones didn't consider these cases (and the court doesn't know whether he did or not), his failure to do so would not have constituted an error. All of these cases involved pole cameras that recorded yards or doors or parking lots connected to the defendants'\n   <em>\n    residences\n   </em>\n   , a place recognized since the beginning of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence as one in which a resident has a reasonable expectation of privacy. The pole camera in this case did not record the defendant's comings and goings from his residence-it recorded his comings and goings from his drug stash house, in the public, common areas of an apartment building. The Seventh Circuit has said that even a resident doesn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment complex, so the court is hard-pressed to see how the defendant's expectation of privacy could be reasonable when he wasn't even a resident. These cases do not support the defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant neglects to mention the many cases in which courts have rejected his reasoning-including a case decided by this court. In\n   <em>\n    Kubasiak\n   </em>\n   , this court considered pole camera surveillance with recorded using a fixed camera placed in a neighbor's house which recorded only the exterior of a residence.\n   <em>\n    Kubasiak\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-Cr-120, Dkt. No. 48 at 15-16. This court found that \"[t]he surveillance did not present the kind of aggregate view of intimate details of the defendant's every movement that concerned the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , or the majority in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The same analysis applies here. At most, the pole camera captured the defendant's comings and goings from an apartment in which he did not reside, in a building in which he did not reside, for a period of (according to the defendant's \"information and belief\") forty-nine days. Even assuming the defendant appeared on the pole camera surveillance footage every day, it would not have recorded who visited his home, when he was home and when he was away, what his daily schedule was, who he lived with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Judge Jones did not err in recommending that this court deny the motion to suppress, and the court will adopt that recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULES\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's objections to Judge Jones's report and recommendation. Dkt. No. 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   Judge Jones's recommendation. Dkt. No. 219.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's motion to suppress. Dkt. No. 195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The deadline for the parties to file pretrial motions has passed, and this was the only motion pending. The court's staff will calendar a date for a scheduling conference, to discuss with this defendant and the others who have not resolved their cases whether the court needs to set dates for a final pretrial conference and a trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Neither party asked Judge Jones to conduct an evidentiary hearing. In his objection to the report and recommendation, the defendant asserted that, \"[u]pon information and belief, the pole camera surveillance lasted at least 49 days.\" Dkt. No. 223 at 6. The defendant argues that Judge Jones \"failed to account for the length of the pole camera surveillance ....\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In a footnote, the defendant says that \"[i]f this Court desires additional facts, [the defendant] requests this Court remand the matter to Magistrate [Judge] Jones for an evidentiary hearing.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
