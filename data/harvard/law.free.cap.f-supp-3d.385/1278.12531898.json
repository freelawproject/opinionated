Both motions have been fully-briefed (ECF Nos. 33, 37, 38, 41), and the Honorable Robert N. Scola, Jr. has referred them to me for a report and recommendation, (ECF No. 39 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After careful review of the parties' legal memoranda and the applicable law, for the reasons that follow I recommend that the Court grant Defendant Carnival's Motion and deny Plaintiff Mann's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mann filed her three-count Complaint on April 5, 2018. She alleges that on May 25, 2017, she tripped and fell on the gangway while disembarking from the M/S Carnival Sunshine following a cruise. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 8 ). The Complaint further alleges that after the fall, \"[n]ursing and doctoral staff in the ship's infirmary refused to acknowledge the injuries as [Mann] was soon to be no longer a passenger, and did not acknowledge either [Mann] or her husband's insistence that the injuries were severe.\" (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 15 ). In Count I, Mann sues Carnival for negligence for the allegedly dangerous gangway and inadequate provision of medical care. Count II alleges that Carnival is vicariously liable for the negligence of its medical staff, and Count III charges that Carnival was negligent in its hiring, retention and training of its medical personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural history\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court's Scheduling Order provided a January 14, 2019 deadline for the close of discovery and the exchange of expert witness disclosures and a January 28, 2019 deadline for the filing of all dispositive motions. (ECF No. 10 ). On December 12, 2018, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Extend Discovery Period, Expert Disclosure Deadline and Dispositive Motion Deadline. (ECF No. 18 ). On December 13, 2018, the Court denied the parties' motion without prejudice and explained that, despite the parties' assertion to the contrary, the proposed changes to the Scheduling Order would not allow sufficient time before the trial date for the Court to resolve any dispositive motions. (ECF No. 19 ). The Court explained that the parties had, in effect, asked for a continuance of the trial date, and that if they sought this relief they must make that request clear and show good cause for such a continuance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 7, 2019, the parties appeared before the Court for a discovery hearing after which the Court extended the fact discovery and expert disclosure deadline to February 1, 2019. (ECF No. 20 ). The deadline for the filing of dispositive motions remained unchanged. On January 28, 2019, both parties filed their Motions for Summary Judgment. (ECF Nos. 27, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 30, 2019, two days after the summary judgment motions were filed, Mann filed a Motion for Continuance and Motion to Amend Initial Scheduling Order or, In the Alternative, Motion for Extension\n   of Time to Complete Fact Discovery and Provide Expert Witness Disclosures. (ECF No. 29 ). Therein, Mann asked the Court to either continue all trial deadlines, or extend the deadline for completion of fact discovery and the exchange of expert witness disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff served her expert disclosures on February 1, 2019. (ECF No. 32 at \u00b6 4 ). A few days later Carnival filed a Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Disclosures (ECF No. 32 ), and on March 5, 2019, the Court held a hearing on Mann's Motion for Continuance and Carnival's Motion to Strike. The Court granted Mann's Motion in part, and extended the discovery deadline to permit Mann to depose Carnival's corporate representative. (ECF No. 46 ). The Court did not extend other deadlines or the trial date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court granted Carnival's Motion to Strike, noting that Mann's disclosures fell well short of the requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) and (C) and were contrary to the Court's Scheduling Order. The Court thus struck Mann's disclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Mann has no expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Undisputed material facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following material facts are not disputed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mann testified at deposition that as she disembarked the M/S Carnival Sunshine on May 25, 2017, there was a handrail on the left side of the gangway and that \"[t]here was plenty of room\" on the gangway. (ECF No. 27-1, 29 :19 - 30:14). She \"was on the little gangplank, and I guess I had some bags or something in my hand, and my husband called me and said he needed-I don't know what he wanted. So [ ] I went to go off, and there was this little ledge about this high, and I couldn't see it ....\" (ECF No. 27-1 at 25 : 15-20). The ledge was \"nothing you step up on. It's beside you,\" and that it was \"not in the flow of traffic\", but rather was \"parallel to the way that you would walk.\" (ECF No. 27-1 at 33 :19-21, 34: 11-15). Mann \"couldn't figure out what had tripped\" her and didn't know how her foot could have gotten on the other side of the ledge. (ECF No. 27-1 at 35 :16 - 25). She did not know how she tripped over the ledge, she knew it tripped her because she fell. (ECF No. 27-1 at 36 :8-18). According to Mann, a person regularly getting off the ship would not have tripped over the ledge, and that she would not have tripped over the ledge if she had not turned around for some reason. (ECF No. 27-1 at 67 : 18-24). Mann further testified that the ledge \"was not in my way.\" (ECF No. 27-1 at 68 : 4-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Mann tripped, \"[t]here were people in white uniforms standing around, and the nurse came and helped [her], and - and everybody was nice.\" (ECF No. 27-1 at 38 :24 - 39:5). She believed the nurse was a Carnival nurse who worked on the ship, and that she did not do \"anything wrong\". (ECF No. 27-1 at 39 :21-25; 40:18-20). The nurse offered to take Mann to the ship's medical center, but she declined the offer because \"[w]e had met a couple there, and they needed a ride somewhere in South Carolina ... and so we were going to take them part of the way home, and so I didn't go down.\" (ECF No. 27-1 at 40 :3-9). No one from the cruise ship, neither the nurses nor any of the ship doctors, refused to acknowledge that Mann was hurt or refused to help her. (ECF No. 27-1 at 57 :15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to Carnival's notice of the allegedly dangerous gangway, in response to an interrogatory from Mann, Carnival disclosed that there were no known prior accidents that occurred in the Port of Charleston for the three-year period before Mann's alleged fall. (ECF No. 27-2 at No. 16 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The burden shifts to Mann to identify specific\n   facts that show a genuine dispute regarding whether Carnival breached its duty of care to Mann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mann has presented no evidence that Carnival knew or should have known that the gangplank at the Port of Charleston posed any risk-creating condition for any passenger. For example, there is no evidence of any accident reports, passenger comments, or reports from safety inspections that alerted Carnival of any potential safety concerns related to the gangplank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mann argues that Carnival had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous conditions of gangplanks generally, and supports its argument with citation to unrelated cases involving different factual predicates. (ECF No. 37 at 14 ). These cases, however, are not a part of the record in this matter and are factually distinguishable from the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mann also summarily argues that she was not required to show notice, because Carnival created the hazard itself. Mann asserts that her expert will \"testify that [Carnival] actually created, participated in, or approved the design of the gangplank.\" (ECF No. 37 at 10 ). The Court, however, struck Mann's expert disclosures because Mann failed to meet her obligations under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) and (C) and the Court's Scheduling Order. (ECF No. 46 ). Mann has no expert witness who could testify that Carnival was involved in the design of the gangplank. Moreover, Carnival's interrogatory responses state that \"the gangway is owned and controlled by another entity, the South Carolina State Port Authority.\" (ECF No. 27-2 at No. 16 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And, in any event, the Eleventh Circuit has rejected the notion that a cruise line operator could be liable for negligence without actual or constructive notice if it negligently created or maintained its premises.\n   <em>\n    Pizzino v.

App'x at 955. Mann testified that she had arthritis in her back and had undergone back surgery before she fell on the gangway. (ECF No. 27-1 at 11 :4 - 12:25). Additionally, Mann testified that after that fall, she slipped in the shower and sustained a compression fracture to her spine. (ECF No. 27-1 at 58 :15 - 59:18). Given Mann's prior and subsequent injuries, and the nature of her alleged injuries to her back, knee, and head-all conditions which are not \"readily observable\"-expert testimony would be required for her to establish proximate cause. As Mann has not and cannot identify any record evidence to provide such support, Carnival is entitled to partial summary judgment as to Mann's \"non-readily observable\" injuries, specifically her concussion, back injury and pain, pain in her chin and knee, and general pain requiring three weeks bedrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mann of course could testify regarding her readily observable injuries, which include the superficial bruising and abrasions on her face and knee and her broken tooth. Thus, Carnival is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of Mann's failure to establish proximate cause as to those injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Genuine Issues of Material Fact Exist Regarding the Existence of Mann's Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Carnival also moves for summary judgment on the basis that \"there is no evidence of damages.\" (ECF No. 27 at 2 ). Although Mann disputes this in her Response, and quotes from medical records related to treatment allegedly required for her back pain, (ECF No. 37 at 13 ), she mostly fails to attach or identify medical records which she claims support her assertions. The only record evidence Mann identifies that references an injury is a visit summary from Dr. Joseph L. Jackson. Therein, Dr. Jackson wrote that Mann tripped coming off a cruise ship, landed on her right knee and hit her right cheek and chin. He noted that Mann had a \"little bit of a contusion, superficial abrasion, to her right cheek. She has some bruising on the right side of her chin. She does have some bruising on her right knee over the patella.\" (ECF No. 37-5 ). Dr. Jackson also noted that Mann did not lose consciousness,\n   though she was initially confused, and did not have any nausea or vomiting. An x-ray was taken, it appears of Mann's knee, and showed no fracture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mann has only put forward evidence of the injuries Dr. Jackson noted in his report. (ECF No. 37-5 ). On this record, her only evidence of injuries are those Dr. Jackson noted in his report, which he could testify to at trial as a lay witness, and those Mann can testify to herself. Thus, Mann has some evidence of some of her claimed damages, and Carnival is not entitled to summary judgment on this third and separate basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Count III: Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Training\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Carnival is entitled to summary judgment on Mann's claim against Carnival for Negligent Hiring, Retention, and Training of the medical personnel, as Mann has failed to provide any evidence in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A principal may be subject to liability for physical harm to third persons if a plaintiff proves that (1) an agent/employee/contractor of the principal was incompetent or unfit to perform the work for which it was hired and/or retained; (2) the principal knew or reasonably should have known of the particular incompetence or unfitness; and (3) the incompetence or unfitness was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Flaherty v.

Fla. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Carnival is correct that the record before the Court contains no evidence of incompetence or unfitness on the part of the medical personnel, no evidence that the Carnival knew or reasonably should have known of any incompetence or unfitness, and no evidence that any action or inaction by the medical personnel was a proximate cause of any injury to Mann. In fact, the only record evidence regarding Mann's treatment by the medical personnel is her testimony that the medical staff promptly attempted to assist her, offered to take her to the medical unit for treatment which she declined, and did nothing wrong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Notably, Mann did not respond to Carnival's argument in its Motion for Summary Judgment that there was no evidence of any negligent act by medical personnel onboard the vessel. Failure to oppose an argument contained in a motion for summary judgment is grounds for granting the motion by default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 7.1(c). The only mention of the medical personnel in Mann's response is her assertion,\n   <em>\n    without any citation to evidence\n   </em>\n   , that following the fall \"[Mann] remained\n   aboard the vessel and no medical attention had been provided\" and that \"no attempts were made to transport an unconscious passenger away from a highly congested area where passengers were attempting to leave the ship.\" (ECF No. 37 at 11 ). Mann's own deposition testimony directly rebuts these assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Count II: Vicarious Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Count III Mann claims that Carnival is vicariously liable for its medical staff's failure to properly treat her after her fall. As explained above, there is no evidence of any negligence or incompetence by the medical staff. A principal cannot be held vicariously liable if a claim for negligence cannot be stated against its purported agent.\n   <em>\n    Flaherty v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345979\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/1348/#p1351\">\n    172 F. Supp. 3d at 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, in her response memorandum, Mann chose not to respond to Carnival's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on this Count. For these reasons, Carnival is entitled to summary judgment on Mann's vicarious liability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mann moved for partial summary judgment on its negligence claim in Count I, on the ground that Carnival breached its duty to protect its passengers from falling by installing handrails on both sides of the gangplank, which breach was the proximate cause of Mann's injuries and resulting damages. (ECF No. 28 at p. 1-2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes that Mann's motion is largely unsupported by any record evidence. Mann attempts to rely on a number of documents addressing handrails or vessel safety in unrelated contexts. Not only is this evidence irrelevant to this case, but it is also insufficient to support Mann's Motion. Mann attempts to establish that Carnival had a specific duty to install a handrail on both sides of the gangplank by reference to (1) OSHA's Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring (ECF No. 28-2 ); (2) OSHA's Safety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment (ECF No. 28-3 ); (3) the Maritime Safety Committee's Guidelines for Construction, Installation, Maintenance and Inspection/Survey of Means of Embarkation and Disembarkation (ECF No. 28-4 ); (4) a United States Coast Guard Marine Safety Alert (ECF No. 28-5 ). Mann is neither a longshoreman nor employed by a shipyard, and the documents she provided do not establish a duty on the part of Carnival to Mann. The Maritime Safety Committee's Guidelines do not explicitly require two handrails, but rather require annual inspection of handrails, among other vessel features. The USCG Marine Safety Alert says nothing about any specific handrail requirements, but rather urges the use of best practices in gangway safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mann appears to attempt to use these documents to simultaneously establish that Carnival had a specific duty to provide two handrails and to establish that Carnival was on notice of the generally dangerous nature of gangways. The documents fail to achieve either aim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For these reasons, and for the reasons offered in support of granting Carnival's Motion for Summary Judgment, this Court must deny Mann's Motion for Summary Judgment on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the Defendant's motion should be GRANTED as to all counts and Plaintiff's Motion DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. RECOMMENDATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Based on the foregoing, I RECOMMEND that the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's\n   Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 27 ).
