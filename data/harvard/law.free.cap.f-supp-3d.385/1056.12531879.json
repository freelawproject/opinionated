Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a lawsuit about two individuals who together purchased a new motor vehicle only to learn later that the vehicle had a defect and did not conform to the manufacturer's warranty. The two individuals are Plaintiffs Ignacio Ramos and Elizabeth Ramos (\"Plaintiffs\"). The vehicle is a 2013 Dodge Ram 1500. The vehicle manufacturer is Defendant FCA US LLC (\"FCA\"). Plaintiffs sued FCA for breach of warranty and fraudulent concealment of the defect, and Plaintiffs requested punitive damages for the fraudulent concealment and statutory penalties for the breach of express warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FCA now moves for summary judgment on the following: (1) Plaintiffs' claim for fraudulent concealment; (2) Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages for the fraudulent concealment; and (3) Plaintiffs' request for civil penalties for the violation of California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty\n   Act (\"Song-Beverly Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will grant summary judgment in FCA's favor on Plaintiffs' claim for fraudulent concealment claim and request for punitive damages, but the Court will deny summary judgment on Plaintiffs' request for civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on the evidence presented by the parties and all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of Plaintiffs, the relevant facts at this summary judgment phase are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 5, 2013, Plaintiffs purchased a new 2013 Dodge RAM 1500 from Lampe Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Visalia, California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40 at 2. The vehicle was manufactured and warranted by FCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 62-1 at 2. When Plaintiffs purchased the vehicle, the vehicle had 84 miles on the odometer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40 at 2. Plaintiffs purchased the vehicle for either $43,180.48 or $47,535.68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the purchase, the vehicle exhibited problems. The problems included the \"Check Engine\" light turning on, the USB outlets and cigarette outfits not working, the power supply fuse being blown, the vehicle making metal-to-metal sounds and rattling sounds, an exhaust leak, a broken stud on the exhaust manifold, a loose heat shield, and a spot appearing on the back-up camera display.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-5; Doc. No. 62-6; Doc. No. 62-7; Doc. No. 62-8. In response to these problems, Plaintiffs took the vehicle to be repaired on at least five separate occasions between May 2013 and May 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-3 (the \"Warranty Claim Summary Report\" identifying \"repair dates\" of April 10, 2013; January 14, 2015; February 24, 2015; April 8, 2015; May 17, 2016); Doc. No. 47-9 at 4 (expert report of Darrell Blasjo, Plaintiffs' automotive expert, stating that the vehicle was presented for service on May 11, 2015; January 13, 2015; February 23, 2015; and April 6, 2015); Doc. No. 65-5 at 3 (FCA stating that it is \"[u]ndisputed that Plaintiffs presented their vehicle for repairs as set forth in the repair orders\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2015, the vehicle was repossessed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-4 at 3-4. When the vehicle was repossessed, the vehicle had approximately 20,000 miles on the odometer and was still exhibiting problems, including making noises, engine problems, and the airbag light being on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-13 at 2-4; Doc. No. 62-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 9, 2016, Plaintiff Ignacio Ramos called FCA and asked to be reimbursed for the purchase of the vehicle because, according to Mr. Ramos, the vehicle was a lemon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40 at 3 (\"Undisputed Facts\" in the parties' joint pretrial statement); Doc. No. 62-10 (\"Customer Assistance Inquiry Record\" stating that \"Customer seeks: To get his payments\n   back\" and \"Customer states: Vehicle was a lemon\"). On FCA's \"Customer Assistance Inquiry Record\" - which appears to be an FCA business record that documented FCA's phone call with Mr. Ramos on April 9, 2016 - it states that there was a \"buzz,\" \"squeak,\" \"rattle,\" and \"unresolved noise after 4 visits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-2 at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 28, 2017, Plaintiffs filed suit against FCA in California state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1 at 2; Doc. No. 1-1 at 3. FCA then removed the lawsuit to this Court on grounds of diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiffs' complaint pleads three causes of action against FCA: (1) violation of the Song-Beverly Act for breaching an express warranty; (2) violation of the Song-Beverly Act for breaching an implied warranty; and (3) fraudulent inducement-concealment (\"fraudulent concealment\") of a known defect. The fraudulent concealment claim is essentially based on the following five allegations: (1) the vehicle is equipped with a Totally Integrated Power Module (\"TIPM\"); (2) the vehicle's TIPM was defective when Plaintiffs purchased the vehicle; (3) FCA knew the TIPM was defective; (4) FCA concealed from Plaintiffs the fact that the TIPM was defective; and (5) Plaintiffs would not have purchased the vehicle if they had known that the TIPM was defective.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A TIPM is an electronic module located in numerous vehicles manufactured by FCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-1 at 3; Doc. No. 47-2 at 2. The TIPM serves as a power distribution system for the vehicle and includes relays, fuses, and printed circuit boards mounted in a protective case located in the engine compartment of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 62-1 at 3. The location of the TIPM in the engine compartment varies from vehicle to vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-2 at 3. Each TIPM must be configured for the specific vehicle in which it is installed, and this is because TIPMs are specific to each FCA-manufactured vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FCA did not equip 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 vehicles with TIPMs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The complaint's allegations about the defective TIPM in Plaintiffs' vehicle are detailed and specific. For example, rather than broadly alleging that the vehicle was equipped with defective \"electrical system\" or a defective \"computer system\" or a defective \"power distribution system,\" the complaint specifically alleges that Plaintiffs' vehicle was equipped with a defective TIPM. The complaint makes at least 141 references to TIPMs. Some of the allegations about the defective TIPM in Plaintiffs' vehicle and FCA's fraudulent concealment of the defective TIPM are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13. The Subject Vehicle was factory-equipped with a Totally Integrated Power Module (\"TIPM\") which is located under the hood in the vehicle engine compartment. FCA US LLC equipped the Subject Vehicle with a TIPM that FCA US LLC refers to as the \"TIPM 7.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 16. The TIPM installed in the Subject Vehicle is defective and thus fails to reliably control and distribute power to various vehicle electrical systems and component parts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 17. As a result of the TIPM defect, the Subject Vehicle has made irregular rattling and buzzing noises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 20. FCA US LLC had superior and exclusive knowledge of the TIPM defects, and knew or should have known that the defects were not known by or reasonably discoverable by Plaintiffs before Plaintiffs purchased or leased the Subject Vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 92. FCA US LLC has never disclosed the TIPM defect to Plaintiffs prior to the purchase of the Subject Vehicle or at any point during ownership of the\n   Subject Vehicle, and FCA US LLC has never instructed its dealerships to disclose the TIPM defect to drivers or potential purchasers or lessees of vehicles equipped with the TIPM-7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 93. The TIPM defect was not known or reasonably discoverable by the Plaintiffs before purchase or lease, or without experiencing the defect first hand and exposing themselves to an unreasonable safety risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 96. As a result of FCA US LLC's inaction and silence, Plaintiffs were entirely unaware that Plaintiffs purchased, and continues to drive, unsafe and unreliable vehicles. As FCA US LLC knows a reasonable person would consider the TIPM defect important and would not purchase or lease a vehicle equipped with the TIPM defect were the defect disclosed in advance, or would pay substantially less for the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 141. FCA US LLC concealed a known defect from Plaintiffs. The defective component is called the totally integrated power module (or TIPM).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 143. FCA US LLC intentionally failed to disclose the known TIPM defect, which was known only to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 145. Plaintiffs reasonably, justifiably, and detrimentally relied on FCA US LLC's silence about the TIPM defect when deciding whether to purchase or lease a vehicle equipped with a TIPM-7, in part because FCA US LLC was, and still is, in a position of superior knowledge about the TIPM defects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 158. FCA US LLC's concealment of the TIPM defect was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs' harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 159. The concealment substantially influenced Plaintiffs to purchase to Subject Vehicle; Plaintiffs would not have purchased the Subject Vehicle had the TIPM defect been disclosed prior to sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Doc. No. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During discovery, Plaintiffs and FCA retained automotive experts. Plaintiffs retained Darrell Blasjo and FCA retained Jeff Richards. In Richards' expert report, which is dated June 18, 2018, Richards opined that Plaintiffs' vehicle's problems and repairs were not related to the TIPM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-13 at 7. When Richards was deposed on September 18, 2018, Richards testified that FCA did not equip 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 vehicles with TIPMs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Blasjo's expert report, which is dated June 26, 2018, Blasjo never opined that the vehicle was equipped with a TIPM, defective or otherwise, or that a TIPM was causing the problems with the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-9. When Blasjo was deposed on June 29, 2018, Blasjo testified that the problems with the vehicle did not involve the TIPM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-10 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 5, 2018, FCA served Plaintiffs with a Rule 68 offer to judgment in the amount of $40,000, plus attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-5 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62-1 at 3. Plaintiffs did not accept FCA's Rule 68 offer of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an individual pretrial statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the individual pretrial statement, Plaintiffs stated that they \"request leave to file their First Amended Complaint.\" Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   No. 33 at 13. The individual pretrial statement stated nothing further about amending the complaint, such as the proposed contents of the amended complaint, the legal basis for amending the complaint, why the request was being made after the amendment deadline, and whether Plaintiffs had discussed the requested amendment with FCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 4, 2019, Plaintiffs and FCA filed their joint pretrial statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40. Just as Plaintiffs did in their prior individual pretrial statement, Plaintiffs stated in the joint pretrial statement that they \"request leave to file their First Amended Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And just as Plaintiffs failed to do in their prior individual pretrial statement, Plaintiffs failed to say anything meaningful in the joint pretrial statement about their request to amend the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 28, 2019, FCA filed the motion for partial summary judgment that is now before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47. As will be discussed in greater detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the motion argued that Plaintiffs could not prevail on their fraudulent concealment claim because Plaintiffs' vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM. Then, eleven days later, on April 8, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51. In the motion for leave to amend, Plaintiffs conceded that their vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM, but Plaintiffs asserted that they \"recently\" learned that their vehicle was equipped with a defective PowerNet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A PowerNet is the electrical architecture installed in Plaintiffs' vehicle that controls virtually all of the vehicle's electrical components, according to Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51-2 at \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs asked the Court for leave to amend the complaint so that Plaintiffs could allege that the defect with the vehicle was with the PowerNet, not the TIPM, and that FCA fraudulently concealed the defective PowerNet from Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend because Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the \"good cause\" standard of Rule 16(b)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 85 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Consequently, Plaintiffs' original complaint remains the operative complaint in this lawsuit; and as previously discussed, the original complaint's fraudulent concealment claim is based on the allegation that Plaintiffs' vehicle is equipped with a defective TIPM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

First, Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the fraudulent concealment claim because the claim is premised on the allegation that Plaintiffs' vehicle is equipped with a defective TIPM, but it is now undisputed that the vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM. Second, Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the fraudulent concealment claim because the only harm Plaintiffs allegedly suffered from the fraudulent concealment is economic loss, and California's economic loss doctrine precludes recovery in tort when the plaintiff's damage consists solely of economic loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs now concede that their vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM, but Plaintiffs argue that summary judgment should be denied for four reasons. First, the fraudulent concealment claim in Plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint - which Plaintiffs presented to the Court via Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the complaint - alleges that the vehicle is equipped with a defective PowerNet, and FCA fraudulently concealed the defective PowerNet from Plaintiffs. Therefore, assuming Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend is granted, the fraudulent concealment claim is no longer premised on the false allegation that the vehicle is equipped with a defective TIPM but, instead, is premised on the allegation that the vehicle is equipped with a defective PowerNet. Second, the difference between a PowerNet and TIPM is \"simply an issue of a change in the nomenclature.\" Doc. No. 62 at 16. In making this second argument, Plaintiffs refer to the vehicle's defective system as the \"TIPM/PowerNet,\" as if the two systems are the same.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533921\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/1099/#p1102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, evidence of the vehicle's defective \"TIPM/PowerNet\" was available to FCA during discovery.

No. 85. Therefore, the Court rejects the arguments from Plaintiffs that assume that Plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint is the operative complaint. It is not. The operative complaint is Plaintiffs' original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   According to Plaintiffs' operative complaint, the material fact that FCA concealed from Plaintiffs is that the vehicle is equipped with a defective TIPM. As previously stated, it is now undisputed that Plaintiffs' vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM and was never supposed to be equipped with a TIPM.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 51 at 5 (Plaintiffs asserting that \"[i]t has recently come to light that the defective component in the Subject Vehicle is not a TIPM as alleged in the original complaint\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Doc. No. 47-2 (FCA's automotive expert, Richards, declaring that 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 vehicles are not equipped with TIPMs). Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot prove several essential elements of their fraudulent concealment claim - including the element that FCA fraudulently concealed the defective TIPM from Plaintiffs; the element that Plaintiffs would have acted differently if they had known about the defective TIPM; and the element that Plaintiffs sustained damages because of the concealed defective TIPM. Accordingly, summary judgment in FCA's favor is warranted on Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James River Ins.

No. 62 at 16; Doc. No. 51 at 7. Plaintiffs failed to support these assertions with admissible evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraser v.

And in fact, the evidence before the Court actually indicates that the TIPM and the PowerNet are different systems. For example, the manager of product investigations for FCA, James Bielenda, declared that the TIPM and the PowerNet use different electronic control modules and different configurations for the communication network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 65-3. And FCA's automotive expert, Richards, declared that the TIPM and the PowerNet are very different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 47-2 at \u00b6 9. Moreover, Plaintiffs clearly believe that the PowerNet is different from the TIPM system, at least to a significant degree: Plaintiffs attempted to amend their fraudulent concealment claim to allege that Plaintiffs' vehicle was equipped with a PowerNet, not a TIPM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' recent tactic of repeatedly calling the defective system the \"TIPM/PowerNet\" system, the Court considers this wordplay to be a disingenuous attempt at defeating summary judgment by muddying the factual waters. Prior to FCA's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs never referred to the defective system as the \"TIPM/Powernet.\" Instead, Plaintiffs referred to the defective system as the TIPM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-1 (Plaintiffs' complaint repeatedly referring to the TIPM but never referring to the PowerNet or the \"TIPM/PowerNet\"); Doc. No. 33-2 (Plaintiffs' individual pretrial statement exhibit list repeatedly referring to the TIPM but never referring to the PowerNet or the \"TIPM/PowerNet\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, in Plaintiffs' opposition to FCA's summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs repeatedly call the defective system the \"TIPM/PowerNet\" system. For example, Plaintiffs assert that (1) FCA \"concealed a known defect(s) with the TIPM/Powernet module,\" Doc. No. 62 at 16; (2) Plaintiffs were \"exposed to personal harm while driving the Subject Vehicle\n   as a result of problems with the TIPM/Powernet architecture,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23; (3) Plaintiffs' discovery responses provided FCA with sufficient \"notice of the evidence of TIPM/Powernet defect problems,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; (4) FCA had \"pre-sale knowledge of TIPM/Powernet defects,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18; and (5) FCA had exclusive knowledge of TIPM/Powernet defects and concealed those from Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet, despite Plaintiffs' recent and repeated use of the term \"TIPM/PowerNet,\" it is undisputed that Plaintiffs' vehicle was never equipped with a TIPM, and there is no evidence that Plaintiffs' vehicle was equipped with a defective \"TIPM/PowerNet,\" if such a thing even exists. Rather, the evidence before the Court is that the TIPM and the PowerNet are different systems - even if the PowerNet is the \"successor\" technology to the TIPM - and Plaintiffs' vehicle was equipped with the PowerNet. Thus, Plaintiffs' repeated use of the term \"TIPM/PowerNet\" is specious and unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' contention that the evidence identified during discovery was sufficient to put FCA on notice about the defective PowerNet in Plaintiffs' vehicle, the Court finds this contention unavailing and off-target. The Court is adjudicating a summary judgment motion, not a discovery motion. This means that the question before the Court is whether Plaintiffs, in response to FCA's evidence, presented evidence to the Court showing a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment claim. Plaintiffs have failed to do so, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , regardless of whether Plaintiffs identified sufficient evidence during discovery. Also, the Court finds Plaintiffs' discovery argument to be self-defeating. If Plaintiffs sufficiently identified evidence during discovery that put FCA on notice about the defective PowerNet in Plaintiffs' vehicle, then why are Plaintiffs simultaneously arguing in their motion for leave to amend the complaint that Plaintiffs just \"recently\" discovered \"new evidence\" about the defective PowerNet, especially when discovery closed approximately eleven months ago?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 51 at 3 (Plaintiffs asserting in their motion for leave to amend that \"Plaintiffs recently discovered new evidence that establishes Defendant's deliberate and fraudulent concealment of information regarding the electrical architecture present in several different models of Defendant's automobiles, including the Subject Vehicle\" and \"Plaintiffs could not have known about the problems with the PowerNet architecture prior to the performance of extensive research by Plaintiffs' counsel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, because the Court is granting summary judgment on the fraudulent concealment claim on grounds that Plaintiffs cannot prove essential elements of the claim, the Court declines to address FCA's alternative argument that the fraudulent concealment claim is barred by California's economic loss doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Punitive damages for fraudulent concealment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   FCA moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages. According to FCA, Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages is premised only on Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment claim, not on any of the other claims. Therefore, according to FCA, if summary judgment is granted on the fraudulent concealment claim, then there remains no basis to award punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court agrees. Plaintiffs' complaint does not specify the basis for the requested punitive damages, but in Plaintiffs' individual pretrial statement and in the parties' joint pretrial statement, Plaintiffs specified that the requested punitive damages\n   are based only on the fraudulent concealment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 33; Doc. No. 40. Therefore, because the Court is granting summary judgment on the fraudulent concealment claim, summary judgment is inherently being granted on Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Civil penalties for violation of Song-Beverly Act.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Parties' arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   FCA moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' request for civil penalties for FCA's alleged violation of the Song-Beverly Act. FCA argues that a vehicle manufacturer must \"willfully\" violate section 1973.2(d)(2) of the Song-Beverly Act in order for the plaintiff to be awarded civil penalties, and FCA did not willfully violate section 1973.2(d)(2) because FCA extended a Rule 68 offer of judgment to Plaintiffs. In other words, according to FCA, a vehicle manufacturer's offer to pay restitution for a nonconforming vehicle bars a finding that the manufacturer willfully violated section 1973.2(d)(2), even if the manufacturer's offer of restitution is made after the purchaser initiated litigation against the manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that summary judgment on the request for civil penalties should be denied for two reasons. First, a manufacturer's offer to pay restitution does not, as a matter of law, establish that the manufacturer did not willfully violate section 1973.2(d)(2). In other words, FCA can be found to have willfully violated section 1973.2(d)(2) even if FCA offered to pay restitution to Plaintiffs. Second, even if FCA did not willfully violate section 1973.2(d)(2), summary judgment on Plaintiffs' request for civil penalties is inappropriate because there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether FCA maintained a qualified third-party dispute resolution process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Discussion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that FCA violated the Song-Beverly Act because FCA breached the express warranty and then failed to promptly repair the vehicle or pay restitution. On account of this alleged violation of the Song-Beverly Act, Plaintiffs requested civil penalties under the Song-Beverly Act in addition to actual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-1 at \u00b6 128; Doc. No. 40 at 9; Doc. No. 62 at 12-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There are at least two different avenues for a purchaser of consumer goods to be awarded civil penalties under the Song-Beverly Act. The first avenue is under section 1794(c), which allows the purchaser to be awarded civil penalties if the manufacturer or seller \"willfully\" violated a warranty, a service contract, or a provision of the Song-Beverly Act, such as section 1793.2(d)(2), which will be discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Civ. Code 1794(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jernigan v.

The second avenue is under section 1794(e)(1)-(2), which allows the purchaser of a new vehicle to be awarded civil penalties if the following two conditions are met: (1) the vehicle manufacturer did not maintain a qualified third-party dispute resolution process that substantially complied with section 1793.22; and (2) the manufacturer violated section 1793.2(d)(2), which will be discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Under this second avenue, the purchaser does not need to prove \"willfulness\" to be awarded civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, in Plaintiffs' complaint and in the parties' joint pretrial statement, Plaintiffs requested civil penalties only under the \"willful\" avenue of section 1794(c), not under the \"dispute resolution process\" avenue of section 1794(e)(1)-(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

To support this argument, FCA cites primarily to\n   <em>\n    Hatami v. Kia Motors Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a non-binding judicial decision from the Central District of California.\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 08-cv-0226,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201396358\">\n    2009 WL 1396358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2009). The Court will discuss\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   , as well as other judicial decisions, to address and ultimately reject FCA's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff purchased a new vehicle in March 2006. The vehicle experienced problems, so between March 2006 and November 2007, the plaintiff made five separate attempts to have the vehicle repaired. Finally, in December 2007, the plaintiff demanded that the manufacturer pay restitution for the vehicle. The manufacturer responded by offering to inspect and repair the vehicle. Instead of responding to the manufacturer's offer to inspect and repair the vehicle, the plaintiff filed suit against the manufacturer in February 2008 for willfully violating section 1793.2(d)(2). In April 2008, which was before discovery commenced in the lawsuit, the manufacturer offered to pay restitution for the vehicle. The plaintiff and manufacturer engaged in restitution negotiations, but ultimately the plaintiff rejected the manufacturer's final restitution offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   At the summary judgment phase, the trial court ruled that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether the manufacturer violated section 1793.2(d)(2) because a factfinder could find that the manufacturer's restitution offer was not made \"promptly,\" as is required by section 1793.2(d)(2). But as for whether the manufacturer\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   violated section 1793.2(d)(2), the court ruled that summary judgment in the manufacturer's favor was warranted because the following three facts established a lack of willfulness: (1) the manufacturer responded to the plaintiff's original restitution demand by offering to inspect and repair the vehicle; (2) the manufacturer made multiple restitution offers to the plaintiff; and (3) the manufacturer's restitution offers were made after the lawsuit was filed, as opposed to before the lawsuit was filed, because the manufacturer wanted to be sure that the vehicle was truly nonconforming and warranted restitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   There are at least two significant distinctions between the facts in\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   and the facts here. First, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   the manufacturer offered to inspect and repair the vehicle immediately after the plaintiff's original restitution demand, here there is no evidence that FCA offered to inspect and repair Plaintiffs' vehicle shortly after Mr. Ramos called FCA and requested restitution on April 9, 2016. It is true that FCA could try to downplay this distinction by asserting that Plaintiffs were not in possession of the vehicle (due to the repossession) when Plaintiffs' originally requested restitution, which potentially could have affected FCA's ability to inspect and repair the vehicle. The parties have not addressed whether FCA had access to the vehicle after the vehicle was repossessed. But regardless, FCA cannot downplay the second distinction, which is that whereas in\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   the manufacturer offered to pay restitution for the vehicle approximately five months after the plaintiff originally demanded restitution and before discovery commenced, here FCA did not make the Rule 68 offer of judgment until twenty-six months after Plaintiffs made their original restitution demand, fourteen months after Plaintiffs filed suit, and several months after discovery commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   These distinctions are important because the crucial question is whether FCA's decision to not pay restitution\n   <em>\n    during the twenty-six months between Plaintiffs' original restitution request and FCA's eventual of fer of judgment\n   </em>\n   was based on FCA's good faith and reasonable belief that FCA was not required to promptly pay restitution, as is required by section 1793.2(d)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4555371\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/23/174/#p184\">\n    23 Cal.

Based on the available facts at this summary judgment phase, a reasonable factfinder could infer an absence of good faith and reasonable belief on FCA's part due to the fact that FCA's offer of judgment was made so long after Plaintiffs' original restitution request. Further, unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   , here FCA has failed to provide an explanation for why it waited twenty-six months to extend the offer of judgment. For these reasons,\n   <em>\n    Hatami\n   </em>\n   does not persuade the Court to conclude that there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether FCA willfully violated section 1793.2(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela v.

In both\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff purchased a new vehicle that experienced problems. The plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to have the vehicle repaired on five separate occasions. The plaintiff then filed suit against the manufacturer, requesting civil penalties for the manufacturer's willful violation of section 1793.2(d)(2). Before the plaintiff filed suit, the plaintiff never requested replacement or restitution from the manufacturer. Then, approximately four months after the plaintiff filed suit, the manufacturer served the plaintiff with an offer of compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   At the summary judgment phase, the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   ruled that summary judgment in the manufacture's favor was warranted as to the plaintiff's request for civil penalties. The court made this ruling because it could not find evidence demonstrating that the manufacturer intentionally avoided its obligations under section 1793.2(d)(2) to promptly offer to replace the vehicle or pay restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   There are two significant distinctions between the facts here and the facts in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   . First, whereas the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   filed suit against the manufacturer before requesting replacement or restitution, here Plaintiffs requested restitution from FCA almost twelve months before filing suit. Second, whereas the manufacture in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   made offers of compromise approximately four months after the plaintiffs filed suit, here FCA waited approximately fourteen months after litigation commenced to extend the Rule 68 offer of judgment. These distinctions are important because Plaintiffs' request for restitution placed FCA on notice that FCA may be obligated under section 1793.2(d)(2) to promptly replace the vehicle or pay restitution. But FCA waited approximately twenty-six months to extend the Rule 68 offer of judgment, and the evidence at this summary judgment phase does not conclusively prove that FCA's prolonged delay was due to FCA's \"good faith and reasonable belief.\" Therefore, because of these significant factual distinctions,\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyzo\n   </em>\n   do not persuade the Court to conclude that there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether FCA willfully violated section 1793.2(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff purchased a new motorcycle in November 2004. During the next six months, the plaintiff took the motorcycle to be repaired on five separate occasions. Then, in June 2005, the plaintiff requested replacement of the motorcycle or restitution because, according to the plaintiff, there was an alleged problem with the motorcycle. One week later, the manufacturer responded to the request, asking that the plaintiff bring the motorcycle in to be inspected and repaired. The manufacturer also stated that the repair mechanics in the past had never been able to duplicate the plaintiff's alleged problem with the motorcycle, had observed excessive mileage on the motorcycle, which indicated that there was not a recurrent problem, and noted that the plaintiff had previously brought the motorcycle in for repairs unrelated to the alleged problem. In July 2005, the manufacturer offered to pay restitution in an effort to resolve the matter. In August 2005, the manufacture extended another restitution offer. In September 2005, the manufacture reiterated the terms of the restitution offer from August 2005. The plaintiff then filed suit against the manufacturer for willfully violating section 1793.2(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At the summary judgment phase, the trial court ruled that the manufacturer violated section 1793.2(d)(1). But on appeal, the appellate court ruled that the manufacturer did not willfully violate section 1793.2(d)(1). According to the appellate court, there was no evidence of willfulness because, in part, there was a span of only six weeks between the plaintiff's original demand and the manufacturer's original offer to pay restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Unlike the manufacturer in Dominguez, here FCA waited until approximately twenty-six months from Plaintiffs' original request for restitution to extend the Rule 68 offer of judgment. And as previously stated, this lengthy delay could allow a reasonable factfinder to infer an absence of good faith and reasonable belief on FCA's part. For example, based on the evidence at this summary judgment phase, a reasonable factfinder could infer that FCA's lengthy delay in extending the offer of judgment was due to FCA's negligence, indifference, or deliberate attempt to discourage Plaintiffs from seeking and receiving restitution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lukather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4213689\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/181/1041/#p1051\">\n    181 Cal.

That consideration is as follows: To what extent and under what circumstances did the manufacturer\n   <em>\n    wait\n   </em>\n   to extend the offer of replacement or restitution? To be clear, this consideration is not to be confused with the question of whether the manufacturer \"promptly\" complied with its obligations under section 1793.2(d)(2), although the two are factually related. The extent to and the circumstances under which the manufacturer waited to make an offer of replacement or restitution can be very indicative of whether the manufacture acted in \"good faith\n   and reasonable belief\" to comply with its obligations under section 1793.2(d)(2). The following hypothetical illustrates this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   A dealership for a sophisticated and international vehicle manufacturer sells a new vehicle to a purchaser. The purchaser is of average or below-average means and sophistication. The purchaser discovers that the vehicle has problems. The purchaser repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempts to have the vehicle repaired. The purchaser requests replacement or restitution. The manufacture learns that the vehicle is nonconforming to the express warranty, and the manufacture becomes subject to the obligation of section 1793.2(d)(2). But despite the obligation to promptly offer replacement or restitution, the manufacturer deliberately decides that it will test the waters, so to speak, and see whether the purchaser is truly committed to obtaining a replacement or restitution. For example, before offering a replacement or restitution, the manufacturer deliberately waits to see if the purchaser will initiate litigation. Or, if the purchaser does initiate litigation, the manufacturer waits even longer to see how zealous and effective the purchaser is during litigation before offering a replacement or restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This hypothetical, which is well within the pale of possibility, illustrates a manufacture's calculated and intentional attempt to thin the heard: to those purchasers who are truly committed and eventually initiate zealous litigation, the manufacturer reluctantly offers replacement or restitution; but to those impotent purchasers who do not pursue litigation, the manufacture withholds replacement and restitution. If a manufacturer operated on this or a similar basis, then the manufacturer could be found to have acted in bad faith,\n   <em>\n    even if the manufacturer eventually offers replacement or restitution\n   </em>\n   . This could be especially true if the manufacturer has a history or policy of operating on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4869193\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/35/112/#p136\">\n    35 Cal.

But at this summary judgment phase, the evidence does not establish that FCA did not act like the manufacturer in the hypothetical or, alternatively, did not act negligently or indifferently during the twenty-six months prior to extending the offer of judgment. Therefore, because this issue of material fact remains unresolved, the question must proceed to trial, where the factfinder will likely ask, \"Why did FCA wait approximately twenty-six months to offer restitution to the Plaintiffs?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   1.
