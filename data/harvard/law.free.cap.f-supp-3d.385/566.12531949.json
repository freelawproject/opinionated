GOLDSMITH, United States District Judge\n   On December 12, 2018, the Court amended the Group Two Defendants' scheduling order and set a briefing schedule for any motion seeking relief under\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    536 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), and its progeny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/12/2018 Order (Dkt. 652). As part of the new schedule, if one or both of the Group Two Defendants filed a notice of an\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim by March 15, 2019, the Government was directed to file a memorandum by March 27, 2019, which would identify the neuropsychological experts upon whom it intends to rely in opposition to any\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   motions, include those experts' curricula vitae, and give notice of the type and scope of the proposed neuropsychological testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/12/2018 Order at 1-2. Defendants were then afforded an opportunity to file objections to the Government's proposed neuropsychological testing by April 3, 2019, and the Government could respond to those objections by April 10, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In accordance with this schedule, after Defendant Carlo Wilson filed a notice of an\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim (Dkt. 814), the Government filed its memorandum (Dkt. 849), setting forth numerous tests that its expert-Dr. Robert L. Denney, Psy.D., ABPP-proposes to conduct. Included among those tests are the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-RF, the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3 Self-Report, and Performance Validity Testing. The Government also requests that Wilson disclose the results and raw data of the testing his experts performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Wilson filed objections to those three tests, as well as opposing the Government's disclosure request (Dkt. 860). Wilson also requested that defense counsel be present during all or some of the Government's neuropsychological testing, and that the Government's testing be video recorded. The Government then responded (Dkt. 870), and Wilson replied (Dkt. 876). At the Court's direction, the Government filed a supplemental brief with the scholarly literature alluded to by Dr. Denney regarding third-party observers and their effects on testing validity (Dkt. 892), to which Wilson replied (Dkt. 908).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, there are three issues raised in the parties' filings that require the Court's resolution: (i) the Government's request for the disclosure of testing results and raw data; (ii) Wilson's objections to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-RF, the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3 Self-Report, and Performance Validity Testing; and (iii) Wilson's requests for a third-party observer during the Government's testing (both defense counsel and video recording). The Court will address each issue in turn, denying the Government's request, overruling Wilson's objections, and denying Wilson's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Government's Request for Disclosure of Testing Results and Raw Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its memorandum, the Government first claims that it cannot identify all potentially necessary neuropsychological testing without Wilson disclosing the results and raw data of tests that have been conducted thus far. Gov't Mem. at 9. Because he filed a notice of an intellectual disability, the Government claims that Wilson has put his mental health \"in issue\" and, therefore, he has waived any privilege he had to his medical and psychological records as it relates to the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Thus, the Government requests that Wilson be compelled to disclose the test results and raw data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Government emphasizes that it is not seeking expert reports that may have been prepared based on the testing results and raw data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his objections, Wilson recognizes that the \"timing surrounding disclosure of the requested material was already argued by the parties and contemplated by the Court when the Court issued its Scheduling Order.\" Def. Objs. at 20. According to Wilson, the Government's \"request is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the Court's Order and obtain material prior to the date on which it is due.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Wilson requests that the Court \"reject the Government's invitation to relitigate issues already decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wilson's point is well founded; the Government should have addressed the disclosure of testing results and raw data earlier during the numerous conferences held concerning the parties'\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   litigation. Therefore, the Government's belated request for this material is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Wilson's Testing Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-RF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its list of proposed neuropsychological testing, the Government includes the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-RF (\"MMPI-2-RF\"). Gov't Mem. at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilson objects to the Government's use of this test, which consists of true-false questions, claiming that MMPI-2-RF \"is an actuarial tool which is commonly used to assess personality disorders and malingering.\" Def. Objs. at 4. But whether a person has a personality disorder is \"irrelevant to the determination of whether he is a person with [an intellectual disability].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nor is the MMPI-2-RF appropriate to assess malingering for people with an intellectual disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is especially problematic, says Wilson, because the test requires \"at least a 6th grade reading level and a level of literacy which most people with [intellectual disability] have not achieved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Although alternative administrations of the test are available, such as a computerized version with audio that reads the questions aloud to the examinee, Wilson claims that \"this version has not been validated for use by people with [intellectual disability].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wilson further states that test is biased with discriminatory results because the \"MMPI-2 over-pathologizes African American men, identifying them as more antisocial, more likely to malinger and fake, more deviant, having more anger and more bizarre thinking, compared to white men.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its response to Wilson's objections, the Government states that the MMPI-2-RF tests \"emotional functioning,\" which \"can interfere with the testing, and measurement, of the subject's intellectual functioning.\" Gov't Resp. at 2. Accordingly, the Government claims that Dr. Denney \"believes that this test will be useful, that it is an important element in conducting a broad-based assessment, and will assist him in reaching a professional opinion as to intellectual functioning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government further posits that MMPI-2-RF can be used for individuals of low intellectual functioning because \"it has an auditory administration potential for low reading ability, and it has internal consistency-related validity indices which would demonstrate whether or not the examinee understood the items.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. As for Wilson's claim of bias, the Government claims that \"[t]hree relatively recent MMPI-2-RF studies found very limited evidence of very limited bias, most of which involved under-prediction of psychopathology in minority groups.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court overrules Wilson's objection to the Government's administration of the MMPI-2-RF. Because Wilson has failed to articulate any specific prejudice or tangible harm of the administration of the test itself, the Court finds that the test is not unnecessarily burdensome on Wilson. It is true that the MMPI-2-RF test has received criticism when assessing malingering in individuals with intellectual disability,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Karen L. Salekin &amp; Bridget M. Doane, \"Malingering Intellectual Disability: The Value of Available Measures and Methods,\"\n   <em>\n    Applied Neuropsychology\n   </em>\n   , Vol. 16, at (2009) (\"Across the board, all of the measures that were identified as either 'recommended' or 'acceptable' [for the assessment of malingering], have now been found to be [ ] unacceptable for use when assessing individuals with ID,\" including MMPI-2.). However, the ultimate issue of admissibility and weight of any such testing results can, and should, be addressed in the parties'\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   briefing and argued at the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roland\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-298,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20752831\">\n    2017 WL 752831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (D.N.J. Feb. 27, 2017) (overruling the defendant's objection to the administration of the MMPI-2-RF, and noting that admissibility and weight will be argued at the parties'\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3 Self-Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its list of proposed neuropsychological testing, the Government also includes the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-3 Self-Report (\"ABAS-3\"). Gov't Mem. at 6. Wilson objects to the use of this test for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, Wilson argues that self-reporting by an individual with intellectual disability of his or her own adaptive behavioral capabilities is disfavored by the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"AAIDD\"), especially when the individual has mild intellectual disability and may exaggerate adaptive abilities to appear more competent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Because it \"may contain a certain degree of bias,\" self-reporting should be interpreted with caution when determining an individual's level of adaptive behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Here, Wilson claims that he has mild intellectual disability and, therefore, self-reporting should not be permitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, although the AAIDD does not recommend a complete ban on self-reporting for the diagnosis of intellectual disability, Wilson contends that, \"before any instrument is used to measure adaptive behavior, it must be established that it has been appropriately normed for the relevant population.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. According to Wilson, the ABAS-3 Self-Report does not satisfy the norming requirements\n   because the test under-sampled Midwestern states, it over-sampled Southern states, and the reliability of the test relied on only thirty-seven people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Third, Wilson argues that the Government should not be permitted to administer the ABAS-3 because he has been incarcerated for nearly three years and \"[a]ssessing deficits in adaptive functioning among prisoners is ... complicated because no measures of adaptive functioning have been designed or normed for use with prisoners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its response to Wilson's objections, the Government claims that an \"adaptive behavior assessment is a valid tool for addressing the question of whether the subject has any significant limitations in adaptive functioning,\" and it emphasizes that the AAIDD's standards do not preclude the use of self-reports. Gov't Resp. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the same reasons stated above regarding the MMPI-2-RF, the Court overrules Wilson's objection, permits the Government to administer the ABAS-3 Self-Report, and allows the parties to address the admissibility and weight of any results gleaned from this testing in their\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Northington\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-550-05,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n    2012 WL 4024944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 12, 2012) (overruling the defendant's objection to the administration of the ABAS-II, but noting that the court's decision \"does not necessarily mean that expert testimony or conclusions based upon these tests will be admitted, considered, or accepted by the Court at the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Performance Validity Testing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Last, in its list of proposed neuropsychological testing, the Government seeks to administer \"Performance Validity Testing.\" Gov't Mem. at 6. Wilson objects to this sort of testing because it is not sufficiently specific. Def. Objs. at 19. Although performance validity tests assess effort and feigning and are often used to assert that a person is malingering, Wilson argues that the Government's listing of \"performance validity testing\" is neither a test or is it notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, there are many tests for malingering, says Wilson, but \"almost none of them are established for use with people with ID and all have poor sensitivity and specificity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its response, the Government claims that it is appropriate to designate the validity testing in its notice, \"but not identify by name, the specific tests,\" because these tests can be easily defeated. Gov't Resp. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the district court did in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Northington\n   </em>\n   , this Court overrules Wilson's objection, but it orders the Government \"to give notice to defense counsel when testing has been completed, and to provide to defense counsel the names of the malingering tests administered to Defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n    2012 WL 4024944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Defense counsel may then raise objections, if any, to the Government's performance validity testing at the time of the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Wilson's Requests for Presence of Counsel and Video Recording\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Wilson also filed an ex parte motion for leave to file excess pages for his supplemental reply brief (Dkt. 907), which the Court grants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Although the Government's memorandum identified the test as MMPI-2, Wilson notes that the Government is likely seeking to conduct the MMPI-2-RF test, which has supposedly replaced the MMPI-2 test in forensic practice. Def. Objs. at 5. The Government clarifies in its response to Wilson's objections that it intends to conduct the MMPI-2-RF test.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gov't Resp. at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Finally, Wilson makes the following two requests in his objections: (i) permit defense counsel to be present in the room during the Government's expert's interviewing and/or testing of Wilson, and (ii) authorize the video recording of any testing performed. The Court will address and deny each request in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Right to Counsel During the Government's Neuropsychological Testing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Regarding his first request, Wilson acknowledges that his\n    <em>\n     Atkins\n    </em>\n    claim has resulted\n    in a limited waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights, but only with respect to matters relevant to his supposed intellectual disability. Def. Objs. at 22. Wilson claims that he has a right to have counsel present during any examination \"to advise him and to interpose appropriate objections,\" thereby protecting \"his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent as to matters beyond the scope of the [\n    <em>\n     Atkins\n    </em>\n    ] hearing, and to effectuate his Sixth Amendment rights.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204024944\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Gibbs v.

Insofar as Wilson's counsel is not permitted to be physically present during the formal test examination itself, Wilson requests that his counsel be present during any interview portion, and then be afforded a \"nearby venue in which to sit and monitor proceedings, with an audio feed, so that counsel has an opportunity to object, albeit not simultaneously, if necessary.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 23. At the very least, counsel should be provided a nearby venue to sit, observe, and listen to both the interviewing and the testing of Wilson.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 23. The Court disagrees with Wilson that any of these procedures are necessary to protect his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    First, courts have held that defense counsel's presence during a mental health examination is not necessary to protect a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights because Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2 provides that \" '[n]o statement made by a defendant in the course of any examination conducted under this rule ... and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition' on which the defendant has introduced expert evidence pursuant to rule 12.2.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
