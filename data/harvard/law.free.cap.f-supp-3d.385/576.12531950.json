CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This lawsuit arose as a result of a failed merger between wrestling entities. In one corner are Global Force Entertainment, Inc. (\"GFE\") and Jeffrey Jarrett, who bring a number of federal and state law claims. In the other, are Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment, Corp. (\"Anthem Sports\") and Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC (\"Anthem Wrestling\"), who have filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 61) the majority of those claims. Anthem Sports has also filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (Doc. No. 58). Both Motions have been fully briefed by the parties (Doc. Nos. 59, 62, 70, 74, 75), and will be considered after a brief recitation of the relevant facts as they are alleged in the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") (Doc. No. 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jarrett, a seventeen-time world wrestling champion, and World Wrestling Entertainment hall-of-famer, is a Tennessee resident. (SAC \u00b6 \u00b6 15, 16). In 2014, he formed GFE for the purpose of promoting wrestling events and creating original wrestling programming for pay-per-view and television markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). GFE is the owner of the \"Global Force Wrestling\" (\"GFW\") brand, and owns trademarks and associated registrations for use in connection with \"(1) posters and photographs; (2) insulated containers for beverage cans for domestic use; (3) clothing, including, but not limited to, t-shirts, bandanas and hats; (4) streaming of audio and video material on the Internet; and (5) entertainment services, including, but not limited to, wrestling exhibitions and performances by professional wrestlers and entertainers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20). GFE also uses a logo with a distinctive green color for GFW on its website and in interstate commerce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 24, August 21, and October 23, 2015, in Las Vegas, Nevada, GFE produced sixteen (16) hours of original wrestling programming to market to television and pay-per-view markets. The collective content was called \"GFW Amped\" and featured completely original content developed and owned solely by GFE, including appearances by Jarrett. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, 29). Plaintiffs believe each one-hour segment is worth $ 300,000 or more, and applications (with the requisite fees) were filed for federal copyright registration for each of them. (Doc. No. 25, 26, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Anthem Sports was formed in 2010 when Leonard Asper acquired a majority stake in the Fight Network. Fight Network is an English language television channel that broadcasts programming related to mixed martial arts, boxing, kickboxing and professional wrestling throughout the world. It is available digitally through streaming services such as Apple TV, Roku, computers, and tablets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2016, Anthem Sports approached Plaintiff about merging with GFE in exchange for membership and equity shares in Anthem Sports. The discussions\n   also concerned hiring Jarrett as Chief Creative Officer for the wrestling portion of Anthem Sports. In conjunction with the merger and employment discussions, GFE and Anthem Sports entered into a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"NDA\") on December 9, 2016. (Doc. No. 17). Several months later, on December 23, 2016, Anthem Sports formed Anthem Wrestling. (Doc. No. 54, SAC \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2017, Anthem Wrestling retained Jarrett as a consultant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). Around this same time, Jarrett provided Defendants with the only set of masters for the sixteen, one-hour episodes of GFW Amped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Several months later, in May 2017, Jarett and Anthem Wrestling executed a term sheet in relation to both Jarrett's employment as Chief Creative Officer of Anthem Wrestling and the merger. Among other things, the term sheet made clear that GFE owned all of the GFW Amped content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In anticipation of a \"Slammiversary\" pay-per-view event in June 2017, Anthem Wrestling issued a press release announcing the acquisition of GFE, and indicating that Jarrett would be joining Anthem Wrestling as an equity owner and member of its board of managers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). However, Anthem and GFE never completed the merger contemplated by the term sheet, and Jarett's employment with Anthem Wrestling was terminated in October 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite the failed merger, \"Defendants reproduced, distributed, publicly displayed, offered for sale, and sold the GFW Amped content without providing any compensation or royalties to GFE or Mr. Jarrett.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). This began with Defendants promoting the GFW Amped content as a four-part pay-per-view program on July 19, 2017, and continued with the airing of that content on the Fight Network website. Thereafter, Defendants aired \"GFW Amped Anthology\" in four parts between August and December 2017 as part of their \"One Night Only Series.\" Anthem Wrestling continues to sell DVD copies of the GFW Amped content on its website, and through other online retail outlets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-59, 60). Additionally, Defendants launched a new subscription streaming service known as Global Wrestling Network (\"GWN\") that features archived content from other predecessor wrestling entities run by Jarrett. GWN also uses a similar logo with \"a green color identical or nearly identical to the green color in GFE's logo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At some point, Defendants destroyed the only masters of the GFW Amped series that Jarrett had provided to them. This meant that Plaintiffs could not complete the trademark registration process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based upon the foregoing events, Plaintiffs sue Defendants for (1) copyright infringement under the Copyright Act; (2) violations of the Tennessee Personal Rights Protection Act; (3) trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false designation of origin under the Lanham Act; (4) unfair competition under Tennessee law; (5) violations of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act; and (6) tortious interference under Tennessee law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction by Anthem Sports\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constrains a State's authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its courts,\"\n   <em>\n    Walden v.

Although asserting that the \"claims in this lawsuit are not brought under\" the NDA, they claim that agreement is \"background for the relationships between the parties.\" (SAC \u00b6 40). However, that \"background\" shows that Anthem Sports agreed to be sued in New York based on New York law in accordance with paragraph 13 of the NDA. (Doc. No. 17 at 3). Further, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that \"[i]n or around May 2017, Anthem Wrestling and Mr. Jarrett signed a term sheet regarding Mr. Jarrett's employment as the Chief Creative Officer of Anthem Wrestling and the merger to be completed in which Anthem Wrestling would acquire GFE.\" (Doc. 43). While that document indicates that any disputes would be decided by a court in Davidson County, Tennessee, the agreement was between Plaintiffs and Anthem Wrestling, not Anthem Sports. All of this suggests that Anthem Sports agreed to sue and be sued in New York, not Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs also point out that Defendants jointly argued in their Motion to Dismiss that they \"entered into an implied license with Plaintiffs, who are Tennessee residents,\" and that \"Anthem Sports cannot argue in one motion it has entered an implied agreement, while simultaneously arguing it has not contacts with Plaintiffs connected to this litigation.\" (Doc. No. 67 at 8). However, even assuming that an implied license is some sort of magic elixir establishing personal jurisdiction, Anthem Sports has not impermissibly pursued two contrary positions. The motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was filed by both Defendants in conjunction with Anthem Sports' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. In both, Anthem Sports indicated that it had entered a special appearance to preserve the personal jurisdiction issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs claim that, because Defendants received copies of the masters from a Tennessee resident, specific jurisdiction exists in this Court. But how that is so as to Anthem Sports is never made clear in the papers. As already explained, and put even more plainly, Plaintiffs have wholly failed to show any activity or presence\n   of that entity in Tennessee in relation to the dispute at issue, and have thus also failed to establish specific jurisdiction over Anthem Sports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In moving to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims, Defendants argue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   First, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have failed to state an adequate claim of copyright infringement (Count I) because they have failed to register their copyrights prior to the filing of this action. Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs cannot state an adequate claim under the Tennessee Personal Rights Protection Act (Count II) because Jeff Jarrett has previously authorized the use of his name and likeness as a trademark and Defendants own that trademark. Third, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' claims of copyright infringement and its trademark infringement-related claims (Counts III-X) must be dismissed because Plaintiff Jarrett granted Defendants a license for all acts about which he now complains. Fourth, Plaintiffs have failed to state an adequate claim for abandonment such that their claim to cancel Defendants' \"JEFF JARETT\" trademark (Count XVII) should be dismissed. And, finally, Defendants assert that this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' state law claims for unfair competition (Count VIII), unjust enrichment (Count IX), consumer protection (Count X), conversion and trover (County XI), and negligence (Count XII) because, in the absence of their claims under the U.S. Copyright Act and the Lanham Act, this Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims, especially due to the lack of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Doc.

These issues are something that can only be determined after discovery, and in the context of a motion for summary judgment where the actual facts have been developed.

After all, Plaintiff allege that after Anthem Sports initiated merger discussion, Jarrett was hired by Anthem Wrestling as a consultant to whom Jarrett provided the only set of masters for the Amped Content. Defendant assert in addition that, shortly after being hired as a consultant, Jarrett became Chief Creative Officer for Anthem Wrestling, \"with responsibility for all wrestling operations and overall responsibility and full authority for the company's content and programming of all types,\" and that it was \"[u]nder his watch as Chief Creative Officer\" the Amped Content was produced as a pay-per-view. (Doc. No. 62 at 11). Defendants submit that \"facts similar to this case\" were presented in\n   <em>\n    Mahavisno v. Compendia Bioscience, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339146\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/964/#p968\">\n    164 F. Supp. 3d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968-69 (E.D. Mich. 2016), where an implied license was found to exist when a source code for software was provided to defendant in exchange for an interest in defendant's company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There are two fundamental problems with Defendants' argument. First,\n   <em>\n    Mahavisno\n   </em>\n   was decided in the context of a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss. This is understandable given the factors that must be considered in determining whether an implied license exists. As explained in another case decided in the context of summary judgment and relied on by Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   An \"implied license\" is an unwritten license to use a work that the court infers from the circumstances and from the conduct between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.

Grusenmeyer &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Davison, Smith &amp; Certo Architects, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Fed.%20Appx.%20510\">\n    212 Fed. Appx. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514 (6th Cir. 2007). That is, the court should explore, based on the facts and the circumstances of the individual case, whether the evidence supports the notion that the parties, in\n   essence, made an agreement permitting the defendant to use the work, consistent with certain understandings or terms.\n   <em>\n    Johnson [v. Jones]\n   </em>\n   , 149 F.3d [494] at 500-02 [ (6th Cir. 1998) ]. The key issue, again, is intent, and the key question is whether the facts and the circumstances demonstrate that \"the copyright owners intended that their copyrighted works be used in the manner in which they were eventually used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 502. Generally, the party claiming the existence of an implied license has the burden of proving the license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bourne v. Walt Disney Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414330\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/621/#p631\">\n    68 F.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (2nd Cir. 1995).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Melanie Howard Music, Inc. v.

Clearly, the intent of the parties and the totality of the circumstances cannot be discerned solely from the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, while \"plaintiff can plead himself out of court by alleging facts which show that he has no claim,\"\n   <em>\n    Soo Line R.R.

Defendants insist that Jarrett had \"complete authority\" over Anthem Wrestling's operations and the \"content that the company would create, market and sell.\" (Doc. No. 62 at 2). Those \"facts,\" however, are not alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, and hence are not properly before the Court on a motion to dismiss. As a consequence, none of Plaintiffs' claims will be dismissed on the grounds that Defendants allegedly had an implied license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Abandonment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In Count Thirteen, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants abandoned the \"JEFF JARRETT\" trademark when Jarrett left his employment with Anthem Wrestling, and assert that Defendants have \"no legitimate intent to resume use\" of the mark. (SAC\u00b6\u00b6 189, 191). As a consequence, Plaintiff seek \"cancellation of U.S.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C269%2C268\">\n    Registration No. 3,269,268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for JEFF JARRETT.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192). In response, Defendants point out the inconsistency between alleging, on the one hand, that Defendants have abandoned the Jeff Jarrett mark, while, on the other, alleging infringement by their use of Jarrett's named, photograph, likeness, and videorecorded performance. They also note that Jarrett left his employment with Anthem Wrestling at the end of October 2017, which was less than a year before the initial Complaint was filed in this Court, and far less than the three years for abandonment set forth in the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This is a close question, but the Court will allow the abandonment claim to go forward at this time. Plaintiffs can plead inconsistent theories of recovery under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that \"a party may state as many claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). Admittedly, the factual allegations surrounding the abandonment claim are sparse. Still, it is difficult to allege a negative (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that Defendants are not using a trademark) beyond merely saying so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cerveceria Centroamericana, S.A. v.
