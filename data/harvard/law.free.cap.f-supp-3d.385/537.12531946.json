(\"ExteNet\"), (Dkt. 36), Defendants Greg Abbott (the \"Governor\") and Ken Paxton (the \"attorney general\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 37), Defendant Mobilitie LLC (\"Mobilitie\"), (Dkt. 38), Defendant T-Mobile West LLC (\"T-Mobile\"), (Dkt. 39), and Defendant Crown Castle NG Central LLC (\"Crown Castle\"), (Dkt. 42). Given the similarities between the motions and the arguments made by the Defendants, the Court will consider them and the arguments they raise collectively. Having considered the parties' briefs, the evidence, and the relevant law, the Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2017, the governor signed SB 1004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   SB 1004 imposes certain standards on the process for permitting telecommunications companies to install \"small cell nodes\" on utility poles, traffic lights, or street signals in the public right of way (\"ROW\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Loc. Gov't Code \u00a7 284.001(a)(1), (5), (8)-(10). These small cell nodes provide the capacity to reliably serve large crowds, and they will eventually serve as a foundation for developing a 5G network. Before SB 1004, the State did not limit the fees municipalities could charge for issuing permits to install and use small cell nodes in their ROW or the time within which a city must process permit applications. SB 1004 places two temporal restrictions on the permit application process: a prohibition of \"moratoria\"-a period during which a municipality will not issue permits-and a \"shot clock\"-a specified time period within which an application must be reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff the City of Austin (the \"City\") sued the State of Texas and the governor seeking an injunction that would prevent the implementation of SB 1004. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. 1). The City argued that SB 1004 is pre-empted by Sections 253(c) and 332(c)(7) of the Federal Telecommunications Act (\"FTA\"). (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 35-38). The City moved for a preliminary injunction, which the Court denied because it concluded that the City was unlikely to succeed on its pre-emption claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Order, Dkt. 12). The City then amended its complaint to add parties as defendants, including several telecommunications companies and the attorney general, and abandon one of its claims. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 22). Each Defendant has moved to dismiss the City's complaint. (Dkts. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(1), a court may dismiss a complaint for \"lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the court lacks \"the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v.

There are three avenues for a movant to demonstrate a lack of jurisdiction: (1) on the face of the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts in the record; and (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts and the court's resolution of disputed facts.\n   <em>\n    Montez v. Dep't of Navy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9187260\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/147/#p149\">\n    392 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (5th Cir. 2004). The party invoking the court's jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction exists.\n   <em>\n    Ramming v.

Where a state's sovereign immunity deprives the court of jurisdiction, the claims barred by sovereign immunity must be dismissed only under Rule 12(b)(1) and not with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Warnock v. Pecos County, Tex.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044334\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/341/#p343\">\n    88 F.3d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343 (5th Cir. 1996). Dismissal under 12(b)(1) is not a determination on the merits and does not prevent a plaintiff from pursuing a claim in a court with proper jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Ramming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391482,9395598\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/158/\">\n    281 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 37, at 2). Finally, each Defendant argues that the City fails to state a claim because the statutes identified by the City do not pre-empt SB 1004.

In response, the City argues that the attorney general has a sufficient connection to the law to allow him to be sued, as shown by the attorney general's pattern of repeatedly suing the City to enforce state law over City ordinances, regulations, and policies.

While the attorney general contends that his connection to SB 1004 is insufficiently close to allow him to\n   be named here, he has often argued the opposite.

The State Defendants argue that the City has not shown any of the three components of standing. (State Defs.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 37, at 4-5). The Court disagrees. As the Court has already found in its order denying the City's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (Order, Dkt. 12, at 3), the City has pled sufficient facts to demonstrate that the City will lose revenue based on the implementation of SB 1004,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the revenue will be lost because of the statute, and an order enjoining SB 1004's implementation would redress that injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. 12(b)(6): Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court turns now to the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) arguments attacking the merits of the City's pre-emption claims. The City argues that a clear reading of the statute and the legislative history indicates that Section 253(c) of the FTA pre-empts SB 1004 because SB 1004 purports to eliminate the authority that 253(c) intended to grant local governments, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, Dkt. 12).

There is no affirmative restriction on State power in this section.

Here too, the City's arguments have not materially changed since its motion for preliminary injunction. Section 332(c)(7)(B) is a pre-emption clause that contains specific limitations on the authority of state and local governments to regulate the telecommunications sector. Relevant here, Section 332(c)(7)(B)(ii) states that federal law pre-empts state and local authority with respect to the time in which the government must act on a request for authorization to site \"personal wireless services facilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7)(B)(ii) (\"A State or local government shall act [on applications for wireless service siting] within a reasonable period of time ....\"). The statute also directs state and local governments to process siting applications without unreasonable delay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the Court explained in its earlier order, (Dkt. 12, at 8-9), the FCC, in responding to complaints from cellular service providers that state and local governments were taking too long to process siting applications, issued an order interpreting the phrase \"reasonable period of time\" in Section 332(c)(7)(B)(ii).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20FCC%20Rcd%2013994\">\n    24 FCC Rcd. 13994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That interpretation was upheld by the Supreme Court as a legitimate exercise of the authority delegated by Congress to the FCC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/\">\n    569 U.S. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1867,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The City contends that Section 332(c)(7) already defined what a \"reasonable period of time\" is for these purposes, so SB 1004's setting of a\n   <em>\n    shorter\n   </em>\n   period than allowed by federal statute is pre-empted by the FTA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 48, at 10). This argument ignores that fact that the FCC order expressly allowed state or local governments to require review of a permit application in a shorter period of time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   To the extent existing State statutes or local ordinances set different review periods than we do here, we clarify that out interpretation of Section 332(c)(7) is independent of these statute or ordinances. Thus, where the review period in a State statute or local ordinance is shorter than the 90-day or 150-day review period, the applicant may pursue remedies granted under the State or local regulation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20FCC%20Rcd%2013994\">\n    24 FCC Rcd. 13994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50. In essence, Section 332(c)(7) serves to cap the amount of time to process siting applications; it does not foreclose shorter time requirements. Because Section 332(c)(7) can coexist alongside a state regulation requiring a shorter time period, SB 1004 is not pre-empted by Section 337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City does not appear to seek the opportunity to cure the defects the Court has identified in its claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Out of an abundance of caution, however, the\n   Court will briefly note that leave to amend would not be appropriate here, as the defect in the City's case is not curable by amendment. The general rule is that when a complaint fails to state a claim, a court should generally give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend under Rule 15(a) before dismissing the action with prejudice. \"Although a court may dismiss the claim, it should not do so without granting leave to amend, unless the defect is simply incurable or the plaintiff has failed to plead with particularity after being afforded repeated opportunities to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

In deciding whether to grant leave, the court \"may consider a variety of factors in exercising its discretion, including ... repeated failures to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed ... and futility of the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

This is not something that the City could cure through a pleading amendment. Additionally, Defendants identified this problem in the briefing at the preliminary injunction stage, and the City amended its complaint in response to the Defendants' arguments. Because the City has already had an opportunity to amend, and because amendment would be futile, there is no need to grant the City leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons given above, the Motions to Dismiss filed by ExteNet, the State Defendants, Mobilitie, and T-Mobile, (Dkts. 36, 37, 38, 39), are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in PART\n   </strong>\n   . The motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to the argument that the City's amended complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, and are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on all other grounds. The motions filed by New Cingular Wireless and Crown Castle, (Dkts. 35, 42), are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . As the City has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted, this case is\n   <strong>\n    HEREBY DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The governor and the attorney general are referred to collectively as the \"State Defendants.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    SB 1004 is codified as Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order, Dkt. 12). To avoid repetition, the Court references that order here where appropriate, and refers the parties to its earlier order where necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    T-Mobile and Mobilitie similarly challenge the Court's jurisdiction. T-Mobile contends that the claims against it should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the suit asks the Court to adjudicate an anticipatory federal pre-emption defense that could be raised should T-Mobile seek to enforce SB 1004 in the future, and the claim cannot support federal jurisdiction on this basis. (T-Mobile Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 39, at 18-20). Separately, Mobilitie argues that, as a private entity, it is not a proper party because it lacks the authority to enforce SB 1004. (Mobilitie Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 38, at 4). Both T-Mobile and Mobilitie have filed applications with the City of Austin for permits to install small cell nodes in Austin's ROW, so both have an interest in whether SB 1004 limits the City's permitting fees and the time within which the City must respond to their applications. This interest is sufficient to grant the Court jurisdiction over the City's claim against them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Verizon Md. Inc. v. Pub. Serv.
