BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The indictment charges Concord and others with conspiring to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful functions of three government agencies: the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of State (DOS). Indictment \u00b6 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the indictment, the conspirators' ultimate goal was to sow discord among\n   U.S. voters through divisive social media posts and political rallies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That goal, by itself, was not illegal. But the indictment alleges that the means used to achieve it were. The conspirators apparently believed that their divisive messages would fall on deaf ears unless they were perceived to come from U.S. nationals. So the conspirators resolved to obscure their Russian identities and affiliations from the public.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7. The problem is that various federal laws require foreign nationals to disclose certain information about themselves and their activities to U.S. agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. As relevant here, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) requires disclosure of certain political expenditures; the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) requires persons who engage in certain activities on behalf of foreign entities to register as foreign agents; and DOS requires foreign nationals wishing to enter the United States to provide truthful answers to questions on visa applications.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. If Concord and its conspirators had complied with these requirements, they would have had to disclose their Russian identities and affiliations to U.S. regulators, jeopardizing their ability to masquerade as U.S. nationals online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Faced with this obstacle, the defendants and their co-conspirators agreed to impair the lawful functions of the FEC, DOJ, and DOS in \"administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27 (describing the disclosure requirements administered by each agency). The defendants and their co-conspirators impaired these functions directly by failing to report expenditures under FECA, failing to register as foreign agents under FARA, and providing false statements on visa applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. And they did so indirectly by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal the Russian origins of their online activity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39, and by destroying evidence to avoid detection by U.S. investigators,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Meanwhile, the conspirators conducted their \"information warfare\" efforts online, using fictitious U.S. personas and stolen U.S. identities to inflame public opinion on various political issues and candidates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The indictment identifies fifteen of Concord's co-conspirators-two entities, Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Catering, and thirteen individuals,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-24-and provides a detailed description of the manner and means used to carry out the conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-58. It also lists at least 26 overt acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-85. Despite these details, Concord seeks further clarification of the 85-paragraph indictment through a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Identifying Unindicted Co-Conspirators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Concord seeks a list of all unindicted co-conspirators known to the government. The D.C. Circuit has not resolved whether and when a defendant is entitled to learn the identities of unindicted co-conspirators through a bill of particulars, and other Circuits and lower courts are divided on the subject.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Crayton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058792\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/560/#p568\">\n    357 F.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (6th Cir. 2004) (\"[T]he Government is not required to furnish the name of all other co-conspirators in a bill of particulars.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Aug. 26, 2004) (observing that courts in the Second Circuit \"have been highly reluctant to require a bill of particulars when a defendant has asked for specific identities of co-conspirators\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Palfrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526725\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/499/34/#p51\">\n    499 F. Supp. 2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-52 (D.D.C. 2007) (observing that, in this District, the \"disclosure of the names of alleged co-conspirators is not uncommon in conspiracy cases, and particularly in cases alleging nonviolent offenses\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Daosavanh\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-50008-011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012902761\">\n    2012 WL 12902761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D. Ark. Apr. 4, 2012) (noting a \"split of authority regarding whether a motion for a bill of particulars is the proper procedure for discovering the names of unindicted co-conspirators\"). In this Court's view, a bill of particulars is rarely the proper vehicle for obtaining the identities of unindicted co-conspirators. Typically, requesting this information amounts to a plea for discovery outside the carefully crafted discovery rules delineated by Congress and the Supreme Court, with the added tactical benefit of committing the government to specific factual positions before it has developed its case-in-chief or, in some cases, completed its investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case, however, is not the typical case. It involves three foreign corporate defendants, one of which employed \"hundreds of individuals\" in support of the conspiratorial objective. Indictment \u00b6 10. The conspiracy targeted three separate U.S. agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. And it was carried out largely on foreign soil by at least thirteen individuals who are beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. Although the government has provided the defense with extensive discovery, the volume of that discovery exceeds four million documents, and at the government's request, the Court has restricted access to the vast majority of those documents to protect national security concerns, pending investigations, and personally identifiable information. Finally, the theory of criminal liability in this case, while sound, is to some extent unprecedented-which is no surprise, given the unprecedented nature and scale of the operations alleged in the indictment. All of these factors, together, weigh in favor of ordering the disclosure of co-conspirator identities to reduce any potential for unfair surprise at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The government counters that the indictment provides the defendants with sufficient details about the conspiracy charge to enable Concord to understand the charges and prepare its defense. The government further argues that Concord can discern the co-conspirators' identities through its own diligent investigation in combination with discovery materials the government has already produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222018\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/309/#p316\">\n    841 F. Supp. 2d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying disclosure of co-conspirator identities where the conspiracy took place entirely on a ship at sea and the defendant could focus its investigation on the \"finite number of people on board\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mosquera-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290799\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/130/#p159\">\n    153 F. Supp. 3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159-51 (D.D.C. 2015) (denying disclosure of co-conspirator identities where the government had already identified many, if not all, of the co-conspirators through wiretap recordings and text messages produced in discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The indictment does contain a thorough description of the conspiracy, including its manner and means and at least twenty-six overt acts. Even so, Concord's ability to identify the co-conspirators is hampered by the unique circumstances of this case-most significantly, by the strict limitations the government has sought on the large volume of discovery. This factor coupled with the others already noted-the potentially large number of co-conspirators involved, the presence of multiple corporate\n   defendants, and the nature and scope of the international conspiracy-make this the rare case in which the Court deems it appropriate to order the government to disclose the identities of Concord's co-conspirators before trial. But, following the practice of other courts, the Court will limit the bill of particulars to persons or entities that the government plans to identify as co-conspirators at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11537389\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/54/25/#p30\">\n    54 F.

Identifying the Co-Conspirators Responsible for Each Act in the Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition to seeking a master list of co-conspirators, Concord asks the government to go further and specify which conspirators committed each act alleged in the indictment.

If the government is not planning to rely on evidence beyond the scope of the specific allegations in the indictment, then it is difficult to see how Concord could be unfairly surprised by such evidence at trial. Put differently, the fact that the government's key documents set relates exclusively to the specific allegations in the indictment is a strong indication that the indictment itself has provided sufficient detail to put Concord on notice of the charges against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At any rate, even if the information Concord seeks is not currently contained in the key documents set, the government has agreed to disclose its entire exhibit list several months before trial, Hr'g Tr. Mar. 7, 2019 at 33, and the Court intends to order it to do so. If the specific accounts and VPNs Concord seeks will be introduced at trial, it is highly likely that they will be identified in either the key documents set or the Government's exhibit list well in advance of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In short, the combination of the detailed allegations in the indictment, the extensive discovery already produced, the government's key documents set, and the government's forthcoming exhibit list make it implausible that Concord will be blindsided by specific account information for the first time at trial. Because this information is evidentiary in nature and is already-or soon will be-available in multiple forms, the government need not disclose it in a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Identification of FECA and FARA Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, Concord seeks information related to the FECA and FARA provisions\n   referenced in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 9, 25-26. In particular, it asks the Government to (1) identify any conspirators who were required to report expenditures to the FEC or register as a foreign agent with DOJ, (2) identify the statutes and regulations described in paragraphs 25 to 27 of the indictment, and (3) clarify whether Concord or its agents are alleged to have violated FECA or FARA. Concord's Mot. Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 12, 23-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court will grant these requests in part, though not quite as Concord frames them. In connection with Concord's second motion to dismiss the indictment, the parties and the Court invested significant time analyzing the government's theory of criminal liability and, specifically, the role that FECA and FARA violations play in the analysis. Ultimately, the Court held that while the government was not necessarily\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to allege FECA and FARA violations to establish a defraud-clause conspiracy, the indictment\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   allege such violations as one of several forms of deceptive conduct aimed at the United States.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Concord Mgmt. &amp; Consulting LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528480\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/38/#p48\">\n    347 F. Supp. 3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-51 (D.D.C. 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Court emphasized that the Government may ultimately have to prove these violations at trial to show that the deceptive acts directed at private parties were\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   intended to impair the FEC's and DOJ's functions \"in administering federal requirements for disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528480\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/38/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528480\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/38/#p48\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reasoned that, while defraud-clause conspiracies do not formally depend on violations of other statutes, it would be difficult to tie the deceptive acts alleged in this case to FEC's and DOJ's administration of FECA's and FARA's disclosure requirements if those requirements did not actually apply to the conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In other words, it will be difficult for the government to establish that the defendants intended to use deceptive tactics to conceal their Russian identities and affiliations from the United States if the defendants had no duty to disclose that information to the United States in the first place. For that reason, the specific laws-and underlying conduct-that triggered such a duty are critical for Concord to know well in advance of trial so it can prepare its defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The indictment alleges that the defendants agreed to a course of conduct that would violate FECA's and FARA's disclosure requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 7, 25-26, 48, 51, and provides specific examples of the kinds of expenditures and activities that required disclosure,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-57.\n   <em>\n    Concord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528480\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/38/#p48\">\n    347 F. Supp. 3d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the indictment does not cite the specific statutory and regulatory disclosure requirements that the defendants violated. Nor does it clearly identify which expenditures and activities violated which disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the Court will order the government to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Identify any statutory or regulatory disclosure requirements whose administration the defendants allegedly conspired to impair, along with supporting citations to the U.S. Code,\n   Code of Federal Regulations, or comparable authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 With respect to FECA, identify each\n   <em>\n    category\n   </em>\n   of expenditures that the government intends to establish required disclosure to the FEC.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Indictment \u00b6 48 (alleging that the defendants or their co-conspirators \"\n   <em>\n    produce[d], purchase[d], and post[ed] advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites\n   </em>\n   expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton\") (emphasis added). The government must also identify for each category of expenditures which disclosure provisions the defendants or their co-conspirators allegedly violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 With respect to FARA, identify each\n   <em>\n    category\n   </em>\n   of activities that the government intends to establish triggered a duty to register as a foreign agent under FARA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48 (same);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (alleging that the defendants or their co-conspirators \"\n   <em>\n    organized and coordinated political rallies\n   </em>\n   in the United States\" (emphasis added)). The government must also identify for each category of activities which disclosure provisions the defendants or their co-conspirators allegedly violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To the extent Concord requests additional information about possible FECA and FARA violations-for instance, which entities or individuals allegedly violated FECA and FARA-its request is denied for the reasons stated in II.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Concord's Remaining Requests for Clarification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Lastly, Concord asks the government to provide information about corporate entities referenced in the indictment, to define certain terms used in the indictment, to clarify certain activities allegedly undertaken by Concord, and to identify certain individuals other than co-conspirators referenced in the indictment. The Court will deny most of these requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Concord requests detailed information about certain corporate entities referenced in the indictment, including their place and date of incorporation and a list of their incorporators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Concord's Mot. Ex. A. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19. This information is evidentiary in nature and immaterial to the charges in the indictment. Further, Concord can obtain this information on its own from public records or through its own reasonable investigation. The Court will therefore deny this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Concord asks the government to define various terms used in the indictment. The Court will deny this request because the terms Concord seeks to define are either plain on their face or become clear through context. For example, \"disparaging Hillary Clinton\" has an obvious meaning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. And other terms that might be ambiguous if read in isolation-such as \"significant funds,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, \"computer infrastructure,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, or \"certain domestic activities,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13-are merely used to summarize more detailed allegations contained elsewhere in the indictment,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8, 13,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (explaining that Concord funded a \"monthly budget\" in excess of $ 1,250,000);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40 (describing the conspirators' use of \"virtual private networks\" and \"email accounts hosted by U.S. email providers\" to obscure the Russian origins of their online activity);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27\n   (elaborating on the domestic activities that require disclosure to the FEC, DOJ, and DOS on reports, registration statements, and visa applications).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Concord asks for clarification of its own role in the conspiracy. According to the indictment, Concord (1) provided funding, (2) recommended personnel, and (3) oversaw Internet Research Agency activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. To clarify these allegations, Concord asks the government to identify all \"funds provided,\" \"personnel recommended,\" and \"activities overseen,\" and to identify each person alleged to have engaged in these activities on behalf of Concord. Concord's Mot. Ex. A. \u00b6 15. The Court will deny the first two of these requests. The allegations related to funding are clear: Concord paid the Internet Research Agency's monthly budget, which exceeded 1,250,000 U.S. dollars, Indictment \u00b6 11, and included \"thousands of U.S. dollars\" spent on social media advertisements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. As for recommending personnel, the substance of the allegation is clear, and Concord is not entitled to a preview of the evidence the Government will use to prove it. Likewise, paragraphs 12 and 13 describe activities Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin oversaw.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. However, it is unclear from the indictment whether Prigozhin engaged in these activities on Concord's behalf. To address this potential source of confusion, the Court will order the Government to clarify whether Prigozhin engaged in the activities described in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the indictment on Concord's behalf. And if Prigozhin did not act on Concord's behalf, the Court will direct the government to clarify which \"activities\" Concord is alleged to have overseen and the manner in which it oversaw them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Concord requests the identification of individuals other than co-conspirators (including victims) referenced in the indictment. This information is not necessary to clarify the charges against Concord or to enable Concord to prepare for trial. Instead, it amounts to a request for a detailed preview of the government's evidence. Ordering the government to provide this information now would, in effect, force the government to hand over its witness list many months before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20936537\">\n    2010 WL 936537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-6 (denying similar requests for the same reason). Moreover, some of the unidentified victims, such as \"Campaign Official 1\" and \"Campaign Official 2\" can be easily identified in the discovery materials or through Concord's own investigation because the indictment specifies the email address the defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly used to contact these officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 76, 78. Concord's final request will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although the Court has analyzed Concord's requests by category, it has reviewed each of Concord's 51 requests and finds that every request not specifically granted in this decision is either beyond the scope of a bill of particulars, sufficiently addressed by the allegations in the indictment, or available to Concord in another form. Accordingly, any remaining requests not already addressed in this opinion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court recognizes that ordering a bill of particulars risks committing the government to positions that might change as it discovers new information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654786,829051\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/359/260/\">\n    359 F.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1966) (explaining that a variance between a bill of particulars and evidence at trial may result in a reversal of the defendant's conviction on appeal). To address that concern, the Court will allow the government to supplement its bill of particulars if it obtains new information after responding to the order\n   below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
