Specifically, inmate Plaintiff Christopher Lee Price (Price)'s execution date is set for April 11, 2019. (Doc. 19-5). Price is presently scheduled to be executed via the three (3) drug midazolam hydrochloride based lethal injection protocol. Price seeks execution via a nitrogen hypoxia protocol instead.

The court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Later in 2015, the Supreme Court held in part that the inmate petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   had failed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation because they failed to identify an available alternative method\n   of execution that entailed a lesser risk of pain. Following\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , the State moved to dismiss Price's Section 1983 complaint, but the Court allowed Price to amend his complaint. As an alternative to the midazolam protocol, Price proposed the use of compounded pentobarbital or sodium thiopental. The parties engaged in discovery, culminating in a non-jury trial in December 2016 on the sole issue of the availability of an alternative method of execution to the State's midazolam included execution protocol On March 15, 2017, this Court entered judgment in favor of the State, finding that Price failed to prove the existence of a substantially safer alternative available to the ADOC. (Doc. 107 -- CV 1:14-00472-KD-C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 19, 2018, after holding oral argument, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed this Court's decision and denied rehearing on December 26, 2018.

Price is now pursuing\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   review before the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 22, 2018, the ADOC's injection protocol changed again. Through Act 2018-353, nitrogen hypoxia became a statutorily approved method of execution in the State of Alabama (death row inmates could elect for this protocol, as specified by the statute, instead of execution via the midazolam three (3) drug protocol).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 8, 2019, Price filed\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   Section 1983 claim to enjoin the State from executing him via the midazolam three (3) drug protocol. (Doc. 1). Price alleges three (3) causes of action against the Defendants (the State): 1) violation of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment (first cause of action); 2) violation of his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights for failure to consistently comply with execution protocol (second cause of action)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and 3) violation of his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights due to the State's refusal to allow him to elect nitrogen hypoxia (third cause of action). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relief, Price seeks that this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   .... Enjoin Defendants from executing Mr. Price using the lethal injection protocol that the State asserts that it adopted on September 10, 2014, as well as the inadequate anesthesia and execution procedures that violate Mr. Price's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and his right to be free from cruel and usual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....

In other words, an inmate such as Price had until\n   <strong>\n    June 30\n   </strong>\n   within which to so elect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The State of Alabama did not create a standardized election form for this purpose.\" (Doc. 19 at 11). Instead, on June 22, 2018, an election form was drafted by Spencer Hahn, Federal Defender with the office of the Federal Defenders (MDALA). (Doc. 29-3 at 2, 5 (Aff. Palombi) ). On June 26, 2018, Hahn and John Palombi, Assistant Federal Defender (MDALA), met with eight (8) death row inmate clients at Holman -- which did not include Price -- and provided the form to them, explaining the details of same in the attorney-client context. (Doc. 29-3 at 2-3 (Aff. Palombi) ). Following the Federal Defenders' visit, the Warden distributed blank reproductions of the form to death row inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Specifically, per the State:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   .... all inmates sentenced to death prior to the adoption of nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution were given a one-time thirty-day period in which to elect this method of execution immediately following the enactment of Alabama Act 2018-353. As the act was enacted on June 1, 2018 inmates had until June 30, 2018, to make this election. [ ] Every death-row inmate at Holman ... including Price, was given an election form on the order of Warden Stewart ...

According to ADOC Captain Jeff Emberton (Emberton), the Warden directed him to give every death row inmate at Holman a copy of the form and an envelope, to complete and return to the Warden, if the inmate decided to make the election. Emberton attests as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In mid-June 2018, after Alabama introduced nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution, Warden Cynthia Stewart tasked me with giving every death row inmate an election form and an envelope. If an inmate wished to be executed by nitrogen asphyxiation, he was to sign and date the form and put it in the envelope, which would be delivered to Warden Stewart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...

While Emberton states it was mid-June when the form was disbursed, it\n   is not contested that the form used by the Warden was the one drafted on June 22, 2018 and given by the Federal Defender to his clients on June 26, 2018. Accordingly, Price could not have received the election form prior to June 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On summary judgment, the State produced nitrogen hypoxia election forms for three (3) prisoners, signed on June 26 or 27, 2018, which had been timely submitted to the Warden. (Doc. 19-6). Overall, 48 Alabama inmates elected nitrogen hypoxia. (Doc. 19 at 12). Price did not submit a nitrogen hypoxia election form to the Warden between June 1-30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 11, 2019, the State asked the Alabama Supreme Court to set Price's execution date. According to Price, on January 12, 2019 his counsel first learned about inmates being able to elect to use nitrogen hypoxia. On January 27, 2019, counsel wrote a letter to the Warden attempting to elect nitrogen hypoxia for Price. In response, the Warden stated the request was \"past the deadline of June 2018[,]\" adding she did not \"possess the authority to grant, deny or reject your request.\" (Doc. 19-3 (undated letter) ). On February 4, 2019, Price's counsel contacted counsel for the State via e-mail asking to elect nitrogen hypoxia. (Doc. 29-2). Price's request was denied because the statutory thirty (30) day election period had expired. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On February 8, 2019, Price initiated this litigation claiming that the State is violating his constitutional rights by refusing to allow him to elect nitrogen hypoxia for his execution. On March 1, 2019, the Alabama Supreme Court set Price's execution for April 11, 2019.

All death row inmates were given the same election form. Price does not allege that he was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   given the form, or that he was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   given the option to make the same election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Price argues that his right to equal protection has been violated because he is being treated differently than similarly situated death row inmates \"whom the State has agreed to execute using nitrogen hypoxia.\" And, although he did not timely elect execution by nitrogen hypoxia, Price contends that the State has no rational basis for refusing to let him join the class of inmates who did so elect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Price points to three (3) actions by the State that violate his right to equal protection. First, Price contends that the State law is unconstitutional because it treats similarly situated people differently based on criteria (whether the inmate submitted a nitrogen hypoxia \"election\" form by June 30, 2018) that does not rationally further any legitimate state interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As stated, Price has to \"show that the State will treat him disparately from other similarly situated persons.\" Price contends that for purposes of classifying inmates with respect to method of execution, an inmate's satisfaction of the June 30, 2018 deadline is not a \" '\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   ' difference between inmates that are otherwise identical.\" (Doc. 29-1 at 15).

Price has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The State contends that it has a legitimate interest in effecting, as efficiently as possible, death sentences. The State contends that a deadline was necessary so that the State could proceed expeditiously with the execution of prisoners whose conviction and sentence were final. The State explains that before an execution goes forward, an execution date must be set by the Alabama Supreme Court. The State signals that it is prepared to go forward with the execution by filing a motion to set an execution date in the Alabama Supreme Court. When the request is made, the State represents to the Alabama Supreme Court that the prisoner's conviction and sentence are final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is rational for the State of Alabama to give a deadline to inmates for electing nitrogen hypoxia, whereas to further the State's interest in to providing the State officials the opportunity to plan for the execution of eligible inmates. Price has not negated this rational basis for the thirty day requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Price also asserts that as applied to him, the thirty day deadline line violates his right to equal protection. In support, Price points to the fact that eight death row inmates who had an Eighth Amendment challenge to the lethal injection protocol pending in June 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Alabama Lethal Injection Protocol Litigation\n   </em>\n   , 2:12-CV-00316-WKW (M.D. Ala.) ), settled their claim as follows: in return for a timely election of nitrogen hypoxia the inmates were given an assurance from the state that ALDOC would not execute the inmates by lethal injection. (Doc. 29-3 at 4 (Aff. Palombi) ). From this fact, Price claims that he has received unequal treatment from the State because the State will not make the same offer to him, although he has a pending challenge. The problem with this argument is that Price is not similarly situated to these eight inmates. These inmates, who were given the assurance in settlement of their challenge to lethal injection that they would not be executed by lethal injection, made a timely election(i.e., by June 30). Price did not make a timely election of nitrogen hypoxia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A slight variation of the preceding argument is that Price was not treated the same as the inmates who had a pending challenge to the lethal injection protocol because he was not offered a\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   settlement by the State. The argument is once the State decided to settle the challenge in the M.D. Ala. action 2:12-CV-00316-WKW, the State was obligated to reach out to Price's counsel in a timely manner with the same settlement offer to his 2014 challenge that was pending at that time. While this would seem to have been a prudent action by the State, the question is whether the State violated Price's right to equal protection by failing to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Unfortunately, Price fails to cite any specific authority to support the proposition that the State must, pursuant to the equal protection clause, settle all pending challenges to the lethal injection protocol in the same manner. But as with any equal protection claim, the Court's analysis starts with whether Price was similarly\n   situated to the eight inmates whose challenge to the lethal injection was mooted by settlement. The most glaring difference between Price and those inmates is the stage of the litigation. The M.D. Ala. inmates were offered a settlement near their trial date. Price, on the other hand, had not prevailed in this Court and was on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. Briefs had been filed, oral argument had been held, and the parties were awaiting a decision. Accordingly, the State's interest in settling the claims of the pre-trial inmates, where uncertainty was greater, was markedly different than settling Price's challenge. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that Price was similarly situated to the eight inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Last, Price asserts that the\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-18-82.1(b)(2) presupposes that any waiver of execution by nitrogen hypoxia is only valid if he received adequate notice from the State regarding his right to elect nitrogen hypoxia. Price contends that the notice to him was wholly inadequate because the State failed to adequately apprise him of his right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The State asserts that Price cannot prevail on this claim because he cannot show that he was treated differently by the State from his fellow Holman death row inmates. The State points out that the State gave Price the same notice and opportunity to elect nitrogen hypoxia as was given to the other Holman death row inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Price does not dispute this assertion as it relates to fact that all inmates were given the same form. Instead, Price takes issue with the fact that most of the inmates that timely elected were represented by the Federal Defender's Office and that these inmates were given a full explanation of their rights by the Federal Defender before being given the form. The court is unable to ascertain how this fact supports unequal treatment\n   <strong>\n    by the State\n   </strong>\n   of similarly situated inmates. Rather, this appears to be disparity in treatment by Price's counsel compared to the Federal Defenders' treatment of their clients. Such is not a cognizable equal protection claim. Price fails to state an equal protection claim based on the assertion that he did not receive an adequate explanation of his rights in conjunction with receiving the waiver form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Price also asserts that he has not validly waived his right to elect execution by nitrogen because he was not adequately aware of the rights he waived by inaction. Price cites in support of this statement two Alabama cases: a case regarding waiver of contractual rights (\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004565\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/713/\">\n    111 So.3d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2012) ) and a case regarding waiver of a spouse's statutory right to an elective share of an estate (\n   <em>\n    Garrard v. Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7578787\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/933/\">\n    514 So.2d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1987) ). The Court fails to see how either of these cases supports an equal protection claim, or any other constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, Price's cross-motion for summary judgment on this claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Eighth Amendment -- Alternative Method of Execution\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Death row inmates seeking to challenge a state's method of execution must satisfy a \"heavy burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Baze v.

Dr. Lubarsky provides no opinion regarding the comparison between the pain incurred with the three (3) drug lethal injection protocol and that incurred with the administration of nitrogen hypoxia. Instead, Price submitted an academic study from East Central University entitled\n   <em>\n    Nitrogen Induced Hypoxia as a Form of Capital Punishment\n   </em>\n   , wherein the authors conclude that \"[t]here is no evidence to indicate any substantial physical discomfort during\" execution by nitrogen hypoxia. (Doc. 29-2 at 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The study also concluded that: 1) execution via nitrogen hypoxia would be a humane method to carry out a death sentence; 2) such protocol would not require the assistance of licensed medical professionals; 3) such protocol would be simple to administer; 4) nitrogen is readily available for purchase and sourcing would not pose a difficulty; and 5) such protocol would not depend upon the cooperation of the offender being executed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673813\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In this proceeding, the State presented no evidence to rebut Price's contention that the current lethal injection protocol would cause him serious harm and needless suffering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did the State challenge Price's evidence that execution by nitrogen would likely not result in substantial physical discomfort. Based on the evidence presented by Price, the Court finds that Price is likely to prevail on the issue of whether execution by nitrogen (which Price's evidence shows is not likely to result in any substantial physical discomfort) would provide a significant reduction in the substantial risk of severe pain Price would incur if he were executed using the three (3) drug lethal injection method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   However, because Price fails to show that execution by nitrogen is readily implemented,\n   his claim must fail and his motion for summary judgment\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Preliminary Injunction/Motion for Stay of Execution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \"Injunctive relief, including a stay of execution, is an equitable remedy that is not available as a matter of right.\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.
