(Docket Nos. 32 and 38.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Castro's third and fourth motions to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Castro purportedly attempted to provide contraband, consisting of cellular phones, to inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico on July 30, 2016. (Docket No. 3.) On June 21, 2018, a federal grand jury charged Castro with willfully making false statements to United States Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") officials, and attempting to provide contraband in prison in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(4), respectively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, the Court issued a scheduling order setting trial for August 29, 2018. (Docket No. 10 at p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 20, 2018 the United States notified Castro that it intends to elicit at trial: (1) evidence that Castro smuggled contraband into MDC on prior occasions, (2) financial records demonstrating that Castro received payment for providing contraband to inmates at MDC, and (3) evidence that Castro destroyed evidence and made false statements to law enforcement officers. (Docket No. 16, Ex. 1.) The notification informed Castro that the United States intends to offer Castro's prior bad acts into evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) (\" Rule 404(b)\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Castro's motions to compel constitute her third and fourth attempts to obtain discovery. First, Castro requested discovery pertaining to alleged prior bad acts. (Docket No. 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court denied Castro's first\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion. (Docket No. 19.) Second, Castro requested that the Court compel the BOP to produce: (1) an original copy of the Attorney's Visiting Log Book from 2015 to the present, (2) the monitored call records and Corr Links Communications for inmates with knowledge of an alleged contraband scheme, (3) the unredacted manual for the X-ray machine at MDC, (4) all surveillance video of Castro's visit to MDC on July 30, 2016, (5) the original copy of all images including metadata of alleged contraband confiscated by BOP security officers on July 30, 2016, and (6) an explanation from the BOP should the evidence requested by Castro not exist. (Docket No. 28.) The Court denied Castro's second motion to compel for failure to comply with Rule 17. (Docket No. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Castro sets forth identical discovery requests in her third motion to compel. (Docket No. 32.) The third motion to compel, however, also requests surveillance images from MDC of private investigator\n   Sherley Montilla from 2015 to the present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n    at p. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her fourth motion to compel, Castro requests \"any and all social and legal visiting logs for inmate Emmanuel Moyano Rodr\u00edguez\" (\"Rodr\u00edguez\"), while an inmate at the Rover A. Deyton Detention Facility in Lovejoy, Georgia. (Docket No. 38 at p. 4.) The United States produced notes from an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggesting that Castro attempted to deliver contraband to Rodr\u00edguez at the Deyton facility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201791\">\n    at p. 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
