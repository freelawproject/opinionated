(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R&amp;R at 7.) In her report and recommendation to this court, Magistrate Judge Theiler concluded that such continued detention without the opportunity for an individualized hearing before a neutral decision-maker where Respondents bear the burden of justifying Petitioner's continued detention violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 10-23.) Respondents timely filed objections to Magistrate Judge Theiler's report and recommendation.

However, as Magistrate Judge Theiler explained, that argument fails.

Since the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit has expressed \"grave doubts that any statute that allows for arbitrary prolonged detention without any process is constitutional or that those who founded our democracy precisely to protect against the government's arbitrary deprivation of liberty would have thought so.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

As Magistrate Judge Theiler points out, numerous federal district courts have provided bond hearings to arriving noncitizens in prolonged detention in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   . (R&amp;R at 15-16 (citing cases).) These cases, taken together, confirm Magistrate Judge Theiler's recommended ruling that \"unreasonably prolonged detention under \u00a7 1225(b) without a bond hearing violates due process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Objections at 6-7.) Magistrate Judge Theiler employed a case-specific analysis that considers the following factors: \"(1) the total length of detention to date; (2) the likely duration of future detention; (3) the conditions of detention; (4) delays in the removal proceedings caused by the detainee; (5) delays in the removal proceedings cause by the government; and (6) the likelihood that the removal proceedings will result in a final order of removal.\" (R&amp;R at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jamal A. v.

(Objections at 6.) The\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test requires considering (1) the private interest affected, (2) the government's interest, and (3) the value added by additional or substitute procedural safeguards in the situation before the court.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Magistrate Judge Theiler considered applying the three-factor test outline in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , but correctly declined to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R&amp;R at 18-19.) Courts apply the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test to resolve the question of \"whether the administrative procedures provided ... are constitutionally sufficient.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test balances the benefits or burdens of \"additional or substitute procedural safeguards.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does not resolve the more fundamental issue of whether any procedure-such as a\n   bond hearing-must be provided. Therefore, Magistrate Judge Theiler correctly determined that the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test is not \"particularly probative of whether prolonged mandatory detention has become unreasonable in a particular case.\" (R&amp;R at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Yet, the Ninth Circuit's analysis did not turn on the fine distinctions between the various removal detention statutes.

Where a noncitizen has not asserted any grounds for relief from removal, presumably the noncitizen will be removed from the United States, and continued detention will at least marginally serve the purpose of detention, namely assuring the noncitizen is removed as ordered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   ).

Petitioner here submitted an asylum application, but IJ denied his requests for relief. Dkt. 12-1.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that this factor does not weigh in favor of either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum, four of the six factors weigh in favor of granting petitioner a bond hearing, and two factors are neutral. The Court thus concludes that petitioner's continued mandatory detention under \u00a7 1225(b) has become unreasonable and that due process requires the Government to provide him with a bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Petitioner's bond hearing must comply with established procedural requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Petitioner contends that at his bond hearing, the Government must provide clear and convincing evidence to justify his continued detention.
