(Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 1; Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 10.) The Enabling Act established ERS to administer the payment of pensions and certain other benefits for the retired employees of the Commonwealth, certain public corporations in Puerto Rico, and certain municipalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 761 (2016). As originally codified, the official English-language version of the Enabling Act denominated the retirement and benefits system as the \"Employees Retirement System of the Insular Government of Puerto Rico and its Instrumentalities.\" (Docket Entry No. 92, the \"Possinger Declaration,\" Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Enabling Act provides that ERS may both issue debt and secure such debt with the assets of ERS. On January 24, 2008, ERS issued senior and subordinate pension funding bonds (collectively, the \"ERS Bonds\") pursuant to a Pension Funding Bond Resolution (Compl., Ex. D, the \"Resolution\"). (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 4; Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 22.) Pursuant to the Resolution, the holders of the ERS Bonds (the \"ERS Bondholders\" or \"Bondholders\") were granted a security interest in certain \"Pledged Property.\" Specifically, Pledged Property is defined in the Resolution to include the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. All Revenues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. All right, title and interest of the System in and to Revenues, and all rights to receive the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. The Funds, Accounts, and Subaccounts held by the Fiscal Agent, and moneys and securities and, in the case of the Debt Service Reserve Account, Reserve Account Cash Equivalents, from time to time held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the application thereof as provided in this Resolution and to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4. Any and all other rights and personal property of every kind and nature from time to time hereafter pledged and assigned by the System to the Fiscal Agent as and for additional security for the Bonds and Parity Obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   5. Any and all cash and non-cash proceeds, products, offspring, rents and profits from any of the Pledged Property mentioned described in paragraphs (1) through (4) above, including, without limitation, those from the sale, exchange, transfer, collection, loss, damage, disposition, substitution or replacement of any of the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (Resolution at VI-36.) The Resolution defines \"Revenues\" as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. All Employers' Contributions\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   received by the System or the Fiscal Agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2. With respect to any particular Bonds, the proceeds of any draw on or payment under any Credit Facility which is intended for the payment of such Bonds, but only for purposes of such payment and not for other purposes of this Resolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. Net amounts received by the System pursuant to a Qualified Hedge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4. Income and interest earned and gains realized in excess of losses suffered by any Fund, Account, or Subaccount held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   5. Any other revenues, fees, charges, surcharges, rents, proceeds or other income and receipts received by or on behalf of the System or by the Fiscal Agent lawfully available for the purposes of this Resolution and deposited by or on behalf of the System or by the Fiscal Agent in any Fund, Account, or Subaccount held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at VI-37.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Resolution is publicly available both electronically on the websites of the Government Development Bank, ERS, and the Electronic Municipal Market Access System, and in the hard copy records of ERS. (Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 116, \"Plaintiff's 56(b) Response,\" \u00b6 42.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 2, 2008, ERS executed a security agreement (Compl., Ex. E, the \"Security Agreement\") in connection with the Resolution. The Security Agreement grants, for the benefit of the ERS Bondholders, \"a security interest in (i) the Pledged Property, and (ii) all proceeds thereof and all after-acquired\n   property, subject to application as permitted by the Resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Security Agreement does not include a definition of the term \"Pledged Property,\" instead providing that \"[a]ll capitalized words not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    In re Fin.

The Resolution further provided that, upon adoption of the Resolution, the Pledged Property was \"immediately ... subject to the lien of th[e] pledge, assignment and security interest without any physical delivery thereof or further act,\" and the security interests in and liens on the Pledged Property became \"valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the [ERS], irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.\" (Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 33.) At the time of the adoption of the Resolution in 2008, the ERS Enabling Act required employers to contribute a set percentage of the contribution of each employee participant during the term of the participant's employment to ERS. (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 9, Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 781(d) (2008).) In 2013, the legislature of Puerto Rico enacted Act 3-2013, which amended the Enabling Act effective July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Two UCC-1 financing statements were filed with the Department of State of the Government of Puerto Rico (the \"Department of State\") in 2008, and two amendment forms corresponding to each of the 2008 UCC-1s were received by the Department of State on or about December 17, 2015. (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23, 29.) Although the 2008 financing statements were insufficient to perfect the security interest under P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 19, \u00a7 2152(1) (2008), the 2015 financing statement amendments met the requirements for perfection as of December 17, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fin.

As of July 1, 2017, ERS stopped receiving Employers' Contributions due to the implementation of the 2017 Commonwealth Pay-Go statute, under which the Commonwealth pays public pensions and various government entities reimburse the Commonwealth for those payments.

La. 2000). Among other things, Defendants contend that, because the Resolution provides a security interest in Pledged Property consisting of Revenues \"and all rights to receive the same,\" and \"Revenues\" are defined to include Employers' Contributions and all cash and non-cash proceeds from the Pledged Property, the Resolution establishes that Defendants have broad liens that encompass contributions that have already been made as well as rights to future contributions and all proceeds of those rights. (Defs.' Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) According to Defendants, the \"proceeds\" of such rights include payments or collection of contributions from employers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Defendants argue that their pre-petition collateral includes the right to receive future contributions, and therefore all such contributions-whenever made-are the proceeds of that pre-petition right. (Docket Entry No. 120, the \"Defendants' Opposition,\" at \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.) According to the Bondholders, Section 552(b)(1) therefore renders Section 552(a) inapplicable to ERS's\n   right to receive such contributions after the petition date. (Defs.' Mot. \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Significantly, Section 552(b)(1)'s exception to Section 552(a)'s general rule only extends to \"property of the debtor acquired before the commencement of the case\" and the \"proceeds, products, offspring, or profits of such property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (West 2016). Put another way, Section 552(b)(1) does not extend to the proceeds of property which itself is acquired after the petition date. Thus, the crux of the issue now before the Court is whether post-petition contributions constitute property acquired after the petition date or the proceeds of pre-petition collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The parties have identified no binding authority governing the question of whether post-petition Employers' Contributions to ERS are protected by Section 552(b)(1), nor has the Court's own research disclosed any such authority. Accordingly, the Court has considered carefully lower court decisions and the provisions of the relevant Resolution and statutes in determining the issue before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The instant factual context is analogous to that of\n   <em>\n    In re HRC Joint Venture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n    175 B.R. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

In that case, the remittances to the debtor-which owned the building that housed a hotel-were generated by the post-petition acts of a third party-Hyatt Corporation-which operated the hotel in the debtor's building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n    at 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that the remittances were after-acquired property subject to Section 552(a) and that the proceeds exception in Section 552(b) did not apply because \"it is only post-petition acts which generated the collateral of TIAA in question, debtor's right to remittances each month under the Management Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n    at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, the Employers' Contributions were calculated, at least in part, based upon the contributing employers' respective payrolls. The parties have identified three components of employers' obligations to ERS. (Docket Entry No. 199, the \"Defendants' Supplemental Memorandum,\" at \u00b6 10; Docket Entry No. 204 at 6-7.) The first component, referred to by Defendants as the Percentage of Payroll Contribution, is a regular contribution calculated as a percentage of an employer's payroll.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 787f. The second, referred to by Defendants as the Supplemental Contribution, is based upon the number of the employer's current pensioners as of the time of computation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act 3-2013 \u00a7 38; 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 761. The third, referred to by Defendants as the Additional Uniform Contribution, is based on the proportion of total employer contributions corresponding to each employer in a particular year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 787q. Accordingly, all three components of contributions by employers are contingent on quantitative factors relating to each employer's workforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, because the Additional Uniform Contribution varies each year (by reference to actuarial determinations and each employer's workforce demographics) to ensure that a certain level of assets is available for ERS, Defendants argue that changes in an employer's workforce would not affect the employer's overall obligations. (Defs.' Supp. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 11-14 (\"This standing obligation to make statutory contributions is not contingent on current employee labor, even if the mix of components of that obligation may change with changes to the employer's current payroll.\").) Defendants also point to examples of statutory text expressing an intention or goal of setting overall contributions to\n   ERS at a level adequate to pay benefits and administrative costs, less contributions by employees. (Docket Entry No. 206 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) However, the fact that statutory provisions state a goal of ensuring that contributions from employers are adequate to support ERS's cash flow does not mean that any particular employer's obligations are fixed. Rather, each employer's Percentage of Payroll Contribution, Supplemental Contribution, and Additional Uniform Contribution will vary based upon the size of an employer's payroll, the number of an employer's former employees, and actuarial factors. Thus, the employers' obligations remain inchoate until such time as the Employers' Contributions are calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, similar to Defendants here, the creditor in\n   <em>\n    HRC Joint Venture\n   </em>\n   had been granted a pre-petition security interest in expected future remittances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113919\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/175/948/\">\n    at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, as here, the right to receive particular future remittances arose based on post-petition events. In\n   <em>\n    HRC Joint Venture\n   </em>\n   , those rights were the rights to revenue from the management agreement; here, those rights are to funds payable by employers that are calculated based upon certain factors relating to their postpetition workforce demographics and payroll obligations. These employers' specific contribution payment obligations are not fixed and unchanging with respect to each employer, but, rather, are calculated based upon certain workforce demographic factors and actuarial determinations. Until the post-petition computations are performed based upon post-petition facts, the receivable to ERS does not exist and ERS has no right to collect the particular contribution. Thus, the relevant right to payment only comes into existence as the result of and contemporaneously with post-petition acts, and the proceeds of that right are therefore the proceeds of post-petition property; ERS's right to payment of the post-petition property is not \"property of the debtor acquired before the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Subsequent events, such as sales of pre-petition inventory or automatic payments of fixed amounts pursuant to pre-petition contractual rights, may generate post-petition proceeds that are protected by Section 552(b)(1) because their value is traceable to and calculable by reference to the pre-petition property without any additional post-petition labor or other intervening value-defining or -adding action. Here, the relevant statutory provisions made the accrual and computation of the employers' contribution obligations contingent upon their contemporaneous payrolls, workforce demographics, and the actuarial funding status of ERS. ERS therefore gained rights to collect the particular amounts once they could be computed, and there is nothing in the record to indicate the employers' actual post-petition contribution liabilities were the product of anything other than computations based on then-current payrolls, demographics, and actuarial factors. Accordingly, the contributions acquired post-petition were not proceeds of ERS's inchoate pre-petition right to receive future contributions computed by reference to yet-to-be determined post-petition circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 928(a) of the Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Counterclaim III of Defendants' Answer seeks a declaration that, \"because the employer contributions constitute 'special revenues,' their security interest in and liens on employer contributions received by the ERS after the Petition Date remain enforceable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20928\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\" (Answer at \u00b6 257.)

Mot. \u00b6 52.) Because ERS's \"self-acknowledged function\" is to collect and pay out pension payments, and because ERS is enabled to perform this function by its statutory right to receive employer contributions from the Commonwealth and other public corporations and municipalities, Defendants argue, employer contributions are \"received\" and thus \"derived\" from particular functions of ERS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants also contend that the Employee Retirement System is a \"system\" within the meaning of Section 902(2)(A) because it was \"created by the Commonwealth to administer the payment of pensions and the delivery of other benefits for retired employees of public corporations.\" (Defs.' Mot. \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   ERS argues that the Employers' Contributions are not \"special revenues\" as defined in either subdivision of Section 902(2) relied upon by Defendants. First, ERS contends that Section 902(2)(A) \"concerns special revenues from the operation of utility or transportation systems\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 32) and does not cover a benefits trust such as ERS, asserting that Employers' Contributions are not derived from the ownership, operation, or disposition of a project or system used primarily to provide transportation, utility, or other services. ERS invokes the principle of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generis\n   </em>\n   in support of the proposition that, where general words follow a designation of a particular subject, the meaning of those general words will include only things of the same type or nature as those particular subjects. (Pl.'s Mot. at 32-33.) ERS also contends that the legislative history of Section 902(2)(A) confirms a limited interpretation of \"other services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to Defendants' argument that Employers' Contributions fall within the meaning of Section 902(2)(A) because ERS's name includes the word \"system,\" ERS asserts that such an interpretation would expand the scope of services subject to Section 902(2)(A) in a manner that ignores Congress's specification of \"transportation\" and \"utility\" services in the definition, and that Defendants have failed to identify any case law expanding the scope of \"special revenues\" beyond a form of utility or transportation service. (Docket Entry No. 115, the \"Plaintiff's Opposition,\" at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, ERS argues that the Revenues do not constitute special revenues under Section 902(2)(D) because the \"particular functions\" of ERS are to \"collect and pay out pension payments to certain public retirees.\" (Pl.'s Opp. at 29.) ERS asserts that\n   Employers' Contributions are not \"derived from\" these \"particular functions\" of ERS and are instead derived from the labor of employees and used to fund the payment of pension benefits. (Pl.'s Mot. at 34.) Thus, ERS argues that Employers' Contributions are not a result of any services provided by ERS within the meaning of Section 902(2)(D). (Pl.'s Opp. at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court concludes that the Employers' Contributions are not \"special revenues\" within the meaning of either Section 902(2)(A) or Section 902(2)(D) of the Bankruptcy Code. \"[W]here words of a particular or specific meaning are followed by general words, the general words are construed to apply only to persons or conditions of the same general kind as those specifically mentioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyman v.

Here, the definition of special revenues as set forth in Section 902(2)(A) encompasses \"projects or systems of the debtor that are primarily used or intended to be used primarily to provide transportation, utility, or other services.\" Applying\n   <em>\n    ejusdem\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generis\n   </em>\n   as a principle of statutory interpretation to Section 902(2)(A) limits the meaning of \"other services\" to projects or systems of \"the same general kind\" as transportation or utility projects or systems. References to \"transportation\" and \"utility\" in this definition contemplate a physical system of providing services to third parties. ERS is a benefits trust that does not provide any \"transportation\" or \"utility\" services, the Employers' Contributions received by ERS are not calculated by reference to or otherwise tied to the provision of transportation, utility, or similar services, and ERS does not produce any product provided to employers in return for payments into its system. The Court therefore concludes that the term \"other services\" as included in the definition of special revenues set forth in Section 901(2)(A) does not encompass Employers' Contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Nor are the Employers' Contributions \"special revenues\" as defined in Section 902(2)(D) of the Bankruptcy Code. The contributions are a means of collection and delivery of deferred compensation to Commonwealth employees, and ERS therefore functions as a conduit for distribution of Employers' Contributions rather than as a provider of a \"particular function\" or service that itself produces revenue. There is no indication that ERS charges any fees for its services or that Pledged Property includes such fees. Nor, for substantially the same reasons explained in the preceding paragraph, are Employers' Contributions themselves revenues derived from the conduit function of ERS. Because the Employers' Contributions are not \"special revenues\" within the meaning of either Section 902(2)(A) or Section 902(2)(D) of the Bankruptcy Code, ERS is entitled as a matter of law to summary judgment dismissing Defendants' Counterclaim III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional Avoidance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants argue that the canon of constitutional avoidance mandates a construction of Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code that renders it inapplicable to Defendants' pre-PROMESA security interests, thus avoiding the \"grave and doubtful constitutional questions\" raised by an interpretation of Section 552 that would \"cut off\" Defendants' liens on the Pledged Property.

Specifically, Defendants\n   characterize PROMESA as a \"new and unprecedented federal law that for the first time in the history of the United States terminates post-petition liens granted by United States Territories on after acquired [ ] property in some circumstances\" and argue that the retroactive application of Section 552, as incorporated by Section 301 of PROMESA, to invalidate any of Defendants' property rights without just compensation would effectuate a taking in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

PROMESA was specifically enacted to enable Puerto Rico to address the unprecedented fiscal emergency that continues to plague the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. This Court cannot subvert the clear intent of Congress by \"choosing\" a prospective interpretation of Section 552 that would disable a tool Congress provided in a statute specifically designed to be available to Puerto Rico.
