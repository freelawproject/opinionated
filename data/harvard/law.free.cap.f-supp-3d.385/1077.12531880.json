But the foundation of the FAC remains the same as in the original complaint: that the Union violated Mr. Cooley's constitutional rights by refusing to accept his resignation and by continuing to collect money from his paycheck.

As this Court explained in its prior order,\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   did not explicitly announce the right of resignation Mr. Cooley seeks to enforce.

Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Cooley voluntary agreed to become a dues-paying member of the Union, and acknowledged restrictions on when he could withdraw from membership. ECF No. 50-9.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   did not automatically undo Mr. Cooley's agreement to be a member of the Union, nor did it render the collective bargaining agreement's withdrawal limitation provision unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

But, as this Court has previously explained, the continued deduction of dues by the Union here does not offend the requirement of freely given, affirmative consent of nonmembers discussed in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   . PI Order at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The collective bargaining agreement's limitation on the period of membership withdrawal is valid and enforceable, as discussed above, and Mr. Cooley's consent carries through his membership agreement. Mr. Cooley knowingly agreed to become a dues-paying member of the Union, rather than an agency fee-paying nonmember, because the cost difference was minimal. FAC \u00b6 13. That freely-made choice was not without consequences: Mr. Cooley had to pay dues as long as he remained a member; he could only withdraw from membership within a certain time frame; and, as a matter of logic and consistent with the structure of this arrangement, if he did not withdraw during that time frame his membership would automatically continue. ECF Nos. 50-1, 50-9. This was valid assent, and an intervening change in law does not taint that consent or invalidate his contractual agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p757\">\n    397 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p757\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p757\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court acknowledges Mr. Cooley's reference to his prior contractual arguments in order to preserve them for appeal. Opp'n to Union Mot. at 7-9, n.1. As before, this Court is unpersuaded by these arguments. Moreover, while Mr. Cooley contends he did not affirmatively agree to continue his union membership after June 30, 2016, it is worth noting that he did not, despite paying dues after June 30, 2016, seek to assert these contract-based arguments of non-membership until the disparity in payments for members and non-members increased substantially after\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   was decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thus, the Union was contractually authorized to continue collecting agreed-upon dues from Mr. Cooley, a union member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Refund of Compulsory Portion of Membership Dues PaidPre-\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Cooley asserts an entitlement to a refund of the compelled portion of his membership dues - equivalent to the Union's charged fair-share service fee (or agency fee) - paid to the Union before\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   was decided. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 63(a), 68(a). Mr. Cooley reasons that, even though he voluntarily agreed to join the Union and pay full membership dues, in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   world he would have, at minimum, been compelled to pay the Union an agency fee. Mr. Cooley contends that\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   invalidated such agency fees and, because\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively, a refund is warranted. This Court finds that the Union owes Mr. Cooley no such refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Mr. Cooley made an affirmative choice to become a member of the Union, obligating him to pay full membership dues. As a union member, Mr. Cooley acknowledges he never paid an \"agency fee.\" Opp'n to Union Mot. at 12 (\"Mr. Cooley never paid agency fees or fair-share fees to anyone; he is demanding a return of the compulsory portion of his union-membership dues.\"). But the Union membership dues are deducted as a single charge, not a split payment for compulsory fees and some extra membership charge in the manner for which Mr. Cooley seeks reimbursement. See ECF No. 50-4. Mr. Cooley's contractual dues payments to the Union were in no part compulsory. Mr. Cooley is not entitled to a reimbursement for compulsory agency fees which he never paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, and independently, Mr. Cooley's argument relies on\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   applying retroactively in a manner this Court\n   does not sanction. This Court acknowledges the general rule that a \"controlling interpretation of federal law must be given full retroactive effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Harper v. Virginia Dep't of Taxation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    509 U.S. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). But in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court itself did not specify whether the plaintiff was entitled to retrospective monetary relief for conduct the Supreme Court had authorized for the previous forty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 2486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding for further proceedings). This Court declines to forge new ground and create such liability here. Moreover, this Court notes that numerous lower courts have denied this retrospective monetary relief, finding the unions' good-faith reliance on then-existing law bars liability under Section 1983.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Babb v. California Teachers Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531321\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/378/857/\">\n    378 F. Supp. 3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. 2019) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Cooley's claims seeking a reimbursement of the compulsory portion of his union dues are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Constitutionality of California Government Code Sections 1152(a) and 1153(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Cooley contends that a public employer must immediately halt union-related payroll deductions upon learning that an employee has withdrawn his or her \"affirmative consent\" to those assessments. FAC \u00b6 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Cooley submits that California Government Code Sections 1152(a) and 1153(a) require public employers to divert employees' wages to the union upon the union's request, regardless of whether the employee consents to the deductions and even if the employee specifically instructs the employer not to divert his wages to the union. Opp'n to State Mot. at 1. Thus, Mr. Cooley argues, Sections 1152(a) and 1153(a) are unconstitutional because they prevent public employers from ending those allegedly impermissible deductions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 38-40, 58(e), 59(d), 60(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Cooley's argument fails for two reasons. First, this argument hinges on a finding that Mr. Cooley has a First Amendment right to immediately resign union membership and cease paying dues. But, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   did not announce such a right and no such right exist here.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   . Second, the argument fails for the independent reason that the Union's refusal to immediately accept Mr. Cooley's resignation and cease fee deductions does not constitute state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is well-settled that the First Amendment protects individuals only from state action, not private action.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Cmty. Access Corp. v. Halleck\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620206\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1921/#p1928\">\n    139 S.

There is no argument that the Union is acting as the state, or that the state itself took direct action. Under these circumstances, \"a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Blum v.

Mr. Cooley contends that the Union's failure to cease deductions is grounded in compliance with Sections 1152(a) and 1153(a), rather than a binding obligation to pay based on the terms of his membership. Opp'n to State Mot. at 3. This theory, unsupported by factual allegations, is insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Indeed, the FAC includes allegations that the Union attributed its refusal to accept the resignation to existing contractual rights based in Article 3.1.A.1. of the collective bargaining agreement, not any\n   mandate of Sections 1152(a) and 1153(a).
