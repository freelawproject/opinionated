INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Defendant United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (\"UPS\") Motion to Dismiss. Dkt. 4. On March 12, 2019, the Court held oral argument on the motion and took it under advisement. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds good cause to GRANT the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are a group of UPS drivers. \"From time to time UPS allows regular part-time employees to work as replacements for full-time package drivers....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When working as replacements for full-time package drivers, the part time employee[s] [are] classified as [ ] 'utility driver[s].' \" Dkt. 1-2, at 4. The Plaintiffs worked as part-time utility drivers for UPS between November 9, 2008, and August 1, 2013. At some point after August 1, 2013, they all became full-time package drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that \"[f]or at least the time period of November 9, 2008 to and through August 1, 2013, UPS agreed that time spent as a utility driver would be applied to the employees' full-time package car progression period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]he Progression Period determines the rate of pay an employee receives\" as a full-time package driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Plaintiffs became full-time package drivers, UPS allegedly refused to apply the time they spent driving as part-time utility drivers to their progression periods. As such, they contend that \"UPS paid [them] at a lower hourly rate than the agreed upon hourly rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit against UPS in Idaho state court asserting a single cause of action under the Idaho Wage Claim Act [IWCA], Idaho Code (\"I.C.\") \u00a7\u00a7 45-601 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   UPS removed the case to this Court on August 27, 2018. It argues that the Plaintiffs' wage claims are preempted by Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"). This provision is codified as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). UPS contends that under Section 301 of the LMRA, Plaintiffs' claims are \"effectively federal claims\" and, therefore, removal to this Court was proper. Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   UPS now seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) resolution of the claims require an analysis and interpretation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), and related supplemental agreements, entered into between UPS and the Union, of which Plaintiffs are members; and (2) pursuant to the terms of the CBA and its related agreements, Plaintiffs are required to resolve their wage claims through the Union's grievance process, which includes binding arbitration, not in the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dkt. 4-1, at 2. Alternatively, \"UPS also seeks dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Additionally, \"if the\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   is plainly based on state law, \u00a7 301 preemption is not mandated simply because the defendant refers to the CBA in mounting a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and punctuation omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kobold\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, the plaintiff was a nurse who belonged to a union. That union had negotiated the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment with her employer. The CBA stated that \"nurses who work extra shifts receive premium pay at one and one-half times the regular rate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n    at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Eventually, the plaintiff \"learned that for more than one year [her employer] had not paid her the premium rate for extra shifts worked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the union filed a grievance on the plaintiff's behalf and secured a settlement that paid her the amount she was owed, the plaintiff still sued her employer for failing \"to pay all wages owed her\n   <em>\n    at each pay period\n   </em>\n   ,\" in violation of state law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n    at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Ninth Circuit found that her state law claims were preempted by the LMRA. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Before a court could calculate the total amount [plaintiff] is owed, it must determine which of the shifts she worked qualified for premium pay. The Oregon statutes under which [plaintiff] seeks relief provide only that an employee be paid \"the wages due and owing to them.\" ... They do not provide any means with which to assess whether wages are \"due and owing.\" To answer that question, a court must consult the ... CBA. In this case, because of a particular provision of the ... CBA that is in dispute, a court must interpret, not just refer to or look at, the ... CBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350204\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1024/#p1032\">\n    Id. at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, IWCA simply requires employers to \"pay all wages due to their employees.\" I.C. \u00a7 45-608. It does not provide any means by which to assess what wages are due and owing. That determination appears to depend on where a driver is on the progression period scale. That scale is contained within the CBA (Dkt. 4-3, at 152-154). As such, the Court would likely be required to interpret the CBA, rather than simply \"look to\" it. If that is the case, pre-emption occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, uncertainty exists regarding where the Plaintiffs' belief that they were promised a higher wage stems from. Plaintiffs' Complaint (as well as their briefing for this motion) is vague on this point. At oral argument, Plaintiffs' Counsel stated that this promise\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have come from Plaintiffs' supervisors rather than the CBA-although he was unsure. Plaintiffs' Counsel also indicated that there\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be a written agreement independent of the CBA that includes this promise, or it may have simply been an oral agreement. Plaintiffs' Complaint does not specify, nor was Plaintiffs' Counsel able to do so at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Such vague and uncertain assertions, particularly when raised for the first time at oral argument, are frustrating for the Court, and unfair to opposing counsel. UPS filed its Motion to Dismiss on September 4, 2018. Due to scheduling conflicts, oral argument was delayed twice, and ultimately did not occur until approximately six months after UPS filed its motion. Plaintiffs have had more than enough time to raise this argument, and absolutely should have included it in their briefing. Instead, both the Court and opposing counsel proceeded as if Plaintiffs were relying on a different interpretation of the CBA, because Plaintiffs never indicated otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court now finds itself unsure of whether a separate agreement existed between the parties or not. Nevertheless, when subject matter jurisdiction is challenged pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    Indus. Tectonics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051046\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/1090/#p1092\">\n    912 F.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiffs' vague assertion that there\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be a separate agreement outside of the CBA does not meet this burden, and the Court will proceed as if no separate agreement exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that \u00a7 301 of the LMRA pre-empts Plaintiffs' state law claim, and GRANTS UPS' Motion to Dismiss. \"Ordinarily, a case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be dismissed without prejudice so that a plaintiff may reassert his claims in a competent court.\"\n   <em>\n    Frigard v.
