Prior to Cosgrove's arrival, Plaintiff helped train police officers to monitor and evaluate other officers; after Cosgrove became commanding officer, however, Cosgrove relieved Plaintiff of those duties and, instead, assigned Plaintiff to deliver mail and to other tasks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 34; Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Until 2015, Plaintiff had consistently received ratings of 4.0 (out of 5.0) on his annual performance evaluations, representing a rating of \"highly competent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18-19, 21, 23-24;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18-19, 21, 23-24. Beginning in 2015, however, Plaintiff's conduct deteriorated, causing him to be disciplined on several occasions. In three instances, Plaintiff received disciplinary warnings, known as command discipline (\"CD\"), for making unauthorized changes to his shift schedule (known as \"tour changes\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 44-51, 56-57; Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 44-51, 56-57; Cosgrove Decl.

In another instance, Plaintiff shouted and waved his arms at two officers because he had not been told that a subordinate had momentarily stepped out of the office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cosgrove Decl. Ex. A at 5. And in two other instances, Plaintiff shouted at and threatened to suspend a fellow officer in front of her co-workers, bringing her to tears.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cosgrove Decl. Ex. H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Also during this time, Plaintiff's attendance was poor. Due to an \"excessive\" number of sick days that Plaintiff took \"in comparison to the majority of the [police] force,\" in late 2014, Plaintiff was designated as a \"Chronic Sick: Category A\" employee.

These evaluations stated that Plaintiff had \"extremely poor\" judgment, as he had \"unprofessionally reprimanded subordinate members of the command in public\" and had spoken \"to subordinates in an unprofessional manner.\" Carter Decl.
