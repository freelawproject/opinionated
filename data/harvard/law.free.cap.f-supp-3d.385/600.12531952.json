(R. 54, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.) Plaintiff operates a sterilization facility in Willowbrook, Illinois, where it stores ethylene oxide, a chemical substance used to sterilize medical devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants overstepped their authority under Illinois law and deprived it of procedural due process under the U.S. Constitution when Defendants issued a \"seal order\" that required Plaintiff to seal all storage containers of ethylene oxide at the Willowbrook facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, 38-63.) Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (R. 63, Mot. at 1-2.) Defendants' motion is granted for the reasons stated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Broadview Heights, Ohio, that provides commercial sterilization services for companies in the healthcare and food industries. (R. 54, Am. Compl. \u00b6 5.) Plaintiff operates a sterilization facility in Willowbrook that, on a typical day, sterilizes approximately 1,000 medical devices used in heart surgery, 1,000 knee implants, 1,500 surgical kits, 16,000 catheters, 11,000 syringes, thousands of diabetes monitoring and care kits, and many other medical products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff or its predecessors have operated this facility continuously since 1984, and the facility has allegedly been operating pursuant to permit number 95120085 issued by IEPA under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") Clean Air Act Permit Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Plaintiff alleges that it has consistently emitted \"far less ethylene oxide than its permit allows,\" and that it has \"voluntarily improved its safety measures for ethylene oxide well beyond what the law requires.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) Plaintiff also claims that the Willowbrook facility is not currently in violation of any rules or regulations promulgated by EPA or IEPA, and that its operating permits have not been\n   modified, terminated, or revoked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 15, 2019, Defendants issued a seal order, which sealed \"[a]ll storage containers of ethylene oxide\" at Plaintiff's Willowbrook facility pursuant to 415 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/34(b), a statutory provision in Illinois' Environmental Protection Act (the \"Act\") that Plaintiff claims only applies if an emergency exists or if there is imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health, welfare, or environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Plaintiff alleges that, instead of seeking relief through the court system or regulatory process, \"Defendants decided to bypass the court system ... to 'sandbag' [Plaintiff]\" by issuing the seal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff claims that at no point before or on the date the seal order was issued, did the IEPA or EPA represent that the Willowbrook facility's use and storage of ethylene oxide posed a safety concern or emergency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff alleges that the seal order justifies itself by citing a questionable August 2018 report regarding the Willowbrook facility's ethylene oxide emissions, and that the EPA sent letters to Illinois officials stating that the Willowbrook facility was not causing immediate harm to persons in and around Willowbrook. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-29, 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff has allegedly attempted to reach out to IEPA to determine what measures it can take to have the seal order lifted and continue sterilization activities in Willowbrook, but Plaintiff claims that Defendants have not cooperated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Plaintiff alleges that the seal order has caused serious harm to Plaintiff, Plaintiff's customers, and the United States' healthcare system at large. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) According to Plaintiff, the closure of the Willowbrook facility impacts several medical device companies and \"risks creating [medical] device shortages with serious adverse effects on healthcare in this country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 30, 2018, the state of Illinois filed a lawsuit against Plaintiff in Illinois state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff removed the case to this District where the case was assigned to U.S. District Judge John Lee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that the October 2018 lawsuit seeks the same relief as the seal order, but none of the relief in that case was pursued on an emergency basis or claimed to be necessary to resolve an \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" to the public health, welfare, or environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 11, 2019, Judge Lee remanded the October 2018 lawsuit back to state court. (18-cv-8010, R. 48, Order at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Lee reasoned there was no subject-matter jurisdiction to proceed in federal court and thus rejected Plaintiff's contention that the State brought a federal cause of action sufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13.) Specifically, Judge Lee reasoned that the lawsuit did not involve a suit by the State against Plaintiff for failure to comply with the Clean Air Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207401\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , or any other federal statute that might raise a federal question, but instead was a suit to enjoin Plaintiff \"\n   <em>\n    despite\n   </em>\n   its compliance with the [Clean Air Act][.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) As a result, Judge Lee concluded that the lawsuit was one involving only state law causes of action, and that Illinois' state laws and regulations implementing the Clean Air Act were not claims arising under federal law that could provide a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately a month before Judge Lee remanded the October 2018 action, on February 18, 2019, Plaintiff filed its initial complaint in this case, which brought a\n   claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for deprivation of its procedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and a claim alleging that Defendants violated Section 34(b) of the Act. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-34.) The same day Plaintiff filed its complaint, it also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"). (R. 5, Mot.) The motion for a TRO was heard on February 20, 2019, by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly who was the designated emergency judge at the time. (R. 28, Min. Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Kennelly denied Plaintiff's motion for a TRO and reasoned that Plaintiff did not have a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. (R. 51-1, Tr. at 74.) Judge Kennelly relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313944\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/264/#p298\">\n    452 U.S. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298-305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313944\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/264/#p298\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313944\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/264/#p298\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), in which the Supreme Court ruled that a state statute did not violate constitutional rights to due process although it allowed a state agency to order, without a hearing beforehand, a cessation of surface mining if necessary to protect public health or safety so long as a hearing or process occurred after the issuance of the cessation order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-76.) Judge Kennelly reasoned further that the controlling inquiry was whether Section 34(b) of the Act is incapable of providing due process and not whether Defendants had authority under the Act to issue the seal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   75-76.) Judge Kennelly concluded that because the Act provides for due process after Defendants issued the seal order, Plaintiff has little chance of succeeding on the merits of its due process claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Judge Kennelly also found that Plaintiff's lawsuit did not have a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits because it essentially asks a federal court to order a state official to comply with state law and therefore is likely barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77.) Accordingly, Judge Kennelly denied the TRO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 27, 2019, the case was reassigned to this Court. (R. 38, Order.) Subsequently, on March 7, 2019, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (R. 54, Am. Compl.) The amended complaint brings three counts against Defendants. (R. 54, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-63.) The first two counts bring claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for a deprivation of Plaintiff's procedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based on Defendants' alleged failure to provide a hearing or other adequate process to challenge the issuance of the February 15 seal order before or after Defendants issued the seal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-57.) The third count alleges that the seal order is an unlawful use of Defendants' authority under Section 34(b) of the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint, (R. 63, Mot.), first arguing that Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that Defendants deprived Plaintiff of its constitutional right to a hearing or other process to challenge the seal order before or after it was issued. (R. 64, Mem. at 6-12.) Defendants maintain that the Constitution allows them to deprive Plaintiff of its property without a pre-deprivation hearing in situations where \"swift action is necessary to protect the public health and safety.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Defendants also argue that a pre-deprivation due process claim only arises if the Act is incapable of affording due process; therefore, according to Defendants, Plaintiff's claim fails because the Act does afford due process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's claim that it was deprived of due process after the seal order was issued, Defendants again argue that the Act affords adequate process and therefore the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's\n   post-deprivation due process claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Defendants also argue that the seal order itself outlines what Plaintiff can do to have the seal order lifted, and that Plaintiff adopts an untenable position that would require Defendants to provide detailed instructions regarding the steps Plaintiff must take before the seal order is lifted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Defendants, because there is no viable federal claim, the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's state law claim because the Court is left with no independent grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Defendant also maintains that, in addition to Plaintiff's failure to state a federal claim giving rise to federal jurisdiction, Plaintiff's lawsuit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment because it asks the Court to order state officials to comply with state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.) Lastly, Defendants argue that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this case because it involves an ongoing state administrative enforcement proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that it has adequately alleged a deprivation of its procedural due process rights. (R. 72, Resp. at 5-12.) Plaintiff also maintains that it has sufficiently pleaded a violation of due process because it has alleged that Defendants issued a facially valid permit to operate the Willowbrook facility and then deprived Plaintiff of that permit without providing notice of the permit's invalidity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11.) According to Plaintiff, controlling legal authorities forbid such \"regulation by ambush.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Plaintiff also contends that its lawsuit is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that the abstention doctrine from\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   does not apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15.) Defendants' motion to dismiss is fully briefed and ripe for the Court's consideration.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 54, Am. Compl. \u00b6 41.)
