Medifast has moved to exclude these witnesses, contending that their causation opinions are unreliable because they are not based on scientific evidence. It also challenges the qualifications of the nutritionist. Medifast additionally seeks to exclude a third expert witness because he relies on the causation testimony of the medical doctor to opine on the adequacy of Medifast's warnings and labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Without the testimony of the endocrinologist and the nutritionist, Ms. Loverdi cannot prove that the Medifast product caused or contributed to her thyroid condition. Thus, Medifast has simultaneously filed a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that the endocrinologist, although qualified, cannot support his opinion with reliable medical or scientific evidence and that the nutritionist is not qualified to render a medical diagnosis and a medical causation opinion. We do not reach a third expert's opinion regarding the necessity of the adequacy of warnings\n   because there is no reliable evidence of causation. Therefore, we shall grant both Medifast's motion to exclude the testimony of Ms. Loverdi's proffered witnesses and its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Angela Loverdi is a 58 year-old female with a family history of thyroid disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an effort to lose weight, she began a Medifast diet plan in March of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dietary program included Medifast calorie-restricted, meal substitution products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the delivery frequency, Ms. Loverdi consumed no more than two to three Medifast products daily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She continued to consume the diet products through late August 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June of 2016, Ms. Loverdi began to experience \"significant ... thyroid and abdominal issues and injuries,\" such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, constipation, heart burn, malnutrition, lethargy, irritability, insomnia, decreased concentration, anemia, lightheadedness, and thyroid issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August of 2016, she sought medical treatment from a general practitioner and an endocrinologist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Six months later, in January of 2017, Ms. Loverdi had her first thyroid test, revealing marked hypothyroidism and high thyroid antibody titers, \"consistent with a diagnosis of Hashimoto's or autoimmune thyroid disease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Loverdi's endocrinologist subsequently diagnosed her with Hashimoto's disease, the most common cause of hypothyroidism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After taking thyroid medication, her thyroid function gradually returned to normal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Believing that her thyroid condition was linked to her ingestion of the Medifast product, Ms. Loverdi and her husband, Charles, filed this action. Angela Loverdi asserts claims for negligence, products liability under \u00a7 402(A) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, breach of express and implied warranty, and misrepresentation. Charles Loverdi brings a loss of consortium claim. Ms. Loverdi contends that the soy protein ingredient in Medifast's meal plan caused her to develop hypothyroidism and her injuries were the result of Medifast's unsafe dietary products that defendants knowingly placed into the stream of commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also alleges that Medifast failed to give proper warnings and/or disclose the risk of injury, and made misleading and false representations that its products are nutritious, healthy, and good for weight loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To prove her case, Ms. Loverdi retained Dr. Jonathan Williams and Dr. Kaayla Daniel as expert witnesses to opine that her ingesting the Medifast products caused or contributed to her thyroid disease. She relies on them and Dr. Richard George to establish that Medifast failed to warn its\n   consumers of the soy-based dangers of its products. Medifast challenges each of these witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As \"gatekeeper,\" the trial judge must ensure that expert testimony is relevant and reliable.\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Medifast attacks his opinions as unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argues that his opinion that soy causes hypothyroidism has not been properly tested or validated and has not been submitted to peer review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Medifast, his opinion runs against the overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence that demonstrates that there is no causal link between soy protein and hypothyroidism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   It emphasizes that there is currently no authoritative body which recognizes soy as a risk factor or a cause of hypothyroidism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the FDA identifies soy protein as one that is \"generally recognized as\n   safe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Williams couched his opinion in qualified terms. He candidly admitted that there are no tests or studies that show that soy contributes to hypothyroidism in those predisposed to the condition, which he characterized as \"unhealthy individuals.\" He conceded that \"[q]uestions remain regarding the susceptibility of non-healthy individuals, such as those with autoimmune tendency as Ms. Loverdi, to develop overt hypothyroidism when exposed to a soy product.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The basis for his opinion is that it is \"not [ ] unproven\" that consumption of soy by one predisposed with hypothyroidism is at risk of developing the condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Remarkably, he did not opine or suggest that it has been proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Dr. Williams conceded that there has been no specific study involving \"at risk\" individuals such as Ms. Loverdi, he reiterated that research on soy and hypothyroidism with this population still \"needs further study.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, by his own admission, Dr. Williams has no scientific or medical evidence to support his opinion. Because it has not been \"unproven\" does not mean it has been proven. On the contrary, there are no studies that establish a link between soy and hypothyroidism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Williams' testimony does nothing more than impermissively shift the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. He suggests that Medifast must prove the negative-that soy does not increase the risk of hypothyroidism for one predisposed to the condition when he himself cannot prove that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. Williams could point to only one study he claimed supports a possible link between soy and hypothyroidism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The study did not include patients with a genetic predisposition for hypothyroidism and instead examined individuals who had \"subclinical hypothyroidism,\" those who displayed elevated thyroid levels which had not risen to overt hypothyroidism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Williams did not know whether Ms. Loverdi had subclinical hypothyroidism before beginning the Medifast products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, he could not say if Ms. Loverdi was a cohort in the study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Williams acknowledged that Ms. Loverdi would have had to consume the minimum amount of soy protein that the subjects in the study consumed to develop overt hypothyroidism. Yet, he did not know how much she had actually consumed and conceded it likely did not reach triggering levels. Significantly, Dr. Williams also conceded that the authors of the study were unable to replicate the results in a repeat study of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, ultimately concluding that soy consumption \"was not associated with either deterioration of thyroid function or an increased rate of thyroid failure....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The reliability requirement ensures that the expert's opinion is supported by appropriate validation which establishes the standard of evidentiary reliability.\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Without expert opinion that soy is linked to hypothyroidism, there is no predicate for the need for warnings.

Also, Dr. Daniel is unqualified to render an expert causation opinion. Dr. Richard George's opinions on the necessity and the adequacy of warnings relies on the unreliable opinions of Dr. Williams. Therefore, we shall grant Medifast's motion to exclude plaintiffs' experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Medifast has moved for summary judgment, contending that Ms. Loverdi cannot prove her claims without expert testimony. Ms. Loverdi agrees. Now that we have precluded expert opinion that the Medifast soy-based products caused or increased the risk of harm to her, Ms. Loverdi cannot prove her case. Therefore, we shall grant judgment in favor of Medifast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller v.
