The MAVNI program provides an expedited path to citizenship to foreign nationals who are legally present in the United States, possess critical foreign-language or medical skills, and serve honorably during designated periods of hostilities. The question before the Court is\n   whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") and its sub-agency U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") acted lawfully when they instituted a policy on July 7, 2017, declining to naturalize MAVNI applicants until the applicant has been determined suitable for service by the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DOD\") and the U.S. Army. Because USCIS's purported reasons for waiting for these military suitability adjudications do not comport with the evidence before the Court, it concludes that the challenged portion of USCIS's policy is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (\"APA\").

In February 2010, James Clapper, then Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, issued a memo expressing concern that MAVNI enlistees serving on active duty had not undergone sufficient \"counterintelligence-focused screening\" and recommending \"immediate steps\" to correct the oversight. (DOD Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness: Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest Personnel (MAVNI), Feb. 17, 2010 (DOD AR 151).) Later that year, DOD imposed enhanced security screening for all current and future MAVNI soldiers, including a \"Single Scope Background Investigation\" (\"SSBI\" or \"Tier 5\" investigation, hereinafter referred to as \"Tier 5\"), which is a detailed background check conducted by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\") and is typically used to determine whether an individual may receive access to classified information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F.

The new DOD policy also required the Service (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the Army) to institute a \"comprehensive counterintelligence-focused security review [\"CI Review\"] and monitoring program for MAVNI recruits.\" (DOD Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Depts.: Two-Year Extension of Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) Pilot Program at 1-2, Aug. 17, 2010 (Pls.'

With subsequent reauthorizations, DOD continued to refine security screening requirements for MAVNIs. In late 2014, DOD specified that all MAVNI applicants would be subject to a \"suitability determination\" based on a National Intelligence Agency Check (\"NIAC\") name\n   search,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tier 5, and CI Review, including an issue-oriented CI interview and/or polygraph \"as needed to resolve any foreign influence or foreign preference concerns.\" (DOD Memorandum: Two-Year Extension of Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) Pilot Program Implementation Policy at 6, Dec. 19, 2014 (USCIS AR 215).)

When a MAVNI soldier submits to USCIS his or her naturalization application, known as Form N-400, he or she must also submit a certification of honorable service from DOD, known as Form N-426.

USCIS's long-standing interpretation of the honorable-service requirement under \u00a7 1440 is that any applicant who is no longer serving must have been separated under \"honorable\" or \"general under honorable\" conditions, and that a neutral \"uncharacterized\" separation is not sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 USCIS Policy Manual, pt.

This \"military suitability determination\" has two steps, which together are referred to by plaintiffs as the \"adjudicatory phase\" of DOD's vetting process. First, based on the DOD investigation results, DOD's Central Adjudication Facility (\"DOD CAF\") makes a recommendation (in later documents referred to as a \"military service suitability recommendation\" or \"MSSR\") to the Army. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 30 Memo at USCIS AR 238.) Neither DOD CAF nor the Army conducts any additional investigation of the applicant, but rather they rely on the information gathered during the DOD investigatory phase and consider whether any derogatory findings can be \"mitigated\" by information from the investigations or provided by the applicant. To make this MSSR recommendation, DOD CAF assesses the applicant using as its criteria 13 National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DOD Memorandum: Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Dec. 29, 2005), Aug. 30, 2016 (Pls.'

The Adjudicative Guidelines provide detailed criteria for evaluating an individual's background, including\n   how certain information may be mitigable, and are generally used to determine whether an individual may access classified information or hold a national security position. The Adjudicative Guidelines include criteria such as allegiance to the United States, Foreign Influence, Foreign Preference, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct, as well as guidance for determining whether certain conduct or information about an applicant should be disqualifying or can be mitigated.

Appx. 98-121 (describing the criteria for each of the Adjudicative Guidelines).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, once DOD CAF has rendered the MSSR, it is provided to the Army for its review. The Army reviews the recommendation and, if it is not favorable, it also reviews the underlying investigatory results to determine if the \"derogatory information\" on which the unfavorable MSSR was based can be mitigated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 30 Memo at USCIS AR 238 (\"If derogatory information was revealed, the DoD CAF will provide information to the accessing service via the Case Adjudication Tracking System.\").) The service then renders a final \"military suitability determination\" (commonly referred to as a \"military service suitability determination\" or \"MSSD\") based on DOD CAF's recommendation and on the service's own needs: \"The accessing service will use this information to then render the final military suitability determination in accordance with DoDI 1304.26 and any service specific policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at USCIS AR 234, 239, 241 (additional references to the \"suitability determination\" for MAVNIs).) It is the MSSD that determines whether a MAVNI may attend Basic Training and then proceed to active duty. If a MAVNI is found suitable for service, he or she ships to Basic Training; if found unsuitable he or she is promptly separated, or discharged, from the military. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at USCIS AR 241 (flow chart depicting separation immediately after \"NON FAVORABLE Military Suitability Determination\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As a result of the Sept. 30 Memo, MAVNIs have had to wait significantly longer between their dates of enlistment and dates for shipment to Basic Training. In response to this situation, in October and November 2016 the Army began placing MAVNIs in the Army's Delayed Training Program (\"DTP\"), where they would remain enlisted and continue to drill as reservists while awaiting shipment to Basic Training. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Daniel Renaud \u00b6 21, July 7, 2017 (USCIS AR 249) (\"7/7/17 Renaud Decl.\"); 7/28/17 Miller Decl. at 6.) Soldiers drilling in DTP are categorized by the Army as \"entry level\" because they are reservists who have not yet attended Basic Training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Enlisted Administrative Separations, Army National Guard and Reserve, Army Reg. 135-178, Glossary \u00a7 II. If a soldier is discharged from entry-level status, the discharge is not characterized as honorable or other than honorable, but rather by the neutral \"uncharacterized\" classification.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-11(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Generally, a soldier could remain in DTP for up to two years, after which he or she must attend Basic Training or face discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/28/17 Miller Decl. at 10 (quoting National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, \u00a7 1115(c), P.L. No. 102-484 (Oct. 23, 1992)).) Because it was taking so long to become eligible for Basic Training under the new requirements, some MAVNIs exceeded this two-year limit on DTP enlistment and faced discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) To alleviate this problem, DOD \"determined that in this instance the [2-year] limitation may be waived if movement to training remains impracticable,\" and extended the 2-year DTP timeout deadline by an additional year to permit MAVNIs to remain enlisted while they waited for the results of the\n   DOD investigatory phase and their MSSDs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOD Memorandum: Waiver of Minimum Training Requirements for Certain Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI), Jul. 27, 2017 (ECF No. 26 at 4) (enlarging the DTP timeout deadline to 36 months).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Another byproduct of the delay was that by early 2017, approximately 500 MAVNIs drilling in DTP sought and received signed N-426s and submitted naturalization applications before having started Basic Training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirwa\n   </em>\n   , 285 F. Supp. 3d at 31 (citing 10/18/2017 Tr. at 21-22). These individuals had not completed their DOD background investigations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/7/17 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 21 (USCIS AR 249).) According to Daniel Renaud, USCIS Associate Director, Field Operations Directorate, \"[p]rior to the September 30, 2016 memo, USCIS had received few, if any, applications from MAVNI recruits who were drilling in the DTP. Instead, the recruits usually attended Basic Training soon after enlisting in the Army and waited until they attended Basic Training to apply for naturalization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Against this backdrop, on May 19, 2017, DOD issued an \"Action Memo\" addressed to the Secretary of Defense, identifying four primary \"MAVNI Risk Groups,\" along with mitigation plans for addressing the risks identified with each group. (DOD Action Memo: Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) Pilot Program at 2, May 19, 2017 (Pls.' Appx. 7) (\"DOD May 2017 Action Memo\").) Of relevance to the plaintiffs in this case, DOD identified as \"Group 3\" the approximately 2,400 MAVNIs drilling in DTP whose Tier 5 investigations had not been completed, including the approximately 500 MAVNIs who had received their Form N-426s and applied for naturalization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Action Memo recommended that all DTP MAVNIs be discharged using Secretarial plenary authority, \"[e]xcept for individual cases deemed vital to the national interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. USCIS's July 7, 2017 Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As far back as 2016 and into 2017, DOD was communicating to USCIS its growing concerns about the MAVNI program, through both discussions and written materials provided on an ad-hoc basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Daniel M. Renaud \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, Mar. 5, 2018 (USCIS AR 2-3) (\"3/5/18 Renaud Decl.\").) According to Stephanie Miller, Director of DOD's Accession Policy Directorate, DOD senior leaders informed USCIS officials in April 2017 that DOD \"was concerned about the naturalization of individuals whose [Tier 5] background investigation and DoD counterintelligence security review has not yet been completed.\" (Miller 7/7/17 Decl. \u00b6 18.) Based on these concerns, according to Ms. Miller, DOD and USCIS \"jointly determined that it was in the best interest of the United States to ensure that the naturalization decision of USCIS was informed by the outcome of [these completed reviews]\" and \"mutually agreed that USCIS would slow down the Form N-400 adjudications of the MAVNI pilot program applicants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 13, 2017, USCIS \"issued a written hold\" on these soldiers' naturalization applications. (7/7/2017 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 25 (USCIS AR 250-51).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In early May 2017, USCIS learned from DOD about two cases where a MAVNI soldier had \"naturalized before his or her DoD background checks revealed derogatory information that USCIS would have considered, had it known about the information,\n   in determining whether the individual was eligible to naturalize.\" (3/5/18 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 3 (USCIS AR 2) (referencing ad-hoc conversations and emails between DOD and USCIS personnel included at USCIS AR 11-13).) USCIS learned from DOD of these two cases during a field visit in May 2017 to Fort Jackson, a military base used by the Army for Basic Training. Follow-up emails between USCIS and DOD personnel who participated in this visit indicate that approximately 21 MAVNI soldiers were already in Basic Training although their Tier 5 investigations were still pending. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIS AR 11-13.) The emails also indicate that two MAVNIS who had already naturalized were \"chaptered out unfavorably\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , discharged after being determined ineligible to enlist, one for \"bad conduct\" and one for \"failure to adapt.\" (USCIS AR 12-13.) On the same day as the DOD May 2017 Action Memo, USCIS sent another email to the field to clarify that its April 13 written hold on MAVNI N-400 applications affected only DTP MAVNIs who had not yet shipped to Basic Training. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/7/17 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 25 (USCIS AR 250-51);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   USCIS Email, MAVNI Hold, May 19, 2017 (ECF No. 23-1 at 10-11).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Meanwhile, DOD's Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") was investigating the MAVNI program, including national security concerns related to soldiers' potential foreign ties or loyalty to the United States. In June 2017, OIG issued a classified report (the \"OIG classified report\") detailing its findings and highlighting these national security concerns. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/5/18 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 4 (USCIS AR 2-3); Memo, DHS USCIS MAVNI Program, July 3, 2017 (USCIS AR 7) (\"July 3 DHS Memo\").) Then, on July 3, 2017, DHS issued a one-page memo for the Secretary of Homeland Security, titled \"DHS USCIS MAVNI Program,\" referring to the OIG classified report and other concerns about the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 3 DHS Memo (USCIS AR 7).) The July 3 DHS Memo stressed \"security concerns regarding MAVNI recruits, informed by a classified DOD Inspector General report,\" and stated that \"USCIS views additional background checks at the naturalization stage as necessary and appropriate in accordance with its general authority to conduct background checks on naturalization applicants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Mr. Renaud sent an email containing the USCIS \"Guidance\" that is the gravamen of this litigation. The email is just over one page and instructs that a MAVNI naturalization applicant may not proceed to interview until \"all enhanced DoD security checks are completed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Email from Daniel M. Renaud, Updated MAVNI N-400 Guidance, July 7, 2017 (USCIS AR 4-5) (\"July 7 Guidance\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The July 7 Guidance makes clear that the enhanced security checks referred to are those required under the Sept. 30 Memo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   USCIS must ensure that each MAVNI naturalization applicant demonstrates good moral character and attachment to the U.S. Constitution as required by the INA and 8 CFR. In order to do so, each applicant must receive proper DoD vetting and clearance in alignment with the September 30, 2016 MAVNI extension authorization and restrictions. Consequently, USCIS will not proceed to interview, approve, or oath any currently pending or future MAVNI naturalization applicants applying for naturalization under INA \u00a7 329 [codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], regardless of their active duty or reserve service, until all enhanced DoD security checks are completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (July 7 Guidance at 2 (USCIS AR 5).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The July 7 Guidance constituted a major change in USCIS policy. For the prior seventeen years, USCIS had basically relied on an FBI background check and a DCII index check to vet MAVNI applicants, but had not required extensive and lengthy DOD background investigations or an MSSD adjudication prior to considering a MAVNI's naturalization application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F.

First, it summarizes DOD and USCIS concerns over the prior year and a half, especially \"circumstances and instances\" of MAVNI enlistees becoming naturalized \"before a DoD background check revealed derogatory information suggesting that [the applicant] lacked good moral character or attachment to the U.S. Constitution.\" (July 7 Guidance (USCIS AR 5) (noting that investigations had subsequently identified such conduct as \"immigration fraud, criminal acts, aggravated felonies, active membership and participation in the Communist Party, and national security concerns\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   7/7/17 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 17 (USCIS AR 248) (noting the same concerns); 3/5/18 Renaud Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (USCIS AR 2) (noting the same concerns and citing the OIG classified report and \"other classified documents\").) The July 7 Guidance explained: \"USCIS has determined that the completion of DOD background checks is relevant to a MAVNI recruit's eligibility for naturalization.... USCIS must ensure that each MAVNI naturalization applicant demonstrates good moral character and attachment to the U.S. Constitution as required by the INA and 8 CFR.\" (July 7 Guidance at 1-2 (USCIS AR 4-5).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., May 24, 2017 (ECF No. 1).) Plaintiffs initially alleged that USCIS and DOD were unlawfully delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications due to improper interference in the process by DOD. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin DOD from interfering and USCIS from delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications. (Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Injunction at 1, June 28, 2017 (ECF No. 17).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Shortly thereafter, USCIS issued the July 7 Guidance and plaintiffs sought to challenge it as part of this litigation. The Court ordered plaintiffs to amend their complaint and revise their request for preliminary relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, July 19, 2017 (ECF No. 24).) Plaintiffs then amended their complaint to challenge the July 7 Guidance as unlawful. (1st Am. Compl., Aug. 4, 2017 (ECF No. 27).) They complained that DOD had unlawfully interfered in the naturalization process and USCIS had allowed DOD to do so by agreeing to wait until the \"enhanced\" checks were \"complete\" before processing naturalization applications. Plaintiffs also moved for class certification. (Pls.' Mot. to Certify Class, Aug. 11, 2017 (ECF No. 30).) The Court certified the class and appointed class counsel. The class is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   all persons who have (i) enlisted in the Selected Reserve through the MAVNI program prior to October 13, 2017; (ii) served honorably with a Selected Reserve unit through participation in at least one qualifying drill period or served in an active-duty status; (iii) submitted N-400 Applications for Naturalization;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (iv) been issued Form N-426s certifying honorable service as a member of the Selected Reserve or in active-duty status; and (v) have had the processing or final adjudication of their naturalization applications (including naturalization itself) withheld or delayed because of (a) a final USCIS processing hold for MAVNIs, (b) a DOD N-426 policy review, (c) a DOD N-426 recall/decertification policy, (d) enhanced DOD security screenings, (e) a DOD CAF adjudication, (f) a national security determination, and/or (g) military service suitability vetting determination[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Order at 1-2, Oct. 27, 2017 (ECF No. 72).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that although plaintiffs had shown irreparable harm, they had not shown that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F.

At the time, plaintiffs did not clearly distinguish between the two separate components of DOD's review-the DOD investigatory phase from which DOD might learn \"derogatory information\" about an applicant, and the \"military suitability determinations\" (DOD's MSSR and the Army's MSSD) based on that information. The Court found that, while the adoption of the July 7 Guidance constituted a \"dramatic change in DHS/USCIS policy,\" the new policy was a \"respon[se] to present national security concerns\" and the need to gather information relevant to those concerns was likely within the discretion of USCIS.\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F.

PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On March 14, 2018, plaintiffs moved to file a third amended complaint based on what they characterized as ongoing violations by defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Points and Auth. in Supp. of Pls.' Mot. for Leave to File 3d Am. Compl., Mar. 14, 2018 (ECF No. 115).) Plaintiffs sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to challenge defendants' interpretation of the July 7 Guidance as requiring that USCIS wait not only for the completion of the DOD investigatory phase, but also for the final MSSD (hereinafter referred to as the \"MSSD Requirement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Court denied leave to amend the complaint but informed the parties that it would \"consider plaintiffs' allegations regarding USCIS's waiting for the results of the MSSD to be part of the second amended complaint,\" since their complaint challenged the entirety of the July 7 Guidance. (Order at 1, Apr. 12, 2018 (ECF No. 135).) The Court directed defendants to supplement the administrative record to address \"the legality of USCIS waiting on MSSD/NSD determinations from DOD before naturalizing enlistees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Nio\n    </em>\n    Status Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As required by the Court, defendants periodically provide status reports on the progress of\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class members' naturalization applications. As of defendants' most recent report dated May 6, 2019, there were approximately 2,000 current and former class members, of whom more than 1,200 have naturalized and are no longer members of the class. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Updated Report, May 6, 2019 (ECF No. 247) (\"Defs.' May 6 Report\").) Of the approximately 750 remaining class members, some 160 have received a suitable MSSD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522919\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/257/#p264\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Almost all of the 550 remaining class members are still waiting for their final MSSDs. Of these, more than 500 have already received a \"non-recommend\" MSSR from DOD CAF. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522919\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/257/#p264\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Approximately 40 still have pending MSSRs, approximately half of whom were previously discharged due to an unsuitable MSSD but have now been offered reinstatement pursuant to the Oct. 26 DOD Memo. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522919\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/257/#p264\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) With few, if any, exceptions, the vast majority of these remaining class members have not gone to Basic Training and are still in \"entry level\" status while they drill with their reserve units and wait for their MSSDs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/20/19 Tr. at 109:12-16;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:10-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Administrative Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   USCIS compiled the administrative record for the July 7 Guidance in early March 2018 and included a declaration by Mr. Renaud describing the contents of the record and summarizing USCIS's reasons for the July 7 Guidance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Index of Administrative Record, Mar. 1, 2018 (ECF No. 111); 3/5/18 Renaud Decl. (USCIS AR 1-3).) The record also contains emails and extensive attachments documenting the specific cases of concern that DOD had raised to USCIS during the first half of 2017 (USCIS AR 8-209); the December 19, 2014 DOD memo reauthorizing the MAVNI program (USCIS AR 210-32); the July 3 DHS Memo (USCIS AR 7); and the July 7 Guidance (USCIS AR 4-6). The record was subsequently amended at plaintiffs' request and by order of the Court to include the Sept. 30 Memo (USCIS AR 233-41) and Mr. Renaud's declarations of July 7, 2017 and July 28, 2017, which were\n   written at the time of or shortly after the July 7 Guidance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIS AR 242-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Earlier in this litigation, the Court reviewed the June 2017 OIG classified report and other classified documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F. Supp. 3d at 64. Defendants did not submit any classified materials as part of the administrative record, for Mr. Renaud did not consult these classified documents when issuing the July 7 Guidance. Rather, the record indicates that Mr. Renaud and others at USCIS relied on what DOD told them regarding their concerns about the MAVNI population. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/5/18 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 4 (USCIS AR 2-3); July 3 DHS Memo (USCIS AR 7) (referencing \"security concerns regarding MAVNI recruits, informed by a classified DOD Inspector General report\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This litigation, as well as the\n   <em>\n    Kirwa\n   </em>\n   case, has generated an extensive record beyond the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   administrative record. As explained above, the Court has ordered ongoing reporting on the status of the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class and their class representatives. Additional declarations and other documents have been filed either at the request of the Court or by the parties to support their pleadings at various stages of the litigation. Two declarations by Ms. Miller of DOD are particularly useful in providing background information critical to understanding the programs at issue, although they are not part of the administrative record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/7/17 Miller Decl.; 7/28/17 Miller Decl.) The Court has held that these declarations may be cited in rebuttal or for necessary background information, but not as justification for the July 7 Guidance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 1, Nov. 15, 2018 (ECF No. 217).) Documents in Plaintiffs' Appendix and the DOD Administrative Record also may be cited for these limited purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Of course, the Court is not limited to the administrative record in conducting its legal analysis. While the Court must assess the rationality of USCIS's MSSD Requirement based on the administrative record, it must take into account relevant legal authority, including statutes, regulations, and agency authority such as DODIs, Army Regulations, and the USCIS Policy Manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Pleadings Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on August 13, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Aug. 13, 2018 (ECF No. 177) (\"Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOD has now completed the DOD investigatory phase for essentially all class members. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citing Arendt Decl. \u00b6 5 (ECF No. 128-2); Defs.' July 20, 2018 Status Report (ECF No. 170)).) Therefore, according to plaintiffs, although they originally attacked the entire July 7 Guidance, now any challenge to the portion regarding the DOD investigatory phase is moot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 6.) What remains of plaintiffs' claim as to the July 7\n   Guidance is their challenge to the MSSD Requirement, which the Court previously indicated could be considered as part of the second amended complaint and, if appropriate, it could be addressed separately. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 2, Apr. 12, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a host of arguments challenging the MSSD Requirement. First, they argue that it violates the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), in various ways. They argue that it is not in accordance with law because it oversteps USCIS's statutory authority to conduct examinations of applicants, improperly outsourcing to DOD the investigation and assessment of these applicants. They also argue that the MSSD Requirement is arbitrary and capricious in violation of \u00a7 706(2) because the administrative record does not support the decision to wait for DOD and the Army to make their suitability decisions about applicants, and because USCIS failed to consider important factors, such as the attendant harms that class members will suffer while awaiting the lengthy completion of the MSSD Requirement before USCIS will adjudicate a MAVNI's naturalization application. Next, plaintiffs argue that the MSSD Requirement violates the APA's publication and notice-and-comment requirements,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553. Plaintiffs also argue that the MSSD Requirement has been applied retroactively to class members whose naturalization applications should have already been progressing before July 7, 2017. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the July 7 Guidance violates the Naturalization Clause of the Constitution by effectively delegating immigration decisions to DOD and substituting DOD standards for those imposed by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants filed an opposition and cross-moved for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J. &amp; Cross Mot. for Summ. J., Nov. 30, 2018 (ECF No. 219) (\"Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot.\").) They argue that USCIS was within its power to issue the July 7 Guidance, and that the MSSD Requirement is lawful. Defendants rely on two primary rationales to justify the MSSD Requirement. First, they argue that waiting until the Army renders the MSSD allows USCIS to collect \"adverse information that\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be relevant to an applicant's eligibility for naturalization under the statutory requirements imposed by Congress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) Second, they claim that the information DOD learns during its process may implicate national-security concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs filed an opposition and reply on December 21, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n &amp; Reply.) Defendants filed a reply on February 15, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot. for Summ. J., Feb. 15, 2019 (ECF No. 237) (\"Defs.' Reply\").) A hearing was held on March 20, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/20/19 Tr.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As explained herein, the Court concludes that the MSSD Requirement is arbitrary and capricious because USCIS's explanation for it runs counter to the evidence. While defendants' stated need for more information about naturalization applicants could well justify waiting for completion of the DOD investigatory phase, that information is essentially irrelevant as long as the MSSD Requirement remains in effect. For, as is clear from the record, USCIS considers an applicant's MSSD determinative of his or her eligibility to naturalize under \u00a7 1440, and therefore, it has no need to review the information from the DOD investigatory phase. Because the Court finds that the MSSD Requirement is arbitrary and capricious, and it will vacate that portion of the July 7 Guidance, the Court need not address the many additional claims raised by plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The MSSD Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds that the July 7 Guidance explicitly incorporates by reference the Sept. 30 Memo screening requirements, including the DOD and Army adjudicatory phase that culminates in the MSSD. Although plaintiffs argue that the July 7 Guidance does not \"mention[ ]\" the MSSD as a precondition for USCIS to process a naturalization application (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n &amp; Reply at 8-9), it is clear from the July 7 Guidance that its directive to wait \"until all enhanced DoD security checks are completed\" means to wait for the final MSSD. (July 7 Guidance at 2 (USCIS AR 5).) Contrary to their present position, plaintiffs previously recognized that the July 7 Guidance explicitly incorporated the Sept. 30 Memo and its refinements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [T]he July 7 Policy itself expressly references the September 2016 DoD Memo. In fact, the Policy states that it is being enacted in order to bring USCIS policy \"in alignment with\" the September 2016 DoD Memo: \"[E]ach applicant must receive proper DoD vetting and clearance in alignment with the September 30, 2016 MAVNI extension authorization and restrictions.\" As such, it must be the case that the \"vetting and clearance\" described in the September 2016 DoD Memo is a factor relevant to the July 7 Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Pls.' Mem. of Pts. &amp; Auths. in Support of Pls.' Mot. Re. Defs.' Certified Admin. Record for the July 7 Policy at 6, Apr. 10, 2018 (ECF No. 133) (citations omitted).) In turn, the Sept. 30 Memo clearly describes both the DOD investigatory phase and the MSSD Requirement, as it imposes \"Security and Suitability Screening Requirements\" which include the DOD investigatory phase and a \"Military Suitability Determination\" by the Service based on a recommendation by DOD CAF. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 30 Memo at USCIS AR 238.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court rejects defendants' argument that the Court cannot consider the MSSD Requirement alone, but instead must \"consider the legality of the Guidance as a whole.\" (Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot. at 19 n.11.) Courts may \" 'set aside' only the\n   part of a rule found to be invalid\" because \"[i]t would ... exceed the statutory scope of review for a court to set aside an entire rule where only a part is invalid....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Catholic Soc. Serv. v.

The DOD investigatory phase and the MSSD Requirement are both contemplated by the July 7 Guidance, but they are clearly distinct phases of the process. The DOD investigatory phase involves investigation and information-gathering, while the MSSR and MSSD processes involve, to borrow defense counsel's characterization, \"synthesizing\" that information for the specific purpose of assessing military suitability. (3/20/19 Tr. at 27:12.) The reasons that may justify USCIS's waiting for the DOD investigatory phase do not necessarily support the MSSD Requirement. Waiting for the MSSD also considerably lengthens the time before USCIS can address naturalization applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, as plaintiffs argue, their original challenge to the DOD investigatory phase is now moot, given that \"the vast majority of class members\" have completed the DOD investigatory phase. (Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot. at 19 n.11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 2 n.3.) The Court will therefore review the reasonableness of the MSSD Requirement alone and treat the challenge to the DOD investigatory phase as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Position Regarding the July 7 Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants argue that the purpose of the MSSD Requirement is to help USCIS gather relevant information from DOD about applicants-to \"wait until [DOD's process is] over.... What USCIS knows is that the process generates information. And it is information that could [ ] potentially be useful.\" (3/20/19 Tr. at 30:24-31:8.) They assert that the MSSD Requirement ensures that USCIS \"may review any information that may have emerged throughout the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   DoD process.\" (Defs.' Reply at 9.) According to defendants, waiting for this information helps USCIS meet its statutory obligation to \"ensur[e] that these applicants possess the requisite good moral character and attachment to the Constitution necessary to naturalize.\" (Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot. at 35 (citing USCIS AR 2-7).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants insist that USCIS needs this information even if an applicant receives an unsuitable MSSD and will therefore be deemed ineligible by virtue of the characterization of his or her discharge. They deny that \"USCIS mechanically treats adverse MSSDs based on 'unmitigable derogatory information' as an automatic disqualifier without analyzing the underlying information itself.\" (Defs.' Reply at 13 n.11.) According to defendants, \"USCIS did not issue the July 7 Guidance for the purpose of learning how MAVNI recruits who are separated would be discharged,\" so \"[t]he import of an 'uncharacterized' discharge is not at issue in this case.\" (Defs.' Reply at 14.) But, as explained\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , their position is at odds with the administrative record, the statutory and regulatory framework, and the statements of representatives of USCIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Army's Position Regarding Uncharacterized Discharge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Central to the question before the Court is an understanding of the concept of uncharacterized discharge and its importance to MAVNI enlistment in the Army and to MAVNIs' naturalization applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Essentially, all\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class members who have not yet received a final MSSD are drilling in DTP awaiting shipment to Basic Training. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/20/19 Tr. at 38:15-18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Army Regulations, the Army categorizes these soldiers as \"entry level\" because they are reservists who have not yet attended Basic Training. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Army Reg. 135-178 Glossary \u00a7 II (defining \"[e]ntry level status\").) By default, any entry-level discharge of a MAVNI reservist is labeled as \"uncharacterized.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-11(a).) Defendants view an entry-level, uncharacterized discharge as a neutral classification, neither honorable nor dishonorable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6/20/18 Tr. at 41:9-16 (ECF No. 161).) For most administrative purposes, DOD treats an uncharacterized discharge as honorable or general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DODI 1332.14,\n   <em>\n    Enlisted Administrative Separations\n   </em>\n   , Encl. 4, \u00a7 3c(1)(c) (Pls.' Appx. 60) (\"[For] administrative matters ... that require a characterization as honorable or general, an entry-level separation will be treated as the required characterization.\"). Those with an uncharacterized discharge also are not necessarily barred from receiving certain veterans' benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203.12\">\n    38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(1) (eligibility for pension and other benefits is barred by a dishonorable discharge, but entry-level uncharacterized separations \"shall be considered under conditions other than dishonorable\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As soon as a soldier's MSSD is issued, if the soldier is found unsuitable for service for any reason, he or she is discharged promptly, and the discharge will be \"uncharacterized\" by virtue of the soldier's entry-level status. For instance, the Sept. 30 Memo indicates that discharge should be initiated immediately after an individual receives an unsuitable MSSD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 30 Memo at USCIS AR 241;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oct. 26 DOD Memo at 2 (providing that when a DTP soldier is to be separated on the basis of \"an unfavorable MSSD or NSD, the Army Reserve Command \"will initiate administrative separation proceedings\"); Defs.' Status Report, Feb. 8, 2019 (ECF No. 234) (indicating that, of the 24 class members who had been discharged due to an unsuitable MSSD, 22 were effectively discharged within a month or less of the MSSD date).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    4. USCIS's Position Regarding Uncharacterized Discharge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Regardless of whether a soldier has received an N-426 certification of honorable service from the Army, USCIS's interpretation of \u00a7 1440 is that a MAVNI who is no longer serving is only eligible to naturalize if the Army discharged him or her under honorable or general under honorable conditions. According to USCIS, \"an uncharacterized discharge ... [is] not honorable and it's not general under honorable. And the way USCIS views 1440 is that you have to fall into one of those first two categories.\" (3/20/19 Tr. at 13:7-12.) Defendants explained the same interpretation to the Court shortly after the issuance of the July 7 Guidance: \"An uncharacterized discharge ... means that the individual would no longer be eligible to become a naturalized citizen under the MAVNI program.\"\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F. Supp. 3d at 54 (citing 8/23/17 Tr. at 24-25). Indeed, as USCIS counsel explained at the Court's March 20, 2019 hearing, this interpretation has been in the USCIS Policy Manual since at least 2008. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/20/19 Tr. at 13:25-15:2.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   12 USCIS Policy Manual, pt. I, ch. 3, \u00a7 B (\"Both 'Honorable' and 'General-Under Honorable Conditions'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   discharge types qualify as honorable service for immigration purposes. Other discharge types, such as 'Other Than Honorable,' do not qualify as honorable service.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants nonetheless acknowledge that there are significant differences between the standards for USCIS naturalization adjudications and the DOD/Army standards for military suitability. For example, defendants acknowledge that \"some factors considered at the [DOD] CAF may be less relevant in the naturalization context (e.g., financial considerations).\" (Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot. at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 11-13 \u00b6\u00b6 7-14.) The 13 Adjudicative Guidelines, on which the DOD and Army suitability decisions are based, require consideration of behavior that could make an individual vulnerable to coercion in the context of handling classified information-for example, two of the 13 Adjudicative Guidelines are \"Use of Information Technology Systems\" and \"Financial Considerations\"-but may be less relevant to a USCIS assessment of the individual's moral character. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adjudicative Guidelines at 1-3 (Pls.' Appx. 95-97).) Moreover, in rendering an assessment under the Adjudicative Guidelines, any doubts \"will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Pls.' Appx. 96).) By contrast, in assessing good moral character USCIS has discretion to evaluate the applicant's character in the context of \"the standards of the average citizen in the community of residence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20316.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   DOD also recognizes these distinctions. As Ms. Miller, Director of DOD's Accession Policy Directorate, explained in another MAVNI case, these different standards would be expected to result in at least some individuals being found \"unsuitable\" for service, but still eligible to naturalize under the USCIS requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   When we screen someone for the purpose of suitability and security, we're screening at a fairly high threshold. So an individual who may have a known or unknown relative that works for a foreign defense department or foreign intelligence agency, the individual themselves may have no malicious intent towards the United States or to the government; but we cannot mitigate the fact that they have a direct relative working for a foreign intelligence agency. So, therefore, the individual may not be suitable to hold a national security position [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to serve as a soldier].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   But ultimately that may not mean that the individual is not suitable to ultimately become a United States citizen. And we have tried very hard to make that distinguishing factor with our colleagues at Department of Homeland Security and USCIS. So they may not be able to serve [or continue serving] in the military, but that may not bear on [USCIS's] final determination as to whether that individual should be naturalized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   (Trial Testimony of Stephanie Miller at 152-53, Nov. 28, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    Tiwari v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   , No. C17-00242-TSZ (W.D. Wash.)), Ex. 8 to Pls.' Notice, Mar. 24, 2019 (ECF No. 244-8).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In practice, however, USCIS is making no such independent assessment, because it treats an unsuitable MSSD as determinative for purposes of naturalization. The Sept. 30 Memo mandates that any MAVNI who does not yet have a final MSSD from DOD cannot ship to Basic Training and therefore must remain in DTP and thus in an entry-level status. Any of these MAVNIs whose MSSD is unsuitable will be discharged promptly, and that discharge will be uncharacterized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Army Reg. 135-178 \u00a7 2-11(a). USCIS will consider him or her automatically ineligible to naturalize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There is no need to proceed with the application, and no need to review the underlying information from the DOD investigatory phase. Meanwhile, any class member found suitable will proceed to the naturalization process without USCIS considering the results of the DOD investigatory phase, because USCIS does not review the underlying information of those found suitable for service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Cross Mot. at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants note that the MSSD Requirement allows USCIS to \"avoid[ ] having to deploy its resources to review DoD background check information ... where the MSSD is favorable. Rather, it can reserve its resources for the fewer cases in which the MSSD is\n   <em>\n    unfavorable\n   </em>\n   ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, this contention is belied by the fact that the information is of no consequence because USCIS deems any applicant with an uncharacterized discharge to be ineligible for naturalization under \u00a7 1440. According to defendants, if MAVNIs receive from the Army \"honorable discharges or general discharges then they will be eligible for naturalization. If they get uncharacterized discharges, the government thinks they won't.... The government thinks that an uncharacterized discharge would not be sufficient to naturalize under 1440.\" (Tr. of Motions Hearing at 38:1-25, Oct. 3, 2018 (ECF No. 197) (\"10/3/18 Tr.\").)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio PI Op.\n   </em>\n   , 270 F.

Defendants also admit that USCIS \"need[s] to find out how [MAVNIs have] been discharged\" because an applicant's uncharacterized discharge \"trigger[s]\" the statutory honorable-service requirement. (3/20/19 Tr. at 50:3-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The July 7 Guidance cites as justifications the fact that DOD's background checks can reveal information relevant to good moral character, attachment to the Constitution, and national security. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 7 Guidance at 1-2 (USCIS AR 4-5).) These justifications may well support USCIS waiting until the end of the DOD investigatory phase, when any such information would be discovered. They do not, however, justify the MSSD Requirement. We know, for instance, that USCIS understood the benefits of knowing an applicant's MSSD and resulting discharge characterization. In a sworn declaration the same day as the July 7 Guidance, its author highlighted the fact that a naturalization applicant would be \"ineligible for naturalization\" under \u00a7 1440 if he or she received a \"discharge from the Armed Forces under other than honorable conditions.\" (7/7/17 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 18 (USCIS AR 248).) The usefulness of this information is also acknowledged by defendants in their pleadings, where they recognize that waiting for the MSSD is \"reasonable because an applicant who receives an unfavorable MSSD is subject to discharge, and characterization of discharge has a clear bearing on naturalization eligibility under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\" (Defs.' Reply at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As noted, the DOD investigatory phase may generate information relevant to good\n   moral character, attachment to the Constitution, and national security. And, as defendants point out, the administrative record contains references to MAVNIs about whom the DOD investigatory phase revealed \"derogatory information that USCIS would have considered\" had the MAVNIs not already been naturalized. (3/5/18 Renaud Decl. \u00b6 3 (USCIS AR 2).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, any such information would be revealed during the DOD investigatory phase. The MSSD Requirement results in USCIS receiving no new derogatory information, and thus defendants' need for information bears no \"rational connection\" to the MSSD Requirement.\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2125\">\n    136 S.

Indeed, the only relevant information revealed to USCIS is, in the case of an unsuitable MSSD, that the applicant will inevitably and imminently receive an uncharacterized discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Waiting for the MSSD does not ensure that USCIS receives relevant information; it obviates USCIS's need for that information. An unfavorable MSSD is determinative: because it results in an uncharacterized discharge, USCIS will reject the application as automatically ineligible. This has been USCIS's practice since at least 2008, when the USCIS Policy Manual was adopted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/20/19 Tr. at 14:22-23.) In a representative case from 2010, a federal court in Indiana reviewed USCIS's denial of a naturalization application under \u00a7 1440 because the MAVNI's entry-level discharge was uncharacterized.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oyebade v.

The\n   <em>\n    Oyebade\n   </em>\n   court noted that the applicant's uncharacterized discharge denoted a wholly \"neutral\" classification and the USCIS denial was based on the agency's long-standing interpretation of that neutrality as insufficient to satisfy the honorable-service requirement under \u00a7 1440.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202927207\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This approach continues to be followed today.

In effect, DOD's and the Army's decisions as to whether a class member is suitable for service operate as a proxy for USCIS. Given this reality, defendants' argument that an applicant's uncharacterized discharge is irrelevant to this case rings hollow. Defendants' justifications for the MSSD Requirement are also belied by the fact that USCIS learns no new information about naturalization applicants except the resulting MSSD and, if it is unsuitable, that the applicant will receive an uncharacterized discharge. The Court therefore finds that the MSSD Requirement is arbitrary and capricious in violation of \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that the entire July 7 Guidance must be invalidated.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 15 n.13.) The APA provides that an agency action that is arbitrary and capricious shall be \"set aside.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Generally, when a court finds that a challenged action is arbitrary and capricious, the remedy is vacatur. It is true that in certain circumstances courts have discretion to remand to the agency for reconsideration or further explanation.

The DOD investigatory phase is complete for members of the class, so USCIS can proceed to process their naturalization applications. And if the MSSD Requirement remains in effect class members certainly will suffer harm, since their applications may not be evaluated by USCIS based on the standards that govern naturalization, as opposed to suitability for military service. The Court will therefore vacate the MSSD Requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment will be granted in part and defendants' cross-motion will be denied.
