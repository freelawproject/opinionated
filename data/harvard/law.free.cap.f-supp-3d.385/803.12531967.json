INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case is before me on a motion (Doc. No. 216) for summary judgment on plaintiffs' individual claims filed by defendant CRST Expedited, Inc. (CRST). Plaintiffs have filed a response (Doc. No. 239) and CRST has filed a reply (Doc. No. 246). I find that oral argument is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 30, 2017, I entered an order certifying a hostile work environment class and a retaliation class in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 85. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4)(A), I also certified the following issues with respect to each class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4)(a) :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   a. As to the Hostile Work Environment Class, whether CRST has any of the following policies, patterns or practices that create or contribute to a hostile work environment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) failing to find their complaints were corroborated without an eyewitness or admission,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) failing to discipline drivers after complaints were corroborated and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) failure to discipline [driver managers] for failing to promptly respond to sexual harassment complaints and\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   b. As to the Retaliation Class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) Whether CRST has a policy, pattern or practice of retaliating against women complaining of sexual harassment by requiring them to exit the truck except when they are a lead driver or owner-operator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. I noted that pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(C), the order could be altered or amended before final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CRST subsequently moved for summary judgment on the retaliation claim and decertification of the hostile work environment class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 171, 172. I granted both motions on January 15, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 204. I denied plaintiffs' motion\n   to amend the decertification order; motion to stay, or alternatively amend, the trial scheduling order; and motion to certify final judgment upon the class retaliation claims for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 233. As such, only plaintiffs' individual claims of hostile work environment, retaliation and constructive discharge under Title VII remain. Those claims are now the subject of CRST's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. CRST's Business Model\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CRST is a leading long-haul freight transportation company with more than 3,000 drivers at any one time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 239-1 at 1. It operates by teaming two drivers per truck so that one driver may rest while the other is driving, thus allowing the truck to continue moving without violating Department of Transportation daily limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Each truck contains a small sleeper berth area behind the front seats containing bunk beds. Doc. No. 247-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   CRST has four terminals, which are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Riverside, California; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drivers are subject to the same policies whether on the road or at the terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When drivers join CRST, they are trained by \"lead drivers,\" or \"leads,\" for a designated period of time. Doc. No. 239-1 at 2. Lead drivers are nominated by operations personnel and reviewed by the safety department for placement into a certification class. Doc. No. 247-1 at 11. Lead drivers must pass a lead driver training class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs note there are approximately 25 female lead drivers out of over 500 leads at any given time, but CRST denies this based on lack of factual support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Student drivers are not permitted to operate a truck alone without completing over-the-road training with a lead driver. Doc. No. 239-1 at 2. Leads and students are paired up by a student coordinator and a lead driver can request to work with a particular student. Doc. No. 247-1 at 13. The lead driver recommends to the driver manager whether the student should be upgraded to co-driver status. Lead drivers generally work with the same driver manager throughout the lead's training of successive students and no one other than the lead's driver manager is responsible for checking in with students during their over-the-road training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Student drivers are road tested and separately evaluated by a safety department trainer before being upgraded to a co-driver. Doc. No. 239-1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Once designated as a co-driver, the driver may team up with another driver of his or her choosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs note that this choice is limited to a list of currently available drivers. Thus, for example, if a female driver wishes to pair up with another female driver and one is not currently available, she will be unpaid during the time that she waits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To find a co-driver, CRST may provide a list of potential co-drivers, whom the individual may call to see if the driver is available. Doc. No. 247-1 at 16. Available co-drivers are also posted on bulletin boards at CRST terminals and on CRST's Facebook page.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CRST also hosts \"meet and greet\" sessions at its terminals to encourage drivers to interact\n   and find compatible co-drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drivers will often meet in person before deciding to drive together. Once the driver finds a co-driver, he or she informs her driver manager of the proposed pairing and, if there are no restrictions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the pair can begin driving and earning pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   All driving teams are supervised by a driver manager located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Each driver manager has a fleet of trucks for which he or she is responsible at any given time. Doc. No. 247-1 at 6. Driver managers work on multiple shifts covering the 24-hour day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The after-hours team size varies depending on the day of the week, load volume and other variables.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drivers and driver managers communicate via phone, email, and CRST's messaging system known as \"Qualcomm.\" Doc. No. 239-1 at 4. Driver managers are responsible for ensuring that loads are delivered on time. They are evaluated on metrics such as time percentage, overall mileage truck utilization, expenses (cents per mile) and the number of trucks in service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs point out that if CRST buys a bus ticket for a driver who gets off a truck due to a sexual harassment complaint, that expense will be counted against the driver manager's metric.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Driver managers are also responsible for driver retention and addressing conflicts amongst team drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs add that Human Resources (HR) also plays a role in these tasks as it is responsible for investigating harassment and discrimination complaints by drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. CRST admits that if a driver manager fails to meet metrics, it could jeopardize his or her continued employment, adding that it uses a progressive disciplinary system relating to driver manager performance results. Doc. No. 247-1 at 8-9. Driver managers are evaluated on their metrics during their annual performance review. The outcome of this evaluation determines whether they are eligible for a salary increase or bonus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. CRST denies that a driver manager would ever be penalized for stopping a truck due to a Title VII issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Driver Pay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Drivers are paid on a per-mile basis using a \"split mileage system.\" This means that each driver is paid at his or her personal rate for half of the total miles driven by the truck (regardless of how many miles that driver actually drives). Doc. No. 239-1 at 5. Personal rates vary with the driver's length of experience.

CRST's Policies Regarding Sexual Harassment and Retaliation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CRST has a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment and retaliation in the workplace. Doc. No. 239-1 at 7. Plaintiffs deny that this policy is enforced. The policy is contained in the Handbook and Statement of Policy that is distributed to drivers and home office employees, including driver managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The policy is also covered in a dedicated session at driver orientation when each driver is provided a stand-alone copy of the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy states that CRST \"prohibits sexual harassment\" and states that those who report it \"will NOT be subject to ANY form of retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy also sets forth the complaint procedure and reporting responsibilities. CRST's Code of Business Ethics also addresses sexual harassment by requiring immediate reporting \"to the appropriate Supervisor or [HR].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Handbook provides that \"[i]f any employee believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical harassment, the employee should immediately contact his or her Driver Manager or [HR] to inform them of the situation and to request a new lead driver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. It further provides that \"[a]n employee has the right to request a new driver without fear of retaliation. Any employee who reports any act of harassment and/or discrimination will NOT be subject to ANY form of retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. All drivers sign an acknowledgement that they have received and reviewed the CRST Driver's Handbook and Statement of Policy, including the policies against sexual harassment and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Drivers must also certify their understanding that employees who complain about harassment will be removed from the harassing situation. The acknowledgment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   I also understand and agree that if I believe I am being subjected to harassment or discrimination, no matter how severe or pervasive, I will immediately report it to my fleet manager or to the Human Resources Department directly so that I may be removed from the harassing situation and so CRST may conduct a prompt investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With regard to reporting harassment, plaintiffs note that if it occurs during business hours a driver can call HR with her complaint, but this line is not staffed 24 hours per day and she will be directed to voicemail if she calls during off hours. Doc. No. 247-1 at 40. CRST notes that there are other means for a driver to report harassment, such as contacting her driver manager by Qualcomm or telephone, the report hotline and after-hours driver managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41. With regard to the hotline, a staff member will take notes regarding a victim's complaint, which will be sent electronically to Karen Carlson, Manager of Employee Relations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.

Plaintiffs deny this and cite affidavits from plaintiffs in which they describe specific instances of harassment and CRST's responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 239-1at 9-10. CRST's policy provides that when a dispatcher receives a communication from a driver alleging sexual harassment, it must take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the complainant and advance the investigation into the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Plaintiffs admit that CRST's written policy provides for this, but denies that it aligns with CRST's pattern or practice and cites documents in which dispatchers failed to immediately separate drivers or escalate the complaint to HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The same goes for the dispatchers' authority to separate employees, arrange necessary accommodations and pay or reimburse for accommodations. While plaintiffs admit that dispatchers have this authority, they deny that dispatchers consistently arrange accommodations and pay or reimburse for these accommodations, alleging that employees many times have to bear these costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Plaintiffs also deny that CRST takes steps to separate the drivers quickly and safely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (citing declarations from Fortune and others describing situations in which driver managers asked complainants to stay on the truck after they reported harassment).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc.

This is CRST's policy regardless of whether the woman complaining of harassment was using the truck before the allegedly harassing co-driver joined her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83. The alleged harasser may continue driving depending on the situation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   When one driver makes a complaint about another driver, CRST instructs its driver managers to remove the complainant from the situation unless the complainant is the lead driver or the owner-operator. Doc. No. 239-1 at 12. Plaintiffs deny that this policy applies regardless of the nature of the complaint, noting that all evidence cited by CRST in support involves complaints of sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs admit that all employees receive notice of CRST's policy of removing the complaining party with regard to harassment or discrimination complaints only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   CRST has disciplined some driver managers for failing to immediately involve HR upon receiving a complaint of sexual harassment. Plaintiffs note that CRST does not have a practice or policy in place to evaluate how driver managers respond to sexual harassment complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. They also contend that CRST produced only three forms demonstrating disciplinary action for a driver manager's failure to\n   timely or properly respond to a complaint of sex discrimination or sexual harassment since October 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Plaintiffs deny this, stating it is a legal argument rather than a statement of fact and that their position is that CRST's primary reason for removing complainants is retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. CRST contends there are numerous reasons for removing the complainant from the truck, such as allowing her to seek any necessary resources, including law enforcement, medical attention and mental health care and to remove her from the inherently dangerous and stressful aspects of truck driving during a time when she may be experiencing distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 -15. It also contends that it gives the complainant the opportunity and resources to gather and transmit any necessary information to HR as part of the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Plaintiffs deny each of these statements as either argumentative or unsupported by the evidence cited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17. They admit that when the complainant is a student or a driver who has been harassed by an owner-operator, removing the complainant complies with licensing and truck ownership rules. However, they deny that differences in pay between the complainant who has to get off the truck with no pay and the lead driver or owner-operator who gets to continue driving and earning money complies with any licensing or truck ownership rules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Plaintiffs acknowledge that in some, but not all, instances CRST takes steps to pair the complainant with a new co-driver at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On July 1, 2015, CRST promulgated a new Layover Pay Policy specific to individuals who complain of harassment or discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. CRST denies that this policy was related in any way to plaintiffs' lawsuit. Doc. No. 247-1 at 82. Plaintiffs deny that this policy was actually implemented on that date. Doc. No. 239-1 at 19-20. They state that as of July 2016, the policy was still not included in the Handbook, was still in \"draft[ ] form\" and has not been produced in any format in this case. Doc. No. 247-1 at 82-83. CRST states that it is an HR practice that is not intended for inclusion in the Handbook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In any event, the policy provides that when a complaint of harassment or discrimination is made, the complainant will be removed from the truck unless such removal would leave the truck without a qualified driver. Doc. No. 239-1 at 20. Plaintiffs deny that the complainant is provided with sufficient funds for lodging and transportation, which she does not have to pay back, stating that drivers have had to bear their own lodging and transportation costs at times, especially before July 2015 when CRST did not cover any lodging or transportation costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. CRST will then pay HR layover pay starting on the\n   date that the employee is removed from the truck and ending on the date the employee is paired with a new co-driver. Plaintiffs deny this, noting that prior to July 1, 2015, there was no layover pay and that even after July 1, 2015, the layover pay ended on the date the employee was offered a re-pairing, not the date that the employee actually paired up with a new co-driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   CRST calculates its HR layover pay based on the highest minimum wage in the country, which it then multiplies by 10 hours per day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. It initially paid $100 per day and now pays $110 per day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to July 2015, CRST states that a complainant would have been eligible to receive the standard layover pay of $40 per day if the delay between re-pairing lasted over 48 hours. Plaintiffs deny this stating that the written policy for the standard layover pay (\"[t]he truck must be available from empty time to dispatched pickup time no less than 48 hours to qualify for 1 layover\") excludes the situation in which a driver is removed from the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When HR receives a complaint of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, it enters it into its \"Positive Work Environment Employee Relations\" spreadsheet and commences an investigation. Plaintiffs dispute that CRST immediately commences an investigation for lack of support. The HR investigator will examine whether there are any prior complaints against the accused driver,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   consider any relevant documents or communications, interview any available witnesses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   interview the individual accused of harassment and take into account any admissions by the accused driver. The investigator\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   will eventually determine whether the complaint can be corroborated. The parties disagree on what is necessary for CRST to find that a complaint is corroborated. CRST maintains that corroboration can be from a variety of resources and the test is whether HR is \"able to identify that the action was confirmed and that it took place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Plaintiffs cite Carlson's testimony, in which she stated that a complaint could not be corroborated without eyewitness testimony or an admission from the accused harasser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   CRST denies that this is its policy or that it has ever had such a policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. CRST states that it may find corroboration based on statements from the accused and accuser, witnesses, pictures or messages.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 247-1 at 33-34. Plaintiffs cite evidence in which an accused driver admitted to touching Lopez and making an inappropriate comment, stating that it was\n   a \"joke,\" and Carlson conceded his conduct would be a violation of the sexual harassment policy. The investigation form for that incident does not reflect a finding of corroboration or that the accused driver was disciplined. Doc. No. 239-1 at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   CRST states that even when a complaint is not deemed corroborated, it nonetheless takes remedial measures by changing the accused male driver's status to \"male only\" and is never reassigned to drive with the accuser. Plaintiffs disagree this is a remedial measure, stating that it is not disciplinary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not reduce the driver's pay and is not considered a disciplinary warning. Plaintiffs also cite evidence in which Carlson admitted that she changed an alleged harasser's status to \"male only\" to provide him \"a measure of protection from a similar claim arising in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. The \"male only\" designation lasts indefinitely, can be removed only by HR and produces an error message in the driver database if anyone attempts an impermissible pairing. The accused driver will also receive a copy of CRST's policy prohibiting harassment via certified mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. This action is not disciplinary in any way and the policy is also sent to the accuser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs state that it is CRST's \"standard response\" to complaints of sexual harassment to designate the accused driver to \"male only.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. CRST disagrees that the cited material refers to CRST's \"standard response,\" but affirmatively states that if there is a complaint of sexual harassment of discriminatory behavior by a female against a male, the accused male driver will be changed to a \"male only\" team preference and never reassigned to drive with the accuser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CRST states that if a complaint is corroborated, the accused driver will face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Doc. No. 239-1 at 31. Plaintiffs dispute this stating that even if this is CRST's written policy, it is not enforced.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 247-1 at 38. They cite six examples of complaints from female drivers (none plaintiffs) that were corroborated but discipline was not imposed on the accused driver. Doc. No. 239-1 at 32-33. HR does not impose the discipline but recommends a course of action to the respective driver manager. Doc. No. 239-1. at 33. Plaintiffs deny that it is a \"recommendation\" from HR, citing deposition testimony from driver managers in which they indicate they do what HR instructs them to do and have no input of their own. However, plaintiffs state in their own statement of facts that the driver manager has authority to decide what discipline should be imposed, subject to being overruled by their supervising operations manager. Doc. No. 247-1 at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   CRST states that discipline may involve verbal warnings, written warnings, counseling sessions with HR or other departments, removal of lead driver certification or termination. Doc. No. 239-1 at 34. Plaintiffs note there is not factual support that counseling sessions have ever taken place outside of Positive Work Environment training, which takes one to three hours and has no actual disciplinary impact (as it does not impact a driver's pay, is not a suspension or a written warning).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carlson testified that \"any corroborated harassment ... of a Title VII nature\" will result in termination. Doc. No. 247-1 at 36. However, she noted that some circumstances may not amount to true sexual harassment or discrimination under Title VII guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs bring up instances in which HR found the complaint\n   was corroborated, but the driver was not terminated or his lead certification revoked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-39. CRST objects to this evidence as containing inadmissible hearsay (in the form of complaints by drivers recorded by HR investigators) and immaterial to the issues as they do not involve complaints by plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs state that CRST has been aware of allegations of sexual harassment from its female drivers for years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. They cite lawsuits filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against CRST, including one in which 270 women were identified as having been sexually harassed while working at CRST.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. CRST denies that any of these prior lawsuits are material to the issues in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also state that beginning in December 2013, CRST had logged over 60 complaints of sexual harassment in the preceding 14-month period, beginning in October 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs state that in late 2013 or early 2014, Carlson suggested installing cameras on CRST trucks during a meeting with CRST's President and its Director of HR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.

Carlson again suggested installing cameras on team trucks. She stated, \"So many of my investigations including those such as physical altercations, inappropriate verbal comments, throwing the Qualcomm, sexual misconduct, etc. are hearsay and there are no witnesses. I feel that a camera on each truck would mitigate the possibility of misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She received no substantive response to this suggestion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also suggested mandatory time on the truck for each driver manager to \"see what life on a truck is like,\" noting that drivers would routinely say that driver managers had no idea what it was like on the road and she agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carlson also recommended an \"undercover boss\" program to monitor the performance of lead drivers because she received the most complaints about them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.

He commented to the female student that Lopez's shirt was \"too long,\" implying that he could not see her buttocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, J.M. approached Lopez and began touching her back, scratching it numerous times over her objections while she was on the phone with her mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eventually, Lopez was able to get out of her chair and exit into an elevator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M. continued to accost Lopez, making her nervous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. He would tell her she was \"very pretty\" and, while laughing, asked if she had spoken to her mother again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M. told Lopez's friend, in front of Lopez, that after his road training, he was \"coming back for [Lopez] to rape [her] and marry [her] and take [her] with him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M. also tried to force Lopez to hug him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Lopez told HR that she had been in contact with J.M. for about a week and a half and made the complaint against him on the fourth day. Doc. No. 239-1 at 64. CRST states that Stoll contacted Lopez on April 17, 2014, and conducted an interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. Lopez denies ever speaking to Stoll. CRST states that Stoll also interviewed J.M. and told him to have no further contact with Lopez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lopez denies this based on lack of factual support. J.M. admitted to HR that he scratched Lopez's back, that she broke down crying in front of him and that he told her that she was \"very pretty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. No. 247-1 at 63. HR never interviewed the witnesses that Lopez identified during the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   J.M.'s team preference was changed to male only. Doc. No. 239-1 at 64. Lopez has not spoken with nor seen\n   J.M. since he left training and since she spoke to HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     12.

No. 247-1 at 64. Lopez began driving with Smith around July 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She alleges that Smith made sexual advances towards her, would purchase things for her, tell her \"I like big women\" and would attempt to kiss her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lopez alleges that Smith commented on her physical appearance, woke her for a driving shift change by touching her hair, asked her to shower with him and told her that she should appreciate him. Doc. No. 239-1 at 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Lopez adds that Smith touched her back and hair on more than one occasion even after she previously told him not to touch her when waking her up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Smith also laid in bed with her against her will and repeatedly attempted to pressure her into reciprocating his advances, including attempts to kiss her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would become angry with her and subject her to verbal abuse when she did not reciprocate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This conduct took place during a trip from Riverside to Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After getting off the truck at some point to get directions, Lopez saw Smith drive away with the truck, whereupon a driver manager contacted Lopez and Lopez complained about Smith's conduct and harassment. Doc. No. 247-1 at 66. The driver manager directed the truck back to Lopez so that she could gather her belongings, but insisted that Lopez exit and leave the truck to Smith, despite her pleas to make Smith exit given that she had procured the truck herself at the prior terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Her driver manager arranged a hotel room for her that evening. Doc. No. 239-1 at 67. She was reimbursed for the hotel and the dispatcher offered to buy a bus ticket to meet the next truck, but Lopez declined and opted to rent a car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Lopez was not paid for the time she was off the truck, which lasted several days. Doc. No. 247-1 at 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Around July 7, 2014, Lopez complained to Carlson about Smith's conduct and identified a truck stop cashier as a witness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Lopez declined to provide a written statement after being interviewed by Carlson. Doc. No. 239-1 at 67. Carlson made one attempt to reach the witness identified by Lopez, but did not reach him or her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carlson also interviewed Smith who denied any wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She concluded the complaint could not be corroborated. Doc. No. 247-1 at 67. Lopez has not spoken with Smith since they drove together and Smith's driver preference was changed to male only. Doc.

No. 247-1 at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Lopez contacted a shuttle driver about her allegations and when she hung up a different person from CRST contacted her. Doc. No. 239-1 at 68. Lopez spoke to a driver manager. Lopez asked the driver\n   manager to let them continue to Oklahoma City so Lopez could pick up a different truck there. She did not address the harassment from Jones until after she requested they continue to Oklahoma City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, she spoke with driver manager Teresa Strong, who routed Lopez to Oklahoma City only after Lopez and Jones relayed the load in West Memphis, Arkansas. Strong had Lopez get off the truck in West Memphis, stay in a motel and take a rental car to Oklahoma City to pick up a truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69. Lopez received layover pay for the time she was unable to drive due to being removed from the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   HR attempted to reach Lopez by phone on October 24, 2014, and left a voicemail, which was the day after Lopez's October 23, 2014, complaint to Strong. While finishing the trip with Jones, Lopez had recorded Jones admitting that he had touched her inappropriately and she sent the recording to HR. Doc. No. 247-1 at 69. Lopez alleges that after the one voicemail, HR did not attempt to reach her again and did not complete an investigation into her complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones' team preference was changed to male only according to CRST, but Lopez denies this based on lack of factual support.

Lopez and M.B.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Lopez alleges she and M.B. had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Well, I was grinding the gears a lot, and he had a situation with that, and he would say that I was grinding the gears a lot. I called it in and the problem was the truck. It had to have the clutch fixed. That's why the gears were grinding so much. He made a comment one day when we were going through mountains, and he tells me, oh, Claudia, one of these days I could just do anything to you, kill you, throw you through the mountains there and no one - nobody ever going to find you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. Lopez did not make any complaints to CRST regarding M.B. while on the truck with him. Lopez states she quit working at CRST after driving with M.B. because she was \"nervous\" as a result of her experiences on the road with various harassers. Doc. No. 247-1 at 70. CRST denies that this is supported by the cited material and admits that while Lopez testified she stopped driving with M.B. because she was \"nervous\" she also testified she quit CRST because her doctor told her she needed an operation for her bladder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     F.

She adds that this was from an injury during a sexual assault by Monroe and that the injury and hospital treatment effectively stopped her driving with CRST. Doc. No. 239-1 at 70. She denies that she voluntarily stopped driving for CRST. CRST states Sellars' workers' compensation claim was closed on November 23, 2015, due to Sellars abandoning treatment. Sellars states that CRST sent her a notice in January 2015 that it would stop her payments, falsely claiming that she did not provide certain medical forms, which were to have been provided to CRST directly from the treating providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Fortune left CRST to take care of her mother, who was very ill, and because she could not bear to undergo any more of the experiences she had complained about.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. She bought a bus ticket and went home and after failing to report to work, CRST entered her termination on February 27, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Lopez felt \"nervous\" after leaving M.B.'s truck. This, along with medical issues she experienced, caused her to leave CRST.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72. During Lopez's \"home time,\" she was told she would need an operation. She contends her decision not to go back was related to feeling nervous after leaving M.B.'s truck and she denies that she voluntarily separated from CRST.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lopez last worked on December 21, 2014, and CRST terminated her employment on February 20, 2015.

Under the fifth element, I must consider whether the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective remedial action. The fourth element focuses on the perspective of the reasonable person and the plaintiff herself while the fifth element focuses on the perspective of the employer.

No. 239-1 at 34-37. Because it is undisputed that CRST had a reporting procedure in place and that plaintiffs used it to report harassment, CRST had actual notice of the harassment at issue when it was reported. Plaintiffs attempt to show that CRST had constructive knowledge of the harassment much earlier based on past sexual harassment lawsuits against CRST and Carlson's testimony regarding the need for a different approach (such as installing cameras on trucks) to prevent sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

I agree with CRST that plaintiffs' attempt to show constructive notice through general evidence regarding previous complaints in separate lawsuits goes beyond the applicable standard.

Such evidence provides no indication that a particular individual poses a threat to other employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CRST Van Expedited, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732178,3877333\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/657/\">\n    679 F.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that constructive notice is established \"where an employee provides management level personnel with enough information to raise a probability of sexual harassment in the mind of a reasonable employer\" or \"where the harassment is so pervasive and open that a reasonable employer would have had to be aware of it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   I agree with CRST that because it had a reporting procedure in place and plaintiffs undisputedly acknowledged and used the procedure, CRST's remedial efforts must be measured based on its actual notice of allegations.

Doc. No. 219 at 22. CRST breaks down each of plaintiff's complaints with respect to each driver, including plaintiff's allegations, the employment conditions (whether the alleged misconduct was severe and pervasive enough to affect a term, condition or privilege of employment), CRST's response time, plaintiff's statement and interview (the investigation) and what measures were taken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-40.

The Fourth Circuit has also discussed the need to prevent future harassment but, like other circuits, this duty appears to be limited to harassment from a known harasser.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Even if the case law could be read that broadly, it requires only a response that is \"reasonably calculated\" to end the harassment. While plaintiffs contend that CRST's response of designating drivers accused of harassment as \"male only\" is not sufficiently disciplinary, this action assures that individuals accused of harassment are not paired with another female driver. Plaintiffs argue CRST is required to do more and intends to demonstrate CRST's response is insufficient by citing recurring harassment that takes place, along with evidence that Carlson believed more could be done to stop harassment (such as installing cameras in all trucks). The Tenth\n   Circuit has explained why this position is problematic:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   For the dissent, the mere occurrence of the future harassment is enough circumstantial evidence to draw an inference of the inadequacy of prior employer responses. Whether even the immediate firing of each harasser would have actually deterred future wrongdoers is purely speculative, and factually impossible if the future harassers did not know about those actions. Unless we hold employers strictly liable for failing to broadcast sensitive disciplinary matters to their entire workforces, we cannot predicate liability on this theory. In addition, if the dissent's inference is properly drawn on this record, it would be so in every case involving multiple incidents of harassment, and employers would be hard pressed to prove the negative - that future harassers were not motivated by prior employer responses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   We recognize the sensibility of taking measures to prevent harassment in the first instance, although such measures are not mandatory. The dissent's test, however, would make employers insurers against future sexual harassment by coworkers after an initial employer response, regardless of the nature of the responses taken. This is liability without end.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <em>\n    Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306858\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/664/#p679\">\n    144 F.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (10th Cir. 1998) (internal citations omitted). I agree with this reasoning. Plaintiff's theory puts too great a burden on the employer to foresee misconduct by employees who have no history of misconduct. CRST cannot be held liable for failing to respond to an action by an employee that has not yet happened and that CRST has no reason to suspect will happen. Its remedial response must be measured only by what it knew at the time. On that point, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that CRST's response to their complaints of harassment was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence that after they made a complaint of harassment by a co-driver and CRST responded to their complaint, they continued to be harassed by that same co-driver. Indeed, the undisputed evidence shows that the plaintiff was never re-paired with that driver and, in most cases, never even saw him again. Thus, CRST's response was adequate in stopping the harassment as to that particular co-driver and it was not reasonably foreseeable that plaintiffs would continue to be harassed by the next co-driver. There is also no evidence that any of the alleged harassers in this case had previously harassed another female driver, which would be relevant as to CRST's knowledge and the reasonableness of its previous response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Finally, and as CRST points out, this case presents the unique situation in which the Eighth Circuit has already evaluated CRST's responses to complaints of sexual harassment by a coworker and determined that, \"as a matter of law, CRST promptly and effectively remedied any alleged harassment that the women reported.\"\n   <em>\n    CRST Van Expedited, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732178,3877333\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/657/\">\n    679 F.3d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At minimum, the Eighth Circuit's conclusion is instructive in this case and provides further support for CRST's position.

I found that the claim failed based on an absence of a \"genuine issue of material fact as to whether CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice after July 1, 2015, of not\n   paying female drivers who were removed from their truck following a complaint of sexual harassment or paying them substantially less than they would have made had they stayed on the truck.\" Doc.

As to those claims, I found there was a genuine\n   issue of material fact regarding whether the conduct plaintiffs experienced was severe and pervasive enough to affect a term or condition of their employment. However, I concluded the claims ultimately failed because there was no fact issue with regard to CRST's remedial response or negligence. In doing so, I noted that CRST's response need only be measured by what it knew at the time. With regard to plaintiffs' constructive discharge claims, I find that whether the employer deliberately created intolerable working conditions with the intent to get plaintiffs to resign must also include a consideration of the employer's knowledge. Specifically, it must be \"reasonably foreseeable\" that the employee would resign as a consequence of the employer's actions.\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Taco Bell Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1567043\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/884/#p890\">\n    156 F.3d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890 (8th Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   When viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, I find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the conditions were intolerable. However, plaintiffs must also prove that CRST deliberately intended for them to be intolerable such that it was reasonably foreseeable that plaintiffs would resign. Plaintiffs have not put forth sufficient evidence that CRST deliberately created intolerable working conditions with the intent that any plaintiff would resign her employment. In each instance of a complaint of harassment, CRST removed the plaintiff from the harassing situation and re-paired her with another driver. While plaintiffs often faced harassment by the next driver, the record lacks evidence that CRST knew or had reason to know that these particular drivers would engage in such conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Because there is no evidence that CRST removed plaintiffs from harassing environments and deliberately put them in new environments which they knew or had reason to know that plaintiffs would continue to be subject to harassment, I find that plaintiffs' constructive discharge claims must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vajdl v.
