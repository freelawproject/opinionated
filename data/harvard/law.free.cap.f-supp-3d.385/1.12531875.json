INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court previously held that the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") exceeded its statutory authority when it reduced the 2018 Medicare reimbursement rate for certain pharmaceutical drugs-those covered by the \"340B Program\"-by nearly 30%. In that decision, the Court asked the parties to provide supplemental briefing regarding the appropriate remedy. That briefing is now ripe for the Court's consideration. Plaintiffs, a group of hospital associations and non-profit hospitals,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   have also filed a supplemental complaint raising a new claim. They contend that HHS once again exceeded its statutory authority when it implemented the same 340B reimbursement rate for 2019 that the Court held was unlawfully implemented in 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that HHS's 2019 340B reimbursement rate is unlawful, for the same reasons that the 2018 rate was unlawful. The Court also concludes that, despite the fatal flaw in the agency's rate adjustments, vacating HHS's 2018 and 2019 rules is not the best course of action, given the havoc vacatur may wreak on Medicare's administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rather, the Court will remand the two rules to the agency, giving it the first crack at crafting appropriate remedial measures. The Court expects HHS to resolve this issue promptly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Under this system, the Secretary-through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\")-sets annual OPPS reimbursement rates prospectively, before a given year, rather than retroactively based on covered hospitals' actual costs during that year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Medicare Part B reimburses, among other products and services, \"specified covered outpatient drugs\" (\"SCODs\") provided by hospitals to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(14)(A). SCODS are a subset of \"separately payable drugs,\" which are not bundled with other Medicare Part B outpatient services, and are therefore reimbursed on a drug-by-drug basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395l(t)(14)(B). Congress has authorized two potential methodologies for setting SCOD rates. First, if the Secretary has certain \"hospital acquisition cost survey data,\" he must set the reimbursement rate for each SCOD according to \"the\n   <em>\n    average acquisition cost\n   </em>\n   for the drug for that year ... as determined by the Secretary taking into account\" the survey data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I) (emphasis added). Second, if the survey data is not available, each SCOD's reimbursement rate must be set equal to \"the\n   <em>\n    average [sales] price\n   </em>\n   [ (\"ASP\") ] for the drug in the year established under ... section 1395w-3a ... as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary for purposes of this paragraph.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) (emphasis added).

Put another way, the 340B Program caps the prices that eligible providers pay for covered drugs, but Medicare Part B sets the reimbursement rates those providers receive for prescribing covered drugs to Medicare beneficiaries. Until recently, there was a significant spread between 340B prices and Medicare reimbursement rates. 340B Program participants could purchase drugs at steeply discounted rates under the Program, then seek reimbursement for those purchases at the higher Medicare Part B rates established by OPPS. The Secretary's attempt to narrow the spread triggered this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In mid-2017, the Secretary proposed reducing reimbursement rates for SCODs and other 340B drugs, from ASP plus 6% to ASP minus 22.5%.

The Secretary asserted that this change was necessary to \"make Medicare payment for separately payable drugs more aligned with the resources expended by hospitals to acquire such drugs[,] while recognizing the intent of the 340B program to allow covered entities, including eligible hospitals, to stretch scarce resources while continuing to provide access to care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n    at 33,633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Secretary's statutory authority to reduce the 2018 340B rate was limited by the data available to him.
