After his diagnosis, Plaintiff Emily DeRogatis received erroneous information about the possible termination of her husband's healthcare benefits from a claims specialist employed by Frank's healthcare plan-the Welfare Fund of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 15, 15A, 15C &amp; 15D, AFL-CIO (the \"Welfare Fund\"). Fearing a loss of medical benefits at a time when her husband was hospitalized and dying, she declined to submit an early retirement election that Frank had signed in order to maximize the pension benefit that she would receive after his death. As a result, Emily was not eligible for augmented survivor's benefits under the terms of his pension plan-the Central Pension Fund of the International Union of Operating\n   Engineers and Participating Employers (the \"Pension Plan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Frank's death, Emily brought lawsuits against the Welfare Fund and the Pension Plan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a quest to obtain the augmented benefit that would have been available to her had she submitted Frank's early retirement papers. This Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and DeRogatis appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed this Court's award of summary judgment in favor of the Pension Plan-the terms of which clearly barred giving Emily the augmented benefit-but concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact about the potential liability of the Welfare Fund for a breach of fiduciary duty based on the actions of its employees. Specifically, the Second Circuit concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact about (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) whether the trustees were acting as fiduciaries to DeRogatis when a Welfare Fund employee provided erroneous advice to Emily; and, if they were, (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ii\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) whether the trustees breached those fiduciary duties through a combination of a misleading summary plan description (\"SPD\") and the erroneous advice. However, the Court of Appeals observed that the Welfare Fund could still obtain summary judgment if it established on remand that DeRogatis was not entitled to equitable relief under the circumstances-an issue that neither party had briefed before this Court in connection with the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court is the Welfare Fund's renewed motion for summary judgment, on the grounds that DeRogatis has no claim for an equitable remedy under the circumstances of this case. Also before the Court is DeRogatis' cross-motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the Welfare Fund breached its fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons that follow, both motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Sept. 19, 2016) (\n   <em>\n    DeRogatis III\n   </em>\n   ), and the Second Circuit's decision,\n   <em>\n    In re DeRogatis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n    904 F.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    DeRogatis IV\n   </em>\n   ). A brief overview of the facts, taken from these decisions, is provided below. For purposes of the Welfare Fund's current summary judgment motion, the facts are taken in the light most favorable to DeRogatis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Frank DeRogatis was an operating engineer and member of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 15 (\"Local\n   15\"). The Union provides its members with both medical (welfare) and pension benefits. Medical benefits are administered locally, through the Welfare Fund's New York City-based office. Pension benefits are administered centrally, through the Pension Plan's Washington, D.C. based-office. The two plans have no formal affiliation with each other, except that they both serve Local 15 members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the Pension Plan's Washington, D.C. office is not readily accessible to New York City-based members of the Local 15, employees of the Welfare Fund occasionally provide advice related to pension benefits under the Pension Plan. That is what happened in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Frank DeRogatis was diagnosed with terminal cancer in January 2011, he and his wife Emily met with Patrick Keenan, an office administrator for the Welfare Fund, to learn about Frank's post-retirement options for health benefits and pension benefits. Based on what Keenan told him, Frank then filled out and signed the paperwork to apply for early retirement. He did this because, under the terms of the Pension Plan, the surviving spouse of a retired Local 15 member would receive a higher monthly benefit than the surviving spouse of a member who died while employed. To put numbers on the difference: if Frank died while employed, Emily was entitled to a Preretirement Annuity of $ 787 per month; if he died after retiring, Emily could qualify for a Joint Annuity (the \"100% Joint Annuity\"), which would pay her as much as $ 1,076 per month. So by retiring, at age 61 instead of waiting until age 62, Frank could leave Emily with a pension benefit worth almost $ 300 more each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Frank was hospitalized with pneumonia in late July 2011, Emily brought the signed retirement paperwork to the local Welfare Fund office for filing. However, before she submitted the paperwork, claims specialist Richard Lopez told her that the DeRogatises would lose their health benefits if Frank retired before reaching the age of 62. This was not correct. What Lopez should have said was that Frank would stop accruing additional health benefits (which were credited to Local 15 members every four months based on hours worked) if he retired early-although since he was dying, not working, this would hardly have mattered. Taking early retirement would not have left Frank without health insurance benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But Emily thought that submitting the early retirement paperwork would jeopardize Frank's access to health insurance. So she did not submit it. Instead, she applied for a short-term disability benefit from the Welfare Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Frank died less than two months later, in September 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In strict accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan, Emily began receiving the lower, $ 787/month Preretirement Annuity. Emily tried to submit Frank's signed retirement papers after his death and contested the Pension Plan's determination. After several unsuccessful rounds of administrative appeals, Emily brought parallel ERISA cases in this Court against both the Pension Plan (13-cv-8788) and the Welfare Fund (14-cv-8863).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Present Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After discovery, the Court granted summary judgment to the Pension Plan defendants, finding as a matter of undisputed fact that the Pension Plan had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously or breached any fiduciary duty in denying DeRogatis' request for an augmented survivor's benefit after her husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    DeRogatis I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201923544\">\n    2015 WL 1923544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-*8 ;\n   <em>\n    DeRogatis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205805283\">\n    2016 WL 5805283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court also granted summary judgment to the Welfare Plan. I concluded that a plan administrator could not be held liable for unintentional misrepresentations made about the plan's operation by Lopez, who was a purely \"ministerial\" agent and not a fiduciary.\n   <em>\n    DeRogatis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342058\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/167/574/\">\n    167 F.

The Court of Appeals concluded that because there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether the Welfare Fund's summary plan description (\"SPD\") was sufficiently clear about whether medical benefits could be lost due to early retirement-as well as whether the representations made by Keenan and Lopez were misleading-Emily might well succeed in proving the first two elements of a fiduciary breach claim against the Welfare Fund at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n    at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, there are three elements to such a claim. The third is whether \"appropriate equitable relief\" is available. As neither party had briefed this issue in their summary judgment papers, the Second Circuit remanded so this Court could consider in the first instance whether Emily might be entitled to any equitable remedy against the Welfare Fund.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n    at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Obviously, if she were so entitled, the existence of questions of fact as identified by the Circuit would necessitate a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court of Appeals directed that, \"On remand, the District Court should consider whether Emily will be entitled to a surcharge or some other form of 'appropriate equitable relief' under ERISA section 502(a)(3) if she successfully proves that the Welfare Fund breached a fiduciary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals catalogued the types of equitable relief that might be available to Emily under the statute: \"estoppel, equitable reformation of plan terms, or a monetary 'surcharge' to recompense 'a loss resulting from a [fiduciary's] breach of duty, or to prevent the [fiduciary's] unjust enrichment[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518645\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/174/\">\n    at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Amara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458996,5957262\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/421/\">\n    563 U.S. at 440-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458996,5957262\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/421/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). One such form of equitable relief was off the table from the start; the Court of Appeals definitively rejected the availability of any injunctive remedy against the Welfare Fund, because it does not administer pension benefits. \"[T]he District Court could not enjoin the Welfare Fund to enroll her in a survivor benefit over which that Fund has no control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199. The Circuit observed-albeit without deciding the issue-that DeRogatis might be able to surcharge the Welfare Fund, whose employee(s) had misled her, to \"compensate her for the difference between the 100% Joint Annuity and the Preretirement Annuity, both retrospectively and on an ongoing basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

They argue that certain paragraphs of the Welfare Fund Trust Agreement constitute a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   contract between plan beneficiaries and trustees that limits recovery to medical benefits. They identify two provisions of the Trust Agreement that (allegedly) prohibit the trustees of the Welfare Fund from using the fund's assets for anything other than member healthcare benefits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   WHEREAS: The Union, the Associations and the Employers desire to establish a Trust under which the moneys paid on account of medical and hospital care and related benefits will be held in a trust fund to be known as the WELFARE FUND OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF OPERATING ENGINEERS, LOCAL UNIONS 15, 15A, 15C, 15D, AFL-CIO (hereinafter referred to as the \"Welfare Fund\"), and to designate trustees to receive, hold, administer and disburse said moneys and other properties owned by the Welfare Fund, and to define the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Trustees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (Steinberg Decl. Ex. A at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The purposes of the Trust Fund shall be to provide, pursuant to the Welfare Plan, medical care, hospital care, life insurance, disability and sickness benefits, and all other kindred benefits,\n   for the Employees eligible thereto hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, Article III.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Br. at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But nothing in the Fund Agreement prohibits the imposition of a surcharge on the Fund's Trustees. As a matter of simple fact, the Trust Agreement does not require that every dollar collected be spent on medical benefits; otherwise, the Fund could not administer itself-rent space, pay its employees, keep the lights on. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, Art. VI, First, (i) (property taxes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, Art. VI, First, (o) (administrative staff).) Moreover, the Trust Agreement authorizes the use of trust funds to indemnify its trustees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, Art. XI, Sixth.) The trustees would surely apply for indemnification if they were to be surcharged because of the bad advice given by a subordinate to a member, and the Fund is permitted to pay such indemnification. That alone disposes of the Fund's argument that the trustees would be diverting funds from an allowable use to one that is not authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   is not to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   was not an equitable case at all; it was a simple contract case, as the Supreme Court held, and under the plain terms of the contract, the company had an equitable lien on any recovery McCutchen might get from anyone in connection with his accident, whether by suit or by allowed insurance claim, up to $ 67,000.\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    569 U.S. at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cognetta v.

Supp. 3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (E.D.N.Y. 2018). Because the Trust Agreement provides that the Fund can pay for administrative expenses and indemnify its trustees, there is no issue about the availability of funds as a matter of simple contract-in fact, under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    McCutchen\n   </em>\n   , surcharge is allowable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Surcharge Does Not Require an Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally (albeit for the first time in reply), the Welfare Fund argues that courts in this circuit do not recognize a standalone surcharge remedy; rather, to constitute an equitable remedy, the surcharge must be accompanied by an injunction. (Reply Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of the Local 15 Welfare Fund Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. No. 95 at 2-7.) The Welfare Fund relies on the following language from\n   <em>\n    New York State Psychiatric Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333573\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/125/\">\n    798 F.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015) : \"where ... a plan participant brings suit against a plan fiduciary ... for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the terms of a plan, any resulting injunction\n   <em>\n    coupled with\n   </em>\n   surcharge ... constitutes equitable relief under 502(a)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333573\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333573\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/125/\">\n    at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This is weak sauce. There is no indication that the Second Circuit, with this one phrase, meant to restrict the scope and availability of ERISA's surcharge remedy. Rather, it was describing the types of relief available, and it viewed those types as disjunctive: \"And so we hold that to the extent Denbo seeks redress for United's past breaches of fiduciary duty\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   seeks to enjoin United from committing future breaches, the relief sought would count as 'equitable relief' under \u00a7 502(a)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333573\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333573\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/125/\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Moreover, the Second Circuit has stated quite directly-albeit in a summary order-that it considers injunction and surcharge to be \"alternative-not interdependent[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Osberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017218\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/555/77/#p81\">\n    555 F. App'x at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Additionally, if the unavailability of injunctive relief ruled out surcharge as a matter of law, the Court of Appeals-which\n   plainly ruled that injunctive relief was not available to DeRogatis-would have had no need to remand the case to this Court so that I could engage in the meaningless exercise of deciding whether surcharge was available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To bolster its argument that the Second Circuit does not recognize a standalone surcharge remedy, the Welfare Fund also relies on other cases, principally\n   <em>\n    Central States v. Gerber Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n    984 F. Supp. 2d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2013). That case, however, involved a section 502(a)(3) suit by a welfare plan against a life insurance company, not a case by a beneficiary against a breaching trustee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n    at 247-48, 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that this was a difference that made a difference-that\n   <em>\n    Amara\n   </em>\n   relief was not available to the plan, as opposed to a beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That being so, the court correctly applied the\n   <em>\n    Mertens\n   </em>\n   line of cases and found that Central States did not state a claim for \"appropriate equitable relief\" under section 502(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059101\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/984/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The facts of\n   <em>\n    Curran v.
