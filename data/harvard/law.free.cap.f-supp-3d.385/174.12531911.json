But a review of his written decision reveals that is an inexact characterization of the ALJ's decision. Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the ALJ accurately summarized plaintiff's testimony, juxtaposing her claims of severe, disabling limitations with other findings by the various medical providers in the record.

But considered together, they tend to cast doubt on the notion that plaintiff is as severely limited as she claimed to be in her testimony. For instance, whether plaintiff wants to admit it or not, she did testify that she is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   driver in the household, that she often drives her boyfriend to work, and that she often helps her children in the mornings. R. at 43, 65.
