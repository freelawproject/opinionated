ROM\u00c1N, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Luis Martinez (\"Petitioner\"), a native and citizen of Mexico, has been living in\n   the U.S. since 1990, when he was 12 or 13 years old. Petitioner has been detained in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") custody since January 16, 2019, allegedly pursuant to a reinstated order of removal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's Letter dated 5/14/19, ECF No. 20.) Petitioner is detained in Essex County Correctional Facility, where he is in conditions identical to those of county jail inmates serving criminal sentences. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter dated 6/12/19, ECF No. 36.) On March 24, 2019, Petitioner filed a writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   with this Court, arguing that he was never served with any reinstatement order when he was detained, and nor was his attorney, who for months repeatedly sought the alleged order justifying Mr. Martinez's detention. (ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner filed a First Amended Petition for his writ on April 21, 2019. (ECF No. 7.) Subsequently, on May 13, 2019, Petitioner filed an Order to Show Cause for his immediate release from custody on grounds that he and his counsel had still not received any notice or orders justifying his detention, and hence the detention was unconstitutional. (ECF No. 18.) On May 13, 2019, the day Petitioner filed his Order to Show Cause in this Court, ICE finally served him and his counsel with a Notice of Intent/ Decision to Reinstate the Prior Order (Form I-871). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter, ECF No. 20.) Having finally received written notice, Petitioner did not receive a new bond hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 28, 2019, I held a Show Cause Hearing to assess the legal basis and constitutionality of Petitioner's Detention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry Dated 5/28/2019.) Following that hearing, I requested that the parties provide additional briefing regarding Petitioner's writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   in light of the fact that a belated Notice of Reinstatement Order had finally been served on Petitioner, four months after his initial ICE Detention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both parties timely filed their briefs. Presently before the Court is Petitioner's Petition for a Writ of\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corpus\n   </em>\n   . (ECF No. 7.) For the following reasons, Petitioner's Writ is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Petitioner's Petition for the Writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   and have largely not been disputed by the Government. While they are useful context, they are not the factual or legal basis, for the Court's ensuing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner Luis Martinez is a citizen of Mexico who has been living in New Paltz, New York since 1990, when he was twelve years old. His father was murdered in Mexico when he was an infant, after which his mother came to the United States to work and support him and his siblings. Petitioner is married. His three children, mother, and two brothers are all U.S. citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Along with his brother, Petitioner owns a well-known and successful construction company, which has projects throughout New Paltz and the Hudson Valley. The company provides work for hundreds of employees. Petitioner's other brother, Jesus Jose Martinez, was shot to death in New Paltz in 1999, while Petitioner was standing beside him, a murder that was never solved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2016, Petitioner filed an application with United States Citizenship and Immigrations Services (\"USCIS\") for a \"U\" visa, a form of legal status for victims of crimes. If approved, this will grant Petitioner legal residence in the United States, despite his prior immigration violations. Although this application is pending, Defendants apprehended Petitioner at his business in January 2019, detained him, threatened to deport him to Mexico, and claimed to be reinstating or\n   have reinstated a prior removal order from more than 20 years ago. Yet, Petitioner claims, Defendants never provided him or his attorney with this supposedly reinstated order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After being apprehended, Petitioner immediately applied for a stay of deportation based on the pending U visa, as he met the criteria for a stay. ICE denied the stay, but on grounds that are legally questionable for individuals with pending U visa petitions. Meanwhile, USCIS asked Petitioner to submit additional evidence in support of his U visa application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In fear for his life after ICE denied his stay of removal and threatened to deport him, Petitioner asserted a claim for fear of persecution and torture in Mexico, a right afforded to people whom ICE claims are subject to reinstated orders of removal. This fear stemmed from threats against him relating to his father's murder, and his fear of retaliation based on information he had provided to the U.S. Government about a Mexican drug cartel. An asylum officer then interviewed Petitioner, found his fear credible, and yet denied the application for a stay. Afterwards, an immigration judge reversed the asylum officer's decision, thereby staying Petitioner's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Presently, if Petitioner's application for a U visa is approved, he will be eligible for \"deferred action,\" a form of temporary legal immigration status, while he waits the additional years it typically takes for an actual visa to become available. If a U visa is granted, Petitioner will be eligible to apply for permanent residence (a green card) after about three more years. But if he is deported to Mexico before his U visa application is decided, Petitioner will not be eligible for \"deferred action\" and could spend several years in Mexico waiting for a U visa to become available. There is a legitimate risk of persecution if Petitioner is deported to Mexico, and there will be additional barriers to admissibility to the U.S. if he is deported-many of which he may not be able to overcome-even if his U visa is eventually approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That is Petitioner's immigration history and status. It provides useful context for his current predicament, though only collaterally relates to the instant issue, which is the constitutionality of his detention, and the Court's ability to release him through the writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Petitioner's Initial Detention Was Unconstitutional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court ultimately needs to answer the question of whether there is an appropriate basis for it to issue the\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   writ. It can find an appropriate basis one of two ways. It can find that Petitioner's initial detention was unconstitutional, and regardless of his present custody, the appropriate remedy for that initial violation alone is to release him. Or it can find that Petitioner's original\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   current detention are unconstitutional, and the appropriate remedy for the continuous violation is to release him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Petitioner's argument is that\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   release is appropriate to remedy just his initial unlawful detention; and, in any event, his current detention is unconstitutional because it was unconstitutional at the time that he was taken into custody, and it cannot be rectified by the Government's last-minute production of a reinstatement order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Mem. at 2) (\"The question is on a habeas petition is whether the detention was lawful at the time the petition was filed, and not whether\n   Defendants have belatedly 'fixed' it\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   , as they claim to have done here.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Petitioner's present detention is fully authorized by the May 13, Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order (I-871) (\"NOIDTR\"), which ICE allegedly served on Petitioner on May 13, 2019. (Def. Mem. at 4-8.) As such, they argue, regardless of the legality of Plaintiff's previous four months of detention, Petitioner's current detention is a separate event, authorized by virtue of a single purportedly corrective document, and therefore Petitioner has no basis to invoke his petition for release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To address the constitutionality of Petitioner's current detention, the Court need first addresses the constitutionality of Petitioner's initial detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Petitioner's Initial Detention Lacked Written Notice and Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Government argues that there was never a time when Petitioner was unlawfully detained. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Mem. at 3) (\"assuming...that there was such a period of unauthorized detention, which there was not.\") Indeed, it argues, as it did at the Show Cause Hearing, that a valid Notice of Reinstatement (\"NOIDTR\") was issued and served on Petitioner on January 16, 2019, when he was first detained. The Government adds that even if a valid NOIDTR was not issued and served, Petitioner knew he was an alien against whom an order of removal had once been issued, and he therefore had constructive notice of the basis for his detention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Petitioner paints a vastly different picture of both the law and facts. He argues that the Government failed to serve him and his counsel with any, let alone a proper, NOIDTR in January-and that the Government continued to thwart its notice obligations, by never providing any, let alone a valid, NOIDTR until May 13, 2019. (Pet. Mem. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court agrees with Petitioner. Based on the arguments and statements made at the Show Cause Hearing and the exhibits submitted, the Court is unable to find one iota of proof that the Government actually served Petitioner with any NOIDTR, let alone a facially sufficient one, when it detained him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To begin, both Petitioner and his counsel's affidavits state that Petitioner was taken custody without being served with an arrest warrant or any paper documentary order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. of Luis Martinez, ECF No. 29-1 ):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   2. On January 16, 2019, I was detained by officers from ICE, in the carpark outside my office in New Paltz. They asked me if I was Luis Martinez, and I replied that I was, and then they told me that they were taking [me] into custody because I had a deportation order. I asked them if they had a warrant for my arrest, and they told me that they would show to me later, and that first they wanted to put me safely in their car. I complied with their request and got into the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   3. I was then taken to what I presume was an ICE office, while the officers who entertained me did some work on the computer, and told me that I was under arrest.

I was never served with any papers or documents by these ICE officers other than a document with instructions for location of detainees in ICE custody, along with a list of free lawyers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Petitioner's counsel, Cheryl R. David, provided an affidavit reflecting the same:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   2. After Plaintiff was detained, in January 16, 2019, ICE informed both myself and Mr. Martinez that his arrest was based on reinstatement of a prior order of removal. However, no such order of reinstatement was ever served on Mr. Martinez, either in January 2016 or at any time prior or subsequent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   3. At various points subsequent to Plaintiff's detention, I asked his deportation officer to provide me with a copy of any reinstated order of removal. I only got one response to these requests, which was that the officer didn't have it because it was with Mr. Martinez's U visa application in Vermont. This made no sense to me, because there would have been no reason for ICE to have sent a reinstatement order to the USCIS office in Vermont dealing with Mr. Martinez's U visa application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   4. On April 4, 2019, I wrote to Plaintiff's deportation officer and made a formal demand for the order of reinstatement, and any related/supporting documents. I received no response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   6. I was not served with the May 2019 order of reinstatement. I have spoken with my client repeatedly about this, and he told me that although he was shown a document purporting to be a notice of reinstatement in May 2019, he was never actually served with it, and is not in possession of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Declaration of Cheryl R. David, ECF No. 29-2.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , Letter from Cheryl R. David to ICE Officer Sean Hunter Dated April 4, 2019 (reflecting that as of April 4, Petitioner's counsel was still seeking documents justifying basis for Petitioner's detention.))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At the Show Cause Hearing, the Government did not dispute the possibility that Petitioner was not served with a valid reinstatement order, nor did it offer any proof that the reinstatement order it completed in January was actually served on Petitioner or his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Hearing revealed that counsel for the Government was not present during Petitioner's arrest, nor when ICE officers produced and served the supposedly legitimate NOIDTR. In addition, the only affidavit the Government submitted was prepared by Deportation Officer Timothy Nevin, who asserted that he worked in a supervisory capacity with ICE, prepared this declaration \"at the request of the U.S. Attorney's Office, and that his representations were only based on his \"\n   <em>\n    review\n   </em>\n   of Martinez's administrative file, consultation with [his] colleagues, and ICE electronic records and databases.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. of Timothy Nevin, ECF No. 24, at \u00b6 2.) Based on this representation, Mr. Nevin's declaration would appear to be hearsay from a removed third party, which at best, only stated in conclusory terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   On January 16, 2019, ICE located and arrested Martinez pursuant to a Warrant of Removal/Deportation for the purpose of reinstating his prior order of removal. On that day, a NOIDTR was generated for Martinez and a Deportation Officer subsequently presented that to Martinez and explained the form to him, but Martinez refused to sign and acknowledge it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The declaration does not explain how Mr. Nevin would know the passive things that he claims happened to Petitioner, beyond that it came from his\n   <em>\n    review\n   </em>\n   of the file and\n   <em>\n    discussions\n   </em>\n   with his colleagues. In fact, Mr. Nevin describes the form being explained by an omniscient \"Deportation Officer.\" Ironically, on the bottom of this page, where a Deportation Officer is supposed to certify that the officer has properly filled out and served the form, Mr. Nevin's signature appears alongside the date August 27, 1997-the date from 22 years ago when Plaintiff purportedly originally\n   received his removal order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 16, 2019 NOIDTR, ECF No. 25-5.) It behooves the Court that on a form that Petitioner claims he never saw until this Court filing, which contains a host of errors, including certification dates from more than two decades years ago, Mr. Nevin's signature appears, and yet, nowhere in Mr. Nevin's declaration does he assert that he ever signed the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As the Court stated, the entire form is filled with dubious discrepancies. Through April, Petitioner's lawyer could not locate any\n   <em>\n    completed\n   </em>\n   NOIDTR containing the signature of a Deportation Order that justified reinstatement of Petitioner's 1997 removal order. In fact, counsel produced another incomplete NOIDTR that dated from July 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 16, 2014 NOIDTR, ECF No. 18-10.) And as the Court previously mentioned, the NOIDTR that the Government recently produced, which has a January 16, 2019 date at the top, has Mr. Nevin's signature at the bottom with a certification dated August 27, 1997. (January 16, 2019 NOIDTR, ECF No. 25-5.) And neither Petitioner nor his Counsel ever report seeing or being served with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   I have looked over this document and find it facially deficient. It makes no sense that a valid reinstatement of removal order: 1) has a date that precedes when Petitioner was actually removed, 2) was supposedly signed by a deportation officer who made no representation of signing it (and whose declaration suggests that someone else signed it), 3) was supposedly presented to Petitioner and his Counsel, when both have repeatedly represented that they had no documentation governing Petitioner's removal, and 4) where the Government has not provided any tangible proof that this form existed on January 16, 2019, let alone that a Deportation Officer actually signed it and served it on Petitioner. These are more than minor technicalities. There is virtually no proof that this documented existed and was served when the Government purports that it did, and considerable evidence suggesting just the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Similar to how the Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), held that a notice form that was facially deficient would not satisfy the notice provisions for the stop-time rule (in that case the form's purpose was to give the noncitizen the time and place of removal proceeding, both of which were lacking) here, the NOIDTR was also facially deficient in proving that it existed at the time of Petitioner's detention or was served on him. The document has absurd dates and was only signed by a Government Officer who did not even recall signing the document in his affidavit. Petitioner's signature is nowhere on the document, and ample evidence suggests that Petitioner's counsel never received it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Accordingly, based on my review of the record, the law, and the presented at the Show Cause Hearing, I conclude that when Petitioner was first arrested and detained, he was not served with any NOIDTR and never received written notice prior to or immediately after his detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Constructive Notice is Inadequate Process for Liberty Deprivations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Government, however, still does not think this fact is detrimental to detaining Petitioner. The Government argues that, even if it did not produce and serve Petitioner with a valid NOIDTR at the onset, Petitioner's original detention was still constitutional because he had constructive notice of why he was being detained, and in any event, no service is required under the new reinstatement provision. (Def. Mem. at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In support of its position, the Government relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda,\n   </em>\n   a case in which the Second Circuit recognized that Congress passed the reinstatement provision as an amendment to the IIRIRA to narrow the process requirements and \"make the removal of illegal reentrants more expeditious.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n    531 F.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Government also concedes that that the\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda\n   </em>\n   Court emphasized that Section 241.8(b) was the procedural mechanism to implement this new reinstatement provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n    at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And again, Section 241.8(b), expressly requires written notice. 8 C.F.R. Section 241.8(b) (the immigration officer \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   provide the alien with a written notice of his or her determination\" and \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   advice the alien that he or she may make a written or oral statement contesting the determination.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Further, the Second Circuit recognized that what the reinstatement provision really eliminated from the previous version of the statute was the right for people subject to reinstatement orders to have a\n   <em>\n    hearing\n   </em>\n   before an immigration judge. The Court explained that removing the hearing provision from the previous statute was not unconstitutional because aliens who had received final removal orders already had hearings before immigration judges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n    at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With the reinstatement provision, Congress was merely eliminating the\n   <em>\n    duplication\n   </em>\n   that arose from requiring a hearing before an immigration judge in\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   removal and reinstatement proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This Court acknowledges that eliminating the right to hearing can be constitutional, where there is an adequate administrative process in place. This principal was established long ago when the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment can be satisfied without a hearing, so long as there is sufficient written notice and written procedures in place that one can avail before being deprived of life, liberty, or property.\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.

But now, Petitioner is attempting to do that from within prison, where his access to his belongings, the courts, and to counsel is severely limited. Therefore, this factor too weighs in favor of finding a procedural due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   And last, the Government's fiscal and administrative burdens were low. The Government had little to lose by providing Petitioner with advanced written notice on completed forms and offering a meaningful opportunity for him to search his papers, solicit counsel, and contest detention. Indeed, because Petitioner was detained, he was unable to attend his first bond hearing at all (which appears to have been lost on\n   an erroneous application of facts and law), and the withdrawal-only hearing was recently adjourned by six more weeks due to faulty technology in the correctional facility. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter dated 6/12/19, ECF No. 36 ). These are the exact irreparable harms that adequate notice and process are designed to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Petitioner was (and would like to remain) an established member of his community, living with his family of U.S. citizens and a enjoying a vast support network. He has no criminal history, runs a profitable business, and tends to his family's many needs. The Court cannot fathom what the burden the Government actually faced in depriving him of barebones process. Their conduct reeks of arbitrariness and carelessness. That is not to say that the Government does not have a valid interest in investigating aliens whom they suspect of violating immigration laws, and even ultimately deporting some. But for alleged aliens who long-ago entered and have lived for decades within the nation's borders, who have no criminal history, and whose personal stakes are at their zenith, the Government has an obligation to be more meticulous and less intrusive before arbitrarily depriving them of their most valuable interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Therefore, I find that even though eliminating an alien's right to a hearing may pass constitutional muster, depriving an alien with substantial ties to the United States of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   written notice and a hearing\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   detaining him for several months not only violates the IIRIRA's reinstatement order, Section 248.1's implementation provisions, and a host of agency regulations, but it also fundamentally violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it deprives him of any way to meaningfully contest the basis for his detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, Petitioner's detention was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Writ Shall Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The writ is granted, and Petitioner will be released from Essex County Jail. There are at least two separate reasons warranting this outcome. The first is that the writ application is not moot. It relates back to when Petitioner was first unlawfully detained, and it can be used to equitably redress that unlawful detention, for which there is no other remedy. The second is that Plaintiff's present detention remains unconstitutional, and the writ's most classic function is to release someone who is presently unlawfully detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court next addresses why the writ is not moot, despite being filed prior to Petitioner being served with facially proper written notice. Next, it will address why it is also appropriate to issue the writ based on Petitioner's current detention, which remains unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Writ Relates Back to When Petitioner was Unlawfully Detained\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants argue that issuing the\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   writ is inappropriate because Petitioner's initial and present detention were both constitutional. (Def. Mem. at 2.) The thrust of their argument is that because Petitioner's present detention is supposedly proper, there is no cure for Petitioner's prior period of detention, even if it was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Petitioner argues that it is appropriate for the Court to issue the writ because the operative question in deciding whether to issue the writ is whether the detention was lawful\n   <em>\n    at the time the petition was filed\n   </em>\n   . (Pet. Mem. at 2.) The Court agrees with Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Petitioner relies on\n   <em>\n    Carafas v. LaVallee\n   </em>\n   to support the notion that an unlawful\n   detention is not mooted by being \"converted\" to a lawful one. (Pet. Mem. at 2-3.) In\n   <em>\n    Carafas\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner was criminally convicted and served his full sentence, during which time his\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition worked its way through various state and federal courts without being resolved on the merits. By the time the Supreme Court granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   on the application, Petitioner had already been unconditionally released from custody. The Supreme Court nevertheless held that a remedy was still available via\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   because: 1) under the\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   statute, once federal jurisdiction attaches in the District Court \"it is not defeated by the release of the petitioner prior to completion of proceedings on such application,\" and 2) because\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   was designed to afford flexible forms of equitable relief, it would not be just for the Court to dispose of the matter simply because during the pendency of the litigation, Defendant completed his time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1560-61 (\"He should not be thwarted now and required to bear the consequences of assertedly unlawful conviction simply because the path has been so long that he has served his sentence. The federal habeas corpus statute does not require this result\"). The Supreme Court emphasized that it would be fundamentally unjust to have petitioner live with his unresolved petition, the consequences of which he would continue to bear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   This Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Carafas\n   </em>\n   reasoning compelling. Just as Carafas' release from custody did not moot his application because he was in custody\n   <em>\n    at the time he filed the petition\n   </em>\n   , the Court does not find Petitioner's current status - even if it has been converted to a lawful one - a bar to allowing the Court to exercise an appropriate equitable remedy through the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Further, the Government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Wainwright\n   </em>\n   to suggest that\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   may only test the legality of a prisoner's current detention misconstrues what\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   actually held. In that case, the petitioner had been convicted of two completely separate crimes and filed a writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   to challenge the legality of the first crime for which he would independently have to serve a life sentence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170283\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/335/\">\n    390 U.S. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170283\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/335/\">\n    88 S.

The Government argued that the Court need not issue the writ because it would be futile in securing his release based on his second, totally unrelated, conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Supreme Court rejected the Government's argument, which had swayed the district and circuit courts. Instead, it noted \"the extraordinary predicament in which the District Court had placed the petitioner\" by denying him the opportunity to challenge his original detention through the writ. The Supreme Court then overruled its own precedent and held that the fact that Petitioner may have to serve a separate sentence for another crime did not serve as a bar to his\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition because it would be unjust to deny him the chance to challenge the constitutionality of the detention in connection with which he filed his application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In sum, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld prisoners' rights to challenge the constitutionality of their detentions, and allow courts to implement corrective remedies, regardless of whether there were other bases for the petitioners to be subsequently detained, or whether they had already been released. Accordingly, the Court finds that Petitioner's application for\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   , which was filed while he was unlawfully detained, is an appropriate basis for the Court to scrutinize his entire detention. This is particularly so where-as here-the detention appears to be one continuous event derived from one underlying set of facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Petitioner's Current Detention is Still Unconstitutional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Petitioner next argues that his detention remains unconstitutional, notwithstanding the seemingly proper NOIDTR that the Government issued on May 13, 2019, because Defendants only produced and served that order by violating a host of Petitioner's Constitutional rights. Therefore, the Court may invalidate or suppress that order, similar to how the exclusionary rule is used to set aside evidence attained through egregious Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Agencies Repent for Violating their own Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court begins by assessing the consequences of agency violations of their own regulations. In\n   <em>\n    Montilla v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that agency acts that violate their own regulations must be set aside, especially when those regulations implicate constitutional or due process concerns, or \"where the violated agency regulation governs individual interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Montilla v.

In\n   <em>\n    Montilla\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that where an immigration judge had not properly appraised the alien of his right to have counsel, which was a constitutional right and controlling rule on the agency, the only appropriate remedy was for the district court to\n   <em>\n    reverse the entire hearing\n   </em>\n   , \"irrespective of whether a new hearing would produce the same result\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541822\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/162/#p170\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541822\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/162/#p170\">\n    at 167-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sessions\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit suppressed evidence that the Government attained to deport aliens, where the government search violated fundamental Fourth Amendment rights by being conducted without: a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517806\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/114/\">\n    897 F.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasizing that the Constitution protects both citizens and non-citizens from Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations.). Indeed, the Second Circuit has long held that evidence attained by the Government by violating constitutional rights of aliens may be suppressed. In\n   <em>\n    Rajah v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit also explained that, in immigration proceedings, suppressing evidence is allowed where there has been an egregious violation of the Fourth or Fifth Amendment that is \"fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842431\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/427/#p441\">\n    544 F.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (2d Cir. 2008). There, the Court gave examples of the types unconstitutional violations, for example: \"government agents may not stop a person for questioning regarding his citizenship status without a reasonable suspicion of alienage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842431\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/427/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842431\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/427/#p441\">\n    at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court was unwilling to undo the BIA's acts, underscoring that the difference between its decision and the one in\n   <em>\n    Montilla\n   </em>\n   was that, in\n   <em>\n    Montilla\n   </em>\n   , unlike the instant case, the agency violated a rule directly implicating the\n   alien's fundamental Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 518,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p516\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This reasoning also drove the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

DHS Violated its Own Constitutionally-Necessary Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Here, as the Court already discussed, Defendants violated their own regulations, which are tethered to fundamental constitutional rights in multiple ways. First, the Petitioner was given no written notice, as the agency regulations explicitly require, when he was arrested and detained. Thus, he was completely unable to meaningfully challenge the initial basis for his confinement and was deprived of adequate procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Second, Petitioner was then detained for four additional months, with no indication that the Government had any intention of curing Petitioner's original constitutional deprivation of baseless confinement. This resulted in a violation of Petitioner's substantive due process rights because he suffered unconstitutional confinement for four months. Indeed, in another recent immigration\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   decision from this Court, the late Judge Sweet held that where a non-citizen alien had been deprived of meaningful procedural due process and was therefore confined for 200 days unnecessarily, he was also deprived of his substantive due process rights.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Although, here, Petitioner's detention was about half as long as the alien's in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the Show Cause hearing reflected that the Government had no intention to independently cure Petitioner's constitutional infringements, as they only produced written notice on the day that Petitioner filed his Order to Show Cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Third, the Government's attempt to provide belated written notice still violated agency regulations and Section 248.1, which together require a host of procedural requirements at the time of detention. Thus, if the Government claims that they properly detained Petitioner when they served him with a new piece of paper, he should have received the full panoply of procedural safeguards that the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda v.

Moreover, the Government still ignored the majority of the statute's concomitant procedural safeguards. For example, Plaintiff was not immediately referred to a new asylum officer for a hearing based on his fear of persecution, and he was not given a new bond hearing. Quite the opposite. Because Petitioner was already detained, he was unable to appear at his first bond hearing and was also disallowed by ICE to travel and appear for his withdrawal-only hearing, resulting in a botched effort to set up the hearing via video conference technology at Essex Correctional Facility and an adjournment of Petitioner's entire hearing for another six weeks due to the dysfunctional technology and backlog.

The only effective remedy is to order that Plaintiff be released forthwith...\"). Defendants, naturally, disagree.

(Gov. Mem. at 7.) It again relies on\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda\n   </em>\n   to essentially argue that if the lack of process would not be outcome-determinative, then there is no cognizable harm for the court to remedy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Petitioner, however, points out why the lack of process and procedural safeguards did have a prejudicial effect on Plaintiff and could have been outcome-determinative.

First, the Government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda\n   </em>\n   again distorts what the case actually held. The discussion about cognizable harm appeared only at the very end of the decision, when the Second Circuit explained why it could not collaterally review and vacate the petitioner's\n   <em>\n    underlying removal order\n   </em>\n   , over which it did not have appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Villeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n    531 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit explained that because Plaintiff had the ability to directly appeal his original deportation proceeding to the BIA, which he had voluntarily foregone, that order became valid final order, for which Congress did not provide a door to collateral review. Thus, Plaintiff's lack of due process-insofar as not having a hearing pursuant to the new reinstatement amendment-would have no cognizable effect on the Court's inability to review the underlying removal order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869301\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/141/#p149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   That is entirely different from the instant scenario. First, Petitioner has not asked this Court to collaterally review his underlying removal order, and indicates that he is contesting that separately through the proper direct appeals channels. Second, Petitioner's argument is that if he had been served with adequate timely notice and been able to promptly contest the basis for his detention, he may have been released by now and not had to endure continued unlawful incarceration, which itself is an irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, courts recognize the irreparable harms that stem from being unlawfully separated from family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Paul O'Dwyern Dec., ECF No. 18-1, Ex. A (letter from daughter reflecting deep remorse); Ex.

E (letters from New Paltz Town Council and Village Board, New Paltz Central School District, St. Joseph's Church, our Lady of Fatima Church, and Family of New Paltz Crisis and Hotline Center, reflecting how many jobs, school events, and community events Petitioner was supporting); Ex. F (letters from friends, neighbors, and local businesses reflecting how many less fortunate communities he was supporting); Ex. G (media articles reflecting his family's suffering and protests on the streets)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government's seemingly baseless argument that Petitioner has not shown cognizable harm from the lack of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Immediate and Unconditional Release is the Warranted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   This brings the Court to its last point on this matter-which is at the heart of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   relief-and that is fashioning the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Petitioner argues that \"a four-month long unlawful detention without issuance of any legal process clearly constitutes a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights,\" and \"[t]he only effective remedy is to order that Plaintiff be released forthwith\n   and that he remain released from custody during the pendency of his U visa petition and his withholding-only proceedings.\" (Pet. Mem. at 10.) He adds that Defendants may \"retain the ability to petition this Court for a change in any order should any of the relevant facts change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants, of course, object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court agrees with Petitioner. This is a rare instance in which there is no appropriate remedy to fix the egregious violations of Petitioner's fundamental rights other than for the Court to issue his immediate release from custody. The Court notes, again, that because it suppressed the May 13, 2019 reinstatement order, and finds that there really has only been one ongoing unconstitutional detention,\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   is already the most appropriate relief for this classic wrong.\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

Between the July 2014 defective reinstatement order and the two orders the Government attempted to issue in the last six months, the Government has repeatedly failed in providing Petitioner with adequate written notice and process. It will not be allowed to flout another botched effort, at the risk of again unnecessarily depriving a person, residing within the United States of their liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The writ shall issue.

Similar equitable relief has been provided when liberty interests were infringed in the criminal law context. For example, many years ago, in\n   <em>\n    Berger v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reviewed the case of a criminal defendant who was convicted of being part of a conspiracy.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    295 U.S. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    55 S.

On reviewing the conviction record, the Court noticed a host of transgressions taken by the government at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    55 S.

(\"the United States prosecuting attorney overstepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense...\"). Based on how tainted the process was, the Supreme Court reversed the entire judgment of the lower courts and ordered a new trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    55 S.

(\"The true inquiry, therefore, is not whether there has been a variance in proof, but whether there has been such variance as to 'affect the substantial rights' of the accused.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Here too, based on a review of the record and the Show Cause Hearing, the Court finds the Government's impropriety, in arresting and detaining Petitioner, too pervasive for the Court to deem any part of the process proper. Accordingly, as the Supreme Court stated \"[i]n these circumstances prejudice to the cause of the accused is so highly probable\" that its \"cumulative effect ... cannot be disregarded as inconsequential.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    295 U.S. at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333750\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/78/\">\n    55 S.Ct. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   As Petitioner's arrest and detention were blatantly unlawful from the start, the only commensurate and appropriate equitable remedy to even partially restore Plaintiff is to immediate release him and enjoin the Government from further similar transgressions.

Ours is not one in which a Government may breach with impunity. Ours is not one in which rights may be provided retroactively. Ours is not one in which due process may be glued together from broken pieces and be titled, \"A Justice Collage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   No relief short of Petitioner's release will remedy his wrong. The Constitution does not permit the United States Government to target people on the streets, arrest them without serving any papers, deny them meaningful due process, and detain them for arbitrary or indefinite periods of time while they engage in phishing expeditions to justify the arrests. That would turn the Constitution on its head and is precisely why the Fifth Amendment exists. No one is to be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process, lest the innocent suffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, Petitioner's Motion for a Writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   is GRANTED. The Government is hereby ORDERED TO RELEASE the Petitioner, Luis Martinez, from the custody of ICE within five days of receiving this order and to show this Court proof of such release on the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Government is ENJOINED from taking any actions to prevent Petitioner's release from physical custody based on the outcome of the instant action. The Government is further ENJOINED from attempting to detain Petitioner, while the outcome of his immigration proceedings are pending, so long as he is ably cooperating and participating in his proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Should Plaintiff receive a final order, reflecting that he is being deported immediately, or if any other relevant facts change, parties may petition this Court for a change in this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
