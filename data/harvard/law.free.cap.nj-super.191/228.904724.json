Appellant testified at length as did a friend of hers. The Bergen County Welfare Board was actively present and participated but, significantly enough, produced no witnesses or evidence Other than to undertake examination of Mrs. Simone. The ease for the Board was succinctly and forthrightly stated by counsel for the Board at the conclusion of Mrs. Simone\u2019s testimony. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">Mr. Simone lives at 438 Grove Street. That is what we\u2019re basing our case on. The lack of parental deprivation. Continued absence of the parent from the home constitutes deprivation of parental support or care. Judge, our case is ipso facto the fact that he lives in the same building with her is by its very nature, uh, a lack of deprivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">The uncontroverted testimony of Mrs. Simone reported that she and Mr. Simone were separated, but not divorced because \u201cI don\u2019t have any time,\u201d and \u201cHe has no money\u201d; that \u201cHe left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>me\u201d; that \u201cwe don\u2019t live together\u201d; that while Mr. Simone lives \u201cin the same building,\u201d he never sees the children and never visits the home; that this \u201cbuilding\u201d is in reality a five-family house, and that Mr. Simone lives with his mother and father on a floor above that on which she lives with the children. It would also appear without contradiction that after the separation, Mr. Simone left the premises entirely, \u201cliving with a friend someplace,\u201d and that when he returned to the premises he did not move back in with appellant nor has he lived there at any time \u201csince the first time he left.\u201d None of his clothes remain in Mrs. Simone\u2019s apartment, he never takes the children to school, he furnishes neither Mrs. Simone nor any of the children \u201cclothing or shoes or food or candy or pocket money.\u201d There is evidence from which it can be most reasonably inferred that an attempt at reconciliation by Mrs. Simone on an earlier separation failed, in part at least, because Mrs. Simone did not \u201cwant a beating every time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Inquiry of Mrs. Simone by counsel for the Board (Mr. Williams) appears instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Q Have you asked Mr. Simone to pay attention to the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">MR. SEMEL [counsel for Mrs. Simone]: I object. That\u2019s not part of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">MR. WILLIAMS: All right. He asked the question has he paid any attention to the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">A No, he left me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">Q Mrs. Simone, have you asked him to pay attention to the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsL\">A No. Cause I\u2019ve been looking for rooms, but they want one month\u2019s security, some of them want real estate fees. It\u2019s hard for me to move. So, the landlord is trying to buy another house. She said the best she can do is give me the rooms over there, but right now the interest rate is too high and she can\u2019t. So I have to stick it out there. So, I go by my mother\u2019s as much as I can because there\u2019s too much trouble over there and now I have trouble with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">The administrative law judge reversed the Board, concluding that \u201cpursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d), that petitioner\u2019s spouse is absent from the home and, therefore, the family continues to have eligibility for AFDC and FS [food stamps] based on deprivation of parental support and care.\u201d This conclusion was based on the following express findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>1. Petitioner lives_ in an apartment in the same five-family building in which her spouse\u2019s parents live.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">2. Petitioner\u2019s spouse is currently living in his parents\u2019 apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">3. Evidence presented by the agency is not sufficient to establish that petitioner\u2019s spouse is living in .petitioner\u2019s home or that petitioner\u2019s spouse is functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance for the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Following the filing of exceptions by both parties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Director of the Division of Public Welfare disagreed with the administrative law judge and affirmed the Board. He did this first by a \u201cfinal decision\u201d in which he found that \u201cthe father is a resident of the same dwelling unit as the eligible unit\u201d and rejected the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s assertion that the father provides no financial support or has no contact with the eligible unit\u201d on the basis that this \u201cis not evidence of continued absence within the meaning of the regulation.\u201d A telephone call from counsel for Mrs. Simone brought an acknowledgment that the \u201cfinal decision is defective and requires amendment and reissuance.\u201d An \u201camended decision\u201d eventuated. In this the director recognized, implicitly at least, that Mr. Simone did not live with Mrs. Simone and that, consistently with Mrs. Simone\u2019s testimony, she \u201cresides in a multi-family building which is also the residence of her spouse.\u201d In apparent contravention of the findings of the administrative law judge, who had an opportunity to see and hear Mrs. Simone during her testimony, the director concluded, \u201cThe petitioner\u2019s contention regarding absence of contact between the father and the eligible unit is not accepted as credible and the assertion that her spouse provides no .financial support is not evidence of deprivation within the meaning of the regulation.\u201d We are satisfied that the director erred in this determination and so we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Although we view the matter as principally one of a determination of fact, we are also convinced that the director was in error in his interpretation of that which constitutes a \u201cdeprivation of parental support or care,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d), sufficient to warrant eligibility for the benefits. The director believed eligibility to be determined in this respect on the basis of \u201cwhether or not a parent has <em>opportunity </em>to exercise parental responsibility irrespective of the parent\u2019s physical presence in the home.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Such a broad definition of the absence of deprivation flies in the face of the precise language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-2.7(d) which expressly directs that continued absence of the parent from the home constitutes deprivation of parental support or care, without any qualification respecting the opportunity of that parent to exercise responsibility regardless of the absence. The regulation then goes on to define what constitutes continued absence. It does this in terms of such an absence as \u201cinterrupts or terminates the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes the parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The question thus becomes a factual one of whether Mr. Simone\u2019s conceded absence from the apartment in which Mrs. Simone lives with the children has been such that it has interrupted or terminated Mr. Simone\u2019s functioning as that function is described in the regulation. It is to be observed that this regulation may explicate but is not at all inconsistent with 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 606(a)(1) or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-l(c)(l), each of which merely speaks in terms of \u201ccontinued absence from the home,\u201d in defining the dependent child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>It appears crystal clear that whatever purpose it may serve in helping determine the factual issues appropriate to the regulation, the opportunity of an absent parent to exercise parental responsibility will not by itself defeat eligibility. The critical fact question is whether the absence \u201cinterrupts or terminates the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes the parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child.\u201d It is the resolution of this factual issue in the circumstances before us which is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">With respect to the \u201camended decision\u201d here under review, we note at the outset that one and only one finding of fact appears in the determination, and that is that the unemployed petitioner resides in a multifamily building which is also the residence of her spouse, the father of two of the children. Beyond this we have nothing at all by way of findings of fact. We have only the conclusion of the director that the petitioner was incredible in respect of the fact as to absence of contact and irrelevantly assertive in the area of the absence of financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>support. Thus we have no way to judge the soundness of the determination by the director that petitioner fabricated nor to measure the basis for his necessarily implied conclusion that the absence of Mr. Simone did not in fact interrupt or terminate \u201cthe parent\u2019s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance for the child,\u201d or preclude \u201cthe parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child.\u201d If there were nothing more to the case than this, we would remand for findings of fact so we could measure the quality of the determination in terms of freedom from arbitrariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">However, the record persuades us that such a remand is not necessary. We find no basis, other than speculation that proximity produces providing, to conclude that the uncontroverted testimony of Mrs. Simone is in fact a fabrication. In fact, we are satisfied to the contrary. Our conviction, apparently not shared by the director, that the written record has an undeniable ring of truth about it is buttressed by the more important consideration that the administrative law judge, who apparently felt as we do, had the opportunity to see and listen to Mrs. Simone.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Also of substantial significance is the fact that of the agencies in this matter responsible for the proper distribution of these public funds none believed it necessary to produce Mr. Simone in order to ascertain the truth of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">All of this considered, it appears clearly that the only basis upon which the determination of the director can be sustained requires recognition of a conclusive presumption that residence in the same building, although in a different apartment, negates any interruption or termination of the parent\u2019s functioning as a provider. We are unwilling to indulge such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The determination of the director is reversed and the determination of the administrative law judge is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> Counsel for Mrs. Simone did not, of course, challenge the result. Rather he excepted on the basis of his belief that \u201cthe decision in this matter does not go far enough in reporting and evaluating the action taken by the Bergen County Welfare Board.\u201d He concluded his exceptions by asserting his conviction that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s conduct in this case is reprehensible, and should be so categorized in the decision resulting from its action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> The position of the federal authorities on the matter is informative. They do not even require an absence of contacts for a finding of \u201ccontinued absence.\u201d The Attorney General, candidly and commendably, has provided us with an informational letter from the Assistant Regional Commissioner for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Family Assistance of the Social Security Administration in the United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services. It reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">In response to your request for an interpretation of 45 CFR 233.-90(c)(l)(iii), I am forwarding a copy of a memorandum to the Regional Commissioner, Region X, Seattle, which deals with the general issue of deprivation by reason of continued absence. I think that this will explain our present position on the question. It does not specifically address your question on \u201cfrequent visitation\u201d by a parent who does not live in the home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">As the memorandum notes, the regulation does not require a total cessation of the parent\u2019s contact with his/her children for a finding of \u201ccontinued absence.\u201d Therefore frequent visits, in and of themselves, do not negate a finding of deprivation by reason of absence. The criterion is whether the absence of the parent interrupts his/her functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care or guidance and whether the duration of absence precludes the parent\u2019s performance of his/her function in planning for the present support or care of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
