Colquhoun (Colquhoun) and the firm in which he is a member from representing plaintiff Frederic S. Gray (Gray) in this matter. Commercial Union contends that Colquhoun is barred from representing Gray by <em>DR </em>4-101 and <em>DR </em>5-105 of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association, operative in New Jersey by incorporation into our court rules. <em>See R. </em>1:14. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Colquhoun, a member of the New Jersey bar, was retained and employed by Commercial Union from 1961 through the time of this matter. With one exception, each retention and employment involved defending Commercial Union\u2019s insureds in personal injury litigation. The one exception was a case in which Colquhoun represented Commercial Union directly in a lawsuit against another insurance company, which had sought to hold Commercial Union liable as an excess insurer. The parties dispute the extent of Colquhoun\u2019s access to Commercial Union\u2019s confidences during this period. Commercial Union\u2019s assistant house counsel maintains that Colquhoun worked regularly with company officials in its West Orange and Livingston, New Jersey offices. It is asserted that in this position Colquhoun \u201cwas privy to confidential and proprietary information of [Commercial Union], including its claims and litigation philosophy and its methods and procedures in handling and defending claims and litigation, and had access to individuals and information regarding the administration of various of defendant\u2019s business operations.\u201d Colquhoun argues to the contrary that he \u201cwas never made privy to any confidential or proprietary information of (Commercial Union),\u201d he was \u201cunaware that they had a claim or litigation philosophy,\u201d and that he did not receive any information \u201cregarding the administration of various of defendant\u2019s business operations.\u201d In the late 1970\u2019s Commercial Union stopped assigning cases to Colquhoun. However, Colquhoun retained those cases still pending and was paid legal fees through 1982 by Commercial Union. At the time of the ruling here under review, Colquhoun was retained by Commercial Union only in connection with the defense of one personal injury suit which apparently is still pending on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In this action Gray, the New Jersey regional claims manager, charges that Commercial Union breached his contract of employment by engaging in a \u201cplanned and settled scheme\u201d to deprive him and other senior employees of their future and benefits and by discharging him without cause. Gray also charges that after Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation, Ltd. merged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Commercial Union, thereafter dominating the management of the merged companies, Commercial Union entered into a program of discrimination against all pre-merger Commercial Union employees, including him. Specifically, Gray maintains that by implementing various corporate policies relating to such areas as personal reductions, unwarranted increases in casualty reserves and demand for dismissal of persons approaching retirement age, Commercial Union embarked upon \u201ca scheme and plan to render effective claims handling impossible [which] was utilized against original [Commercial Union] personnel to effect their elimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The pivotal issue posed on this appeal is under what circumstances a lawyer may represent a client whose interest is adverse to a party whom the lawyer represented in a prior litigation. The governing principles are set forth in <em>DR </em>4-101, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Preservation of Confidences and Secrets of a Client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">(A) \u201cConfidence\u201d refers to information protected by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law, and \u201csecret\u201d refers to other information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">(B) Except as permitted by DR 4-101(C), a lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">(1) Reveal a confidence or secret of his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">(2) Use a confidence or secret of his client to the disadvantage of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">(3) Use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage of himself or of a third person, unless the client consents after full disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">(C) A lawyer may reveal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">(1) Confidences or secrets with the consent of the client or clients affected, but only after a full disclosure to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">(2) Confidences or secrets when permitted under Disciplinary Rules or required by law or court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">(3) The intention of his client to commit a crime and the information necessary to prevent the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-16\">(4) Confidences or secrets necessary to establish or collect his fee or to defend himself or his employees or associates against an accusation of wrongful conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">(D) A lawyer shall exercise reasonable care to prevent his employees, associates, and others whose services are utilized by him from disclosing or using confidences or secrets of a client, except that a lawyer may reveal the information allowed by DR 4r-101(C) through an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The application of <em>DR </em>4-101 to a lawyer whose client brings an action against a former client is discussed in the exhaustive and scholarly opinion in <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>460, 472-474 (1980). The court summarized its holding therein by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">[W]hen a motion to disqualify an attorney is instituted by his former client to enforce the principles that an attorney must protect the confidences of a client and avoid even the appearance of impropriety, the former client must establish the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">(1) a prior attorney-client relationship between the former client and the attorney sought to be disqualified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">(2) a substantial relationship or a reasonable perception, from the public\u2019s perspective, of a substantial relationship between the subject matter of the present suit and that of cases worked on during the former representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">(3) access to relevant confidences of the former client, which may be proven by other than direct evidence, leading to a conclusive presumption of the attorney\u2019s knowledge of such confidences, [at 474].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The court in <em>Reardon </em>emphasized that \u201c[i]f there be any doubt as to the propriety of an attorney\u2019s representation of a client, such doubt must be resolved in favor of disqualification.\u201d At 471. <em>See In re Opinion No. 415, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>318, 324 (1979); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>28, 30 (1975); <em>State v. Galati, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>572, 576-577 (1974). This principle conforms to <em>DR </em>9-101, which cautions a lawyer to avoid \u201ceven the appearance of professional impropriety.\u201d The reason for this rule is explained in the oft-cited case of <em>Emle Industries, Inc. v. Patentex, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 562, 570-571 (2 Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Applying the foregoing standards here, it is evident that neither Colquhoun nor any members of the firm in which he is a member can properly represent Gray in this action against Commercial Union. First, there is no dispute that Colquhoun maintained an attorney-client relationship with Commercial Union. Colquhoun\u2019s argument, that he did not have a \u201ctrue\u201d attorney-client relationship with Commercial Union because his professional duty ran to the latter\u2019s insureds and not the insurer itself cannot withstand scrutiny. Concededly, it can be said that \u201c[t]hese interrelationships among a liability insurer, its insured, and the attorney chosen by the insurer to represent the insured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>are <em>sui generis. </em>The canons and disciplinary rules do not address themselves frankly and explicitly to this special set of relationships, and there is awkwardness in attempts to apply the canons and rules.\u201d <em>Moritz v. Medical Protective Co., </em>428 <em>F.Supp. </em>865, 872 (W.D.Wis.1977), quoted in American Bar Foundation, <em>Annotated Code of Professional Responsibility </em>169 (1979). Nonetheless, this ambiguity exists only as to instances of a conflict of interest between the insurer and the insured, which raise the question of the lawyer\u2019s primary allegiance. There is no dispute that as a fundamental proposition a defense lawyer is counsel to both the insurer and the insured. <em>See Lieberman v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>325, 338 (1980); <em>Bartels v. Romano, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23, 29 (App.Div.1979); <em>N.J. Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics, Opinions </em>165, 166. He owes to each a duty to preserve the confidences and secrets imparted to him during the course of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Secondly, there is, or at the very least, there appears to be a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d between the subject matter of the present action and the subject matter of the cases previously handled by Colquhoun for Commercial Union. Obviously, the legal issues in the present employment contract case are not precisely the same legal issues in the personal injury cases Colquhoun defended. However, the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d standard should not be read in a mechanical or overly technical manner. As pointed out in <em>Reardon, </em>the requirement of substantial relationship of issues is satisfied where the \u201cadversity between the interests of the attorney\u2019s former and present clients ... has created a climate for disclosure of relevant confidential information.\u201d <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., supra </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 472 <em>(quoting </em>Note, \u201cAttorney\u2019s Conflict of Interests: Representation of Interest Adverse to That of Former Client,\u201d 55 <em>B.U.L.Rev. </em>61, 73 (1975). Therefore, under <em>Reardon, </em>if the prior representation was of a type that would give the appearance that the lawyer learned and has reason to disclose his former client\u2019s confidences, \u201cthe lack of identity between the cases will not pose a barrier to disqualification.\u201d <em>Ibid. (citing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Motor Mart Inc. v. Saab Motors, Inc., </em>359 <em>F.Supp. </em>156, 158 (S.D.N.Y.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It may not be seriously disputed that as a result of his 20 years as one of Commercial Union\u2019s lawyers, Colquhoun has obtained confidential information and possesses knowledge of certain internal policies of Commercial Union that he will be able to use against it in the Gray litigation. According to Gray\u2019s complaint, (1) Commercial Union\u2019s management opposed certain changes he made in the operation of the New Jersey claims department and retaliated by forcing him out of his job and (2) Commercial Union determined to drive out all pre-merger personnel \u201cby making policies of personnel reduction [and] unwarranted increases in casualty reserves.\u201d Both of these charges rest upon factual allegations regarding the operation of Commercial Union\u2019s New Jersey claims department. It is exactly these facts to which Colquhoun was privy during his 20 years of defending claims for Commercial Union. As one of Commercial Union\u2019s New Jersey counsel, it is difficult to conceive that Colquhoun would not have become familiar with the structure, operation and policies of its claims department. To the contrary, Commercial Union has established that as pointed out above, \u201cColquhoun was privy to confidential and proprietary information of [Commercial Union], including its claims and litigation philosophy and its methods and procedure in handling of defending claims and litigation, and had access to individuals and information regarding the administration of various of [Commercial Union\u2019s] business operations.\u201d Furthermore, Colquhoun\u2019s position as one of Commercial Union\u2019s defense lawyers surely involved recommending settlement limits and negotiating settlements. Colquhoun thus necessarily became familiar with \u201csuch useful information as the strengths and weaknesses of this corporate client\u2019s decision makers [and] their attitude towards settlement.\u201d <em>See Reardon, supra </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 476. Although this general information may not be specifically relevant to the merits of the Gray-Commercial Union dispute, it consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tutes secrets or confidences of the former client that could be used against it to its substantial disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The third and final requirement established by the <em>Rear-don </em>court\u2014that the lawyer in fact had access to the confidences of his former client during the time he represented them\u2014clearly has been met in this case. Colquhoun\u2019s argument that he did not have access to relevant information such as management\u2019s employment practices towards former employees on policies relating to personnel reduction, casualty reserves and retirement does not provide a valid basis to permit him to continue to represent Gray in this matter. When access to secrets and confidential information exists, as it did here, the court will presume that the lawyer in fact learned such secrets and confidences, notwithstanding the lawyer\u2019s protest to the contrary. <em>See Id. </em>at 473. In this regard, we repeat what our Supreme Court stated in <em>In re Braun, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>16 (1967), concerning the content of former Canon 6 (now included in <em>DR </em>5-101 and <em>DR </em>5-105) and former Canon 37 (now included in <em>DR </em>4-101(B)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">The factual contention of respondent that no actual confidence was received is without merit even if true. The intent of <em>Canons </em>6 and 37 is violated whenever the conduct of an attorney raises the possibility that he has or may use the confidences of one client for the benefit of another, [at 18; <em>see also In re Blatt, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>522, 524 (1964)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We hold therefore that Colquhoun and the law firm of which he is a member are disqualified from representing Gray in this matter by virtue of the fact that such representation constitutes a violation of <em>DR </em>4-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Beyond this, there is another reason here to disqualify Colquhoun and his law firm. It is unethical for a lawyer to represent a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought against a party whom the lawyer represents on other matters, even if the two representations are unrelated. <em>DR </em>5-105 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">Refusing to Accept or Continue Employment if the Interests of Another Client May Impair the Independent Professional Judgment of the Lawyer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9P\">(A) A lawyer shall decline proffered employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>adversely affected by the acceptance of the proffered employment, except to the extent permitted under DR 5-105(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">(B) A lawyer shall not continue multiple employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by his representation of another client, except to the extent permitted under DR 5\u2014105(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">(C) In situations covered by DR 5~105(A) and (B) except as prohibited by rule, opinion, directive, or statute, a lawyer may represent multiple clients if he believes that he can adequately represent the interests of each and if each consents to the representation after full disclosure of the facts and of the possible effect of such representation on the exercise of his independent professional judgment on behalf of each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(D) If a lawyer is required to decline employment or to withdraw from employment under DR 5-105, no partner or associate of his or his firm may accept or continue such employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As was explained by our Supreme Court in <em>In re Dolan, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1978),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">The sense of our rules is that an attorney owes complete and undivided loyalty to the client who has retained him. The attorney should be able to advise the client in such a way as to protect the client\u2019s interests, utilizing his professional training, ability and judgment to the utmost. Consequently, if any conflicting interest could arise which would stand in the way of that kind of unstinting zeal, then the client must be so informed and the attorney may continue his limited representation only with the client\u2019s informed consent, [at 9]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics has held consistently that a lawyer may not represent the adversary of one of his present clients. In <em>Opinion </em>282, 97 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>362 (1974), the lawyer was asked to represent a woman in a slander action while representing the husband of the accused slanderer in a workers\u2019 compensation case. In recommending that the attorney withdraw from further representation of the plaintiff in the slander case, the committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEx\">In the present inquiry both cases are still pending. The public would not understand how an attorney can sue a woman and at the same time represent the woman\u2019s husband in another proceeding. The attorney\u2019s action would be viewed with suspicion. Attorneys must avoid the appearance of wrongdoing. It is the appearance of a conflict which renders the representation of the wife in the slander action objectionable. Where a doubt exists as to the propriety of representing plaintiff-wife under these circumstances, the doubt should be resolved against accepting the retainer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Similarly, in <em>Opinion </em>301, 98 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>209 (1975), the defense lawyer in a forgery action was placed in the position of having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to file a third-party complaint against a bank that his former firm had represented and that he continued to represent on a few unrelated matters. The committee found this to be unethical, stating flatly that \u201ca lawyer should not take a case against his own client,\u201d even with full disclosure and full consent. As set forth therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Accordingly, it is our opinion that it is not professionally advisable for the inquirer to represent the same client both as advocate and adversary even if the cases are unrelated, and even if there are full disclosure and full consent. We feel that if the depository bank is brought into the proceedings as a third-party defendant a definite conflict of interest would be presented and that it would be inappropriate for the attorney to continue to represent the two clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">Based on all of the foregoing and following the same reasoning, we conclude that there is a conflict which requires counsel to arrange for a substitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Finally, we note the case of <em>International Business Machines Corp. v. Levin, </em>579 F.2d 271 (3 Cir.1978), which arose in District Court for the District of New Jersey. The law firm in that case sought to represent the plaintiff in a private antitrust lawsuit against I.B.M., which retained the firm in labor and other matters unrelated to the antitrust suit. Judge Meanor in the District Court disqualified the law firm from the antitrust case and the Court of Appeals affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">CBM argues that clauses (A) and (B) of <em>DR </em>5-105 are not applicable since no effect adverse to IBM resulted from CBM\u2019s concurrent representation of both IBM and the plaintiffs and no adverse effect on CBM\u2019s exercise of its independent professional judgment on behalf of IBM was likely to result from CBM\u2019s representation of these clients in two entirely unrelated areas. Since clauses (A) and (B) do not apply, CBM argues, the consent requirement of clause (C) of <em>DR </em>5-105 also is not applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">. We think that CBM takes too narrow a view of the meaning of the phrase \u201cadversely affected\u201d in clauses (A) and (B), and that a somewhat more generous interpretation is called for. The rule does not define the nature or extent of the adverse effect contemplated on the attorney\u2019s exercise of independent judgment. However, <em>DR </em>5-105(C) makes clear that situations entailing the likelihood of an adverse effect include circumstances in which such an effect may be minor permitting the performance of adequate services in spite of it. In those cases the multiple representation may take place if the attorney believes in good faith that he can adequately represent both clients and if the consent of the clients is obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">We think, however, that it is likely that some \u201cadverse effect\u201d on an attorney\u2019s exercise of his independent judgment on behalf of a client may result from the attorney\u2019s adversary posture toward that client in another legal matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>See </em>Cinema 5, <em>Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 1384, 1386-1387 (2 Cir.1976); <em>Grievance Committee of the Bar of Hartford County v. Rottner, </em>152 <em>Conn. </em>59, 65, 203 <em>A.2d </em>82, 84 (1964); Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, <em>Opinion No. 282, </em>97 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>362 (1974), and <em>Opinion No. 301, </em>98 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>209 (1975). For example, a possible effect on the quality of the attorney\u2019s services on behalf of the client being sued may be a diminution in the vigor of his representation of the client in the other matter. <em>See Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., supra </em>at 1387. A serious effect on the attorney-client relationship may follow if the client discovers from a source other than the attorney that he is being sued in a different matter by the attorney. The fact that a deleterious result cannot be identified subsequently as having actually occurred does not refute the existence of a likelihood of its occurrence, depending upon the facts and circumstances, at the time the decision was made to represent the client without having obtained his consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">The cases relied upon by CBM do not support its argument that the code rule can never be violated by concurrent representation of several clients absent a showing of a relationship in the subject matter of the multiple representation. Most of the cases cited by CBM concern instances where ethical improprieties were found and are, therefore, not authority here. In <em>Moritz v. Medical Protective Co., </em>428 F.Supp. 865 (W.D.Wis.1977), the challenge to multiple representation came from a former and not a current client. But as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated in <em>Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 <em>F.</em>2d 1384 (2 Cir.1976), in connection with the prosecution of a lawsuit by an attorney or his partner against an actively represented client as opposed to a former one, \u201cThe propriety of this conduct must be measured not so much against the similarities in litigation as against the duty of undivided loyalty which an attorney owes to each of his clients.\u201d 528 F.2d at 1386. The case of <em>City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., </em>440 <em>F.Supp. </em>193 (N.D.Ohio 1976), aff\u2019d 573 F.2d 1310 (6 Cir.1977), <em>cert. </em>denied, 435 <em>U.S. </em>996, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1648, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>85 (1978), also cited by CBM, involves a waiver of objections to an attorney\u2019s continuing representation of another client and is, therefore, also not apposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">An attorney must be cautious in this area and, if he is to adhere to the high standards of professional responsibility, he must resolve all doubts in favor of full disclosure to a client of the facts of the attorney\u2019s concurrent representation of another client in a lawsuit against him. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated, \u201cPutting it as mildly as we can, we think it would be questionable conduct for an attorney to participate in any lawsuit against his own client without the knowledge and consent of all concerned.\u201d <em>Cinema 5, Ltd. v. Cinerama, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 1384, 1386 (1976). [at 280],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Thus, it is clearly the rule that a lawyer may not represent the plaintiff in a lawsuit against another of his clients, which is precisely what Colquhoun here proposed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Finally, we deem it appropriate to repeat once more that when dealing with matters involving a claimed conflict of interest and breach of confidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">. ... a lawyer must avoid even the appearance of impropriety, <em>DR </em>9-101, to the end that the image of disinterested justice is not impoverished or tainted. Thus it is that sometimes an attorney, guiltless in any actual sense, nevertheless is required to stand aside for the sake of public confidence in the probity of the administration of justice. [State <em>v. Rizzo, supra </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 30].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the order under review and disqualify Colquhoun and the firm in which he is a member from representing Gray in this matter against Commercial Union. Moreover, we direct that none of Colquhoun\u2019s work product shall be turned over to succeeding counsel except that which is required to understand the status of the case, taking care not to reveal the Colquhoun firm\u2019s strategy, plans or work product. In order that plaintiff will not be harmed by the delay occasioned by this appeal and this ruling substitute counsel for plaintiff may apply to the trial court for such protective orders as may be necessary to extend the discovery period and, if necessary, to insure new counsel that he is not faced with an unduly early trial date. <em>See Reardon, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 478.
