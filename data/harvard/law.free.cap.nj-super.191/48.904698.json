Bulman </em>on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-13\"><em>Thomas E. Downs, </em>IV, Municipal Prosecutor, City of South Amboy, argued the cause for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b77-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b77-15\">BRODY, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">Defendant appeals its conviction under an ordinance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for polluting the air of South Amboy. A $500 fine was imposed. It contends that the ordinance definition of \u201cair pollution\u201d is unconstitutionally vague and that the penalty provision of the ordinance is void because it establishes a minimum fine contrary to the limited statutory authority given municipalities to adopt penal ordinances. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">The facts are not now disputed. Defendant was using an unenclosed conveyor to transfer coal from a railroad coal car to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>an open area in its yard. The operation generated a cloud of coal dust which settled on the neighborhood. Some of the dust was collected in a bag and received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Defendant was charged with violating that section of the ordinance prohibiting any person from causing substances \u201cto be emitted into the open air ... in such quantities as shall result in air pollution.\u201d \u201cAir pollution\u201d is defined in the ordinance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">The presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more air contaminants in such quantities and duration as are, or tend to be, injurious to human health or welfare, to animal or plant life, or to property, or would unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property throughout the City as shall be affected thereby, and excludes all aspects of employer-employee relationship as to health and safety hazards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Virtually the same definition appears in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-2 of the Air Pollution Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-1 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The predecessor of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-2 (which was no more specific than the current version) was considered by this court \u201ca sufficient guide and standard\u201d to inform the public as to what conduct \u201cwould be considered proscribed activity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 383-385 (App.Div.1968), aff\u2019d o.b. 53 <em>N.J. </em>248 (1969). Furthermore, the record shows that harm from the airborne and settled particles of coal dust was direct and palpable unlike the uncertain harm from smoke emissions which depends in part on their density.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Defendant\u2019s second point is more troublesome. The penalty provision of the ordinance (\u00a7 10.1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this Code, or who shall fail to comply therewith or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of no more than $500.00, nor less than $5.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Our courts have consistently held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:49-5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibits municipalities from enacting minimum fines which would deprive judges of their statutory discretion to impose \u201cany fine.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hatco Chemical Co., </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 240-242, (App.Div.1967); <em>Studerus Oil Co., Inc. v. Jersey City, </em>128 <em>N.J.L. </em>286, 292 (Sup.Ct.1942); <em>Pfister Chemical Co., Inc. v. Romano, </em>15 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>71, 72, 188 <em>A. </em>727, 728 (Sup.Ct.1937); see <em>Massinger v. Millville, </em>63 <em>N.J.L. </em>123, 126 (Sup.Ct.1899). Defendant argues that since the $5 minimum fine is invalid, the entire penalty clause is void and the ordinance is therefore unenforceable. <em>See Verona v. Shalit, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>20, 24-25 (App.Div.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In the trial court, Judge Breitkopf held that the invalid part of the ordinance providing for a minimum fine is severable and therefore its invalidity does not require striking down the whole ordinance. We agree. The ordinance contains the following provision (\u00a7 11.2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phase [sic], or portion of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid for any reason whatsoever, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof which shall remain in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Where an ordinance contains a severability clause, there is a rebuttable presumption of severability. <em>Helmsley v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>200, 237 (1978), app. dism. 440 <em>U.S. </em>978, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1782, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>237 (1979), opinion clarified 82 <em>N.J. </em>128 (1980). \u201cThe question of severability of the invalid provision is one both of legislative intent, [citations omitted] and of whether the remaining provisions are functionally self-sufficient as containing the essentials of a complete enactment [citation omitted].\u201d <em>Gross v. Allan, </em>37 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 269 (App.Div.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It is inconceivable that the South Amboy governing body would have preferred sacrificing its entire comprehensive antipollution code to losing the guarantee of a minimum $5 fine. Eliminating the minimum $5 fine does not affect the operation of the other ordinance provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Defendant contends that a severability provision cannot save an ordinance that imposes a penalty not authorized by statute, citing <em>Leland v. Commissioners, </em>42 <em>N.J.L. </em>375 (Sup.Ct.1880) and <em>State v. Laurel Mills Sewerage Corp., </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331 (App. Div.1957). These cases are distinguishable. Nothing in <em>Leland </em>suggests that the ordinance there contained a severability clause. In <em>Laurel Mills </em>the penalty clause suffered from two infirmities. It provided for a minimum fine of $10 and a maximum of $1,000 even though at the time the statute authorized a maximum of only $200. The court questioned \u201cwhether the ordinance penalty provision is not invalid for exceeding statutory authority, notwithstanding the penalty imposed was a fine of $200 and costs, the maximum allowed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:49-5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. Despite a severability clause in the ordinance, the court held that \u201c[t]he penalty provided in the ordinance, being. greater than is permitted by statute, is void.\u201d The opinion reproduces the ordinance, but makes no other reference to the minimum fine provision. It appears to us that the court was exclusively concerned with the excessive maximum fine feature of the ordinance, concluding that severance would leave the ordinance unenforceable because of the absence of any fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>maximum. We need not consider whether in such a case the statutory maximum may be read into the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Here, removal of the $5 minimum fine is barely perceptible. The remaining portion of the penalty clause is fully operable and conforms to statutory authority. The unlawful minimum fine provision of the ordinance is severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-18\"> South Amboy, N.J., Ordinance 892 (February 5, 1973) (Air Pollution Control Code).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>26:2C-22 expressly permits municipalities to adopt air pollution codes more stringent than the act, subject to the approval of the State Department of Health.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> Where the alleged pollution is smoke, the ordinance provides for the use of the Ringelmann Smoke Chart to determine if the emission is a violation. <em>See Board of Health of Weehawken Tp. v.
