We hold that separate trials are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Defendant was indicted by the Essex County Grand Jury for third degree burglary, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2 (Count One), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>second degree aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1 b(l) (Count Two) and first degree robbery, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (Count Three). Before trial, he served a notice of intention to rely on insanity defense and a notice of alibi. See <em>R. </em>3:11; <em>R. </em>3:12. The notice of alibi gave the names of two witnesses who were prepared to testify that they were with defendant at other locations at the time the crimes occurred. Defendant then filed a pretrial motion for a bifurcated trial of the two defenses. The motion to bifurcate was granted. We granted the State leave to appeal. We now reverse the order for bifurcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The trial judge mistakenly read <em>State </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72 (App.Div.1980), as requiring bifurcation. The defendant in <em>Khan </em>was accused of murder and possession of pistols without permits. His defense was self-defense. Although Khan was adjudged competent to stand trial, the trial judge, over Khan\u2019s objection, appointed a second attorney to present on Khan\u2019s behalf an insanity defense based on the unanimous medical opinion that Khan suffered from paranoid delusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\"><em>Khan </em>is to be distinguished from this case. In <em>Khan </em>the defendant\u2019s dilemma was imposed on him by the judge rather than as the result of his own tactical choices. Even though defendant can be compelled to make a hard tactical choice without violating his constitutional rights, <em>see State </em>v. <em>Forcella, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>263, 288-290 (1968), rev\u2019d other grounds <em>sub. nom. Funicello v. New Jersey, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>948, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2278, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>859 (1971); and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-10, the choice must be that of defendant rather than one imposed upon by him the court. Here, the hard choice is of defendant\u2019s own making. That choice may be a difficult one involving trial strategy as it does, but \u201c[t]he criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring \u2018the making of difficult judgments\u2019 as to which course to follow. <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>[759], at 769 [90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1441 at 1448], 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>[763], at 772.\u201d <em>McGautha v. California, </em>402 <em>U.S. </em>183, 213, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1454, 1470, 28 L.Ed.2d 711, 729 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>For a more exhaustive analysis of whether bifurcation is required when defendant raises inconsistent defenses, see D. Louisell &amp; G. Hazard, \u201cInsanity as a Defense: The Bifurcated Trial,\u201d 49 <em>Calif.L.Rev. </em>805 (1961); Note, \u201cDue Process and Bifurcated Trials: A Double-Edged Sword,\u201d 66 <em>Nw.U.L.Rev. </em>327 (1971); \u201cNecessity or Propriety of Bifurcated Criminal Trial on Issue of Insanity Defense,\u201d 1 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 884 (1980). The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that have ruled on the subject have concluded that bifurcated trials are not required when defendant creates the hard choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">A single trial is preferable because it conserves judicial resources and avoids the inherent unfairness of giving the accused two bites at the apple of acquittal. As was said in <em>State v. Levier, </em>226 <em>Kan. </em>461, 601 P.2d 1116, 1119 (1979), \u201cBy trying all issues together, time and expense to both parties is conserved, and the single jury is given the entire picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The order for bifurcation is therefore reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for a single trial on the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
