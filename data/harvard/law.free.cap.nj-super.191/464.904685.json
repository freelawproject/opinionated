On this appeal defendant first urges that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because his acts \u201cwere not the proximate cause of the death of the decedent,\u201d that \u201cthe actions of the decedent\u2019s family and the physician were the supervening cause of death\u201d and that \u201cthe decision to terminate the life of the victim herein was improper and illegal.\u201d These contentions were not advanced in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">The record shows that the victim left Cooper Hospital in Camden on the evening of February 20, 1981 after visiting a friend. As he was unlocking the door of his car parked on a nearby street, he was attacked by defendant and defendant\u2019s accomplices and was struck on the back of the head. He fell to the pavement where he lay bleeding while defendant removed his wallet and watch. Passersby called the police, who immediately removed the victim to Cooper Hospital, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Upon admission he was comatose, with both pupils dilated and fixed, without spontaneous respiration and with few reflexes. The admitting doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>testified that those signs \u201cindicated that the brain was inactive.\u201d The victim was intubated and a respirator was attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">A CAT scan showed massive contusions of the brain and a \u201csmall operation\u201d was done to \u201cput a monitor on his brain.\u201d Nevertheless, within a few hours the victim \u201cshowed a clinical picture which was consistent with brain death, there were no reflexes, no spontaneous activity, nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The victim\u2019s condition was closely monitored and \u201cabsolutely no change\u201d was noted. On February 23 and 24, brain-wave tests showed \u201cno electrical activity,\u201d which the doctor described as meaning that \u201cthe brain has reached a point of not being able to be reversed to a functional level.\u201d On February 24 the doctors discussed the victim\u2019s condition with the family and \u201cmade them aware that we had reached a point of no return.\u201d In agreement with the family the respirator was stopped and the victim expired within a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In this setting, the contention that defendant is not criminally responsible for the death of the victim is patently without merit. The \u201cbrain death\u201d suffered by the victim was death in fact and could have been so declared before the respirator was turned off. See <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>10, 28 <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Garger </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>922, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>319, 50 L.Ed.2d 289 (1976). See also <em>In re Conroy, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 466 (App.Div. 1983). The death resulted not from turning off the respirator, but from defendant\u2019s acts, which undeniably caused the victim\u2019s brain to die. Having caused \u201cbrain death,\u201d defendant was properly found criminally responsible for homicide. See <em>State v. Fierro, </em>124 <em>Ariz. </em>182, 603 P.2d 74 (1979); <em>People v. Mitchell, </em>132 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>389, 183 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>166 (1982); <em>Swafford v. State, </em>421 N.E.2d 596 (Ind.1981); <em>State v. Inger, </em>292 <em>N.W.2d </em>119 (Iowa 1980); <em>State v. Shaffer, </em>223 <em>Kan. </em>244, 574 P.2d 205 (1977); <em>Commonwealth v. Golston, 373 Mass. </em>249, 366 N.E.2d 744 (1977), <em>cert. </em>den. 434 <em>U.S. </em>1039, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>777, 54 L.Ed.2d 788 (1978); <em>People v. Vanderford, 77 Mich.App. </em>370, 258 <em>N.W.2d </em>502 (1977); <em>State v. Meints, </em>212 <em>Neb. </em>410, 322 <em>N.W.2d </em>809 (1982); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>56 <em>Ohio </em>St.2d 35, 381 N.E.2d 637 (1978); <em>Cranmore v. State, </em>85 Wis.2d 722, 271 <em>N.W.2d </em>402 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Defendant further contends that \u201cthe prosecutor was allowed to introduce improper, unfair and highly prejudicial evidence before the jury with regard to alleged past criminal conduct of the defendant,\u201d that his constitutional right to remain silent \u201cwas violated by the misconduct of the prosecutor,\u201d that the prosecutor \u201cexceeded the bounds of propriety in his summation\u201d and that trial counsel was ineffective. Our review of the record satisfies us that each of these contentions is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
