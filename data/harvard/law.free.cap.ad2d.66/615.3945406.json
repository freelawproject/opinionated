The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sums of $300,000 for past pain and suffering and $500,000 for future pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">A jury verdict may not be set aside as being against the weight of the evidence unless the jury could not have reached the verdict on any fair interpretation of the evidence <em>(see Landau v Rappaport, </em>306 AD2d 446 [2003]; <em>Nicastro v Park, </em>113 AD2d 129, 134 [1985]). \u201cMoreover, issues regarding the credibility of expert witnesses are peculiarly within the province of the jury to determine\u201d <em>(Landau v Rappaport, </em>306 AD2d 446, 446 [2003]). Here, it cannot be said that the evidence so preponderated in favor of the defendant that the jury could not have reached a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on any fair interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>evidence <em>(id.). </em>There is no basis in the record to disturb the jury\u2019s resolution of credibility issues in favor of the plaintiff <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">However, we agree with the defendant that the award of damages of the principal sums of $300,000 for past pain and suffering, and $500,000 for future pain and suffering, deviates from what would be reasonable compensation, and is excessive to the extent indicated herein <em>(see </em>CPLR 5501 [c]; <em>Miller v Weisel, </em>15 AD3d 458 [2005]; <em>Charles v Day, </em>289 AD2d 190 [2001]; <em>Adebowale v Charles Drew Family Health Care Ctr., </em>268 AD2d 542, 543 [2000]).
