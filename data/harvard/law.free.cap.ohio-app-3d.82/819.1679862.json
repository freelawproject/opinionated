Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed on October 15,1991. The trial court granted Pilar\u2019s motion and denied that of Nova and the bureau on December 10, 1991. Nova and the bureau timely appealed (case Nos. 63075 and 63063,. respectively), said appeals being consolidated for record, briefing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Nova and the bureau assign the following error for our review:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">Pilar worked in Nova\u2019s shipping and receiving department. He claimed that he received a work-related injury while playing football on March 10, 1989. The game occurred during a 3:00 p.m. rest break on a cement parking lot adjacent to Nova\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">The granting of summary judgment is only appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion which is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Toledo\u2019s Great E. Shoppers City, Inc. v. Abde\u2019s Black Angus Steak House No. III, Inc. </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 24 OBR 426, 428, 494 N.E.2d 1101, 1104; Civ.R. 56(C). An order granting summary judgment will, therefore, only be upheld where the record discloses no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 471, 364 N.E.2d 267, 273. In reviewing the granting of summary judgment, an appellate court must apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Pilar\u2019s injury, to be compensable, must have occurred \u201cin the course of, and arising out of\u201d his employment. R.C. 4123.01(C). The Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274, recognizing the conjunctive nature of the formula, found the \u201cin the course of\u201d prong to relate to the time, place and circumstances of the injury and the \u201carising out of\u201d prong as referring to a causal connection between the employment and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The court then articulated the following test to be used when determining a causal connection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201c \u2018Whether there is a sufficient \u201ccausal connection\u201d between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment to justify the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the- benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274, quoting <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">This court has previously acknowledged that authorized breaks in employment activity for rest and relaxation may fall within a claimant\u2019s course of employment. See <em>Dolby v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 68, 574 N.E.2d 570; <em>Primiano v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. </em>(Apr. 24, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50495, unreported, 1986 WL 4962. However, we noted that \u201cwhere an employee is injured during a personal relief break from work, a genuine issue of material fact may exist as to the sufficiency of the \u2018causal connection\u2019 between the employee\u2019s injury and his employment.\u201d <em>Dolby, supra, </em>at 70, 574 N.E.2d at 572. Here, we likewise find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Pilar\u2019s injuries were sustained in the course of and arising out of his employment. We thus reverse and remand this action to the trial court for a factual determination of the existence of a causal connection between Pilar\u2019s injury and his employment by analyzing the totality of the circumstances as set forth in <em>Fisher, Dolby, </em>and <em>Primiano.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b853-10\">Spellacy, P.J., Harper and Parrino, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Thomas J.
