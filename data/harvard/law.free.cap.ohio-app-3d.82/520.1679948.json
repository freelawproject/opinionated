(\u201cappellee\u201d). Nelson bought the car for his personal use. Prior to purchasing the car, Nelson spoke with Ron May, a salesman at Rose Chevrolet. May showed Nelson the 1989 Celebrity station wagon, which had approximately 14,500 miles on it when Nelson purchased it. Nelson\u2019s understanding was that the car was owned by Rose Chevrolet and had been driven by the wife of the owner of the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, Nelson went to change its oil and discovered that the car had been previously owned by Budget Rent-A-Car. Nelson then attempted, without success, to return the car to appellee; therefore, Nelson filed a complaint with the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">On April 30, 1991, the Attorney General of Ohio (\u201cappellant\u201d) filed a complaint in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas. In his complaint, appellant alleges violations by appellee of the Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. Chapter 1345. On October 3, 1991, appellant filed a motion to compel discovery with the trial court. Appellee filed its response on October 8, 1991 and the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion on October 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On October 31, 1991, a trial of this matter was commenced before the court without a jury. After appellant presented his evidence, appellee motioned the court for a dismissal of the matter. On November 22, 1991, the trial court entered its judgment granting the dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2). It is from this entry that appellant filed its notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On appeal, appellant assigns as error the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">\u201cThe lower court erred to the prejudice of appellant in denying appellant\u2019s motion to compel discovery inasmuch as the decision adversely affected appellant\u2019s substantive right of access to relevant information and frustrated the legislative intent underlying the Consumer Sales Practice Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201cThe lower court erred to the prejudice of appellant in sustaining defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of appellant\u2019s evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cThe lower court erred to the prejudice of appellant when it abused its discretion by relying on its own opinions instead of weighing the evidence and by denying appellant due process of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to compel. In his motion, appellant requested the trial court to compel appellee to answer two interrogatories and one production-of-documents request. Specifically, one interrogatory propounded to appellee asked the dealership to identify all vehicles which appellee had purchased at a General Motors auction and which had been driven by appellee\u2019s employees or family members from April 30, 1989 to present. The document request asked for the retail buyer\u2019s orders for said vehicles. The second interrogatory asked appellee to give the substance of discussions between appellee\u2019s agents and Richard Nelson. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to compel on the basis that the requests were not relevant to the pending lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Civ.R. 26 allows the parties broad powers of discovery. Although Civ.R. 26(B)(1) does limit the matter to be discovered to that which is \u201crelevant to the subject matter,\u201d Civ.R. 26(B)(1) also provides for discovery of information \u201c * * * reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d The court in <em>Icenhower v. Icenhower </em>(Aug. 14, 1975), Franklin App. No. 75AP-93, unreported, described the test of relevancy under Civ.R. 26(B)(1) as follows: \u201c * * * the discovery test for relevancy is much broader than the test to be utilized at trial. It is only irrelevant by the discovery test when the information sought will not reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Appellee in its brief states that \u201c * * * appellant has failed to establish that the information to be discovered would lead to the discovery of other admissible evidence in the trial[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We find that appellee is attempting to shift the burden and that under the <em>Icenhower </em>test, appellee had the burden to establish that the requested information would not reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The record, including appellee\u2019s response to appellant\u2019s motion to compel, does not support a determination that appellee sustained this burden. We therefore find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to compel. <em>Smith v. Klein </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 146, 23 OBR 387, 492 N.E.2d 852; <em>Rossman v. Rossman </em>(1975), 47 Ohio App.2d 103, 1 O.O.3d 206, 352 N.E.2d 149. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Appellant next assigns as error the trial court\u2019s granting of appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellant has raised three issues under Assignment of Error No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Prior to evaluating appellant\u2019s issues under Assignment of Error No. 2, it is important to note that Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.01 <em>et seq., </em>is remedial legislation and is to be construed liberally. <em>Renner v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1988), 54 Ohio App.3d 79, 86, 561 N.E.2d 959, 965. R.C. 1345.02 prohibits a supplier from committing unfair or deceptive acts in a consumer transaction. R.C. 1345.02(A). The code lists ten examples of deceptive acts or practices. R.C. 1345.02(B)(1) through (10); see <em>Thompson v. Jim Dixon Lincoln Mercury, Inc. </em>(Apr. 27, 1983), Butler App. No. CA 82-11-0109, unreported, at 3. This court stated in <em>Thompson, </em>at 3: \u201cThis list is not exhaustive and does not limit the broad scope of the terms \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive.\u2019 \u201d Furthermore, this court recognized that administrative rules were adopted to aid in interpreting R.C. 1345.02(A). <em>Thompson, supra; </em>R.C. 1345.05(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In his first issue, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s granting of appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was against the. manifest weight of the evidence. The standard which we must use in reviewing the trial court\u2019s entry of dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2) is whether the dismissal is \u201c * * * erroneous as a matter of law or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Janell, Inc. v. Woods </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 216, 217, 24 O.O.3d 266, 266, 435 N.E.2d 1138, 1139. The Supreme Court of Ohio has defined the \u201cmanifest weight\u201d test as follows: \u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. See, also, <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 411-412, 461 N.E.2d 1273, 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The evidence at the trial of this matter revealed that. Nelson, a consumer, spoke with one or more persons employed by appellee regarding purchase of a 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity station wagon. Charles Day, a salesman for appellee at the time, testified that he was involved with the car deal with Nelson. Day stated that Nelson asked Day, \u201cWell, who drove, you know, who\u2019s driven the car?\u201d Day did not know, so he asked Dan Larkin (the general manager of the car dealership) for the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Larkin testified that when the salesman came to him to inquire about the station wagon, the salesman informed Larkin that Nelson knew about a lawsuit in which appellee was involved. Larkin knew that the lawsuit dealt with the use of the word \u201cfactory official\u201d cars and that a majority of the cars involved in the lawsuit were rental cars. Larkin also testified that he had bought the station wagon and, therefore, knew that it had previously been owned by a rental car company. Larkin did not give Nelson the buy slip, <em>i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the sales slip indicating the sale of the station wagon at a General Motors auction to Larkin until shortly after Nelson purchased the station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In response to Day\u2019s inquiry about the station wagon, Larkin told Day that Mrs. Ed Larkin (the wife of the owner of the car dealership) had been driving the car. Larkin recalls giving this information to Day prior to Nelson\u2019s agreeing to purchase the car. Day then told Nelson that Mrs. Larkin had been the previous driver of the station wagon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Nelson also testified that he had expressed to a third person at the dealership<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his concern regarding appellee, in the past, selling rental cars as dealership cars and that he hoped that his situation was not like that situation. Nelson also testified that had he known that the station wagon had been owned by Budget Rent-A-Car, he would not have been interested in buying the car. At the trial, an expert testified to the value and valuation of the station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">A failure of a dealership to disclose that an automobile was purchased from another dealer was found by one court to have been a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-08(A). <em>Oster v. Swad Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(June 17, 1982), Franklin App. No. 81AP-934, unreported, 1982 WL 4235. The evidence in the case <em>sub judice </em>supports a finding that when asked a direct question as to who had previously driven the car, appellee responded with only a partial answer \u2014 that the owner\u2019s wife had driven the car \u2014 and excluded the rental car company\u2019s rental use and prior ownership. Therefore, we find that appellant\u2019s first issue has merit as the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Under his second issue, appellant contends that the trial court did not use the proper legal standard of .the consumer\u2019s perception in making its decision. As previously stated, the standard of review under Civ.R. 41(B)(2) is whether the dismissal is \u201c * * * erroneous as a matter of law or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Janell, Inc., supra, </em>70 Ohio App.2d at 217, 24 O.O.3d at 266, 435 N.E.2d at 1139. Additionally, the trial court\u2019s discretion to dismiss is not absolute; \u201c * * * the decision to dismiss must be guided by the evidence in the case and the pertinent law. [Citations omitted.]\u201d <em>Levine v. Beckman </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 24, 27, 548 N.E.2d 267, 270. The relevant evidence is recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The pertinent law provides: \u201c * * * it shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier * * * to misrepresent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the extent of previous use [of an item of goods] * * Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-08(A). Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16(B)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">\u201c(B) It shall be a deceptive and unfair act or practice for a dealer, in connection with the advertisement or sale of a motor vehicle, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201c(3) Use any statement or illustration in any * * * sales presentation which could create in the mind of a reasonable consumer a false impression as to the * * * prior use * * * of any motor vehicle * * *[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Furthermore, \u201c * * * [a]n act is deceptive if it \u2018has the likelihood of inducing a state of mind in the consumer that is not in accord with the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 3, quoting <em>Brown v. Bredenbeck </em>(C.P.1975), 2 O.O.3d 286, 287. See, also, <em>Crull v. Maple Park Body Shop </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 153, 158, 521 N.E.2d 1099, 1104. The \u201c * * * basic test is one of fairness * * <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">We find that appellee\u2019s omission of the car\u2019s prior ownership by Budget Rent-A-Car had the likelihood of inducing Nelson to believe that appellee was the only owner of the vehicle. This is in light of a direct question posed to appellee\u2019s salesman of who had driven the car. There was no time limitation in the question such as who has driven the car immediately prior to this sale. Additionally, appellee knew or had reason to know that Nelson was concerned about the prior lawsuit in which appellee was involved dealing with misrepresentations of cars, the majority of which were former rental cars. Therefore, appellant has presented evidence to sustain his burden of establishing that appellee violated R.C. 1345.02 by violating Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-08 and 109:4-3-16(B)(3). Since appellant\u2019s third issue under Assignment of Error No. 2 and his Assignment of Error No. 3 both allege that the trial court substituted its own opinion instead of weighing the evidence, we will deal with both below. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, as well as his third issue under Assignment of Error No. 2, contends that the trial court substituted its opinion instead of weighing the evidence presented. The trial court\u2019s job was to determine whether appellant met his burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The court in <em>Robinson v. McDougal </em>(1988), 62 Ohio App.3d 253, 575 N.E.2d 469, stated that since the plaintiff \u201c * * * was relying on acts prohibited by R.C. 1345.02, as defined by rules adopted under R.C. 1345.-05(B)(2)[,] * * * [it was only necessary] to prove that the act or acts prohibited by statute and rule had occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261-262, 575 N.E.2d at 474-475. Therefore, the court concluded that the \u201c * * * degree of required proof is by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>a preponderance of the evidence * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 575 N.E.2d at 475. A preponderance of the evidence is \u201c[e]vidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it; that is, evidence which as a whole shows that the fact sought to be proved is more probable than not.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 1064; <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Gath </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 257, 160 N.E. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We find that instead of weighing the evidence in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court used its own opinion to conclude that appellee was entitled to a dismissal. At the end of appellant\u2019s case, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, and counsels\u2019 arguments, the trial judge made remarks regarding the case. For example, after talking about a rental car versus other used cars, and the public\u2019s perception of a former rental car, the trial judge said: \u201cI want a rental car, low mileage, still factory warranty, and that\u2019s what this was, right?\u201d The trial judge further stated: \u201cI go to a lot and I see a regular, used car and I see ten thousand miles on it and if I just assume an individual owned it, I begin wondering, Why\u2019d they trade that in with such low mileage, must be a lemon.\u201d The trial judge made further comment by stating: \u201cI know a rental agency, they take meticulous care of their cars with constant maintenance.\u201d The trial judge also commented on the damages as \u201cperceived damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Based upon the above, we find that the trial court abused its discretion by substituting its opinion on the preferability of a used car which had been owned by a rental car company and on the damages as \u201cperceived damages\u201d for that of the evidence presented at the trial. The substitution of its own opinion in place of the evidence presented indicates imposition of a personal preference and thus an arbitrary attitude. \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d is an attitude by the trial court which is \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Ruwe v. Bd. of Springfield Twp. Trustees </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 29 OBR 441, 443, 505 N.E.2d 957, 959. We therefore sustain appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-7\">William W.

Ron May, another salesman with appellee at the time, also testified that he told Nelson that Mrs. Ed Larkin had been driving the station wagon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">.

Most assuredly, I would not grant my approbation to a dealer passing off a rental car as a \u201cfactory official\u201d car, but neither would Judge John R. Moser. The court made a commonsense decision in a case involving no damages. And finally, the court\u2019s remark with reference to rental cars dealt only with damages, and the lack thereof. I would accordingly also overrule the third assignment and affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
