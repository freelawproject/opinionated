Beverly Reams, appeals the judgment of the trial court\u2019s decision of October 29, 1991, dismissing her complaint. The trial court dismissed her parentage action concerning the minor child Tessa Reams (\u201cTessa\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The saga precipitating the case <em>sub judice </em>began in 1982. At that time, Richard Reams and Beverly Seymour, a childless couple, arranged for Norma Stotski to become the surrogate mother of Reams\u2019 child. There was no written contract and all the terms of the agreement between the parties, were made orally. The effort to achieve conception with the use of Reams\u2019 sperm failed. However, Stotski, on January 12, 1985, gave birth to Tessa Annaleah Reams. The conception giving rise to the birth of this child resulted from the use of the sperm of one Leslie Minor. Stotski gave the baby to the Reamses in exchange for $10,000 and other expenses pursuant to their oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In March 1985, Stotski filed a parentage action against Reams in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations. Stotski thought this was necessary so that Reams could eventually adopt Tessa. Neither Joseph Stotski (Norma Lee Stotski\u2019s husband) nor Leslie Minor was included in this action. Reams acknowledged paternity and was granted custody of Tessa pursuant to a court order filed August 1, 1986. The Reamses began to experience marital difficulties and eventually separated. Subsequently, a divorce action proceeded in Pickaway County. In June 1987, Seymour removed Tessa from Reams\u2019 home. Later, a Pickaway County court ordered Seymour to return the child to the custody of Reams, thereby enforcing the Franklin County \u201cParentage and Custody Order\u201d filed August 1, 1986. Subsequently, Seymour filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the previous Franklin County parentage and custody order and alleged that Reams was not Tessa\u2019s biological father. The previous parentage determination was vacated and all necessary parties, Joseph Stotski, Leslie Minor, and Richard Reams, were joined in the parentage action. The result of the HLA blood testing demonstrated that Leslie Minor was the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In October 1988, Reams filed a petition for adoption in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division. Seymour also filed a petition for the adoption of Tessa in November 1988. After the probate court issued an order requiring each petitioner to post an additional court-costs deposit of $3,000, Reams filed an appeal to this court. A short time later, on December 7, 1989, this court rendered an opinion in <em>In re Adoption of Reams </em>(1989), 52 Ohio App.3d 52, 557 N.E.2d 159. Therein, this court reversed and remanded the matter to the probate court for a determination of the legal parentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Tessa. Upon remand, the case was dismissed by the probate court, <em>sua sponte, </em>on September 18, 1990, due to the death of Reams.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On August 15, 1991, this court was again called upon to render an opinion in <em>Reams v. Reams </em>(Aug. 15, 1991), Franklin App. No. 90AP-1137, unreported, 1991 WL 160052. Therein, this court found the issues of custody to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Prior to this decision, on June 3,1991, Seymour had filed a parentage action, pursuant to R.C. 3111.17, with the Domestic Relations Court of Franklin County. However, the trial court dismissed her parentage action, finding it to be moot. The errors now assigned by appellant are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201c1. The trial judge should ethically have recused himself from deciding this case and denied appellant due process of law by violating Canons 2, 3 of the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct in regard to his past treatment of and comments pertaining to appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>There has never been an adjudication of who is Tessa\u2019s legal \u2018mother.\u2019 Nowhere is there a legal debate recorded as to who is Tessa\u2019s mother. This claim seeks to resolve that unaddressed question, and denying a hearing violates appellant\u2019s due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201c3. Legal parental rights are not automatically relinquished by incarcerated mothers in Ohio, and parental rights only become moot when the parent cannot make appropriate arrangements for her children. State law mandates a reunification plan with the mother, <em>before </em>any other plan, not after. Legal parentage should be decided before \u2018custody\u2019 is moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201c4. The previous cases cited were conducted by Judge Solove with extensive violation of civil rights to appellant and those arguments and their validity should be re-examined, due to acts and omissions of defense counsel for appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">\u201c5. Even if \u2018custody\u2019 is an issue, keeping a mother\u2019s right to custody by an incarcerated mother is legally feasible and assignment of physical custody to trusted family members a regular occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">\u201c6. The judge erred in suggesting it would not be in the child\u2019s best interests to hear this case. Since he readily admits Seymour was not a party to neglect/dependency/custody proceedings, appellant contends Tessa\u2019s best interests could not possibly have been fully considered without attention to the mother/child relationship for five years, seven months, resulting' in the healthy, well-adjusted child she was determined to be when seized by Children Services. <em>\u2018Best interests </em>\u2019 for a female child include a clarification of her own legal status, and conditions under which her society may some day steal her own lovingly mothered child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u201c7. The lower court erred in considering the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 in making a custodial decision with no consideration of or expert testimony on the importance of the mother/child bond that existed for five years, seven months of Tessa\u2019s life between her and Beverly Seymour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201c8. The lower court failed to recognize the freedom of two adult women to choose surrogacy as a free reproductive choice for them both, protected by the U.S. Constitution; Seymour is Tessa\u2019s \u2018mother\u2019 because the two women chose this, and Seymour fulfilled every obligation as a \u2018mother\u2019 to birth substitute, child and society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201c9. Seymour has been denied recognized maternal parentage by the acts, delays, and denials of her free access to the court, and as \u2018punishment\u2019 for freely exercising her civil liberties.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Appellant has filed what is entitled an \u201cExhibit\u201d on February 6, 1992. In this exhibit, appellant has filed Assignments of Error Nos. 5 through 21, which we will address as Assignments of Error Nos. 10 through 26.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201c10. Appellant in this case was denied due process of law by the state of Ohio in that she was not able to attend the hearing on seizure of her child Tessa by children services due to the fact this state permits a wide range of excessive bails to be set in local courts, bails which discriminate especially against women who defend themselves against men. The wide discrepancies and leeway in bail setting can also be used to prevent helpless citizens from protecting their rights in just such actions, and in preparing their defense. By failing to provide fair and equitable bail guidelines, the state itself permits violation of Amendments 8 and 14 to the U.S. Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201c11. The lower court erred in denying appellant the civil liberty of speaking publicly about her case, thus preventing her from exercising an American freedom to seek redress for government error by public examination and attention to a grievance. The U.S. Constitution does not mandate or require a citizen to confine her efforts to correct a wrong to only those procedures for redress set up by a particular branch of the government, legislative, executive, or judicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201c12. Appellant was prejudiced by the references to the surrogate arrangement in this case as being \u2018illegal\u2019 when in fact there is no Ohio law which disallows one woman to act as the birth surrogate for another and this <em>\u2018reproductive choice\u2019 </em>is protected by the Constitution of the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">\u201c13. Appellant was denied her basic right to free speech, and actually punished for daring to speak out freely as an American citizen, by being denied custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201c14. The lower court erred in the process used to declare the child Tessa a \u2018neglected/dependent\u2019 child and thereby violated the constitutional rights of the parents of Tessa to due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201c15. Appellant was denied due process of law through the ineffective assistance of counsel in the acts and omissions of her counsel, Francine Jacobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201c16. The lower court erred in determining that, because appellant is incarcerated, issues of custody are \u2018moot.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201c17. The lower court erred in modifying its own former custody decision, making Richard Reams and Beverly Seymour the child\u2019s custodians and parental figures, when it was totally unnecessary, not proven to be in her best interests, to award the child to children services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201c18. The lower court erred in modifying his own previous order granting custody, care, physical custody, and visitation to Beverly Seymour and Richard Reams, which effectively recognized Tessa as a member of both the Reams and Seymour families. Such modification and assignment of the child to Franklin County Children Services and the subsequent complete elimination of Tessa\u2019s identity as a Seymour family member was unjustified, unnecessary, and unwarranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201c19. The lower court erred in awarding custody of the child Tessa without requiring an examination and report, of the qualifications of Children Services so that the child\u2019s best interests in <em>each </em>of <em>the litigants\u2019 custody could properly be compared. A report on the desirability of custodial candidates was made except for Children Services.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">\n<em>\u201cThe participants in the custody hearing were denied due process because the fourth litigant, Franklin County Children Services, was permitted to do the \u2018home studies\u2019 of those [with] whom they were adversaries in the custody hearing. As a litigant, it is improper for them to be the evaluators of other contestants.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">\u201c20. The lower court erred in ordering psychological reports that had been performed to be considered as part of the evidence in the first custody hearing between Reams and Seymour (90AP-1137) and in failing to require testimony concerning what \u2018anger\u2019 he thought he saw in appellant, its source, direction, and whether or not it was indeed justified, a result of being a battered woman, or a sign of depression and exhaustion from 3V2 years of pressure, coercion, and stress in the litigation process itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201c21. The lower court erred in not taking into consideration a professional evaluation and realistic look at evidence presented concerning the mental and psychological health of the custody candidates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c22. The lower court erred in basing a custody decision upon the display of appellant\u2019s \u2018unlikable\u2019 responses to stress without requiring psychological testimony pertaining to the effects of a battering relationship and the frustration of legal system reinforcement of male coercion against a female spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201c23. The lower court erred in not applying the primary caregiver doctrine to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201c24. The lower court erred in considering the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 in making a custodial decision with no consideration of or expert testimony on the importance of the mother/child bond that existed for five years, seven months of Tessa\u2019s life between her and Beverly Seymour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201c25. Beverly Seymour contends she was denied due process of law by the actions of this court in encouraging and abetting procedures which denied her access and input to the court records, by attitudes which were prejudicial to her as a person of conservative, \u2018straight,\u2019 Christian-oriented \u2018country\u2019 type culture, and by a courtroom attitude and decorum which favored Mr. Reams\u2019 lies, fraud, deceit, abuse, failure to meet her agreement in the surrogacy contract, dirty tricks, and weak, homosexual orientation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201c26. The lower court erred in taking custody of Tessa, and authority over her, from Mrs. Stotski, who had legally <em>already relinquished </em>her rights to the child. She had no right to consent or admit or deny anything pertaining to Tessa.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">We now examine all of appellant\u2019s assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In Assignment of Error No. 1, appellant contends the trial judge should have recused himself. However, we find no merit in this contention. If appellant truly believed she would be prejudiced by Judge Solove\u2019s hearing her parentage complaint, she should have followed R.C. 2701.03 by filing an affidavit of prejudice. By its terms, R.C. 2701.03 requires that a party file, with the Supreme Court of Ohio, an affidavit of prejudice not less than three days prior to the time of a hearing before a common pleas court judge. Since appellant did not comply with R.C. 2701.03, we overrule her first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">In Assignments of Error Nos. 2, 3, 6, 8, and 12, appellant argues that the trial court should not have dismissed her parentage action and should have declared her to be Tessa\u2019s mother. Appellant does not dispute that she is not Tessa\u2019s biological mother; however, she maintains that her agreement with Stotski gives her the status of Tessa\u2019s mother and, thus, the right to be declared as such through a parentage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">In collectively addressing these assigned errors, we initially find the trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint, but it did so for the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>reason. The trial court stated it was dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * This Court has determined that it is in the best interests of the child to be removed from all the parties involved in the preceding cases. It would therefore be in the best interests of Tessa Reams that the parentage action of Beverly Seymour be dismissed as moot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">It was not because the parentage action was \u201cmoot\u201d that the trial court was obliged to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint; rather, it was because appellant lacked standing to prosecute her claim. She was without standing because she is admittedly not the biological mother of Tessa, nor was she ever determined to be Tessa\u2019s legal mother by means of the so-called \u201csurrogate agreement.\u201d The policy on such \u201csurrogate agreements,\u201d when considering Ohio\u2019s adoption laws, is unsettled and open to considerable scrutiny as far as enforceability. See R.C. 3107.10. Additionally, it has been previously determined that appellant had no legal relationship to the child. In Ohio, one cannot claim the status of an adoptive parent merely through an oral agreement. Thus, appellant was in no position to bring a parentage action or claim motherhood of Tessa. Accordingly, we overrule these assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In Assignments of Error Nos. 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 13 through 26, appellant contends that her counsel was ineffective, and the trial court erred in other cases in which she was involved. What appellant fails to consider is that previous cases are not on appeal, and these claims of error in another case are not before us in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Moreover, we have already, determined that issues related to custody are moot. <em>Reams v. Reams </em>(Aug. 15, 1991), Franklin App. No. 90AP-1137, unreported, 1991 WL 160052. Accordingly, we overrule these assigned errors. We do agree with appellant\u2019s contentions that her right to speak freely regarding her past litigation cannot be abridged by the trial court. However, we cannot conclude that the conduct or attitude of the trial court in this regard was critical to the decisional background in this case and, as such, clearly does not merit reversal of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In sum, we overrule all of appellant\u2019s assignments of error. The dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint by the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-9\">John C. Young, P.J., and Peggy Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
