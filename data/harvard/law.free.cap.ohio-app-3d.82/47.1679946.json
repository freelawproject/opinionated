Forney asserts two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-14\">\u201cI. The municipal court committed reversible error by failure to conduct a trial <em>de novo </em>on receiving the appeal from the mayor\u2019s court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-15\">\u201cII. The judgment of the mayor\u2019s court is void <em>ab initio </em>because the city ordinance 432.37 \u2018weaving\u2019 is constitutionally defective on it\u2019s [sic] face and as it is applied in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-16\">\u201cA. On it\u2019s [sic] face the ordinance is overbroad, vague and ambiguous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-17\">\u201cB. As applied the ordinance is a subterfuge, and/or a pretext.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">Appellant was found guilty of a traffic offense in the city of Fairlawn Mayor\u2019s Court on August 22,1991. Appellant filed her notice of appeal to the Akron Municipal Court on September 19, 1991, twenty-eight days after the mayor rendered judgment. R.C. 1905.22 authorizes an appeal from a mayor\u2019s court to a municipal court. R.C. 1905.23 requires that \u201c[w]ithin ten days from the time a mayor renders judgment, the appellant shall file with the mayor\u2019s court a written notice of appeal * * *.\" Where the notice of appeal is not timely filed, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Hamersville </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>v.

Therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain Forney\u2019s appeal and the municipal court should have dismissed Forney\u2019s appeal from the mayor\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded to the trial court for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-8\">Baird, P.J., and Reece, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
