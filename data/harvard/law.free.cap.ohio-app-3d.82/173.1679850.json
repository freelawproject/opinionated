Vanderkooi (\u201cappellant\u201d), from the judgment and sentencing of the Municipal Court of Crawford County, finding her guilty of driving under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>On August 23, 1991, appellant, her boyfriend, Ernie Martin, and a friend, Jimmie Reagan, were driving home from a wedding reception in Crestline, Ohio, in appellant\u2019s vehicle. Jimmie was driving the vehicle, as he had not been drinking and both appellant and Ernie had been drinking and were in no condition to drive. When Jimmie and Ernie left the reception, appellant was asleep in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On the ride home, Jimmie and Ernie began to have words and Jimmie decided that he had enough of Ernie. Jimmie then stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle in the lane of traffic, approximately thirty feet from the stop sign on County Road 46. Jimmie then parked the vehicle, threw the keys to the appellant, who was still asleep in the back seat, and left to walk home.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">After Jimmie had left, Ernie woke up appellant. Appellant climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and Ernie handed her a set of car keys. As appellant was attempting to start her vehicle with the keys Ernie had given her, Patrolman Greene pulled his patrol car behind appellant\u2019s vehicle and activated his lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">When the patrolman approached the driver\u2019s door, he observed appellant trying to put a key into the ignition to start the vehicle. Upon speaking with appellant, Patrolman Greene noticed a strong odor of alcohol on her breath, bloodshot eyes, and that appellant\u2019s speech was slurred. Based on the general demeanor of appellant, the patrolman gave her several field sobriety tests and a portable breath test and concluded that she was under the influence of alcohol. Appellant was then arrested for driving under the influence and read her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Because Ernie was not able to drive appellant\u2019s vehicle, the patrolman called for a tow truck to remove the vehicle, as it was parked in the roadway. The patrolman then went back to appellant\u2019s vehicle to retrieve her car keys from the backseat where he had observed them when he first approached the vehicle. Patrolman Greene then put the keys into the ignition of appellant\u2019s vehicle and determined that the key would start the vehicle and the vehicle was capable of movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Appellant was then transported to the station, where she was given a breath test resulting in a blood alcohol content of .182. Appellant was then cited for violating R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), driving under the influence, and R.C. 4511.66, prohibiting parking on the highway. Appellant filed a motion to suppress and dismiss, stating that she did not operate her vehicle as defined in R.C. 4511.19(A) and she did not park her vehicle upon the highway. Upon the trial court\u2019s overruling of appellant\u2019s motion, she entered into a plea negotiation with the prosecutor whereby appellant entered a plea of no contest to driving under the influence and the alleged violation of the prohibition against parking on the highway was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Appellant now appeals from the judgment of the trial court in overruling her motion to suppress/dismiss and asserts the following sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying the defendant-appellant\u2019s motion to suppress/dismiss for the reason that the defendant-appellant was not operating her vehicle since she did not have possession of her vehicle\u2019s ignition key.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Appellant asserts that in order to be operating a motor vehicle within the meaning of R.C. 4511.19(A), the ignition key must be on the person in the driver\u2019s seat or in the ignition. Since appellant did not have the right key in the ignition and did not know where her keys were, she was not operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In <em>State v. Cleary </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 198, 199, 22 OBR 351, 351, 490 N.E.2d 574, 575, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that a person in the driver\u2019s seat with the key in his possession indicating either his actual or potential movement of the vehicle can be found in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1). As appellant\u2019s keys were within her reach from the driver\u2019s seat, she had possession of the ignition key. Therefore, there was a potential for movement of the appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Appellant cites two unreported cases in support of her assignment of error; however, both cases are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>State v. Gilbert </em>(Dec. 29, 1989), Clermont App. No. CA89-05-028, unreported, 1989 WL 157164, the court held that the defendant could not be found in violation of driving under the influence, when the state did not provide positive proof that the key found on appellant was the ignition key and that the vehicle was capable of movement. Herein, the patrolman testified that he retrieved appellant\u2019s keys from plain view in the back seat. He then placed the key into the ignition of appellant\u2019s vehicle and started it and determined that the vehicle was capable of movement. Therefore, the state provided positive proof that the key in appellant\u2019s possession was the ignition key and she had the potential to operate her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Appellant also cites <em>State v. Degler </em>(Feb. 21, 1990), Wayne App. No. 2491, unreported, 1990 WL 15200, in support for her assignment of error. The court in <em>Degler </em>stated that a person cannot operate a motor vehicle within the meaning of R.C. 4511.19 when the vehicle is incapable of motion due to a mechanical failure. Appellant asserts that since she was trying to start her vehicle with the wrong ignition key, the vehicle was incapable of movement. Appellant\u2019s argument is misplaced. The patrolman testified that upon starting appellant\u2019s vehicle, he determined that the vehicle was capable of motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Consequently, if appellant had put in the right ignition key, her vehicle was capable of movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">This court recently held in <em>State v. Barger </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 451, 605 N.E.2d 409, that where the defendant is not asleep, in the driver\u2019s seat and has the ignition key in her possession, which indicated her potential movement of the vehicle, there was sufficient evidence to determine that the defendant operated a motor vehicle within the meaning on R.C. 4511.19. Because appellant was in the driver\u2019s seat and was attempting to start her vehicle and her keys were in plain view and in reach, she was operating a motor vehicle as prohibited by R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), as there was a potential for movement. Therefore, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-7\">Evans and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
