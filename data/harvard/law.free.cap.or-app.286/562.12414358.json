He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence acquired during the course of the traffic stop. Defendant contends that the officer who stopped him did so based on a mistaken interpretation of ORS 811.505. That statute requires a driver \u201cemerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway in a business or residence district\u201d to stop \u201cbefore driving onto the sidewalk or sidewalk area.\u201d Defendant, who was observed emerging from a parking lot without stopping before driving onto the sidewalk, contends that the statute does not apply to motorists exiting from parking lots, and that the officer therefore lacked probable cause to stop him for purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>See State v. Stookey, </em>255 Or App 489, 491, 297 P3d 548 (2013) (where facts perceived by officer do not constitute an offense, officer lacks probable cause to conduct a stop under Article I, section 9); <em>State v. Tiffin, </em>202 Or App 199, 203-04, 121 P3d 9 (2005) (\u201c[A]n officer\u2019s subjective belief that a traffic infraction occurred is objectively reasonable if, and only if, the facts as the officer perceived them actually satisfy the elements of a traffic infraction.\u201d). We conclude otherwise and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress for legal error, accepting the facts as found by the trial court, so long as there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993); <em>State v. Davis, </em>282 Or App 660, 666, 385 P3d 1253 (2016). To the extent that the trial court,did not make findings on a particular issue, and there is evidence from which the facts could be found more than one way, we presume that the trial court found the facts consistently with its ultimate determination. <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968). We state the facts\u2014which are few\u2014in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Officer Ledford of the Albany police observed defendant drive out of the vehicle exit of the Dari Mart parking lot without stopping before driving onto the sidewalk. Instead of stopping before driving onto the sidewalk, defendant stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in the middle of it. As illustrated by the photographs that the state submitted in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, one of which we have reproduced in an appendix to this opinion, the Dari Mart parking lot wraps around the Dari Mart store. A portion of the parking lot adjacent to the store is demarcated by lines signaling parking spaces, indicating that that part of the parking lot is for parking. The rest of the parking lot\u2014that is, the part containing no demarcated parking spaces\u2014consists of unmarked blacktop, indicating that that portion of the parking lot is for driving between the parking spaces and the parking lot\u2019s entrance-and-exit. The entrance-and-exit is designated by a gap in a concrete curb along the perimeter of the parking lot. Visually, the set-up suggests to motorists wishing to shop at the Dari Mart that they should enter the demarcated entrance-and-exit, drive along the unmarked portion of the pavement to a parking place, park, exit their vehicles, and go into the store. A driver wishing to leave the Dari Mart presumably would invert that sequence, departing the store by pulling out of a marked parking space, driving along the unmarked portion of pavement meant for driving to the entrance-and-exit, and then pulling onto the street. And that is exactly what Ledford observed defendant do. Defendant drove out of the parking lot through the demarcated entrance-and-exit from the portion of the parking lot apparently intended for driving, rather than parking. Believing defendant to be in violation of ORS 811.505 for not stopping before he drove onto the sidewalk, Ledford pulled defendant over.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s conduct in driving out of the parking lot, as observed by Ledford, constituted a violation of ORS 811.505. If not, then Ledford lacked probable cause to stop defendant and defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted. <em>Stookey, </em>255 Or App at 496 (where conduct perceived by officer did not constitute a violation of law, officer lacked probable cause to stop the defendant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 811.505 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of failure to stop when emerging from an alley, driveway or building if the person is operating a vehicle that is emerging from an alley, building, private road or driveway in a business or residence district and the person does not stop the vehicle as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201c(a) If there is a sidewalk or sidewalk area, the person must stop the vehicle before driving onto the sidewalk or sidewalk area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201c(b) If there is no sidewalk or sidewalk area, the person must stop at the point nearest the roadway to be entered where the driver has a view of approaching traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c(2) The offense described in this section, failure to stop when emerging from an alley, driveway or building, is a Class B traffic violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The parties agree that the issue is whether defendant was emerging from a \u201cdriveway\u201d at the time he drove out of the Dari Mart parking lot. Thus, that is the issue we consider. On that point, the parties debate extensively whether a parking lot is a \u201cdriveway\u201d for purposes of ORS 811.505. But we think the question is much narrower and less abstract: whether that portion of the parking lot from which Ledford observed defendant emerge is, itself, a driveway for purposes of ORS 811.505. That is because we must evaluate the particular conduct that Ledford perceived in order to assess whether that particular perceived conduct violated ORS 811.505.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">ORS 811.505 does not define \u201cdriveway,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so we look to the ordinary meaning of the term. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). The common meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of the term, according to the most pertinent definition in <em>Webster\u2019s, </em>is \u201ca private road giving access from a public thoroughfare to a building or buildings on abutting grounds.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>692 (unabridged ed 2002). But we need not stop with Webster\u2019s; in support of his argument that a parking lot cannot be a driveway, defendant has supplied us with a number of other definitions of \u201cdriveway\u201d to aid in our assessment of whether the conduct that Ledford observed violated ORS 811.505. According to <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>436 (unabridged ed 1967), a driveway is a \u201ca road, esp. a private one, leading from a street or other thoroughfare to a building, house, garage, etc. *** [or] any road for driving on.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) According to IV <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>1062 (2d ed 1989), a driveway is a \u201cway along which something is driven * * * a private carriageway for a motor vehicle alongside, in front of, or leading to a house, garage, or other building; a drive.\u201d According to <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s-Collegiate Dictionary </em>354 (10th ed 1994), a driveway is \u201ca private road giving access from a public way to a building on abutting grounds.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>548 (5th ed 2011) similarly defines driveway as a \u201cprivate road that connects a house, garage, or other building with the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Each of those definitions fairly encompasses the portion of the parking lot from which Ledford observed defendant emerge without stopping. What all the definitions have in common is the idea that a \u201cdriveway\u201d is a private way of access that allows drivers to reach a private place from a public road. That portion of the parking lot from which defendant emerged serves exactly that purpose: to give motorists driving their cars access to the Dari Mart (and its parking spaces) from the street. As such, it constitutes a \u201cdriveway\u201d under the ordinary meaning of the word. Thus, the facts, as Ledford perceived them, constituted a violation of ORS 811.505, and the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-5\"> The state challenges our prior holdings (1) that an officer must have probable cause to initiate a traffic stop; and (2) that the facts perceived by the officer must, in fact, constitute a violation of the law. On the latter point, the state argues that we should abandon our rule of law in favor of the Fourth Amendment rule adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Heien v. North Carolina, </em>574 US -, 135 S Ct 530, 190 L Ed 2d 475 (2014) (holding that, under Fourth Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop can rest on a reasonable mistake of law). We decline the state\u2019s invitation to revisit our prior holdings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> The vehicle code used to contain a definition of \u201cprivate road or driveway\u201d: \u2018\u201cPrivate road or driveway\u2019 means every way or place in private ownership and used for vehicular travel by the owner and those having express or implied permission from him, but not used by other persons.\u201d <em>Former </em>ORS 483.018(4) (1975). The legislature repealed that definition in 1983, ostensibly to simplify the vehicle code without making any substantive changes: \u201cThe intent of the assembly is to make the law relating to vehicles easier to use <em>*** </em>by simplifying the language * <em>* </em>* [and] eliminating some confusing use of terminology * * * all in accordance with existing interpretation and use of the vehicle code.\u201d Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 3. Although that definition undisputedly would encompass the area of the parking lot from which Ledford observed defendant emerge, because the legislature did remove that definition we examine the ordinary dictionary definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of driveway, even though there is no indication that the legislature intended to change the operation of the vehicle code by removing that definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
