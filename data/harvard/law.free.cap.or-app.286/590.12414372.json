Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to prohibit the arresting deputy\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d certain field sobriety tests (FSTs). Defendant argues that that testimony is scientific because it draws its convincing force from a scientific proposition, namely, that exhibiting a certain number of standardized \u201cclues\u201d during performance of the test means that the test subject is under the influence of intoxicants. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for a special jury instruction regarding the results of a breath test to determine his blood alcohol content (BAC).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We conclude that the deputy\u2019s testimony at issue here is scientific and, consequently, that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion and admitting the testimony without a proper foundation, and we further conclude that the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s DUII conviction, and, because the record may develop differently on remand, we do not address defendant\u2019s assignment of error regarding the denial of his request for a special jury instruction. Because defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal pertain only to his DUII conviction, we affirm his conviction for failing to perform the duties of a driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. While driving out of a parking lot, defendant struck another car and failed to immediately stop. Defendant eventually pulled into a different parking lot, where witnesses to the collision confronted him. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Due\u00f1as arrived and spoke with defendant. Due\u00f1as noticed that defendant was a little \u201cstandoffish\u201d and did not seem to want him there. Due\u00f1as also noticed that defendant had bloodshot, watery eyes and a \u201crelaxed\u201d look on his face. Due\u00f1as smelled a moderate odor of alcohol on defendant. Due\u00f1as asked defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>if he had been drinking, and defendant answered that he had had two bottles of beer one hour before. Due\u00f1as asked defendant to perform FSTs, and defendant agreed. Due\u00f1as administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg-stand test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Based on Duenas\u2019s observations and defendant\u2019s performance on the FSTs, Due\u00f1as arrested defendant and transported him to the police station. At the station, Due\u00f1as tested defendant\u2019s breath with the Intoxilyzer 8000, which requires two successful breath samples to provide a final test result. <em>See </em>OAR 257-030-0130(3). Defendant gave two breath samples indicating that his BAC was 0.082 and 0.079, respectively. The final result of defendant\u2019s breath test was a 0.07 BAC, which is the lower sample truncated to two decimal places. <em>See </em>OAR 257-030-0140 (after a successful breath testing sequence, \u201cthe lower breath sample measurement shall be truncated to two decimal places and reported as the chemical test result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Defendant was charged with DUII and failure to perform the duties of a driver. Before trial, defendant moved to prohibit Due\u00f1as from testifying that defendant had \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn or one-leg-stand tests because those terms are scientific; they derive from a purported statistical correlation between exhibiting a certain number of clues on the test and having a high BAC. Defendant argued that \u201capplying that \u2018pass or fail\u2019 [to a person\u2019s performance on those FSTs] puts a scientific backing that doesn\u2019t exist and isn\u2019t tested.\u201d He asserted that Due\u00f1as could testify that defendant exhibited \u201csix out of eight clues or eight out of eight clues [on a given test], but just not use the term, \u2018pass\u2019 or \u2018fail.\u2019\u201d The state responded that \u201cthe officers can testify as to whether he passed or failed!,] \u201d because FSTs are \u201cstandardized test[s].\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request and allowed the state to introduce Duenas\u2019s testimony about whether defendant passed or failed the FSTs without laying a scientific foundation for that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>At trial, Due\u00f1as testified about defendant\u2019s performance on the FSTs. Specifically, he testified that defendant had exhibited four of eight possible \u201cclues\u201d on the walk-and-turn test: (1) He started before Due\u00f1as told him to; (2) he was unable to maintain his balance while Due\u00f1as gave him instructions; (3) he took eight steps before turning, instead of the required nine steps; and (4) he made an improper turn. In addition to describing those problems with defendant\u2019s performance, Due\u00f1as testified that that score meant that defendant had failed the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201cQ. * * * You testified that [defendant] showed four out of eight clues on the walk and turn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201cQ. Is that a passing or failing score?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\u201cA. Fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Later, Due\u00f1as testified to his opinion that defendant was impaired when he drove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\u201cQ. About how long were you with the defendant back on August 20th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">\u00ab* \u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">\u201cA. Almost two hours, maybe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-13\">\u201cQ. Now based on your training and experience and your contact with the defendant that night, were you able to form an opinion as to the state of the defendant\u2019s sobriety that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-15\">\u201cQ. What was that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-16\">\u201cA. That he was impaired to a noticeable and perceptible degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">On cross-examination, Due\u00f1as testified that defendant\u2019s motor skills did not appear to be impaired, defendant\u2019s balance was intact, his speech was normal, and he behaved politely. Additionally, Due\u00f1as admitted that, although defendant started the walk-and-turn test before Due\u00f1as told him to, Due\u00f1as had not instructed defendant to wait for his command before starting the test. Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>counsel also elicited Duenas\u2019s testimony that defendant had passed the one-leg-stand test.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The state also introduced defendant\u2019s \u201cBreath Test Report.\u201d The one-page report included two \u201csubject samples\u201d\u2014 a 0.082 BAC and a 0.079 BAC\u2014and a \u201cTest Result\u201d of 0.07 BAC. Due\u00f1as testified about defendant\u2019s two breath samples, and, when asked what the final result was, Due\u00f1as stated that \u201c[t]he test result was a .07 percent BAC.\u201d Similarly, on cross-examination, Due\u00f1as testified that neither of the \u201csubject samples\u201d was official and that, instead, the 0.07 \u201cTest Result\u201d represented defendant\u2019s official BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Using retrograde extrapolation, the state\u2019s forensic expert, Bessett, estimated defendant\u2019s BAC at the time of driving. Bessett based his calculations off of the \u201csubject samples\u201d rather than the \u201cTest Result.\u201d According to Bessett, on the lower range, defendant\u2019s BAC at the time of driving was the same as the \u201csubject samples,\u201d and on the higher end, it was 0.01 more than those samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The jury convicted defendant of DUII and failure to perform the duties of a driver, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to exclude testimony that he \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn or one-leg-stand tests because that testimony was scientific and the state did not lay an adequate foundation for it. We begin by explaining the governing law, then we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">A. <em>Legal Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">OEC 702, which governs the admission of expert testimony, provides, \u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d In <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 408, 687 P2d 751 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that expert scientific evidence is best evaluated under traditional admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>standards for expert testimony under OEC 702. Those standards require expert testimony to be \u201crelevant under OEC 401 and [helpful to] the trier of fact in deciding a disputed issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Expert testimony is helpful if its subject is \u201cwithin the expert\u2019s field,\u201d the witness is qualified, and the foundation for the opinion intelligibly relates the testimony to the facts. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the trial court must consider whether the testimony \u201cis unduly prejudicial, repetitive, or falls under some other exclusionary provision\u201d of OEC 403. <em>Id. </em>The court held that, \u201c[i]n determining whether scientific evidence is probative under OEC 401 and the relevancy and prejudice analysis implicated in OEC 702\u2019s helpfulness standard,\u201d seven factors \u201cprovide structure and guidance in applying those rules of evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 417. The factors, which are not exclusive, are intended to assist a court in performing its \u201cvital role of gatekeeper, screening proffered scientific testimony to determine whether it is sufficiently valid, as a matter of science, to legitimately assist the trier of fact and excluding bad science in order to control the flow of confusing, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial, or useless information to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Marcum v. Adventist Health System/West, </em>345 Or 237, 244, 193 P3d 1 (2008) (internal citations, brackets, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Eleven years later, in <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995), the Supreme Court again addressed the admissibility of expert scientific evidence and refined the requirements articulated in <em>Brown </em>for a sufficient foundation for such evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Brown, </em>the court had defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>scientific evidence as evidence that \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d 297 Or at 407. In <em>O\u2019Key, </em>with respect to whether evidence is scientific, the court noted that \u201c[t]his court\u2019s definition of \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence in <em>Brown </em>recognizes that it is difficult to set a more definitive boundary between \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence and \u2018technical or other specialized knowledge,\u2019 which are the other types of evidence requiring expert proof.\u201d 321 Or at 291 (quoting OEC 702).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court quoted Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick, who explained that \u2018\u201c[m]ost expert testimony rests at least partly on science. In many areas the scientific underpinning is well established and the criteria set out in [Rules] 702 and 703 work well. *** Under these criteria an enormous amount of conventional scientific evidence is routinely admitted.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Modern Evidence </em>\u00a7 7.8, 990 (1995) (second insertion in <em>O\u2019Key)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Thus, in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the court recognized that there may be no definitive boundary between expert scientific evidence and expert evidence based on \u201ctechnical or other specialized knowledge\u201d\u2014that is, as Mueller and Kirkpatrick contend, \u201c[mjost expert testimony rests at least partly on science.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 321 Or at 291 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of that recognition, the court identified the particular risk carried by the admission of expert evidence that the jury will perceive as scientific: \u201cEvidence perceived by lay jurors to be scientific in nature possesses an unusually high degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of persuasive power. The function of the court is to ensure that the persuasive appeal is legitimate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[propositions that a court finds possess significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions * * * should be supported by the appropriate scientific validation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing William Strong, <em>Language and Logic in Expert Testimony: Limiting Expert Testimony by Restrictions of Function, Reliability, and Form, </em>71 Or L Rev 349, 368 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">Ultimately, in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the court explained that there was no present need to attempt to draw a firm line between expert scientific testimony and expert testimony based on \u201ctechnical or other specialized knowledge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201cWe need not attempt precisely to distinguish \u2018scientific\u2019 from other types of expert testimony under the Oregon Evidence Code. For now, we hold that, in the absence of a clear case, a case for judicial notice, or a case of <em>prima facie </em>legislative recognition, trial courts have an obligation to ensure that proffered expert scientific testimony that a court finds possesses significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as \u2018scientific\u2019 assertions is scientifically valid. This is especially true in cases where the proffered expert scientific testimony is innovative, nontraditional, unconventional, controversial, or close to the frontier of understanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Thus, when proffered expert scientific testimony \u201cpossesses a significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as \u2018scientific,\u2019\u201d a court must determine whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable to be admitted, applying the guidelines established in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>The court\u2019s assessment of the reliability of the evidence is necessary to \u201c\u2018ensure [] that expert testimony does not enjoy the persuasive appeal of science without subjecting its propositions to the verification processes of science.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 292 (quoting Strong, 71 Or L Rev at 368); <em>see also </em>Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 3 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 353, 656 (2d ed 1995) (noting that most expert testimony is based on science and explaining that, \u201c[i]n cases involving scientific evidence, especially where the science is new or controversial or close to the frontier of understanding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>proponent must show that the proffered evidence is valid science\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Next, the <em>O\u2019Key </em>court evaluated the expert testimony at issue\u2014testimony about the HGN test\u2014and concluded that the jury would perceive it as scientific. The court noted that \u201cthe HGN test is distinguished from other field sobriety tests because science, rather than common knowledge, provides the legitimacy for HGN testing.\u201d 321 Or at 296. After discussing the \u201casserted scientific proposition\u201d underlying the HGN test (\u201cthat there is a causal relationship between consumption of alcohol and the type of nystag-mus measured by the HGN test\u201d), the court explained that the HGN test \u201crests on a manifestation of alcohol consumption not easily recognized or understood by most people. The relationship between the effects of alcohol on the central nervous system, the nystagmus phenomenon, and the HGN test is not within the realm of common knowledge of the average person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Thus, the court concluded that the jury would perceive HGN-test evidence as scientific because, unlike many other signs of alcohol consumption, the causal relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>between alcohol consumption and the nystagmus phenomenon was outside jurors\u2019 common knowledge. Consequently, that \u201casserted scientific proposition\u201d implied by the testimony had significantly increased potential to influence the jury as a \u201cscientific\u201d assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>O\u2019Key </em>demonstrates that attributes of a particular proposition implied by an expert\u2019s testimony\u2014its scientific underpinning, coupled with its unfamiliarity to the jury\u2014 may cause the jury to perceive the proposition, and, consequently, the testimony, as scientific. <em>See also Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 304, 14 P3d 596 (2000) (\u201c[c]linical diagnoses bear the marks of science\u201d because doctors use the scientific method to arrive at diagnoses); <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 631, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (testimony about sex abuse \u201csyndrome\u201d that explains \u201c\u2018typical\u2019 reactions\u201d of abuse victims is scientific).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Jurors also may perceive expert testimony as scientific because of attributes of the expert, rather than the particular explicit or implicit proposition that the expert relies on; through her overall presentation, an expert may \u201cannounce!] to the factfinder that her testimony is \u2018scientific, <em>i.e., </em>is grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 563, 73 P3d 911 (2003). In <em>Marrington, </em>the defendant argued that a witness\u2019s assertion \u201cthat delayed reporting is a predominant feature of disclosure in otherwise verified cases of child sexual abuse\u201d was scientific. 335 Or at 560. The court first noted that \u201cexpert testimony concerning matters within the sphere of the behavioral sciences possesses the increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions, just as expert testimony dealing with the \u2018hard\u2019 sciences does.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. Then the court noted that the expert had testified that she had degrees in behavioral science and extensive experience in the field of child abuse and was familiar with research and literature in the field. Moreover, her testimony implied that \u201cthere is a well-defined, empirically verified, set of characteristics that a significant percentage of sexually abused children display.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. She also used \u201cthe vocabulary of scientific research.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court held that an expert \u201cwho has a background in behavioral sciences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>and who claims that her knowledge is based on studies, research, and the literature in the field, announces to the factfinder that the basis other testimony is \u2018scientific,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>is grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563-64; <em>see also State v. Perry, 347 </em>Or 110, 120, 218 P3d 95 (2009) (where expert, like expert in <em>Marrington, </em>\u201cwas presenting herself as an expert in her field whose knowledge was based, at least in part, on studies, research, and scientific literature,\u201d \u201cher testimony regarding delayed disclosure is scientific evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">We have employed both of those methods of evaluating whether a jury will perceive evidence as \u201cscientific.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Dulfu, </em>282 Or App 209, 215-16, 386 P3d 85 (2016), <em>rev allowed, </em>361 Or 100 (2017) (expert testimony was scientific because, as in <em>Marrington </em>and <em>Perry, </em>proponent \u201ctied [the expert\u2019s] ability to opine on possible motivations for possessing child pornography to his professional background and experience as a scientist\u201d); <em>State v. Branch, </em>243 Or App 309, 315, 259 P3d 103, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011) (evidence of distance derived from lidar device \u201cis based on the premise that measurements of distance can be derived through the lidar device\u2019s use of a certain scientific principle, <em>viz., </em>the speed of light\u201d; accordingly, the evidence \u201cdraws its convincing force from a scientific principle and would be more persuasive to the trier of fact due to its scientific nature\u201d); <em>State v. Sampson, </em>167 Or App 489, 496-97, 6 P3d 543, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 361 (2000) (persuasive force of drug recognition expert protocol \u201cemanates predominantly from the substance <em>and </em>the aura of the scientific principles on which its methodology is based\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We have also distinguished opinion evidence that is based exclusively on an expert\u2019s training and experience from scientific evidence. We explained that distinction in <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 279 P3d 361 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013). There, the defendant was charged with driving under the influence of a controlled substance and sought exclusion of an officer\u2019s opinion that she was under the influence of a controlled substance based on her performance during some components of a drug recognition expert (DRE) protocol that the officer had administered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>contending that the opinion testimony was scientific evidence for which the state had to lay a proper foundation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 250 Or App at 187. The trial court allowed the officer to testify to that opinion based on certain components of the DRE protocol, specifically, the defendant\u2019s BAC, her statements, the HGN test, her performance on FSTs,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> her general pupil size, and needle injection sites on her body. <em>Id. </em>at 189. The trial court excluded evidence based on the defendant\u2019s pulse rate, temperature, measurement of her pupils after a \u201cdark room test,\u201d and muscle examination, concluding that evidence about those things would suggest a scientific basis for the officer\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed, reprising her argument made before the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">We concluded that \u201cthe trial court properly admitted the challenged testimony as nonscientific expert opinion evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. We first explained that the defendant \u201cdoes not challenge the admissibility of any of the underlying evidence upon which [the officer] based his ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, the defendant \u201cimplicitly acknowledge [d]\u201d that the HGN and blood-alcohol-test evidence was admissible scientific evidence and that evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements made during an interview and her performance on the FSTs was independently admissible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">Instead, the defendant\u2019s only challenge was to \u201cthe admissibility of [the officer\u2019s] opinion, based on that underlying evidence, that defendant drove under the influence of a narcotic analgesic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that, because that opinion was based, in part, on scientific tests (the HGN test and the blood alcohol test) and couched in terms of the officer\u2019s investigative accuracy rate, the jury would perceive that his opinion itself was scientific. <em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, explaining that officers who have training and experience in recognizing signs of impairment can testify to their expert opinions of intoxication without first showing that the opinion-forming process was scientifically valid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c[T]he evidence showed that [the officer] was qualified, by virtue of considerable training and experience, to recognize the symptoms of drug impairment in the course of a DUII investigation. Based on such training and experience, police officers can\u2014and frequently do\u2014testify as to their opinions of whether an individual was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Moreover, we concluded, the fact that the officer\u2019s opinion relied in part on the results of scientific tests that had previously been recognized as reliable did not make the officer\u2019s opinion itself scientific and in need of a scientific foundation: \u201cThe fact that [officers] may rely in part on <em>independently admissible </em>scientific evidence, such as blood alcohol content and HGN test results, to reinforce their opinions, does not render those opinions inadmissible as unqualified scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Ultimately, we explained, \u201c[s]pecialized expert opinion evidence based on a witness\u2019s training and experience draws its force from that training and experience, but not necessarily from the mantle of science.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the officer \u201cdid not\u2014apart from his reference to independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>admissible scientific tests\u2014rely on the vocabulary of science\u201d and did not \u201csuggest that his conclusions had been reached through the application of a scientific method to collected data,\u201d and because the trial court had \u201cscrupulously sanitized the record of any evidence of a scientifically based protocol,\u201d the jury would not have perceived the officer\u2019s opinion to be based on science. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Thus, certain officers may be practical experts in recognizing intoxication, and, when they are, they may offer expert opinions on that topic without first showing that the process by which they arrive at their opinions is scientifically valid, provided that their testimony does not imply that it is based on science. <em>See </em>Strong, 71 Or L Rev at 368-69 (noting that propositions relied on by \u201cexperientially qualified experts\u201d are often adequately reliable for admission because of \u201cthe likely ability of the trier of fact to view them as what they are, the practical observations and assessments of persons who have had unusual specialized experiences\u201d; contrasting that type of evidence with expert scientific evidence). Officers may become practical experts based on their experience identifying and interacting with people who are intoxicated, as well as from their training. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>266 Or App 286, 296-97, 337 P3d 948 (2014) (jury would not perceive officer\u2019s testimony that the defendant was under the influence of marijuana, based on the officer\u2019s training and experience and the fact that the defendant \u201chad dilated pupils and red, puffy \u2018spider web\u2019 eyes,\u201d as \u201cscientific\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there are limits on training and experience as a \u201cnonscientific\u201d source of propositions. <em>O\u2019Key, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>321 Or at 296-97 (HGN evidence presented by an officer trained in administering the test is nevertheless scientific because \u201c [t]he value of HGN testing depends critically on the demonstrated scientific validity of\u2019 the \u201cproposition that there is a causal relationship between consumption of alcohol and the type of nystagmus measured by the HGN test,\u201d and that proposition will be perceived by the trier of fact as scientific because it is outside jurors\u2019 common knowledge of signs of intoxication).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">In summary, to be admissible, expert evidence must be relevant and helpful to the jury, and its probative value must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 409. In addition, if the expert evidence is \u201cscientific,\u201d it must be reliable under <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>Expert evidence is scientific if it \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 407. If evidence will be perceived by a jury as scientific and, therefore, have an \u201cunusually high degree of persuasive power,\u201d a court must ensure that the \u201cpersuasive appeal is legitimate.\u201d <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 291. Thus, for example, expert testimony regarding physiological or behavioral responses that are outside the realm of common knowledge is scientific evidence, as is evidence that is presented as being based, at least in part, on studies, research, and scientific literature. In contrast, expert testimony that is based on an expert\u2019s training and experience is not scientific evidence if it is, and will be recognized by the trier of fact as, merely the \u201cpractical observations and assessments\u201d of a person who has had \u201cunusual specialized experiences.\u201d Strong, 71 Or L Rev at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">B. <em>Parties\u2019 Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">With that understanding of the law, we turn to defendant\u2019s argument, which, as noted above, is that the trier of fact will perceive testimony that a person \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn or one-leg-stand test as scientific. At the outset, defendant concedes that testimony describing a subject\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests is not scientific evidence subject to the admissibility requirements of OEC 702 because, as the court stated in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests \u201cobtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>their legitimacy from effects of intoxication based on propositions of common knowledge.\u201d 321 Or at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">That is, the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests allow officers, and, through the officers\u2019 testimony, the jury, to spot commonly known signs of intoxication. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Clark, </em>286 Or 33, 39-40, 593 P2d 123 (1979), which took \u201cjudicial notice of a list of commonly known \u2018observable symptoms\u2019 or \u2018signs\u2019 of alcohol intoxication\u201d); <em>see also State v. Mazzola, </em>356 Or 804, 818, 345 P3d 424 (2015) (describing \u201c [t] he rationale behind the admission in DUII cases of the results of FSTs\u201d like the walk and turn and one-leg-stand tests as \u201c\u2018testing] balance and divided attention, or the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Horn, </em>185 F Supp 2d 530, 558 (D Md 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted))).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The jury will not perceive evidence describing the test performance as scientific because the evidence will relate to commonly known \u201cobservable symptoms\u201d or \u201csigns\u201d of alcohol impairment that comport with jurors\u2019 own knowledge and experience and, perhaps, additional signs identified by the officer based on his or her practical expertise. <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 297 (concluding that HGN test evidence is scientific because, \u201calthough the function of the HGN test, like other [FSTs], is to spot \u2018observable symptoms\u2019 or \u2018signs\u2019 of alcohol impairment, it is different from other [FSTs] because it rests on a manifestation of alcohol consumption not easily recognized or understood by most people\u201d); <em>see also Horn, </em>185 F Supp 2d at 558 (\u201cBecause evidence procured by administration of psychomotor FSTs is within the common experience of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ordinary citizen, the majority of courts that have addressed the issue generally consider [evidence describing performance on] psychomotor FSTs to be nonscientific evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">Against that backdrop, defendant\u2019s argument is that, when an officer testifies that someone \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn test or the one-leg-stand test, the probative value of that testimony rests on a scientific proposition distinct from the commonly known signs of intoxication and from the officer\u2019s practical expertise in identifying impairment. As explained above, both the officer and the jury can recognize signs of impairment that a test subject might exhibit during performance of an FST. Moreover, if the officer has training and extensive experience administering FSTs to suspected impaired drivers, the officer may have practical expertise in recognizing when a test subject\u2019s performance indicates impairment. <em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 194-95 (recognizing officer\u2019s qualification to offer nonscientific expert opinion of intoxication based on training and experience). However, defendant argues, the conclusion that the subject has \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the test because he or she exhibited a particular number of signs of impairment, or standardized clues, relies on more than a common or even a specialized understanding of the signs themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In defendant\u2019s view, the conclusion\u2014\u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d\u2014relies on an external scoring rubric that does not derive from common understanding or the officer\u2019s practical expertise. For the walk-and-turn test, the conclusion that a subject fails the test rests on the proposition that exhibiting two of a particular group of signs of impairment during performance of the test indicates that the subject is objectively, measurably impaired. Because the conclusion \u201cfail\u201d relies on that external scoring rubric, defendant argues, \u201ca jury is likely to view the [result of the] test[] as conclusive scientific evidence of alcohol impairment.\u201d Moreover, defendant points out, scientific research and testing is exactly how the scoring rubric was developed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In support of his argument, defendant relies on cases from other jurisdictions, which have held that, although, as a general matter, an officer\u2019s testimony regarding a driver\u2019s conduct during FSTs does not require a scientific foundation, testimony that the driver \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the FSTs does require such a foundation because it will be perceived as scientific by the jury. For example, in <em>State v. Meador, </em>674 So 2d 826, 832-33 (Fla App 1996), the court explained that using terms such as \u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d and \u201cpoints\u201d \u201ccreates a potential for enhancing the significance of the [officer\u2019s] observations\u201d because the terms give \u201can aura of scientific validity\u201d to the observations. Similarly, in <em>Horn, </em>185 F Supp 2d at 559, the court concluded that, although an officer may describe his or her observations of a driver\u2019s conduct during FSTs,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201c[t]o interject into this essentially descriptive process technical terminology regarding the number of \u2018standardized clues\u2019 that should be looked for or opinions of the officer that the subject \u2018failed\u2019 the \u2018test,\u2019 especially when such testimony cannot be shown to have resulted from reliable methodology, unfairly cloaks it with unearned credibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Thus, defendant concludes, the term \u201cfail,\u201d along with the term \u201cpass,\u201d is scientific testimony for which the state must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>lay an adequate foundation. Accordingly, defendant argues, the trial court erred in allowing the testimony without any foundation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The state responds that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude testimony that he passed or failed the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests. The state argues that the terms \u201cpass\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d are not scientific because they are \u201cordinary words of common understanding that are used in many contexts outside the scientific realm.\u201d Here, in the state\u2019s view, the terms \u201cmerely stand as shorthand for the officer\u2019s testimony regarding whether defendant\u2019s performance on the test demonstrated sufficient impairment to indicate intoxication\u2014an opinion that the officer is permitted to offer.\u201d According to the state, the jury would understand the term \u201cfail\u201d to simply mean \u201cdeficient, inadequate, or unsuccessful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The state also argues that, because the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests are based on \u201cprinciples easily recognized or understood by most people,\u201d Duenas\u2019s use of the term \u201cfail\u201d did not affect the jury\u2019s ability to weigh and evaluate Duenas\u2019s opinion based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In support of its argument, the state relies on <em>State v. Shadden, </em>290 Kan 803, 825-29, 235 P3d 436, 451-53 (2010), which sets out the reasoning of several other state cases that have concluded that field-sobriety-testing terminology (including \u201cfail,\u201d as well as many other terms, including \u201cimpairment,\u201d \u201csobriety,\u201d and \u201ctests\u201d) is admissible without a showing of scientific reliability. The opinions cited in <em>Shadden </em>conclude that the terminology merely \u201c \u2018make [s] plain the tests\u2019 purpose as indicators of impairment\u2019\u201d and the terms are \u201c\u2018nothing more than descriptive\u2019\u201d of a test subject\u2019s inadequate performance. 209 Kan at 828-29, 235 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>P3d at 453 (quoting <em>State v.

As explained above, the state is correct that Due\u00f1as was entitled to offer his nonscientific expert opinion, based on his training and experience, that defendant was impaired. <em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 194. However, we disagree with the state\u2019s second premise: The term \u201cfail\u201d is not merely \u201cshorthand for the officer\u2019s testimony regarding whether defendant\u2019s performance on the test demonstrated sufficient impairment to indicate intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">As the prosecutor stated at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the FSTs at issue are \u201cstandardized tests.\u201d In this context, \u201cstandardize\u201d means \u201cto arrange or order the component items of a test * * * so that the probability of their eliciting a designated class of response varies with some quantifiable psychological or behavioral attribute, function, or characteristic.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2223 (unabridged ed 2002), <em>see also id. </em>at 2224 (defining \u201cstandard test\u201d as a test \u201cwhose reliability has been established by obtaining an average score of a significantly large number of individuals for use as a standard of comparison\u201d). Thus, as proffered by the state, and as would be understood by the jury, the terms \u201cpass\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d imply that there is a correlation between \u201ca designated class of response\u201d to the test prompts\u2014that is, the presence of a certain number of clues\u2014and \u201csome quantifiable psychological or behavioral attribute\u201d\u2014that is, intoxication\u2014and that that correlation has been verified by application of the scientific method.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>In this case, separately from describing defendant\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn test, Due\u00f1as testified that defendant showed four out of eight possible clues on the test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He was asked, \u201cIs that a passing or failing score?\u201d He responded, \u201cFail.\u201d Later, separately, Due\u00f1as testified to his opinion that defendant was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In stating that defendant \u201cfailed\u201d the test, Due\u00f1as did not merely express his own opinion that defendant was impaired based on the particular deficiencies in defendant\u2019s performance. Due\u00f1as testified that defendant\u2019s numerical score on the test, alone, indicated failure\u2014four out of eight clues is a \u201cfailing score.\u201d He did not tie that conclusion to any observations about the deficiencies in defendant\u2019s performance or to a personal scoring system. When an officer testifies that a defendant \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn test or the one-leg-stand test, that testimony relies on an external scoring rubric to prove that the defendant was objectively, measurably impaired. Indeed, the state acknowledged as much by arguing, in response to defendant\u2019s pretrial motion, that FSTs are standardized tests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The state suggests that, although the evidence concerned defendant\u2019s score on a standardized test and was offered to prove intoxication, a jury would not perceive the evidence as scientific.

A jury\u2019s understanding of whether testimony is scientific is not based exclusively on whether the expert witness uses scientific-sounding jargon or words that are susceptible to only scientific meanings. Juries are capable of recognizing scientific substance when they hear it. <em>Sampson, </em>167 Or App at 496-97 (explaining the scientific principles underlying DRE evidence and noting that \u201cit is clear that DRE draws its authority from scientific principles\u201d); <em>see also O'Key, </em>321 Or at 296-97 (holding that HGN-test evidence is \u201cscientific\u201d because such evidence \u201cpurports to draw its convincing force from\u201d the scientific proposition that there is \u201ca causal relationship between consumption of alcohol and the type of nystagmus measured by the HGN test\u201d and that relationship \u201cis not within the realm of common knowledge of the average person\u201d); <em>Branch, </em>243 Or App at 315 (the jury will perceive distance evidence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>lidar as scientific because lidar uses a scientific principle\u2014 the speed of light\u2014to measure distance).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">Expert testimony that implicitly rests on scientific propositions can have just as much persuasive power as testimony that makes its scientific backing explicit. That is, the fact that an expert who explicitly relies on her scientific education and uses scientific jargon \u201cannounces to the factfinder that the basis of her testimony is \u2018scientific.\" <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 563, does not mean that the propositions underlying the testimony of any expert who does not do those things necessarily will not be perceived as \u201cscientific.\u201d <em>See O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 292-95 (focusing on the \u201cpropositions\u201d underlying the expert\u2019s testimony to ascertain whether they have increased potential \u201cto influence the trier of fact as <em>scientific </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>assertions\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). The propositions underlying an expert\u2019s testimony are a critical focus of the inquiry, not merely the words of the testimony. <em>See Marrington, </em>335 at 561 (quoting O\u2019Key\u2019s reference to \u201cscientific assertions\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 563 (noting that the expert\u2019s reference to \u201c\u2018the characteristics of sexually abused children\u2019 <em>impl[ied] </em>that there is a well-defined, empirically verified, set of characteristics that a significant percentage of sexually abused children display\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>accord </em>Strong, 71 Or L Rev at 353, 361 (noting that an expert witness\u2019s \u201cfunction is to supply general propositions\u201d and that \u201cthe value of expert opinion critically depends on the reliability of the general propositions utilized by the expert\u201d). As we understand it, that is a focus of the inquiry because the jury will understand that the expert\u2019s testimony rests on underlying propositions about the topic of the testimony and, because the expert is knowledgeable about the topic, is likely to believe that those propositions are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Here, a jury would perceive the proposition underlying the testimony that a defendant \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn test or one-leg-stand test as scientific. As we have explained, the proposition underlying that testimony is that the test is able to measure impairment objectively and that a specific numerical score can prove that the subject is impaired. As defendant points out, that proposition is grounded in scientific research. Moreover, that proposition is distinct from, and cannot be derived from, commonly recognized signs of impairment or the more detailed understanding of signs of impairment that an officer obtains from his or her specialized training and experience. The only way to create an accurate numerical scoring system for measuring impairment objectively is to conduct scientific research and testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Some simple factual propositions are easily enough arrived at through training and experience that jurors will not perceive them as <em>scientific\u2014e.g., </em>an officer\u2019s knowledge that red, \u201c\u2018spider web\u2019 eyes\u201d indicate recent marijuana consumption. <em>Wilson, </em>266 Or App at 296-97. However, in our view, where, as here, there is no reasonable way for the expert to have derived the proposition other than through \u201capplication of a scientific method to collected data,\u201d <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 564, the jury will perceive the proposition to be based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>on science.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 296-97 (assertion of causal relationship between alcohol consumption and nystagmus will be perceived as scientific); <em>State v.

That is true even in the absence of testimony explicitly referring to the scientific backing for the testimony. A party seeking to introduce expert testimony that is based on scientific testing cannot avoid the requirement of laying a proper foundation by having the expert testify only to the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"ato-dedup-0\">In short, our task is to discern whether, when an officer testifies that a defendant \u201cfailed\u201d the walk-and-turn or one-leg-stand test, the jury will think that science supports the propositions that alcohol impairment can be objectively measured through the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tests and that the defendant\u2019s performance showed that he was objectively impaired. We conclude that, using their ordinary powers of deduction, jurors will think so. Accordingly, the state here had to establish that, in fact, alcohol impairment is reliably measured through the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests before introducing the testimony that defendant \u201cfailed\u201d the tests to prove that he was impaired.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">To be clear, our holding concerns only the admissibility of evidence that defendant \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the FSTs. That was the subject of defendant\u2019s motion. Consequently, our holding does not concern the admissibility of the officer\u2019s observations of defendant\u2019s conduct during the FSTs in this case, which defendant concedes is not scientific evidence. Furthermore, our holding is only that, in order for testimony regarding whether defendant \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the FSTs to be admissible, the state needed to lay a proper foundation, which it did not attempt to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">D. <em>Harmlessness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Finally, we evaluate whether the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the evidence was harmless. <em>See </em>OEC 103(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(an evidentiary error does not require reversal unless the error is prejudicial). \u201cWe will affirm a defendant\u2019s conviction if there is little likelihood that erroneously admitted evidence affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, 672, 307 P3d 552 (2013); <em>see also State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict?\u201d). The focus of our inquiry \u201cis on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32. \u201cIf erroneously admitted evidence relates to a central factual issue in the case, it is more likely to have affected the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Whitmore, </em>257 Or App at 672. \u201cBecause scientifically based testimony by an expert witness has manifest potential to influence the jury, erroneous admission of such evidence weighs against a determination that the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">Here, the central factual issues, for purposes of defendant\u2019s DUII conviction, were whether defendant had a BAC of .08 or above or was \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d when he drove. ORS 813.010(1) (\u201cA person commits the offense of [DUII] if the person drives a vehicle while the person: (a) Has 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood of the person as shown by chemical analysis of the breath or blood of the person *** [or] (b) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor ***.\u201d). As we have explained, in testifying that defendant failed the walk-and-turn test, Due\u00f1as indicated to the jury that the walk-and-turn test measures impairment objectively and that defendant\u2019s performance showed, based on an objective scoring rubric, that he was impaired. Thus, the testimony bore directly on whether defendant was \u201cunder the influence of an intoxicating liquor.\u201d ORS 813.010(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">As noted above, and as demonstrated by the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of scientific evidence in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>scientific evidence has manifest potential to influence the jury; that persuasive effect is the reason that scientific evidence must meet the <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>factors before it is admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Thus, here, when Due\u00f1as testified that defendant\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn test was objectively a failure, he presented evidence that had persuasive value apart from Duenas\u2019s observations and his opinion that defendant was impaired. <em>See Whitmore, </em>257 Or App at 672-73 (one consideration in harmlessness analysis is \u201cwhether the finder of fact would have regarded the evidence as duplicative, cumulative, or unhelpful in its deliberations\u201d). Although that evidence consisted of only one word, it presented the jury with a separate, ostensibly objective, reason to believe that defendant was under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The state\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s BAC was not so overwhelming that we can be confident that the jury would not have considered whether defendant was \u201cunder the influence of an intoxicating liquor.\u201d ORS 813.010(l)(b). The state presented defendant\u2019s intoxilyzer results\u2014two numbers, 0.082 and 0.079 that represented separate \u201cblows,\u201d and a \u201cfinal result\u201d of 0.07 percent\u2014and testimony from a forensic scientist that, using retrograde extrapolation, he had calculated that defendant\u2019s BAC could have been over the legal limit of 0.08 percent when he drove. However, as noted, the \u201cfinal result\u201d of the intoxilyzer test was 0.07 percent, and the forensic scientist acknowledged that, when defendant drove, his BAC could have been the same as the intoxylizer samples. Given that evidence, the jury may well have had reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or above and, instead, evaluated whether defendant was under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On that question, the evidence likewise was not overwhelming. The state presented evidence from Due\u00f1as that defendant admitted to drinking two beers prior to driving, had a \u201cmoderate odor\u201d of alcohol, had a relaxed look and watery eyes, was standoffish at first, failed the HGN test, and displayed a variety of clues indicating intoxication on the walk-and-turn test and one clue on the one-leg-stand test. However, Due\u00f1as also testified that defendant\u2019s motor skills and balance were intact, his speech was normal, and his demeanor was polite. As noted above, our focus in evaluating harmlessness \u201cis on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>and compelling.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32.

Because we agree with defendant that the testimony was scientific and it is undisputed that the state did not lay any foundation for the testimony in this case, we do not consider that question here. <em>See State v.

As explained in the text, we agree that such testimony was inadmissible in the absence of a <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>foundation. If the court had granted defendant\u2019s motion to exclude such testimony and Due\u00f1as had sought to use the word \u201cfail\u201d as shorthand for his own view, the parties could have litigated whether, and what, additional explanation would he required to make that testimony admissible under the court\u2019s pretrial ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The dissent argues that Duenas\u2019s additional testimony that he does not always arrest a driver who fails the walk-and-turn test undercuts our conclusion that the term \u201cfail\u201d implies that there is a correlation between the presence of a certain number of clues on the walk-and-turn test and impairment and that that correlation has been verified by application of the scientific method. 286 Or App at 611 (Hadlock, C. J., dissenting). First, we reiterate that, as explained above, Duenas\u2019s testimony was not before the court when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude testimony that he had \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d the tests. At that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>time, the state argued that the fact that the tests were \u201cstandardized\u201d\u2014which, as explained above, indicates that they were designed to show a correlation between exhibiting a certain number of clues and impairment\u2014weighed in favor of admitting the evidence. At no point during the motion hearing or during the trial did the state suggest that the test result was merely Duenas\u2019s own opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"ACp\">Second, while we acknowledge that the fact that Due\u00f1as does not rely solely on a person\u2019s failure of the walk-and-turn test as a basis for arrest may undercut the persuasiveness of the underlying proposition\u2014that the test measures impairment accurately\u2014contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, it does not suggest that the conclusion of \u201cfailure\u201d was merely Duenas\u2019s own opinion. It suggests the opposite: It shows that Duenas\u2019s statement that defendant failed the test does not express Duenas\u2019s own opinion that defendant was impaired. Given that, we do not understand what subjective opinion Due\u00f1as could have been expressing by his testimony that defendant\u2019s score of \u201cfour out of eight clues\u201d was a \u201cfailing score.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> To the extent that the state is arguing that admission of a small amount of scientific evidence would not affect the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence as a whole, that is an argument that any error is harmless, and, accordingly, we do not consider it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b633-4\"> The dissent asserts that those cases are distinguishable because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auj-dedup-0\">\u201cjuries will understand that science is involved when a witness testifies about such things as distance measurement by lidar and measurement of alcohol impairment through HGN testing.

By contrast, in the dissent\u2019s view, Duenas\u2019s testimony in this case was only to \u201c \u2018propositions of common knowledge\u2019 \u201d and \u201cneither Duenas\u2019s testimony nor any other evidence admitted at trial would have suggested to the jury that Duenas\u2019s determination that defendant failed the test was based on the sort of science-based protocol that a jury might give extra weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624 (Hadlock, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">As explained in the text, we disagree that Duenas\u2019s testimony was confined to propositions of common knowledge, because he also testified to the conclusion that a test subject \u201cfails\u201d the test by exhibiting a specific number of standardized clues. Certainly, from testimony describing a subject\u2019s performance on a test, the jury will be able to assess whether he or she performed well or poorly. However, that ability to evaluate performance is different from the knowledge that exhibiting two or more clues is a \u201cfailing score.\u201d That a subject \u201cfails\u201d the test if he or she exhibits two clues is not within the realm of common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Moreover, in our view, in <em>Marrington, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the distinction that the dissent draws between lidar and HGN testing, on the one hand, and the propositions underlying the conclusion that someone has failed the walk- and-turn test, on the other hand. The court explained that \u201cexpert testimony concerning matters within the sphere of the behavioral sciences possesses increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions, just as expert testimony dealing with the \u2018hard\u2019 sciences does.\u201d 335 Or at 561 (rejecting state\u2019s proposed distinction between evidence of \u201csexual abuse syndrome\u201d and evidence of \u201c\u2018typical\u2019 reactions of child victims,\u201d which could be admitted based on \u201c\u2018some kind of experiential or observational foundation\u2019\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b635-5\"> The dissent characterizes our holding here as being that the jury would \u201cperceive the proposition <em>that defendant failed a walk-and-turn test </em>to be based on science.\u201d 286 Or App at 621 (Hadlock, C. J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; emphasis added). However, the emphasized text reflects a proposition supplied by the dissent on which we do not rely. As we have explained, in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the court held that the proper focus of our analysis is on the propositions <em>underlying </em>an expert\u2019s testimony, not just the words of the testimony. 321 Or at 292-95. Thus, the question for us here is whether the jury would perceive as scientific the propositions that the test is able to measure impairment objectively and that a specific numerical score can prove that the subject is impaired, because, as we have explained, those are the propositions underlying the statement that a subject \u201cfailed\u201d the test by exhibiting a certain number of clues. We conclude that it would because, as we explain in the text, those propositions can be derived only by application of the scientific method to collected data, not through practical expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">That understanding of the proper analysis also leads us to disagree with the dissent\u2019s reliance on the facts that \u201cDue\u00f1as did not expound on <em>why </em>a person fails the walk-and-turn test if he or she exhibits four clues,\u201d that he \u201cdid not inform the jury that the failing score was based on a scoring rubric developed through research sponsored by NHTSA\u201d and that \u201che did not testify that the score was based on the application of a scientific method to collected data\u201d to conclude that the jury would not understand the testimony as \u201cscientific.\u201d 286 Or App at 622-23 (Hadlock, C. J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent\u2019s reliance on those facts does not acknowledge that, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>O'Key, </em>the role of an expert is to provide the jury with reliable propositions; juries rely on the correctness of the propositions underlying experts\u2019 testimony, not just their express conclusions. <em>See </em>Strong, 71 Or L Rev at 353, 361 (noting that an expert witness\u2019s \u201cfunction is to supply general propositions\u201d and that \u201cthe value of expert opinion critically depends on the reliability of the general propositions utilized by the expert\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> Regarding the cases from other jurisdictions relied upon by the state, we note that the broader challenges in those cases\u2014challenges to a wide variety of terms even including \u201cimpairment\u201d\u2014make much of those courts\u2019 reasoning inapposite here, where defendant challenges only the use of \u201cpass\u201d and \u201cfail.\u201d Moreover, we find the cited reasoning unpersuasive because, as explained in the text, use of the terms \u201cpass\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d is not \u201cnothing more than descriptive\u201d of a subject\u2019s performance on the test. An officer\u2019s testimony about the subject\u2019s behavior during the test, as well as the officer\u2019s practical expert opinion on whether that behavior, together with the officer\u2019s other observations, indicated that the subject was impaired, are \u201cdescriptive\u201d of the subject\u2019s performance. In our view, the addition of the term \u201cfail\u201d superimposes on the officer\u2019s otherwise descriptive testimony an external scientific conclusion offered to prove that the test subject is objectively, measurably impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">We do agree with the court in <em>Campoy </em>that terms like \u201cpass\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d \u201cmake plain the tests\u2019 purpose as indicators of impairment.\u201d 214 Ariz at 136, 149 P3d at 760. However, we disagree to the extent that <em>Campoy </em>held that testimony that relies on the tests to indicate objective, measurable impairment based on an external scoring rubric is not scientific. When evidence that a subject failed the test is used to show that the subject was objectively, measurably impaired, the ultimate underlying proposition is that the test validly measures impairment\u2014that is, that there is verified, reliable correlation between intoxication and failure of the test. And the jury will understand that. Consequently, \u201cthe value of [the conclusion that a subject failed the test] depends critically on the demonstrated scientific validity of that proposition,\u201d O\u2019Key, 321 Or at 296-97, and the evidence may not be presented to the jury in the absence of a showing of scientific validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b639-5\">HADLOCK, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGSm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The majority has comprehensively and accurately reviewed the Oregon case law related to the admissibility of scientific evidence. <em>See </em>286 Or App at 595-605.1 have no quarrel with its description of the cases and the fundamental principles that they establish. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of that law to the facts of this case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">As part of his investigation of whether defendant had committed the crime of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), Deputy Due\u00f1as administered three field sobriety tests (FSTs). At trial, Due\u00f1as testified about defendant\u2019s performance on those tests. First, Due\u00f1as explained how the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test works, described his observations of defendant\u2019s eye movements, and asserted that defendant had exhibited six out of six clues on that test, meaning that he had failed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">On direct examination by the prosecutor, Due\u00f1as then described the walk-and-turn FST, which he explained is \u201cbroken up into an instructional phase and a walking phase\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u201cThe first part of the test is to set the\u2014have the person stand with his right foot in front of his left in a heel to toe fashion with his arms at his side and to remain in that position until I\u2019m done explaining the rest of the test, <em>i.e., </em>the walking test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\u201cQ. And after you explain the test, what do you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">\u201cA. After I explain the walking test, I watch the defendant and make sure he takes the necessary steps. The nine steps before the turn and the nine steps after the turn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>I\u2019m making sure that he keeps his hands to his side. He doesn\u2019t stop walking, that he continues walking heel to toe and I should backtrack. He\u2019s doing this on a line. In this case, [defendant] was doing it on an imaginary line and I\u2019m making sure that he stays on that line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Due\u00f1as testified that, after explaining the walking test, he demonstrated the test to defendant before asking him to perform the test himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Due\u00f1as then described defendant\u2019s performance on the test, explaining that defendant had started to walk before Due\u00f1as told him to, that\u2014after Due\u00f1as told him to wait until Due\u00f1as had explained the rest of the test\u2014 defendant moved his foot \u201clike he couldn\u2019t maintain his balance\u201d, that defendant then took eight steps instead of nine, and that defendant \u201cdid an improper turn,\u201d not in the way that Due\u00f1as had demonstrated. Due\u00f1as explained that he looks for \u201ceight clues\u201d in observing a person\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn test, and he testified that defendant exhibited four of those clues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cA. He started too soon, unable to maintain balance in the instructional phase, the improper number of steps for the first set of nine steps and the improper turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\u201cQ. But generally, as he was walking performing the nine steps down that imaginary line, he did pretty well on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Defendant does not contend that any of that testimony should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The prosecutor then asked Due\u00f1as about the third FST that he administered to defendant, the one-leg-stand test. Again, Due\u00f1as explained the physical motions that the test involves, primarily raising one foot off of the ground with a pointed toe. Defendant showed only one clue on that test, putting his foot down once after he had succeeded in standing on one leg for between 21 and 30 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">At that point, the prosecutor realized that he had forgotten to ask Due\u00f1as about defendant\u2019s \u201cscore\u201d on the walk-and-turn test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u201cQ. And I should back up, I apologize I forgot to ask this. You testified that he showed four out of eight clues on the walk and turn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201cQ. Is that a passing or a failing score?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cA. <em>Foil\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">It is the last word of that testimony\u2014\u201cFail\u201d\u2014to which defendant objected below and which the majority concludes requires reversal of his conviction. According to the majority, Duenas\u2019s testimony that defendant failed the walk-and-turn test is \u201cscientific evidence\u201d for which a foundation had to be laid under <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995). I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The majority observes, correctly, that Duenas\u2019s conclusion that defendant failed the walk-and-turn test was based on a scoring rubric developed through research and testing sponsored by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). 286 Or App at 607 at n 11. The majority acknowledges that the jury was not informed of that fact. Nonetheless, the majority asserts that the jury would have understood Duenas\u2019s testimony that defendant failed the walk-and-turn test to be based on \u201capplication of the scientific method\u201d because \u201cthere is no reasonable way for the expert to have derived the assertion other than through \u2018application of a scientific method to collect data.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614 (quoting <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 564, 73 P3d 911 (2003)). Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, \u201cthe jury [would] perceive the proposition [that defendant failed a walk-and-turn test] to be based on science\u201d even though neither Due\u00f1as nor any other witness testified to that effect. <em>Id. </em>at 614-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">I disagree because, in my view, Duenas\u2019s testimony would have conveyed nothing more to the jury than his <em>own </em>conclusion\u2014based on his observations of defendant\u2019s lack of balance and difficulty following instructions\u2014that defendant had failed the walk-and-turn test, which Due\u00f1as took into account in assessing whether defendant was impaired. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Nothing in Duenas\u2019s testimony would have led the jury to believe that there was a scientific basis for his conclusion that defendant had failed the test. Accordingly, and as explained in more detail below, I would affirm the trial court on the basis that Duenas\u2019s testimony was not scientific evidence that required a <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">As the majority explains, courts serve a gate-keeping function with respect to scientific evidence because of the danger that \u201cjurors would view the evidence as having \u2018an unusually high degree of persuasive power\u2019 because of the perception that it is based on scientific assertions [.] \u201d <em>State v. Dulfu, </em>282 Or App 209, 214-15, 386 P3d 85 (2016), <em>rev allowed, </em>361 Or 100 (2017) (quoting <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 291-92). Evidence is not \u201cscientific\u201d merely because it draws force from an expert witness\u2019s training and experience. <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 195, 279 P3d 361 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013). Rather, what matters is whether the evidence \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 407. Thus, a court assessing whether evidence is scientific \u201cmust determine whether the expert\u2019s assertions \u2018possess significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact <em>as scientific assertions.\u2019\u201d Marrington, </em>335 Or at 562 (quoting <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 292 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In this case, Due\u00f1as explained to the jury\u2014in testimony that the majority acknowledges was admissible and not \u201cscientific\u201d\u2014that defendant had exhibited four clues in taking the walk-and-turn test. Due\u00f1as then testified that defendant\u2019s score on that test was \u201cFail,\u201d and he later elaborated, on cross-examination, that a person fails the walk-and-turn test if he or she exhibits at least two clues. Due\u00f1as also testified that, based on his training and experience, he would not arrest a person solely on the basis that the person had exhibited two clues on the walk-and-turn test. Rather, Deunas suggested that he would take \u201ceverything\u201d into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Beyond that, Due\u00f1as did not inform the jury of the basis for his conclusion that defendant had failed the test. That is, Due\u00f1as did not expound on <em>why </em>a person fails the walk-and-turn test if he or she exhibits four clues by starting the test before being told to do so, not maintaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>balance, taking an incorrect number of steps, and making an improper turn. Due\u00f1as did not inform the jury that the failing score was based on a scoring rubric developed through research sponsored by NHTSA, he did not testify that the score was based on the \u201c\u2018application of a scientific method to collected data.'\" 286 Or App at 614 (quoting <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 564), and he did not in any other way suggest that the score had a scientific basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Given that context, I see no basis for concluding, as the majority does, that the jury would have understood that Duenas\u2019s \u201cpreposition to be based on science\u201d and that \u201cthere is a correlation between the * * * presence of a certain number of clues [on the walk-and-turn test]\u2014and *** intoxication\u2014and that that correlation has been verified by application of the scientific method.\u201d 286 Or App at 610, 614-15. Indeed, that conclusion is undercut by Duenas\u2019s testimony that he would not arrest a person for DUII solely because the person exhibited two clues on the walk-and-turn test\u2014 even though that is a failing score.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">I agree with the majority that there can be situations where the jury will perceive that an expert witness\u2019s testimony is based on science even when the expert does not explicitly say so. The examples the majority supplies are apt: juries will understand that science is involved when a witness testifies about such things as distance measurement by lidar and measurement of alcohol impairment through HGN testing. 286 Or App at 612-13. But that is because those topics by their very nature \u201cpurport [] to draw [their] convincing force from a principle of science\u201d and have value that \u201cdepends critically on the demonstrated scientific validity\u201d of that principle. <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 296-97. The significance of those testing mechanisms and their results lies outside the common knowledge of lay persons. <em>See Id. </em>at 297 (noting that\u2014unlike the HGN test, which \u201cis not within the realm of common knowledge\u201d\u2014the walk-and-turn test obtains its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>legitimacy \u201cfrom effects of intoxication based on propositions of common knowledge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Here, in contrast, Due\u00f1as testified only to \u201cpropositions of common knowledge\u201d in describing the four ways in which defendant performed poorly on the walk-and-turn test, exhibiting a lack of balance and difficulty following Duenas\u2019s instructions. And neither Duenas\u2019s testimony nor any other evidence admitted at trial would have suggested to the jury that Duenas\u2019s determination that defendant failed the test was based on the sort of science-based protocol that a jury might give extra weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In that regard, this case is analogous to <em>Rambo, </em>in which the defendant challenged a drug recognition expert (DRE) officer\u2019s testimony that the defendant\u2019s performance on several sobriety tests indicated that she was under the influence of narcotic analgesics. 250 Or App at 186. The defendant argued that the DRE officer\u2019s \u201cultimate opinion constituted scientific evidence, because it was based on portions of a series of tests that formed his procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted). We disagreed, explaining that\u2014even though the officer relied on scientific evidence, including HGN evidence, in forming his opinion\u2014the officer\u2019s <em>testimony </em>did not \u201crely on the vocabulary of science [or] suggest that his conclusions had been reached through the application of a scientific method to collected data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. To the contrary, the trial court had \u201cscrupulously sanitized the record of any evidence of a scientificially-based protocol, thereby mitigating the risk that [the officer\u2019s] testimony would be given unfair weight beyond the credentials that he claimed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Similarly here, although application of a science-based protocol formed the underlying basis of Duenas\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn test indicated a failure on that test, no evidence in the record would have suggested that fact to the jury. Moreover, defendant\u2019s performance on the walk-and-turn .test itself was a matter within the jury\u2019s ability to assess using common knowledge of the effects of alcohol intoxication. <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 297. Accordingly, the jury would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>surprised by\u2014nor would it have given undue \u201cscientific\u201d weight to\u2014Duenas\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s multiple errors in performing the walk-and-turn task meant that defendant failed that test. In the end, Duenas\u2019s testimony on that point told the jury little more than it could have concluded itself\u2014that a person who cannot maintain his balance or follow directions when taking a walk-and-turn test has \u201cfailed\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">For those reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Duenas\u2019s testimony that defendant failed the walk-and-turn test was scientific evidence that was inadmissible without a proper <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>foundation. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> Defense counsel asked Due\u00f1as on cross-examination whether \u201ca specific part of the NHTSA manual is to instruct [the person taking the FST] not to start and then you observe after that if they start in violation of your rules?\u201d Due\u00f1as answered affirmatively. But even that reference to the NHTSA manual, elicited by defense counsel, did not inform the jury that NHTSA had developed the FSTs or that those tests were based on scientific research.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
