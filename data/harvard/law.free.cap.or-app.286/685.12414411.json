J.</author>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Defendant was found guilty of having committed multiple crimes, including possession of a controlled substance (PCS) and delivery of a controlled substance (DCS). Both the PCS charge and the DCS charge arose from a commercial transaction involving hydrocodone. On appeal, defendant challenges his conviction for DCS and the determination of guilt on the PCS charge, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of text messages that police officers found on a cell phone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The narcotics investigation that led to the charges against defendant began with a traffic stop of defendant\u2019s car in January 2011. Trooper Looney, who assisted another trooper during that stop, searched the car with defendant\u2019s consent. Looney found\u2014inside a speaker box\u2014bags of marijuana, a digital scale with marijuana residue, and empty sandwich bags. Defendant\u2019s phone \u201cwas ringing constantly\u201d as Looney searched the car, \u201calmost non stop, call after call after call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">A few months later, Looney responded to the location of another traffic stop involving defendant; this time, the stopped vehicle was a pickup truck that defendant had been driving. Looney advised defendant that he was wanted on a warrant, handcuffed him, and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant consented to a search of the truck, but said that if Looney \u201cfound anything illegal, it\u2019s not his.\u201d On the driver\u2019s seat of the truck, Looney found a prescription pill bottle that contained two knotted baggies that were \u201cconsistent with packing for * * * illicit delivery.\u201d The name on the bottle was not defendant\u2019s. Later testing revealed that the bottle contained hydrocodone tablets. Two cell phones were sitting in the driver\u2019s area and \u201cwere constantly ringing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Looney contacted another officer, Trooper Timm, who worked as a narcotics detective. Looney wanted Timm to investigate the two cell phones that Looney had found in the truck, one Samsung and one Motorola. Officers obtained a warrant to search the phones. Defendant was ultimately charged with multiple crimes, including those at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">At defendant\u2019s trial, Timm testified that he took photographs of every text message that was on the Samsung phone. When Timm began describing those text messages, defendant objected on hearsay grounds to testimony about the statements made, via text message, by somebody other than defendant. The court overruled the objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you know, I\u2019m going to overrule the objection because there\u2019s evidence from which you could find these are [defendant\u2019s] phone [s]. Therefore, what he would say would not be hearsay because it would be a statement of his own. <em>And what he was receiving and responding to would be in effect him agreeing or adopting or responding to that.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant disputed the court\u2019s reasoning, arguing that, \u201cto the extent that [defendant was] responding without confirming, it\u2019s not an adoptive admission\u201d of the statements \u201ccoming from some unknown third party.\u201d The court disagreed, and explained further why it was overruling defendant\u2019s hearsay objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll overrule the objection because when you respond to one, unless you respond to something that\u2019s entirely opposite of what\u2019s being said you have to be adopting it to respond to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Timm provided more testimony about the exchange of text messages on the Samsung phone, which Timm believed was a discussion about marijuana and some financial transactions. On appeal, defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling admitting that testimony; nor does he challenge the admission of photographs of the text messages from the Samsung phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The prosecutor then asked Timm about the Motorola phone. Timm had also photographed a series of text messages from that phone. Defendant again raised a hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>objection to evidence of the text messages, which consisted of the photographs and Timm\u2019s testimony about the content of the messages. The court overruled that objection for the same reason that it had overruled defendant\u2019s objection to evidence about the text messages on the Samsung phone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll overrule the hearsay objection for the same reason. You know, it\u2019s on his. And I don\u2019t know that automatically possessing the phone makes all similar to your statements or the fact that you\u2019re responding means you adopt them. But, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s hearsay or if it is hearsay it\u2019s admissible under one of the exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Timm then testified about the text messages, describing the exchanges that took place. For example, one incoming message stated, \u201c\u2018Chris is sending me some money today or tomorrow to get a couple of those to get me through the next two days. Can I get some from you even though I still owe you?\u201d\u2019 The responsive outgoing message from the Motorola phone was, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m out of them but I\u2019ll see if I can locate some.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on his training and experience, Timm testified, essentially, that he believed that the exchange of text messages related to a request to purchase narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his hearsay objection to evidence of the incoming text messages on the Motorola phone. He asserts that the text messages are inadmissible hearsay because (1) they are out-of-court statements offered for their truth, (2) they do not fall within any of the OEC 801(4) provisions that describe out-of-court statements that are not hearsay, and (3) they do not fall within any of the exceptions to the general rule that hearsay evidence is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Defendant acknowledges the existence of the OEC 801(4) (b)(B) \u201cadoptive admission\u201d exception to the definition of hearsay. That exception provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is a \u201cstatement of which the party has manifested the party\u2019s adoption or belief in its truth[.]\u201d OEC 801(4)(b)(B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cTf a party manifests an <em>adoption </em>of a statement of another, the party is in the same position as if the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>had personally made the statement. The party becomes the declarant, and the statement of the other person becomes the party\u2019s.\u2019 <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or 201, 206-07, 808 P2d 1002 (1991) (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). *** The court must examine the totality of the circumstances to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the party intended to adopt or approve the contents of the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 207-09.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><em>State v. Schiller-Munneman, 359 </em>Or 808, 814, 377 P3d 554 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Defendant does not make a substantive argument against applicability of the \u201cadoptive admission\u201d exception to the incoming text messages on the Motorola phone. Rather, his argument is premised on an assertion that the trial court ruled \u201cthat the evidence did not fall under the adoptive admission exception.\u201d That is, defendant does not argue that the trial court erred if it <em>did </em>admit the text messages under the \u201cadoptive admission\u201d exception; rather, his argument is predicated on the idea that the trial court did <em>not </em>admit the evidence as falling within that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on a single sentence taken from the trial court\u2019s explanation of its ruling: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that automatically possessing the phone makes all similar to your statements or the fact that you\u2019re responding means you adopt them.\u201d Read in isolation, perhaps that statement could be understood to mean that the court was rejecting a contention that the \u201cadoptive admission\u201d exception applied in this case. Read in context, however, it cannot reasonably be understood that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">As detailed above, the trial court first ruled that the incoming text messages on the Samsung phone were admissible because defendant had \u201cadoptively admitted\u201d them through his responses to those messages. The court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the Samsung text messages on that basis. Shortly thereafter, when the state offered evidence of the text messages on the Motorola phone, the court stated that it would admit them, over defendant\u2019s hearsay objection, \u201cfor the same reason.\u201d The court did go on to say that it did not \u201cknow that <em>automatically </em>possessing the phone makes all similar to your statements or the fact that you\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>responding means you adopt them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But the court went on to admit the evidence of the incoming text messages on the Motorola phone, and it did not suggest that it was admitting evidence for some reason other than defendant having adoptively admitted the incoming messages. In that context, the trial court\u2019s statements are best understood as explaining (1) that a person\u2019s response to text messages will not always \u201cautomatically\u201d constitute an adoptive admission, but (2) that, <em>in this case, </em>defendant\u2019s responses showed that defendant had adoptively admitted the incoming text messages on the Motorola phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In sum, defendant\u2019s appeal is premised entirely on his contention that the trial court did not admit the text messages as adoptive admissions under OEC 801(4)(b)(B). We reject that premise and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\"> Defendant was charged in a multi-count indictment and found guilty of unlawful manufacture of marijuana (Count 1), unlawful delivery of marijuana (Count 2), unlawful possession of marijuana (Count 3), the DCS charge at issue here (Count 4), the PCS charge at issue here (Count 5), and false swearing (Count 6). The trial court merged the determinations of guilt on counts 1, 2, and 3 into a single conviction for unlawful manufacture of marijuana. The court also merged the determinations of guilt on counts 4 and 5 into a single conviction for DCS (hydrocodone). On appeal, defendant does not challenge either the conviction for unlawful manufacture of marijuana or the conviction for false swearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-11\"> Spelling has been corrected for the sake of readability.
