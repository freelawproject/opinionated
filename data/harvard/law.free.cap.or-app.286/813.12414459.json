The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those claims after concluding that there were no triable issues of fact as to whether defendant had \u201cknowingly allow [ed], permitted] or encourage [ed] child abuse,\u201d ORS 12.117(1), and that, without the extended limitations period provided by that statute, plaintiffs action was time barred. Plaintiff raises two assignments of error on appeal. We write only to address plaintiffs first assignment of error, in which he argues that the trial court erred in concluding that he had not raised a fact issue as to whether defendant had acted knowingly within the meaning of ORS 12.117.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that, because the summary judgment record discloses factual disputes regarding that issue, the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claims.

In conducting our review, we view the facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them in favor of the nonmoving party who, in this case, is plaintiff. <em>Jones, </em>325 Or at 408. We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">In 1996, when plaintiff was a minor, defendant\u2019s husband, Silverman, sexually abused him while he was a guest of defendant and Silverman\u2019s son in their home. That criminal conduct led to Silverman\u2019s conviction and subsequent imprisonment. <em>See State v. Silverman, </em>159 Or App 524, 977 P2d 1186, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 527 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>531 US 876 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In 2014, when he was 30 years old, plaintiff sued Silverman and defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claims against defendant alleged negligence and IIED for her role in Silverman\u2019s abuse of plaintiff. Specifically, the complaint alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\u201cPLAINTIFF and other boys * * * were invited to the property by [defendant and Silverman] and their son for social occasions and sleep overs. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\"******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">\u201c* * * DEFENDANT * * * was a practicing child psychiatrist. * * * [Defendant and Silverman] had knowledge about how pedophiles commit child sexual abuse by grooming, molesting, and otherwise manipulating youngsters such as PLAINTIFF to comply with pedophiles\u2019 demands for sexual favors, how children are harmed by pedophilia, and how pedophiles coerce and/or convince victims not to tell anyone about the abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-9\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">\u201c*** [Defendant] <em>was aware that SILVERMAN was a predatory pedophile who had molested minor children in the past and who was doing so at the property and also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>during his working hours. One of those child victims was PLAINTIFF who was repeatedly molested by SILVERMAN </em>at the property. PLAINTIFF alleges that [defendant] and SILVERMAN each played an active role in convincing boys like PLAINTIFF that the property was a safe place to play free from the dangers of pedophilia that [Silverman and defendant] posed to PLAINTIFF and others. <em>***</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\u201c*** [Defendant and Silverman] invited PLAINTIFF to come to the property to play or sleep over. During these visits by PLAINTIFF [defendant and Silverman], and each of them, were aware that SILVERMAN posed an unreasonable danger and foreseeable risk of harm to plaintiff. [Defendant and Silverman], and each of them, manipulated PLAINTIFF\u2019S visits to the property so that SILVERMAN had one-on-one time with PLAINTIFF. *** <em>[Defendant] assisted SILVERMAN in his abuse of PLAINTIFF by helping SILVERMAN arrange for boys such as PLAINTIFF to come play and stay over night at the property knowing that SILVERMAN would have alone time [and] would probably molest boys, including PLAINTIFF. </em>Further, [defendant] aided and abetted SILVERMAN\u2019S molestation of boys by <em>not reporting his child abuse of said boys she was aware of </em>or had reasonable suspicious to be aware of by reason of her education and training [as a child psychiatrist] and her knowledge of SILVERMAN\u2019s sexual predilections for minor children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">(Capitalization in original; emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Defendant and Silverman each moved separately for summary judgment and asserted that plaintiffs action was time barred. In her motion, defendant contended that the applicable statute of limitations was ORS 12.110(1), which typically applies to negligence and IIED claims, and that, under that statute, plaintiffs claims against her were untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant further argued that, for two reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>ORS 12.117, which extends the statute of limitations in cases involving \u201cknowingly allowing, permitting, or encouraging child abuse,\u201d could not save plaintiffs claims. First, according to defendant, under ORS 12.117 (1995), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 879, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 2011, ch 151, \u00a7 4; Or Laws 2015, ch 98, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the version of the statute in effect when plaintiffs claims arose, plaintiff was required to file his claims before reaching the age of 24 years; thus, his claims were time barred even if ORS 12.117 applied to his case. <em>See </em>ORS 12.117 (1995) (extending the time to bring suit for certain actions to \u201csix years after [the] person attains 18 years of age\u201d). Second, defendant argued, ORS 12.117 did <em>not </em>apply. That, defendant contended, was because, under our decision in <em>Lourim v. Swensen, </em>147 Or App 425, 444, 936 P2d 1011 (1997) <em>{Lourim </em>I), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>328 Or 380, 977 P2d 1157 (1999) <em>(Lourim II), </em>the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.117 could not apply unless plaintiff alleged that defendant had actual, and not merely constructive, knowledge of child abuse. According to defendant, the complaint only alleged that she had knowledge of a risk of harm; it did not allege that she had actual knowledge that Silverman was abusing plaintiff. Because, in defendant\u2019s view, that showed that plaintiff had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether she had acted knowingly with regard to actual abuse, she was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In response to defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff first asserted that he had alleged sufficient knowledge by defendant to raise an issue of fact as to whether her conduct fell under ORS 12.117. Plaintiff further argued that the version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>of ORS 12.117 in effect when plaintiff filed his suit in 2014<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> applied to his action and that, under that version of the statute, his claims were timely, because it allowed him to bring his claims anytime before reaching 40 years of age. Plaintiff alternatively contended that, because he had only recently discovered defendant\u2019s role in his abuse and the earlier version of ORS 12.117 provided for a three-year discovery period, his claims remained timely even if that version of the statute applied. <em>See </em>ORS 12.117 (1995) (providing that, \u201cif the injured person has not discovered the injury or the causal connection between the injury and the child abuse, nor in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the injury or the causal connection between the injury and the child abuse,\u201d that person may bring suit \u201cnot more than three years from the date the injured person discovers or in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the injury or the causal connection between the child abuse and the injury, whichever period is longer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Plaintiff also submitted two declarations in response to defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. In the first declaration, plaintiffs mother described a conversation that had occurred after she learned of her son\u2019s abuse, in which she had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201casked [defendant] about why Mr. Silverman had molested my son. [Defendant] told me that it was because Mr. Silverman suffered long standing mental illness regarding molesting children because he had been molested as a child. [Defendant] also told me that her husband could not help himself and promised me that he would never do this again. * * * I asked [defendant] why she stayed married to Mr. Silverman given his crimes against children, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>she told me that she had stayed with him over the years because he had stood by her during a difficult time * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The second declaration was from plaintiff himself. In it, plaintiff asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201cI *** remember being abused by Mr. Silverman in his bedroom, sleeping in his bed, and Defendant * * * watching me come out of Mr. Silverman\u2019s bedroom in the morning. I remember <em>that as her husband continued to abuse me, [defendant] began to treat me differently </em>than other boys who visited her home. She avoided me as if I was not present while she acknowledged other boys\u2019 presence, boys who frequently stayed overnight at [defendant and Silverman\u2019s] home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s and Silverman\u2019s summary judgment motions, the parties focused their arguments on which version of ORS 12.117 applied to plaintiffs action. Following the hearing, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe appropriate statute of limitations to apply to plaintiffs claims [was] ORS 12.117 as *** in effect in 1996.\u201d Based on that conclusion, the court granted Silverman\u2019s motion, reasoning that \u201cplaintiff was aware of the abuse and [Silverman\u2019s] identity as the culpable party no later than *** 1996,\u201d and that his claim therefore expired no later than 2008, when he reached 24 years of age.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With regard to plaintiffs claims against defendant, however, the court continued summary judgment proceedings for 90 days to give plaintiff an opportunity to conduct further discovery. In the court\u2019s view, plaintiffs case against defendant could proceed as timely if plaintiff could establish that his claims fell within ORS 12.117\u2019s extended filing window. <em>See </em>ORS 12.117(1) (1995) (providing a three-year discovery period).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Following that continuance, however, the court concluded that defendant was likewise entitled to summary judgment, because plaintiffs claims against defendant were time barred for reasons unrelated to the discovery issue. Specifically, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\u201cTo avoid summary judgment on the statute of limitations issue, plaintiff was forced to rely on the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.117. However, with regard to the claim [s] against defendant * * *, plaintiff could only take advantage of the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.117, if there was an issue about whether defendant *** could be held responsible for \u2018knowingly * * * allowing, permitting, or encouraging child abuse.\u2019 The Complaint contains no allegation that defendant * * * had actual knowledge of plaintiffs abuse. Moreover, the documents submitted in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment contain no evidence of defendant [\u215b] actual knowledge at the time of the abuse. Although plaintiff\u2019s declaration may create a factual dispute about whether defendant *** should have known of plaintiff\u2019s abuse, the declaration falls short of being admissible to demonstrate actual knowledge. As the record is devoid of any evidence of actual knowledge of the abuse at the time of the abuse by co-defendant and the Complaint fails to allege defendant [\u215b] knowledge, the court will grant defendant [\u215b] Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Accordingly, the court entered a general judgment dismissing plaintiffs remaining claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">As noted, plaintiff raises two assignments of error on appeal. In his first assignment of error, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that there were no issues of fact regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge that Silverman was sexually abusing plaintiff and that plaintiff, therefore, could not establish that the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.117 applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to plaintiff, the facts set forth in his declaration\u2014 most notably, his description of defendant seeing him leave Silverman\u2019s bedroom in the early morning and changing her behavior towards him as a result\u2014would support the inference that defendant knew about Silverman\u2019s ongoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>abuse of plaintiff. Plaintiff alternatively argues that, even if he did not raise any triable fact questions regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge that Silverman was abusing <em>him, </em>there was an issue of fact regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge of the risk of harm that Silverman posed generally. In support of that alternative argument, plaintiff relies on our decision in <em>Lourim </em>I, 147 Or App 425, and contends that, in light of that case, the \u201cknowingly\u201d standard under ORS 12.117 encompasses both knowledge of actual abuse and knowledge of a risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Defendant disputes plaintiffs reading of <em>Lourim I </em>and argues that, under that decision, ORS 12.117 applies only in cases involving knowledge of actual abuse, not merely knowledge of risk. We conclude, however, that it is unnecessary to resolve that dispute. That is because, as we explain below, we agree with plaintiff\u2019s first argument, that the declarations on file support the inference that defendant knew about plaintiff\u2019s abuse as it was occurring. Because plaintiffs submissions raised that triable issue of fact, the trial court erred in granting defendant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As an initial matter, the trial court mistakenly observed that the complaint \u201ccontain [ed] no allegation that defendant * * * had actual knowledge of plaintiffs abuse.\u201d In fact, the complaint specifically alleged that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\"><em>\u201cwas aware </em>that SILVERMAN was a predatory pedophile <em>who had molested minor children </em>in the past <em>and who was doing </em>so at the property and also during his working hours. <em>One of those child victims was PLAINTIFF who was repeatedly molested </em>by SILVERMAN at the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">(Capitalization in original; emphases added.) The complaint further alleged that defendant \u201caided and abetted SILVERMAN\u2019s molestation of boys by not reporting his child abuse of said boys <em>she was aware </em>of,!\u201d (Capitalization in original; emphasis added.) Thus, while the complaint did not use the words \u201cactual knowledge,\u201d a fair reading of the complaint\u2014and especially the portions of it emphasized above\u2014readily conveys an allegation that defendant was aware, at the time of plaintiffs abuse, that Silverman was abusing him. In other words, the complaint alleged that defendant actually knew that plaintiff was being abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Of course, under ORCP 47, a plaintiff may not'rest on the allegations of the complaint. But plaintiff did not do that here. Instead, as contemplated by ORCP 47 C, plaintiff satisfied his burden of producing evidence in response to defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion by submitting declarations \u201cset [ting] forth specific facts showing that there [was] a genuine issue as to [the] material fact\u201d of defendant\u2019s knowledge. ORCP 47 D (standards for affidavits and declarations in summary judgment proceedings).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">First, plaintiffs own declaration described defendant watching him emerge from Silverman\u2019s separate bedroom in the morning. After that, or, in the words of plaintiffs declaration, \u201cas [defendant\u2019s] husband <em>continued </em>to abuse me,\u201d defendant\u2019s attitude towards plaintiff changed: she \u201cbegan to treat me differently * * *. She avoided me as if I was not present while she acknowledged other boys\u2019 presence [.] \u201d (Emphasis added.) Properly viewed in favor of plaintiff, the nonmoving party, those facts alone arguably support the inference that defendant knew that her husband was abusing plaintiff. <em>See Jones, </em>325 Or at 408 (on summary judgment, the facts and the inferences they support are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party); <em>see also State v. Rose, </em>311 Or 274, 282, 810 P2d 839 (1991) (a person\u2019s mental state is \u201crarely, if ever, proven by direct evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">It is not necessary, however, to view plaintiffs declaration alone, because plaintiff also submitted his mother\u2019s declaration, which lends further support to the inference that defendant had actual knowledge of plaintiffs abuse. In her declaration, plaintiffs mother explained that defendant had told her that Silverman had suffered from a longstanding mental illness that led him to sexually abuse children, and that \u201cshe had stayed with him over the years\u201d despite knowing about that behavior. Although that declaration does not expressly state <em>when </em>defendant became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>aware of her husband\u2019s behavior, it nonetheless supports the inference that, when defendant saw plaintiff leave her husband\u2019s bedroom and subsequently treated him differently from her son\u2019s other friends, it was because defendant knew that Silverman was abusing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Thus, we conclude that the summary judgment record supports the inference that defendant had actual knowledge of plaintiffs abuse as it was occurring. Accordingly, plaintiff raised a genuine issue of fact on that point, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise. Furthermore, because we conclude that plaintiff raised a question of fact regarding defendant\u2019s <em>actual </em>knowledge of his abuse, we need not decide whether, under <em>Lourim I, </em>147 Or App 425, it would have been sufficient had plaintiff merely established that defendant was aware that Silverman presented a risk of harm. Finally, because our decision regarding plaintiffs first assignment of error requires us to reverse the judgment, it is unnecessary to address the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\"> In plaintiff\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues that the court erred in concluding that the applicable version of ORS 12.117 was the version in effect in 1996, when Silverman first abused plaintiff, rather than in 2014, when plaintiff filed his lawsuit. As we explain below, we conclude that it is unnecessary to address that issue in light of our decision regarding the first assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-11\"> The complaint in this case named Silverman and defendant as codefen-dants.
