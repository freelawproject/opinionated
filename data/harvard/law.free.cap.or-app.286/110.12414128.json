Defendant pleaded guilty to one count each of aggravated murder, ORS 163.095; attempted murder, ORS 161.405; ORS 163.095; and conspiracy to commit murder, ORS 161.450; ORS 163.095.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced defendant to a sum of 40 years\u2019 incarceration: 30 years\u2019 incarceration for the aggravated murder conviction, and 10 years\u2019 incarceration for the attempted murder conviction, to be served consecutively. Although defendant argued that the sentence should be shorter, he did not suggest that the 40-year term was unconstitutional in light of his status as a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On appeal, defendant argues for the first time that, under the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 US 460, 132 S Ct 2455, 183 L Ed 2d 407 (2012), it was error for the trial court to impose the 40-year term of incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that <em>\u201cmandatory life without parole </em>for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u2018cruel and unusual punishments.\u2019\u201d 567 US 460 (emphasis added). Defendant acknowledges that his argument is not preserved, and that <em>Miller </em>did not address a nonlife, fixed-term sentence like the one he received, but asks us nonetheless to conclude that the trial court\u2019s purported error is plain and to reverse on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">An error is \u201cplain\u201d only \u201cif (1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute, and (3) the error appears on the face of the record, so that we need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 551, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, it is not \u201cobvious\u201d that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Miller. </em>As defendant admits in his brief, the Supreme Court has not extended its reasoning in <em>Miller </em>to nonlife, fixed-term sentences such as defendant\u2019s, and the extent to which <em>Miller </em>applies to nonlife sentences for juveniles\u2014even when those sentences are long\u2014presents an open question. As a result, the trial court\u2019s error\u2014if any\u2014is not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> In accordance with defendant\u2019s plea agreement, the trial court merged defendant\u2019s guilty plea for conspiracy to commit murder with his guilty plea for attempted murder, resulting in a conviction for attempted murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\"> Defendant suggests that the reasoning in <em>Miller </em>means that his sentence is unconstitutional under both the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
