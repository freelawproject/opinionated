In her second assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to deny her request to rescind the suspension of her driver\u2019s license pending this appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">When we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence following a conviction of a violation, we examine the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the state to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the violation had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. Bainbridge, </em>230 Or App 500, 502, 216 P3d 338 (2009) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. A vehicle driven by defendant collided with a vehicle driven by defendant\u2019s friend in a parking lot. At the time of the accident, the two drivers were friends and high school classmates. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>two drivers and their boyfriends had visited a restaurant together and were in the process of leaving the parking lot when they collided. The occupants of the cars stopped and assessed the damage caused by the collision and found that the collision had damaged the front bumper of defendant\u2019s friend\u2019s car. The two drivers did not exchange any identifying information at the scene of the accident, and they left the scene to go to the same next destination. The friend\u2019s mother contacted defendant the following day via text message and asked defendant for her parents\u2019 phone number and for the vehicle\u2019s insurance information. After defendant refused to comply, the friend\u2019s mother first threatened to call the police and then did so. Two days later, at 10:00 a.m., a police officer contacted defendant at her high school. The officer \u201cinformed [defendant] of her legal obligation to provide certain information to the owner of damaged property in a traffic crash. I told her I had [her friend\u2019s] information, but still needed hers. I told her I was there to facilitate the exchange of that information.\u201d Again, defendant refused to provide \u201cthe information,\u201d and the officer arrested defendant for failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged, ORS 811.700(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">ORS 811.700 is a Class A misdemeanor, but the prosecutor elected to pursue the charge against defendant as a Class A violation. Defendant was found guilty of the violation after a trial in municipal court and she sought <em>de novo </em>review in the circuit court. After denying defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal as a matter of law for lack of evidence, the circuit court found defendant guilty. As a result of her conviction, defendant was fined $435 by the trial court and her driving privileges were suspended for 90 days by the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV) of the Department of Transportation. The suspension began December 27, 2014. Defendant appealed. Defendant then requested that the circuit court rescind the suspension pending this appeal. The circuit court declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On appeal, defendant reasserts her argument that she made to both trial courts below that the evidence was not sufficient to find her guilty of a violation under ORS 811.700(l)(a). Defendant also asserts that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>erred by not granting her request to rescind the driver\u2019s privilege suspension pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We first address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s request to rescind the suspension of her driver\u2019s privileges pending this appeal, as authorized by ORS 809.460.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state contends that, because defendant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended for 90 days beginning December 27, 2014, and the suspension has now ended, the issue of whether the circuit court abused its discretion is moot. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">An issue on appeal is moot if a reviewing court\u2019s decision will have no practical effect on the rights of the parties. <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 405-06, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). In this case, after her driver\u2019s privileges had been suspended for about two months, defendant requested the trial court to rescind the remainder of her suspension pending the outcome of this appeal. Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s privileges would have been restored in March 2015. Defendant makes no argument that the circuit court\u2019s denial of her request to rescind would have any effect on her now. We conclude that defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is moot, and we do not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error. ORS 811.700(l)(a) requires a driver involved in an accident that results in damage to another vehicle to \u201c[g]ive to the other driver or passenger the name and address of the driver and the registration number of the vehicle that the driver is driving and the name and address of any other occupants of the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the circuit court could not have found defendant guilty because the information she was required by ORS 811.700(l)(a) to provide to the driver of the damaged vehicle was known or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>available to that driver. The state contends that defendant failed to perform the clearly expressed duties imposed on her by that statute because she did not \u201cgive\u201d the required information to the driver of the damaged vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">Whether a rational trier of fact could find that defendant did not \u201cgive\u201d the required information to the other driver involves a question of statutory interpretation! When construing a statute, our task is to discern the intent of the legislature. ORS 174.020(1)(a); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We resolve statutory construction questions through an inquiry into the statute\u2019s text and context, and any pertinent legislative history that the parties may offer. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The term \u201cgive\u201d is not defined in the statute; accordingly, we look to its plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (\u201c[W]ords of common usage typically should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d). The relevant ordinary meaning of \u201cgive\u201d is \u201cto put into the possession of another\u201d or \u201cto provide or supply one with.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>959-60 (unabridged ed 2002). In the context of the crime of failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged, \u201cgive\u201d means that a driver is required to affirmatively act to ensure that the other driver, attendant, or passenger receives the identifying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Defendant argues that ORS 811.700(l)(a) does not require her to give identifying information to the driver of a damaged vehicle that that driver already possesses or that is readily available at the scene of the accident. Defendant also argues that, in the days following the collision and before her arrest, she was asked by her friend\u2019s mother, who owned the damaged vehicle, and the police to provide only her parents\u2019 contact and insurance information, which she refused to do because ORS 811.700(l)(a) does not require her to provide that information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant is correct that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>statute does not require her to provide her parents\u2019 contact or insurance information to any person. ORS 811.700(l)(a) does not require a driver to provide any information to any person other than the driver, attendant, or passenger of the vehicle with which she collided, nor at any time other than at the scene of the accident. Defendant\u2019s argument that she was not required to provide information that was readily available at the scene, however, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">We need not decide whether ORS 811.700(l)(a) requires a driver to \u201cgive\u201d identifying information to a driver or attendant of a damaged vehicle if that driver already possesses all of the required identifying information. We need not decide that issue because in this case defendant does not argue that her friend already knew or possessed the vehicle registration number of the vehicle defendant was driving at the time of the accident. Rather, defendant contends that the vehicle she was driving was within the sight of the damaged vehicle\u2019s driver while they stopped and discussed the accident. That is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In construing a statute, we must \u201cascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d ORS 174.010. The wording of ORS 811.700(l)(a) requiring that a driver \u201c[g]ive to the other driver *** the registration number of the vehicle that the driver is driving\u201d is clear as far as it does not allow for us to construe that requirement to be met by a driver simply stopping her vehicle at the scene of an accident and, at least theoretically, allowing the other driver the time to read the vehicle\u2019s license plate. The statute includes an explicit directive that a driver must affirmatively provide to the other driver the registration number of the vehicle she was driving before leaving the scene of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It is undisputed that defendant failed to affirmatively provide the registration number of the vehicle she was driving to the driver of the damaged car before she left the scene of the collision. The actions and requests of the damaged vehicle\u2019s owner and the police after the fact have no bearing on our review here. As soon as defendant left the place where she stopped to assess the damage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>collision without providing the other driver with the registration number, she failed to perform the duties required by ORS 811.700(l)(a). We conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant failed to give to the driver of the damaged vehicle the registration number that ORS 811.700(l)(a) required her to provide before defendant left the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\"> In relevant part, ORS 811.700(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cIf the person is the driver of any vehicle involved in an accident that results only in damage to a vehicle that is driven or attended by any other person the person must perform all of the following duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201c(A) Immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as possible. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201c(B) Remain at the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled all of the requirements under this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201c(C) Give to the other driver or passenger the name and address of the driver and the registration number of the vehicle that the driver is driving and the name and address of any other occupants of the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\"> Under ORS 153.008(l)(d), an offense is a violation if \u201c[t]he prosecuting attorney has elected to treat the offense as a violation for purposes of a particular case\u201d and the prosecutor follows the procedural requirements of ORS 161.566.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\"> Under ORS 153.076(2), \u201c[t]he state, municipality or political subdivision [has] the burden of proving the charged violation by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Under ORS 809.460(1), the court that enters the judgment of conviction has discretion to order the Department of Transportation to rescind the suspension pending the outcome of an appeal if the person has appealed and has made a written request to the convicting court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\"> Neither party raises the issue of whether defendant gave the driver of the damaged vehicle the name and address of her boyfriend who was defendant\u2019s passenger at the time of the accident.
