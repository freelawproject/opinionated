Associates, LLC, (Persels) is a law firm and Maryland limited liability company. The primary services that Persels provides are debt settlement services. For a fee, Persels offers to collect money from a consumer and then, once it has collected enough money, negotiate with a consumer\u2019s creditors to reduce the consumer\u2019s unsecured debt to an amount that the consumer can pay using the collected funds. Persels offers these services to consumer debtors nationwide, including those located in Oregon. Although ORS 697.612 generally requires those who do what Persels does to register with the director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) before providing\u2014or offering to provide\u2014such services in Oregon, Persels did not register with the director before it began offering its services to Oregon consumers. Following a contested case, the director determined that Persels committed 1,801 violations of ORS 697.612 when, without having registered with the director, Persels held paid consultations with 1,801 Oregon consumers at which Persels offered\u2014for a fee\u2014to provide its services to those consumers. The director issued a final order directing Persels to cease and desist from ongoing violations of the Oregon laws governing debt management service providers and to pay an assessed $500,000 civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Persels seeks judicial review of that order under ORS 183.482. On review, Persels asserts that the director erred in concluding that its conduct violated Oregon law. It contends that it had no obligation to register with the director because ORS 697.612(3)(b) exempts some attorneys from the registration requirement. Persels argues that it is entitled to the benefit of that exemption. Alternatively, Persels asserts that it committed at most a single violation of ORS 697.612, and that the director therefore erred in determining that it had committed 1,801 violations. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with Persels on both points. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>I.

BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9J\">A. <em>Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">ORS 697.602 to 697.842 governs the provision of \u201cdebt management services\u201d in Oregon. The legislature originally enacted those statutes in 1983, and then amended them in 2009. It did so to strengthen regulation of the debt management services industry in response to \u201cnew and troubling forms of debt management companies\u201d using business models that the statutes, prior to amendment, did not reach. Testimony, House Consumer Protection Committee, HB 2191, Feb 9, 2009, Ex 4 (written statement of David Tatman, Administrator, Division of Finance and Corporate Securities, Department of Consumer and Business Services); <em>see generally </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 604; <em>see also </em>Matthew Brock, <em>As Cats are Drawn to Cream: Expanding Debt Settlement Regulation to Traditionally-Exempt Entities, </em>47 Colum J L &amp; Soc Probs 385, 404-11 (2014) (discussing the different business models employed by debt management companies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>avoid regulation under existing state laws during the early part of the twenty-first century).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the administrator of the DCBS Division of Finance and Corporate Securities who proposed the amendments explained, greater regulatory oversight was required because these new forms of debt management services were extracting significant fees from debt-ridden consumers and then providing little or no assistance of value to the consumer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201cIn the past few years, we have seen the birth and growth of debt settlers or debt eliminators who use a business model not under our regulation. For example, debt elimination providers claim the ability to eliminate various types of debt for an upfront fee. They claim to be able to negotiate with creditors, usually credit card companies, but also other creditors, and eliminate principal and interest in return for a single lump sum payment that significantly lowers the balance owed. Most of us encountered the advertisements on radio, television or the Internet in which debt settlement companies mention incredible results for previous clients. Claims like \u2018debt reduced by 50%, 60% or even 75%\u2019 and \u2018debt settled in 12 to 30 months.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cAdditionally, these companies inappropriately advise a consumer to stop communicating with a creditor\u2014which is generally to the detriment of the consumer. Debt elimination providers do not accept money from a consumer for redistribution to the consumer\u2019s creditors. Instead, debt settlement or debt eliminator companies have the debtor save money in the debtor\u2019s bank account, after first paying the debt settlement company a hefty upfront fee, until such time as the debt settlement company has negotiated a reduction in the amount to be paid to settle the debt and then instructs the debtor to pay the creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cUnfortunately, the delay in contacting or negotiating the debt may take several to many months\u2019 time during which there has been no contact or payment to the creditor. In the meantime, creditors have filed suit to collect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the debt, obtain a judgment and begin garnishing wages and bank accounts. We have talked to representatives of the Oregon Collectors Association, the organization that represents collection agencies in Oregon. They advise that many of their collectors do not believe debt settlement companies provide a meaningful resolution to the debt they are collecting and generally disregard proposals from these companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201cThe scenario I describe is in the best of circumstances, when a genuine, if expensive and ineffective, effort may be made on behalf of a debtor. In worst-case scenarios, we have heard of debtors who provide a significant upfront fee and then vainly wait to hear back from the debt settlement company with further instructions. The end result is that the debtors have lost additional money and precious time in finding the best approach to their debt problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Testimony, House Consumer Protection Committee, HB 2191, Feb 9, 2009, Ex 4 (written statement of David Tatman, Administrator, Division of Finance and Corporate Securities, Department of Consumer and Business Services).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">As amended, the statutes (1) define the types of services and conduct that are regulated as \u201cdebt management services\u201d and (2) impose numerous requirements on the provision of those services and the fees that may be charged for those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For purposes of the regulatory scheme, a person provides a debt management service by providing certain services for a fee and, in some instances, simply by offering to provide specified services for a fee. ORS 697.602(2) identifies the conduct that constitutes the provision of a debt management service. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201c\u2018Debt management service\u2019 means an activity for which a person receives money or other valuable consideration or expects to receive money or other valuable consideration in return for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201c(a) Receiving or offering to receive funds from a consumer for the purpose of distributing the funds among the consumer\u2019s creditors in full or partial payment of the consumer\u2019s debts, whether or not the person holds the consumer\u2019s funds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201c(b) Improving or offering to improve or preserve a consumer\u2019s credit record, credit history or credit rating;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201c(c) Modifying or offering to modify terms and conditions of an existing loan from or obligation to a third party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201c(d) Obtaining or attempting to obtain as an intermediary on a consumer\u2019s behalf a concession from a creditor including, but not limited to, a reduction in the principal, interest, penalties or fees associated with a debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Thus, among other things, under the plain terms of the statute, a person provides a debt management service under Oregon law if the person receives a fee for \u201coffering\u201d to collect funds from a consumer to distribute to the consumer\u2019s creditors. ORS 697.602(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In addition to defining the services and conduct that are regulated as \u201cdebt management services,\u201d the statutes regulate and restrict how those services may be provided. Providers must supply each potential customer with \u201can analysis of the consumer\u2019s budget * * * that evaluates whether the debt management services the debt management service provider proposes to perform are advantageous to the consumer\u201d before entering into an agreement to provide services. ORS 697.652(2); ORS 697.662(4). An agreement to perform debt management services must be in writing and must satisfy a host of statutory requirements, including identifying the fees to be charged and an explanation of how those fees were determined. ORS 697.652. Debt management service providers must refrain from a range of prohibited practices, including charging more than the amount authorized by statute, and also must comply with a range of affirmative statutory requirements for the provision of services. ORS 697.662 (identifying prohibited practices by debt management service providers); ORS 697.672 (establishing record keeping requirements for debt management service providers); ORS 697.692 (establishing limits on the fees that may be charged for debt management services); ORS 697.707 (requiring debt management service providers to make certain disclosures to consumers). A debt management service provider\u2019s failure to comply with statutory requirements exposes the provider to civil damages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>injunctive relief, and civil penalties. <em>See generally </em>ORS 697.732 - 697.832.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">To assist the director in monitoring the provision of debt management services in Oregon, the statute requires debt management service providers to register with the director unless the provider falls within one of 14 enumerated exceptions to the registration requirement. <em>See </em>ORS 697.612(3) (listing exceptions to registration requirement); ORS 697.632 (establishing registration procedure). One enumerated exception to the registration requirement\u2014the one at the heart of this case\u2014applies to lawyers. It states that the registration requirement does not apply to an \u201cattorney licensed or authorized to practice law in this state, if the attorney provides a debt management service only incidentally in the practice of law.\u201d ORS 697.612(3)(b). Before the 2009 amendments, lawyers were categorically exempt from the operation of the statutes governing debt management service providers. <em>See former </em>ORS 697.622 (2007) (\u201cThe following are not required to comply with ORS 697.602 to ORS 697.842: (1) Attorneys-at-law rendering services in the performance of duties as attorneys.\u201d). The 2009 amendments narrowed the scope of the exemption for attorneys, bringing them under the regulatory scheme except when they provide debt management services \u201conly incidentally in the practice of law.\u201d ORS 697.612(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">After the 2009 amendments, the director promulgated an administrative rule to clarify the scope of the registration exemption for attorneys. The rule defines what it means for an attorney to \u201cprovide!] a debt management service only incidentally in the practice of law\u201d for purposes of ORS 697.612(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201c(1) An attorney provides debt management services only incidentally to the practice of law if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201c(a) The attorney only provides the services to a client of the attorney and only while acting as an attorney on behalf of the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201c(b) The attorney does not act as a broker for debt \u25a0management services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">\u201c(c) If the attorney refers a consumer who is a client of the attorney to a third party debt management services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>provider, the attorney does not receive compensation, directly or indirectly, for the referral and in the attorney\u2019s professional judgment the attorney believes the referral will be beneficial to the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201c(d) The attorney does not provide debt management services to a third party on behalf of a consumer who is a client of the attorney; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201c(e) Any advertisement used by the attorney concerning debt management services complies with the Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct and formal ethics opinions published by the Oregon State Bar applicable to advertising.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">OAR 441-910-0005(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">If a nonexempt debt management services provider does not register with the director, ORS 697.612(1) bars the provider from performing debt management services and other related activities. Specifically, the provider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cmay not engage in business in this state in the course of which the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201c(a) Performs a debt management service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">\u201c(b) Receives money or other valuable consideration or expects to receive money or valuable consideration for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201c(A) Soliciting or receiving an application from a consumer for a debt management service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201c(B) Forwarding or providing a completed application for a debt management service to a debt management service provider;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201c(C) Referring a consumer to another debt management service provider, if the person is a debt management service provider;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\u201c(D) Providing a consumer\u2019s name, address or other information that identifies the consumer to a debt management service provider for the purpose of arranging the provision of a debt management service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201c(E) Providing advice, assistance, instruction or instructional material concerning a debt management service to a consumer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ORS 697.612(1). To enforce the registration requirement, ORS 697.832(1) authorizes the director to impose a civil penalty \u201cin an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each violation of ORS 697.612.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">B. <em>Substantive Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">1. <em>Persels\u2019 operations generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Persels is an LLC organized and headquartered in Maryland. It offers debt settlement services to consumers, that is, it offers, for a fee, to attempt to negotiate a reduction in debt with creditors. Persels registered as a business in Oregon in 2009, but did not register with the director before providing debt management services to Oregon consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Persels provides its services through three different types of staff: staff attorneys employed at its Maryland headquarters, 150 field attorneys located across the country,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and staff at CareOne Debt Relief Services (CareOne). CareOne is a debt management service provider with which Persels has contracted to provide debt settlement services to Persels\u2019 clients on Persels\u2019 behalf. If Persels\u2019 clients require assistance that necessarily must come from a lawyer, Persels\u2019 staff attorneys and field attorneys perform those services. Otherwise, CareOne performs the bulk of the services provided to Persels\u2019 clients using paralegals and other nonlawyer staff. Among other things, CareOne collects and stores Persels\u2019 client data, mails letters on behalf of Persels to Persels\u2019 clients and their creditors, contacts creditors and negotiates with them on behalf of Persels, staffs a central call center for Persels, manages Persels\u2019 clients trust accounts, and prepares and manages almost all of the debt settlement plans for Persels\u2019 clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">CareOne also is the source of Persels\u2019 clients. CareOne itself provides debt management services to consumers who can afford to pay off their debts in full under a debt management plan. If a consumer cannot afford to pay off their debt in full, CareOne then refers the consumer to Persels for debt settlement services. Upon receiving the referral, a staff attorney at Persels\u2019 Maryland headquarters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>reviews the documentation of a referred consumer, and then forwards the documentation to a field attorney located in the consumer\u2019s home state. The local field attorney then schedules an initial consultation with the consumer, for which the consumer is charged $100-$400, depending on the amount of the consumer\u2019s debt. At that consultation, the attorney provides a comprehensive analysis of the consumer\u2019s financial condition and an overview of the debt settlement services that Persels provides, and offers to provide those services to the consumer. If, however, Persels\u2019 financial analysis demonstrates that the consumer will not be-able to afford to settle the consumer\u2019s debts, then the field attorney suggests bankruptcy as an alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">If a consumer decides to accept Persels\u2019 debt settlement services after the initial consultation with a field attorney, Persels requires the consumer to sign a retainer agreement. The retainer states that Persels has been retained to represent the client for the purpose of negotiating with creditors regarding unsecured debt, and to \u201cassist in legal matters relating to that process.\u201d The retainer further states that Persels will answer legal questions related to the client\u2019s unsecured debt, and creditors\u2019 efforts to collect on that debt, but will not represent the client in collection suits. The agreement further provides that Persels will represent the client in damages actions against creditors for violations of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act if the client requests, although Persels has never filed such an action on a client\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Once the retainer is signed, Persels sends letters to the consumer\u2019s creditors identifying itself as the consumer\u2019s representative for negotiating over the debt, and directing creditors to stop contacting the consumer. However, the letter also states that Persels will not accept service on behalf of the consumer, and also that Persels will not appear on behalf of the consumer in litigation. At the same time, Persels begins collecting money from the consumer on a monthly basis. The amount an individual consumer is required to pay is computed using an algorithm that determines the consumer\u2019s monthly disposable income. For the first 18 months of the relationship, almost all of the money collected goes toward Persels\u2019 fees. Persels does not perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>any negotiations with a consumer\u2019s creditors until after the consumer has accumulated sufficient funds to support an offer to compromise the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">When a consumer enters a retainer agreement with Persels, the consumer is provided with the phone number for the call center staffed by CareOne as the contact number for the firm. Persels discourages CareOne from providing clients with the phone number of the Persels attorney assigned to the client. Unless a service is one that must be provided by an attorney, CareOne\u2019s nonlawyer staff provides the service. When a client contacts the call center, a call center \u201ctriage\u201d person determines whether the client needs to talk to an attorney. If needed, the call center staff refers the matter to a Persels staff attorney to assess whether the client needs to talk to a field attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Once a client has amassed sufficient funds to make payments on settlement offers, the nonattorney staff at CareOne begins to negotiate settlements with creditors. Field attorneys can influence those negotiations if the attorney determines that a particular creditor should receive priority. Otherwise, CareOne staff decides when to contact a creditor and what to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">2. <em>Persels\u2019 Oregon operations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Persels has two field attorneys in Oregon, Kiel and Corwin. Each of Persels\u2019 clients in Oregon is assigned to one of those two field attorneys. They perform Persels\u2019 initial consultations for those consumers referred by CareOne who live in Oregon. When needed, Corwin and Kiel provide advice to Persels\u2019 Oregon clients about litigation with creditors, and assist in drafting pleadings and other papers that those clients can use to represent themselves in litigation with creditors, but Corwin and Kiel do not appear on behalf of Persel\u2019s clients in court. If Persels\u2019 clients require substantive bankruptcy advice or assistance, Corwin and Kiel refer them to other lawyers. Corwin and Kiel do not handle funds or fees from Persels\u2019 clients or keep billing records. Client funds are handled exclusively by Persels and Consumer Law Associates, LLC, another LLC that is owned by the same two attorneys that own Persels.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>During the period between January 26, 2009 and February 18, 2012, CareOne referred 1,801 Oregon consumers to Persels. On behalf of Persels, Corwin and Kiel conducted initial consultations with those 1,801 consumers. Some of those consumers then entered retainer agreements with Persels, although the record does not disclose how many.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">C. <em>Procedural Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On June 10,2012, the director issued an order directing Persels to cease and desist \u201cfrom violating any provision of the Oregon statutes regulating debt management service providers.\u201d The director proposed a $500,000 civil penalty for Persels\u2019 multiple acts of providing debt management services in Oregon without first registering with the director. Persels requested a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) from the Office of Administrative Hearings and, on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary determination, the ALJ rejected Persels\u2019 contentions that it was exempt from the registration requirement under the attorney exemption, and that it had only committed one violation of the law by providing debt management services, without registering with the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Persels then filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s order with the director. On review of those exceptions, the director issued a final order that clarified and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order. Pertinent to the primary issue on appeal, the director concluded that Persels was not exempt from the registration requirement under the attorney exemption. The director reasoned that the word \u201cattorney\u201d in the context of ORS 697.612(3)(b) refers to an individual licensed to practice law in Oregon, and does not refer to a law firm, thereby precluding Persels from availing itself of the exemption. Alternatively, the director reasoned that, even if Persels could qualify as an \u201cattorney\u201d for purposes of ORS 697.612(3)(b), Persels did not provide debt management services \u201conly incidentally in the practice of law\u201d under ORS 697.612(3)(b) and OAR 441-910-0005(1) and, as a result, did not qualify for the attorney exemption for that independent reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Having determined that Persels was not exempt from the registration requirement, the director further concluded that Persels violated ORS 697.612(1) each time it provided an initial consultation to a consumer without having registered as required by statute. Because Persels scheduled 1,801 initial consultations with consumers during the period extending from January 26, 2009 to February 18, 2012, the director determined that Persels committed 1,801 violations of ORS 697.612(1), permitting a penalty of up to $9,005,000. The director further determined that, under those circumstances, the proposed penalty of $500,000\u2014which was well below the total amount authorized in light of the number of violations\u2014was permissible and appropriate because of the duration of time that Persels had been offering its services without registering with the director and the large number of times that it had provided debt management services without having registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Persels petitioned for review of the director\u2019s final order. ORS 183.482. On review, Persels contends that the director erred in concluding that the attorney exemption does not apply to Persels, and also in concluding that Persels .committed more than a single violation of ORS 697.612(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">A. <em>Attorney Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We start with Persels\u2019 contention that the director erred when it concluded that Persels was not exempt from the registration requirement under ORS 697.612(3)(b). That provision, as mentioned, exempts some attorneys who provide debt management services from registering with the director, namely, \u201c [a] n attorney licensed or authorized to practice law in this state, if the attorney provides a debt management service only incidentally in the practice of law.\u201d ORS 697.612(3)(b). As noted, the director reasoned that the exception does not apply to Persels because Persels\u2014a law firm\u2014is not \u201can attorney\u201d within the meaning of the statute and, alternatively, that even if the exception could apply to a law firm, Persels would not qualify for it because Persels does not provide its debt settlement services \u201conly incidentally\u201d to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>On review, Persels contends that the director\u2019s analysis of the exemption\u2019s application reflects a legal error. According to Persels, the legal question for the director was not whether ORS 697.612(3)(b), by its terms, applies to Persels. Instead, Persels argues, the legal question the director should have addressed was whether Persels\u2019 Oregon field attorneys qualified for the exception. Pointing to the statutes that govern the formation of limited liability companies and common law principles, Persels asserts that, if its two field attorneys each qualified for the exception, then Persels itself necessarily must qualify for the exception. Thus, Persels contends, a remand is required for the director to \u201cdetermine whether Persels provided professional services through licensed attorneys who were exempt from the registration requirement under the factors articulated in OAR 441-910-0005(1). If so, Persels was not required to register to perform those services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The director responds that nothing in the text or context of ORS 697.612(3)(b) suggests that the legislature intended for the exception to operate in the manner advocated by Persels. The director points out that, in establishing the various exceptions from the registration requirement, the legislature expressly excepted individual employees of a debt management service provider from the registration requirement, provided that their employer entity complied with the registration requirement. ORS 697.612(3)(a). That, the director asserts, demonstrates that \u201cin crafting the exceptions the legislature did not <em>see </em>companies and the individuals that work for them as one and the same.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Regardless, the director asserts that whatever the merits of Persels\u2019 argument that, in some circumstances, a law firm would be exempt from the registration requirement if its Oregon based attorneys were exempt, Persels\u2019 circumstances are such that it is clear that the legislature intended the registration requirement to cover Persels:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cUnder Persels\u2019 proposed construction, unregistered debt management businesses would be entitled to the exemption simply by hiring an Oregon attorney as an independent contractor. The company would then be allowed to conduct business in Oregon free from any regulation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>oversight. That construction reads the \u2018only incidentally in\u2019 language out of the statute and is contrary to the remedial purposes of the statute. As noted, in 2009, the legislature narrowed the exemptions\u2019 applicability solely to Oregon attorneys who perform debt negotiation \u2018only incidentally in\u2019 their practice. Persels\u2019 construction would expose consumers to the kinds of abuses the debt negotiation statutes were designed to prevent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The intended scope of the attorney exception to the registration requirement and, in particular, the extent to which a law firm might be entitled to its protection, presents a gray area of the law\u2014one that could use clarification from the legislature or, short of that, from the director by administrative rule. Both parties make fair points on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">On the one hand, the director is correct that the text and context of the exception indicate that it applies to individual attorneys and not to law firms. The text of the exception does not mention law firms and, as the director points out, other exceptions differentiate between individuals and entities. <em>See </em>ORS 697.612(3). And the legislative history of the 2009 amendments (HB 2191) demonstrates that the legislature intended to broaden the scope of its regulation of the debt management services industry by sweeping in business models that might be craftily constructed to escape regulation. In other words, there is reason to think that the legislature intended for the exceptions to registration to be narrowly construed to favor registration in the face of any ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">On the other hand, the legislative history provides at least some indication that the legislature did not contemplate that the registration requirement would categorically apply to law firms. For example, bankruptcy lawyer Keith Karnes testified at several hearings in favor of HB 2191. Karnes cited his experience handling phone calls from people who had been harmed by hiring debt services companies as evidence of the need for HB 2191. Karnes\u2019 testimony suggested that he did not think that his small bankruptcy firm would be subject to regulation under HB 2191, although none of the committee members asked him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>about it directly. Audio Recording, House Committee on Consumer Protection, HB 2191, May 19, 2009, at 2:11:00 (comments of Keith Karnes and Sen Larry George), https:// olis.leg.state.or.us (accessed Apr 10,2017); <em>see also id., </em>Feb 2, 2009, at 2:13:00; <em>id., </em>Apr 23, 2009, at 1:45:00; <em>id., </em>May 19, 2009, at 2:02:00. And there is no hint in the legislative history that the legislature intended to sweep a law firm into the registration requirement whenever one or more of the firm\u2019s lawyers happened to provide one of the statutorily defined debt management services, even if those services were provided only incidentally to any one lawyer\u2019s practice and the lawyer individually would otherwise be exempt from registration under ORS 697.612(3). Yet that appears to be the result compelled by the director\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">This case does not require us to resolve definitively whether the attorney exception might, in some circumstances, operate to exempt a law firm from the registration requirement. Although it is conceivable that the legislature may have intended for the exception to have some applicability to a law firm where the <em>only </em>debt management services that the firm provides\u2014or offers to provide\u2014are services rendered by the firm\u2019s individual attorneys \u201conly incidentally\u201d to those attorneys\u2019 practice of law, it is not conceivable that the legislature intended for the exemption to apply to a firm like Persels. The undisputed facts demonstrate that Persels engages in exactly the type of business that the 2009 amendments to the debt management service statutes were intended to regulate: Persels, for a fee, offers to receive and hold money from a consumer for the purpose of paying unsecured debt in full and or in part, and to negotiate with the consumer\u2019s creditors to modify the consumer\u2019s debt. Persels provides those services through nonlawyer staff, involving lawyers only when necessary. Given that business model, the fact that Persels uses local lawyers to offer those services in its initial consultations with consumers, and that those lawyers provide some services that could be characterized as the practice of law, does not persuade us that Persels is an entity that the legislature intended to exempt from the registration requirement. That is so even if it might be true that Persel\u2019s local attorneys might, themselves, be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>avail themselves of the attorney exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, we conclude that the director did not err in determining that Persels was not exempt from registering with the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">B. <em>Number of Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Persels\u2019 second assignment of error challenges the director\u2019s determination that Persels violated ORS 697.612(1) each time that it provided an initial consultation to an Oregon consumer without having registered with the director. Persels points out that, had it registered, that registration would have been valid for two years. ORS 697.632(4). From that observation, Persels reasons that \u201conly one violation of ORS 697.612(1) could possibly occur during a two-year period.\u201d In Persels\u2019 view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cbeing unregistered in violation of ORS 697.612(1) creates a status. That status continues for as long as the entity remains unregistered. No part of the relevant statutory scheme authorizes the Division to assess multiple penalties for a continuing violation of the registration requirement, and other parts of that scheme reflect that the legislature will define when conduct constitutes multiple violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Therefore, Persels reasons, the director erred in imposing a civil penalty on Persels in excess of $5,000 under ORS 697.832. Because, in Persel\u2019s view, it committed but one violation of ORS 697.612, ORS 697.832 limited its civil penalty exposure to $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Persels\u2019 argument does not square with the plain text of ORS 697.612(1). That statute does not indicate that the legislature conceptualized the provision as creating a \u201cstatus,\u201d such that the failure to register would constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>a single ongoing violation, or that the legislature intended the failure to register to result in a violation of ORS 697.612 only once every two years. Contrary to Persels\u2019 conception, ORS 697.612(1) does not, on its face, punish the status of being unregistered. Instead, by its terms, the statute targets conduct by persons who are not registered: the conduct of \u201cengaging] in business in this state in the course of which the person * * * performs a debt management service\u201d or the other related actions listed in the statute. ORS 697.612(1). Viewed in that manner, each time Persels, while unregistered, \u201cengage [d] in business in this state in the course of which\u201d Persels \u201cperformed a debt management service,\u201d Persels violated ORS 697.612(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Apart from its argument that the failure to register is a \u201cstatus\u201d such that an unregistered debt management services provider can only violate ORS 697.612(1) once every two years\u2014an argument that we have concluded is not tenable in view of the text of the statute\u2014Persels does not otherwise argue that the director\u2019s determination that it violated ORS 697.612(1) each time it held an initial consultation with a new Oregon consumer is predicated on a misreading of that statute. We therefore reject Persels\u2019 contention that the director erred in determining that it violated ORS 697.612(1) each time it held an initial consultation with a new Oregon consumer, for a total of 1,801 violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">For all of those reasons, we conclude that Persels has not demonstrated legal error by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> The director\u2019s order contains a section labeled \u201cFindings of Fact.\u201d However, where an agency adjudicator resolves a contested case proceeding on a motion or motions for summary determination under OAR 137-003-0580, the agency does not engage in fact finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cAs is the case on a motion for summary judgment under ORCP 47, the adjudicator is not permitted to make factual findings at that stage of the proceedings. Rather, the issues that an agency is empowered to resolve on summary determination are purely legal: (1) whether the evidence presented gives rise to a dispute of material fact and (2) whether the moving party \u2018is entitled to a favorable ruling as a matter of law.\u2019 OAR 137-003-0580.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>Hamlin v. PERB, </em>273 Or App 796, 798 n 2, 359 P3d 581 (2015). Consistent with the procedural posture of the case, we understand the director\u2019s statement of the facts to be a statement of the undisputed facts, rather than a statement of factual findings. In any event, neither party suggests that the director erroneously engaged in fact finding in resolving the cross-motions for summary determination. <em>See id. </em>(taking the same approach in a similarly-situated agency case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> According to the order on review, one such business model is the \u201cattorney model,\u201d under which a debt management company affiliates with attorneys and represent to consumers that attorneys would assist with the debt negotiation process when, in actuality, attorney involvement was minimal. <em>See </em>Brock, 47 Colum J L &amp; Soc Probs at 404-08 (discussing the development of the attorney model as a means for debt management service providers to operate outside of the regulations generally applicable to the industry).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> The field attorneys include both employees and independent contractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> We are skeptical on this point. Under the director\u2019s rule defining the exception, an attorney is entitled the exception if \u201c[t]he attorney only provides the services to a client of the attorney and only while acting as an attorney on behalf of the client.\u201d OAR 441-910-0005(l)(a). The debt management services on which this case is predicated, however, were rendered during the initial consultations between the field attorneys and the consumers referred to Persels by CareOne\u2014 that is, at a time when it is questionable whether the consumers had become clients of the firm or the attorneys that worked for it, as well as questionable whether the attorneys were \u201conly * \u215c \u215c acting as an attorney on behalf of the client,\u201d in view of the marketing function of those sessions. However, we need not, and do not, resolve the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
