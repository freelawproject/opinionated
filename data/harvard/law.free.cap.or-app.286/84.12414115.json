He brought negligence claims against defendant under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 USC \u00a7\u00a7 51-60, basing five of his claims on violations of the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA), 49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 20701-20703, and associated federal regulations. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs LIA claims, concluding that the LIA was inapplicable because, at the time of plaintiffs injury, the locomotive was not \u201cin use.\u201d On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to that ruling, arguing that, at the time of his injuries, the locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d within the meaning of the LIA. We conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant because, viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, under the totality of the circumstances, the locomotive was \u201cin use.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and remanded with respect to claims 2 through 6 and is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for legal error. <em>Johnson v. State Board of Higher Education, </em>272 Or App 710, 714, 358 P3d 307, <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 527 (2015). Summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ORCP 47 C. Generally, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the nonmoving party, and we draw all reasonable factual inferences in his favor. <em>Morehouse v. Haynes, </em>350 Or 318, 321, 253 P3d 1068 (2011). In this case, the parties agreed for purposes of defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>facts are undisputed. <em>See Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc., </em>357 Or 74, 95-96, 347 P3d 766 (2015) (viewing the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Because the relevant facts on appeal concern the condition of a train and one of its locomotives at the time of plaintiffs injury, we recount the circumstances surrounding the injury in some detail. Plaintiff was employed by defendant as a \u201ccarman,\u201d meaning that he specialized in the inspection, maintenance, and repair of railcars, and, like other carmen employed by defendant, he was not authorized or qualified to work on locomotives. Defendant\u2019s locomotive department\u2014consisting of machinists, hostlers, and electricians\u2014was responsible for performing work on locomotives. Plaintiff was not a member of a transportation crew <em>(i.e., </em>the engineer and other workers who travel with the train).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On the evening of plaintiffs injury, he was working on a train as part of a two-person, outbound-inspection crew in the Terminal 6 rail yard (the T-6 yard) in Portland. Nominally, the T-6 yard is a \u201cstorage yard,\u201d but most of the traffic in the yard is from grain trains travelling to and from the nearby Rivergate terminal. Loaded grain trains travel from the east through the T-6 yard to the Rivergate terminal; after a train is unloaded, a crew typically brings the train back to the T-6 yard for routine inspection and maintenance before the train returns east. Defendant uses storage tracks in the T-6 yard as departure tracks for grain trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Because the T-6 yard lacks a designated repair facility, locomotives or railcars needing repairs or maintenance are sent to a dedicated repair facility in Vancouver, Washington. However, if a locomotive needs only \u201clight work or servicing,\u201d defendant\u2019s locomotive department performs such work at the T-6 yard. Typically, defendant\u2019s locomotive department completes all necessary servicing and repairs on a locomotive before it is coupled to an outbound train for departure. Locomotive 4574, the lead locomotive for the train to which plaintiff was assigned, received an inspection at the Vancouver facility the night before plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Before a train departs from the T-6 yard, the train\u2019s transportation crew arms electronic devices known as the \u201cFRED\u201d and \u201cMary.\u201d The FRED is a flashing device affixed to the rear of a train; the Mary is a small box located inside the lead locomotive. Together, the two devices monitor the air pressure in the train\u2019s air brake system and relay that information between the front and the back of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The train to which plaintiff was assigned was a grain train that was set out on two tracks but otherwise fully assembled, as the tracks were too short to hold the entire train during its predeparture preparations. On the evening of plaintiffs injury, he and a crewmate were inspecting cars, performing an \u201cair test\u201d on the train\u2019s brake lines, and arming the FRED and Mary (typically, the train\u2019s tra nspor-tation crew arms the FRED and Mary, but any qualified person can do so). Plaintiff entered Locomotive 4574 to arm the Mary and observed that the device was not working. He then exited the locomotive and moved on to other inspection tasks in order to give the Mary time to start working properly. When he returned, the Mary was still not operative. In the course of removing the Mary to switch it with a replacement, plaintiff fell from the locomotive and suffered injuries to his elbow, arm, and wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">At the time of plaintiffs injury, the train was \u201cblue flagged.\u201d Blue-flagging is a safety measure used to indicate that workers are in, under, or around a train. <em>See </em>49 CFR \u00a7 218.23(a) (providing that \u201cblue signals\u201d signify that \u201cworkers are on, under, or between rolling equipment,\u201d and, in general, rolling equipment \u201cmay not be moved\u201d when it is blue-flagged). According to federal regulations, the carmen who blue-flagged the train were the only workers permitted to remove the blue flag, and they were not permitted to do so until they had completed their work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">When plaintiff was injured, a \u201chandful\u201d of cars had yet to be inspected. Locomotive 4574 was idling in order \u201cto pump air into the air brake lines to build pressure in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the train\u2019s air braking system.\u201d The train in question, as is typical of grain trains departing the T-6 yard, did not have a scheduled departure time. However, it was considered a \u201chigh priority train,\u201d meaning that \u201cdeparture from the T-6 yard is imminent\u201d once the FRED and Mary are armed. As part of their preparation of the train, the trainmaster had asked plaintiff and his crewmate to \u201cpull down the air\u201d for one section of railcars, which refers to the task of disconnecting the train\u2019s air brake system from the air compressors in the rail yard. Ordinarily, once workers have \u201cpulljed] down the air,\u201d the train departs soon thereafter because, if too much time passes, the train must be subjected to additional brake tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">At the time of plaintiffs injury, there was no transportation crew for the train on site, and no crewmembers had been called to report to the yard to depart with the train that evening. The train was still on the yard tracks and had not been moved onto the main line. The train departed the T-6 yard at 5:30 a.m., approximately 13 hours after plaintiff had started his inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Following the accident, plaintiff brought a damages action against defendant under the FELA, a federal statute that provides a private right of action to railroad workers who sustain on-the-job injuries as a result of their employer\u2019s negligence. 45 USC \u00a7 51; <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Sorrell, </em>549 US 158, 165, 127 S Ct 799, 166 L Ed 2d 638 (2007). Plaintiff based five of his claims on the LIA and corresponding regulations, the violation of which establishes a rail carrier\u2019s negligence as a matter of law for purposes of a FELA action. <em>See Urie v. Thompson, </em>337 US 163, 188-89, 69 S Ct 1018, 93 L Ed 1282 (1949) (so stating with respect to the LIA\u2019s predecessor statute, the Boiler Inspection Act (BIA), <em>former </em>45 USC \u00a7\u00a7 23-34 (1946), <em>repealed by </em>Pub L 103-272, \u00a7 7(b), 108 Stat 1379 (1994)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">A rail worker may rely upon an LIA violation to establish his employer\u2019s negligence as a matter of law only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>if the injury-causing locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d at the time of the injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>49 USC \u00a7 20701 (providing, in relevant part, that a \u201crailroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances\u201d are, among other things, \u201cin proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury\u201d); <em>Wright v. Ark. &amp; Mo. R.R. Co., </em>574 F3d 612, 620 (8th Cir 2009); <em>McGrath v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>136 F3d 838, 842 (1st Cir 1998); <em>Crockett v. Long Island R.R., </em>65 F3d 274, 277 (2d Cir 1995).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Defendant moved for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs five LIA claims, arguing that the LIA is inapplicable because the locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d at the time of plaintiffs injury. For purposes of defendant\u2019s motion, the parties agreed that the material facts were undisputed, and that whether the locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d presented an issue of law for the court to decide. The trial court agreed with defendant that the locomotive was not \u201cin use,\u201d granted defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, and dismissed plaintiffs LIA claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in its conclusion that the LIA is inapplicable because the locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d at the time of plaintiffs injury, thereby precluding plaintiff from relying on the LIA to establish defendant\u2019s negligence as a matter of law under the FELA. We have not previously had an occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to address the proper application of the LIA\u2019s \u201cin use\u201d test. In this case, the relevant historical facts are undisputed, and we review the question of whether the locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d at the time of the injury as a question of law. <em>See Deans v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>152 F3d 326, 329 (4th Cir 1998); <em>Angell v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>618 F2d 260, 262 (4th Cir 1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s determination that the locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d for legal error. <em>See Minihan v. Stiglich, </em>258 Or App 839, 861, 311 P3d 922 (2013) (reviewing the trial court\u2019s resolution of a question of law for legal error).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We first address plaintiffs argument that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brady v. Terminal Railroad Association, </em>303 US 10, 58 S Ct 426, 82 L Ed 614 (1938), established a bright-line rule that, to be considered <em>not </em>\u201cin use,\u201d a rail vehicle must have been removed from service and \u201creached a place of repair.\u201d We are bound by the Court\u2019s construction of federal statutes, <em>Industra/Matrix Joint Venture v. Pope &amp; Talbot, </em>200 Or App 248, 256, 113 P3d 961 (2005), <em>aff'd, </em>341 Or 321, 142 P3d 1044 (2006), and, therefore, if such a bright-line test exists, our inquiry would end because it is undisputed that the train in this case was not in a dedicated place of repair. Defendant argues, however, that <em>Brady </em>does not <em>go </em>so far as plaintiff suggests. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In <em>Brady, </em>a case arising under the Safety Appliance Act (SAA),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff worked as a railcar inspector. 303 US at 11. The plaintiff was injured while inspecting one car in a string of cars placed upon a \u201creceiving\u201d track in a rail yard. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the car was \u201cin use\u201d for purposes of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">\u201cThe statute gives no ground for holding that it was the intent of Congress that in a situation such as is here presented neither [of the defendants] should be subject to the statutory duty. The use, movement or hauling of the defective car, within the meaning of the statute, had not ended when petitioner sustained his injuries. The car had been brought into the yard at Granite City and placed on a receiving track temporarily pending the continuance of transportation. If not found to be defective, it would proceed to [its] destination; if found defective, it would be subject to removal for repairs. <em>It is not a case where a defective car has reached a place of repair. The car in this instance had not been withdrawn from use. </em>The car was still in use, though motionless. In view of that use, either [of the defendants] was subject to the obligation imposed by the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 13 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Based on the italicized language, plaintiff argues that <em>Brady </em>establishes a bright-line rule that a locomotive or other rail vehicle is \u201cin use\u201d <em>unless </em>it has \u201creached a place of repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We do not interpret that language in such absolute terms. The Court did not, in its abbreviated analysis, rely exclusively on the fact that the railcar was not in a \u201cplace of repair\u201d to conclude that it was \u201cin use.\u201d Rather, the court also considered the fact that the car would depart immediately if it passed inspection and that it was en route to its destination. Thus, <em>Brady </em>suggests that the \u201cin use\u201d analysis turns on the totality of the circumstances, with consideration for such factors as the rail vehicle\u2019s location at the time of the injury (including whether it was in a \u201cplace of repair\u201d), whether the vehicle was in the midst of a journey, and the nature of the activity being performed upon or with the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">That is, in fact,, how most courts approach the \u201cin use\u201d inquiry, although some courts focus primarily on the location of the rail vehicle at the time of the accident and the activity in which the injured party was engaged. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wright, 574 F3d at 621 (concluding that the proper analysis turns on \u201cthe totality of circumstances at the time of the injury\u201d); <em>Deans, </em>152 F3d at 329 (\u201c[T]o determine whether a train is \u2018in use\u2019 * * *, the primary factors we consider are where the train was located at the time of the accident and the activity of the injured party.\u201d); <em>McGrath, </em>136 F3d at 842 (stating that \u201cthe determinative factors\u201d are the \u201clocation of the locomotive at the time of the injury and the activity of the injured party\u201d); <em>Crockett, 65 </em>F3d at 277-78 (considering the totality of circumstances, including the fact that the train at issue was inactive on a yard track awaiting cleaning, the locomotive was not idling, the train was not being readied for imminent departure, and the plaintiff was the only employee working on the train); <em>Davis v. Burlington N. Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2016 IL App (3d) 150464, \u00b6 20, 59 NE3d 820, 827 (2016) (\u201c[C]ourts are to apply a totality-of-the-circumstances, multifactor analysis in determining whether a particular locomotive was \u2018in use\u2019 at the time of an injury.\u201d). <em>But see Trinidad v. Southern Pac. Trans. Co., </em>949 F2d 187, 189 (5th Cir 1991) (concluding that the SAA does not apply to a rail vehicle until the train has been \u201creleased following inspection,\u201d unless the vehicle has \u201cpassed inspection\u201d before being coupled to the train). Thus, consistently with the majority of courts that have addressed the \u201cin use\u201d issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>we conclude that the proper analysis looks to the totality of circumstances and does not depend upon the application of a bright-line rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><em>Brady </em>establishes several other principles that are pertinent to our analysis. For one, <em>Brady </em>stands for the proposition that a rail vehicle need not be in motion to be considered \u201cin use.\u201d <em>See Brady, </em>303 US at 13; <em>Deans, </em>152 F3d at 330 (\u201cA train may be considered \u2018in use\u2019 even though it is motionless and not yet on the main track.\u201d). Second, <em>Brady </em>establishes that a rail vehicle or train undergoing inspection may still qualify as \u201cin use,\u201d at the very least in situations in which the vehicle would immediately move into service if it passed inspection. <em>See Brady, </em>303 US at 16 (reasoning that \u201cone is not to be denied the benefit of the Act because his work was that of inspection for the purpose of discovering defects\u201d); <em>Wright, </em>574 F3d at 621 <em>(\u201cBrady </em>* * * demonstrate[s] that undergoing inspection, without more, is probably insufficient to establish that a train is not in use.\u201d); <em>Holfester, </em>360 F2d at 373 (liability under the BIA does not depend on \u201cthe position the employee may be in, or the work which he may be doing at the moment when he is injured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Brady </em>does not, however, make clear how courts are to determine the point at which a railroad carrier becomes liable for an injury caused by defects in a locomotive that has not yet commenced its journey. On that point, we find the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Angell </em>to be instructive. In that case, at the time of the plaintiffs injury, \u201call servicing, maintenance, and inspection work had already been performed\u201d on the locomotive, and it \u201cwas being moved to its place in the consist.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 618 F2d at 262. The Fourth Circuit found no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d at the time of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 260-61. The court observed that \u201cCongressional intent and the case law construing the [LIA] clearly exclude those injuries directly resulting from the inspection, repair, or servicing of railroad equipment located at a maintenance facility,\u201d but, according to the court, it was unclear at what point a railroad carrier becomes absolutely liable for injuries caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>by defective equipment once \u201cthose excluded activities have been performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262 (footnote omitted). The court rejected an analysis that would completely exclude from coverage those injuries that occur \u201cbetween servicing and preparing the [locomotive] up until the time the engineer takes the controls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court concluded that the point at which a railroad becomes liable under the LIA is the point at which a locomotive has been \u201cmade ready\u201d for its journey\u2014in other words, when the inspection, repair, and servicing of the locomotive are complete. <em>Id. </em>Applying that rule, <em>the Angell </em>court reasoned that, because the plaintiff was moving the locomotive in order for it to pull a train, it was proper to infer that the locomotive \u201cwas not in need of further repair or servicing and, in reality, had been \u2018okayed\u2019 by railway officials for service as contemplated by the [LIA].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Following Angell, other courts have applied the principle that a rail vehicle assigned to an outbound train that has not completed predeparture inspection may nevertheless be considered \u201cin use\u201d if that particular <em>vehicle </em>is otherwise ready to move into service. <em>See, e.g., McGrath, </em>136 F3d at 842 (locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d because it was \u201crunning on the yard track and ready to move into service,\u201d despite the fact that some pre-departure inspection tasks \u201cincidental to the task of operating the train\u201d were not complete (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Deans, </em>152 F3d at 329-30 (rail vehicle was \u201cin use\u201d even though pre-departure inspections had not been completed because the train \u201calready had its engine coupled to it and was standing on a track in the rail yard in preparation for imminent departure\u201d); <em>Rivera v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>868 F Supp 294, 300-01 (D Colo 1994) (locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d when its engineer was performing predeparture inspections because the rail carrier\u2019s service department had already \u201ccompleted its maintenance, repair, and servicing of the locomotive,\u201d and the locomotive was ready for \u201cimmediate use,\u201d as evidenced by the fact that it was coupled to railcars and idling); <em>Balough v. Northeast Ill. Reg\u2019l Commuter R.R. Corp., </em>409 III App 3d 750, 766, 950 NE2d 680, 698 (2011) (\u201cIf the train or [locomotive] has been serviced and is being moved or is ready to be moved to the main line[,] it is \u2018in use,\u2019 even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>not all inspections have been completed.\u201d); <em>see also Edwards v. CSX Transp. Inc., </em>821 F3d 758, 762 (6th Cir 2016) (\u201c[A] locomotive is \u2018in use\u2019 almost any time it is not stopped for repair\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">We agree with the foregoing cases that the focus of the \u201cin use\u201d inquiry must be to determine whether, in effect, the railroad carrier had released into a service a locomotive that it has deemed to be \u201cin proper condition and safe to operate,\u201d <em>see </em>49 USC \u00a7 20701, regardless of whether further predeparture activities were required before the train as a whole was ready to depart. That understanding of the \u201cin use\u201d inquiry is consistent with the purpose of the LIA, which is to broadly protect railroad workers from the use of rail equipment that poses an \u201cunnecessary peril to life or limb.\u201d <em>Urie, </em>337 US at 191 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Lilly v. Grand Trunk W. R. Co., </em>317 US 481, 486, 63 S Ct 347, 87 L Ed 411 (1943) (the LIA is to be \u201cliberally construed in light of its prime purpose, the protection of employees and others by requiring the use of safe equipment\u201d). It is also consistent with the purpose behind the \u201cin use\u201d limitation, which is to \u201cgive[] the railroad an opportunity to remedy hazardous conditions before strict liability attaches to claims made by injured workers.\u201d <em>See Wright, </em>574 F3d at 620; <em>Wilson v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>509 SW3d 862, 870 (Mo Ct App 2017) (\u201cThe purpose of [the \u2018in use\u2019] limitation is to encourage and allow railroad companies to take defective locomotives out of service for inspection and repairs by relieving them of strict liability for defects in those engines while they are being serviced.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We therefore conclude that, when a railroad carrier\u2019s customary processes for preparing an outbound locomotive for departure are complete, and the locomotive will not undergo further comprehensive inspections, it is appropriate to regard the railroad carrier as having allowed the locomotive to be put \u201cin use.\u201d That is so even when other portions of the train to which the locomotive is assigned are still undergoing comprehensive inspection, because such inspections are not directed at detecting hazardous conditions in the locomotive itself. <em>See Babin v. New Orleans Pub.

Maynard v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>51 F3d 267 (Table), 1995 WL 131363 at *1 (4th Cir 1995) (concluding that a locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d at the time of an engineer\u2019s injury because the engineer had a duty to inspect the locomotive for defects, and he had not yet commenced that inspection at the time of his injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Turning to the summary judgment record in this case, we conclude that the trial court erred in its conclusion that Locomotive 4574 was not \u201cin use\u201d because, viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, defendant\u2019s customary processes for detecting and repairing defects in Locomotive 4574 were complete, and defendant had deemed Locomotive 4574 ready to move into service. One can reasonably infer that defendant\u2019s locomotive department had finished any work that it was going to perform on Locomotive 4574 because the vehicle was coupled to a train that was being readied for departure, and, in general, defendant\u2019s locomotive department at the T-6 yard completed all servicing, repair, and maintenance on a locomotive before it was allowed to be coupled to railcars. One can also reasonably infer that, once plaintiffs work was complete, the train would have been ready for departure because plaintiff was instructed to disconnect the train from \u201cyard air,\u201d and, when plaintiff was injured, he was engaged in arming the FRED and Mary, one of the final tasks to be completed before the train\u2019s departure. Moreover, the tasks in which plaintiff was engaged were concerned with the train as a whole rather than the locomotive, and we agree with the reasoning of other courts, discussed above, that have focused the inquiry on the condition of the locomotive itself. In short, under the totality of circumstances, including reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs favor, Locomotive 4574 was \u201cin use.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiffs act of replacing the Mary in Locomotive 4574 had the effect of taking the locomotive out of service.because plaintiff was performing a repair task at the time he was injured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The record suggests that arming the FRED and Mary is a predeparture task directed at the train\u2019s air brake system as a whole, and it is not a task intended to discover defects or hazardous conditions particular to the locomotive itself. That can be inferred from the fact that a worker need not have specialized expertise with respect to locomotives in order to arm the devices, and plaintiff himself was not authorized to inspect or work on locomotives. Thus, plaintiffs attempt to replace the defective Mary does not undermine the reasonable inference that defendant had already deemed Locomotive 4674 ready for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In arguing that the locomotive was not \u201cin use,\u201d defendant also relies heavily on the fact that the train had no scheduled departure time, the train did not depart until 13 hours after plaintiff and his crewmate started inspecting the railcars, and there was no transportation crew on site. We do not dispute that the imminence of a train\u2019s departure has some bearing on the \u201cin use\u201d analysis because a train\u2019s imminent departure supports an inference that its component parts have been approved for use. However, in this case, the passage of time between plaintiffs injury and the train\u2019s departure does not undermine a conclusion that Locomotive 4574 was \u201cin use.\u201d The fact that the train did not have a scheduled departure time tells us little about whether Locomotive 4574 was \u201cin use,\u201d as the grain trains departing from the T-6 yard generally do not have set departure times. Thus, with respect to the imminence of the train\u2019s departure, it is more significant that the locomotive was already coupled to cars and that it was part of an assembled train that was preparing to depart.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, although a significant amount of time passed between the start of plaintiffs work and the train\u2019s departure, we think it is more relevant that, once plaintiff completed the tasks to which he was assigned, the train would have been ready to depart, supporting an inference that Locomotive 4574 had been approved for use. Defendant does not point to any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>showing that this train\u2019s departure process was unusual in any respect, and therefore, we do not give the passage of time between inspection and departure much weight. Similarly, without more information about how soon before departure a transportation crew typically arrives on site, the fact that the crew had not yet arrived when plaintiff was injured does little to inform our analysis about whether the locomotive was ready for departure. Our role in reviewing the grant of summary judgment is not to draw inferences in defendant\u2019s favor, and defendant has not pointed to contextual evidence that would render the absence of an on-site transportation crew conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Finally, the fact that the train was \u201cblue-flagged\u201d at the time of plaintiffs injury does not undermine a conclusion that the locomotive was \u201cin use.\u201d Blue flags are required whenever rail workers are working \u201con, under, or between rolling equipment,\u201d 49 CFR \u00a7 218.23(a), and therefore, the presence of blue flags is not necessarily an indication that the <em>locomotive </em>had been withdrawn from use or was otherwise being repaired or serviced. The circumstances relevant to the \u201cin use\u201d analysis include whether the comprehensive inspection, maintenance, and repair of an outbound locomotive was complete; whether the locomotive would be ready to depart once it passed predeparture inspection; and whether the injured worker was engaged in tasks directed at detecting and repairing defects to the locomotive. The fact that the <em>train </em>was not permitted to move at the precise time that plaintiff was injured has little bearing on those considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Accordingly, viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that the trial court erred in its conclusion that the locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d when plaintiff was injured. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Judgment on claims 2 through 6 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\"> We note that plaintiff did not file a cross-motion for summary judgment, so whether plaintiff would have been entitled to partial summary judgment had he moved for it is not before us. We decide only whether, viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the locomotive was \u201cin use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> We apply federal substantive law and Oregon procedural law to federal claims brought in state court. <em>Geris v.

Whether the \u201cin use\u201d inquiry presents an issue of fact or an issue of law is a procedural question on which we are not bound by federal cases that have treated it as the latter. <em>See Geris, </em>277 Or at 383 (\u201cIn cases arising under federal law, such as the [FELA] \u215c:|!\u215c, state courts are bound to follow federal substantive law but are free to follow their own practices as to matters which are strictly procedural.\u201d); <em>Shropshire v.

On appeal, plaintiff argues that the \u201cin use\u201d determination is a question of fact, but he concedes that he did not make that argument below. Indeed, the parties agreed below that the question is one of law, and the trial court treated it as such.

However, because the SAA also applies to assembled trains, cases analyzing whether a train was \u201cin use\u201d under the SAA may have limited application when assessing whether an individual rail vehicle (such as a locomotive) was \u201cin use.\u201d <em>See United States v.
