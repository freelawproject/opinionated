In that order, the board upheld insurer SAIF Corporation\u2019s (1) denial of claimant\u2019s \u201cnew and omitted condition\u201d claims, ORS 656.267; and (2) denial of claimant\u2019s \u201ccombined condition\u201d claim, ORS 656.262(6)(c). We review under ORS 183.482(8) and ORS 656.298(7), and affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">On February 8, 2012, claimant injured her left knee at work, and claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits in connection with the injury. SAIF accepted the claim, designating the accepted condition as a \u201cleft knee sprain and contusion.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, SAIF modified its acceptance to accept a combined condition beginning on the date of claimant\u2019s workplace injury. SAIF identified the combined condition as the knee sprain and contusion that claimant suffered at work combined with claimant\u2019s preexisting medial compartmental left knee arthritis. SAIF subsequently denied the continued compensability of claimant\u2019s combined condition, finding that, as of September 14, 2012, claimant\u2019s accepted workplace injury was no longer the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined left knee condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">After SAIF\u2019s initial acceptance of her claim, claimant initiated two \u201cnew or omitted condition\u201d claims under ORS 656.267. Claimant requested that SAIF accept the condition of \u201cunicompartmental arthritis\u201d and also a condition that was \u201ca combination between what has been diagnosed as preexisting arthritis in [claimant\u2019s] left knee with the injury event of February 8, 2012.\u201d SAIF denied both of claimant\u2019s \u201cnew or omitted condition\u201d claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Claimant requested a hearing on the denials before an administrative law judge (ALJ), and the ALJ affirmed. Claimant then sought review before the board, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order. The board unanimously concluded that SAIF properly denied claimant\u2019s \u201cnew and omitted\u201d condition claims, finding that \u201cthe record does not persuasively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>establish that\u201d the conditions for which claimant sought acceptance were \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the combined condition that SAIF already had accepted. A majority of the board, over one board member\u2019s dissent, also found that claimant\u2019s workplace injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s current combined condition as of September 14, 2012, and, therefore, that SAIF properly denied the continued compensability of claimant\u2019s combined condition after that date. The dissenting board member would have reached a different result, explaining that she found the medical opinions on which the majority relied unpersuasive, in part because the doctors who rendered those opinions appeared to evaluate claimant\u2019s condition in a manner that was contrary to our decision in <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 325 P3d 834 (2014), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>361 Or 241, 391 P3d 773 (2017) <em>(Brown I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review. In her first assignment of error, claimant challenges the board\u2019s determination that SAIF properly denied her \u201cnew or omitted condition\u201d claims. In her second assignment of error, she challenges the board\u2019s finding that her workplace knee injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of her combined condition as of September 14, 2012. We address claimant\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">ORS 656.267<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> governs claimant\u2019s \u201cnew and omitted condition\u201d claims. By its terms, the statute provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>mechanism for a workers\u2019 compensation claimant to seek acceptance of conditions that are not included within the scope of an insurer\u2019s acceptance of the claimant\u2019s claim, which must \u201c[sjpecify what conditions are compensable.\u201d ORS 656.262(6)(b)(A). Here, the board found that the conditions for which claimant sought acceptance in her \u201cnew and omitted condition\u201d claims were included within the scope of the combined condition that SAIF already had accepted. Thus, the board concluded, SAIF properly denied claimant\u2019s claims under ORS 656.267 because the conditions for which claimant sought acceptance were not, in fact, new or omitted conditions within the meaning of ORS 656.267.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">On review, claimant does not assign error to the board\u2019s factual finding that the conditions for which she sought acceptance were included within the combined condition that SAIF already had accepted. <em>SAIF v. Custer, </em>181 Or App 199, 202, 45 P3d 508 (2002) (explaining that the scope of SAIF\u2019s acceptance is a question of fact reviewed for substantial evidence). Instead, claimant argues that SAIF was required to accept those conditions even if they were included within the previously accepted condition, and that SAIF\u2019s denials of claimant\u2019s \u201cnew and omitted condition\u201d claims under ORS 656.267 were therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We disagree. As its text indicates, the purpose of ORS 656.267 is to permit a workers\u2019 compensation claimant to obtain acceptance of conditions that, as a factual matter, are not included within the scope of an insurer\u2019s acceptance of the claimant\u2019s claim. The focus of the statute is on conditions that are \u201cnew\u201d or \u201comitted\u201d with respect to an existing notice of acceptance. <em>Nacoste v. Halton Co., </em>275 Or App 600, 605-07, 365 P3d 1098 (2015) (discussing legislative history of ORS 656.267 and explaining that purpose of statute is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>create a process for acceptance of conditions that are \u201cdistinct from the condition identified as accepted in the notice of acceptance\u201d)- Nothing in the text, context, or legislative history of the statute supports claimant\u2019s argument that the legislature intended to require an insurer to reaccept (and reprocess) a condition that, as a factual matter, already has been accepted. The board did not err in upholding SAIF\u2019s denials of claimant\u2019s \u201cnew and omitted condition\u201d claims under ORS 656.267.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We turn to claimant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which claimant contends that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s workplace knee injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition as of September 14, 2012. In particular, claimant relies on our decision in <em>Brown I </em>to argue that the record lacks substantial evidence to support that finding because the examining doctors on which the board relied focused on whether claimant\u2019s \u201caccepted condition\u201d <em>ii.e., </em>the knee sprain and contusion) remained the major contributing cause of her combined condition, and did not analyze whether claimant\u2019s \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d remained the major contributing cause of her combined condition. <em>See </em>262 Or App at 656 (holding that correct test to determine if a combined condition remains compensable is \u201cwhether claimant\u2019s work-related injury incident is the major contributing cause of the combined condition\u201d). Alternatively, claimant argues that the board\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence because, in her view, the record lacks evidence to support a finding that claimant\u2019s condition changed after the date on which SAIF accepted the combined condition, a finding that is required by our case law. <em>See Washington County v. Jansen, </em>248 Or App 335, 345, 273 P3d 278 (2012); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Young, </em>219 Or App 410, 419, 182 P3d 298 (2008) (explaining that medical evidence must demonstrate a change in the claimant\u2019s condition in order to support a finding that claimant\u2019s combined condition is no longer compensable). Claimant contends additionally that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial reason, asserting that the board did not adequately explain why it found certain medical evidence persuasive and why it rejected other medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>To the extent claimant\u2019s arguments are predicated on our decision in <em>Brown I, </em>they have been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reversal of that decision. <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>361 Or 241, 244, 391 P3d 773 (2017) <em>(Brown II). </em>There, the court held that \u201can employer is entitled to deny a combined condition claim when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of that combined condition,\u201d rejecting our contrary conclusion that an employer has to prove that the \u201cwork-related injury incident\u201d no longer remained a major contributing cause of any combined condition in order to deny compensability. <em>Id. </em>at 283. In view of the court\u2019s conclusion, we must reject claimant\u2019s contention that the reports on which the board relied cannot constitute substantial evidence. Even if claimant is correct that those reports do not align with the standard that we articulated in <em>Brown I, </em>the reports are consistent with the articulation of the applicable legal standard <em>Brown II, </em>and, for that reason, the board permissibly could rely on them to determine that claimant\u2019s workplace injury had ceased to be the major contributing cause of her current combined condition as of September 14, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">As noted, claimant also argues that the record does not contain substantial evidence that claimant\u2019s condition changed between the date of SAIF\u2019s effective acceptance of claimant\u2019s combined condition and September 14, 2012, the date that, according to SAIF, claimant\u2019s combined condition became no longer compensable. <em>See Oregon Drywall Systems, Inc. v. Bacon, </em>208 Or App 205, 210, 144 P3d 987 (2006) (holding that \u201cthe effective date of acceptance provides a baseline for determining whether a worker\u2019s condition has changed so that\u201d the accepted condition no longer remains the major contributing cause of a combined condition). \u201cSubstantial evidence supports a finding when the record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to make the finding.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 294, 787 P2d 884 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the requisite change occurred and, in particular, the finding that claimant\u2019s accepted knee sprain and contusion had resolved by September 14, 2012. That evidence includes the opinion of Dr. Dewing, who conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>an independent medical examination of claimant on September 14, 2012, and Dr. Sabahi, who evaluated claimant\u2019s condition based on a comprehensive review of claimant\u2019s medical records. Dewing opined that, although he could not pinpoint the specific date by which claimant\u2019s workplace knee injury resolved, the knee sprain and contusion had resolved no later than September 14, 2012, as there were no \u201cfindings specific to\u201d the sprain or the contusion as of that date. Sabahi concurred in that opinion based on his review of claimant\u2019s records. Those opinions would permit a reasonable person to find that claimant\u2019s condition changed between the date of her workplace injury and September 14, 2012. Although there was competing evidence in the record that would permit a reasonable person to reach the contrary finding reached by the dissenting board member, that does not make the board majority\u2019s reliance on the evidence on which it relied unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Finally, claimant argues that the board\u2019s decision\u2014 in particular, its decision to rely on the opinions of Dewing and Sabahi, rather than the competing opinions of other medical professionals\u2014is not supported by substantial reason, given what claimant perceives to be a number of weak points in the opinions of Dewing and Sabahi. An agency\u2019s decision is supported by substantial reason if the decision \u201csupplies] an explanation connecting the facts of the case and the result reached.\u201d <em>Rogue Advocates v. Jackson County, </em>282 Or App 381, 389, 385 P3d 1262 (2016). Here, the board\u2019s decision, which explained why the board found the evidence on which it relied more persuasive than the evidence on which it did not, met that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> The notice of acceptance refers to the accepted condition as a knee \u201csprain,\u201d although some documents in the record refer to the condition as a \u201cstrain.\u201d We refer to the condition as a \u201csprain\u201d to be consistent with SAIF\u2019s specification of the accepted condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> ORS 656.267, regarding claims for \u201cnew and omitted medical conditions,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201c(1) To initiate omitted medical condition claims under ORS 656.262(6)(d) or new medical condition claims under this section, the worker must clearly request formal written acceptance of a new medical condition or an omitted medical condition from the insurer or self-insured employer.
