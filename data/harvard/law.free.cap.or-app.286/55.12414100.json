J.</author>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The issue in this juvenile dependency case is whether ORS 419A.150(3) allows a party the opportunity to present new evidence in a judicial rehearing of a referee\u2019s determination or whether that evidence can be excluded at the discretion of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, when mother failed to appear at a pretrial conference under ORS 419B.815(2)(b) before a juvenile court referee, the referee allowed the Department of Human Services (DHS) to proceed with its <em>prima facie </em>case, and the referee entered an order taking jurisdiction of mother\u2019s child, D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the referee entered that order, mother made a timely request for a rehearing before a juvenile court judge under ORS 419A.150, seeking to present additional evidence to rebut DHS\u2019s previously proven case. The court \u201caffirmed\u201d the referee\u2019s order without affording mother the opportunity to present additional evidence and entered a judgment taking jurisdiction of D. Mother appeals from that judgment, arguing that she was entitled to present additional evidence at the rehearing. DHS responds that the court had discretion to decide whether to allow mother to present additional evidence and it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>abuse that discretion. We agree with mother and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We begin by briefly reviewing the relevant portions of ORS 419A.150. ORS 419A.150(1) permits juvenile court judges to \u201cappoint one or more persons as referees of the juvenile court.\u201d A juvenile court judge may \u201cdirect that any case, or all cases of a class designated by the judge, be processed or heard in the first instance by a referee,\u201d who then transmits his or her \u201cfindings, recommendations or order in writing\u201d to the judge. ORS 419A.150(2). A referee order is \u201cimmediately effective, subject to the right of review provided in [ORS 419A.150].\u201d ORS 419A.150(4). After the referee conducts a hearing, certain parties\u2014including \u201ca child, ward, youth, youth offender, the parent, guardian, district attorney, [DHS], juvenile department or other party affected by the order\u201d\u2014are entitled to request a rehearing before a juvenile court judge. ORS 419A.150(3), (7). The court may also order a rehearing on its own motion. ORS 419A.150(6). If no party requests a rehearing within 10 days, then the referee\u2019s order becomes \u201ca final order of the juvenile court.\u201d ORS 419A.150(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">If a party requests a rehearing, pursuant to ORS 419A.150(3), \u201c[a] rehearing before a judge of the juvenile court may be determined on the same evidence introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept, but, in any case, additional evidence may be presented.\u201d ORS 419A.150(8) further provides that the \u201crehearing is conducted de novo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Here, as noted, DHS petitioned for jurisdiction of mother\u2019s child, D. Mother failed to appear for a pretrial conference before a referee. At the pretrial conference, the referee permitted DHS to present its <em>prima facie </em>case without mother present. The referee subsequently entered an order taking jurisdiction of D. Mother then made a timely request for a rehearing under ORS 419A.150. She argued that, on rehearing, she was entitled to a full jurisdictional hearing before the court, including the right to present evidence. In response, the state argued that mother had forfeited any right to present evidence by failing to appear. The juvenile court agreed with the state, explaining its reasoning in a letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The court first concluded that \u201cthere was no reasonable excuse for Mother\u2019s absence [.] \u201d Next, the court explained that \u201c[h]ad Mother been at the hearing, she would have had the right to call witnesses (including herself, of course), cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses, and otherwise participate in the hearing.\u201d However, \u201c[b]ecause she was not present in person at the hearing, she lost that right.\u201d The court further explained that it \u201cd [id] not believe that it was the legislature\u2019s intention to allow a parent who failed to appear at the Pretrial Conference and Judicial Settlement Conference to [present evidence] at rehearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The court also concluded that, even if mother\u2019s failure to appear did not preclude her from presenting evidence, the court could nevertheless deny her request to do so. According to the court, ORS 419A.150(3) \u201cgives the trial court conducting the rehearing the discretion to review the case using the evidence presented at the initial hearing and also gives the trial court discretion to allow the presentation of\u2018additional evidence.\u2019\u201d The court determined that, \u201cto the extent that I may allow [mother] to produce additional evidence, I elect to not exercise that discretion.\u201d As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201cTo exercise my discretion to allow a parent to proceed to adduce testimony at a rehearing of a hearing to which she failed to attend in the first instance would be to vitiate the need to even consider whether an absence was excusable, and would make ORS 419 [B].815(7) superfluous. A parent, having missed the hearing as summoned due to her own neglect, could simply seek a second bite at the apple, despite the summons and its dire warnings. That would be unfair to the many parents who are present at their hearings even at great difficulty or inconvenience, and could lead to rehearings simply due to a parent\u2019s absence at the hearing to which the parent was summoned originally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The court then stated that it had \u201creviewed <em>de novo </em>the evidence presented\u201d at the hearing before the referee, and it \u201caffirmed\u201d the referee\u2019s order taking jurisdiction over D. The court subsequently entered a judgment consistent with that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On appeal, the parties dispute the scope of the rehearing available under ORS 419A.150. According to mother, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>statute permits a new hearing on the merits of the case, including the right to present evidence. The state responds that the statute allows a party to obtain reconsideration of the referee\u2019s decision on the record created by the referee, and that whether new evidence may be presented is at the juvenile court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">To resolve that issue, we must interpret ORS 419A.150 by examining its text, context, and any relevant legislative history to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 <em>(2009); PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). When the text of a statute contains words in common usage, we interpret those words in accordance with their plain, natural, and ordinary meanings. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. Furthermore, if a term has a \u201cwell-defined legal meaning,\u201d we presume that the legislature intended for it to carry that meaning. <em>Dept. of Transportation v. Stallcup, </em>341 Or 93, 99, 138 P3d 9 (2006). We may rely on dictionaries to discern the meaning of words in common usage, <em>State v. Higgins, </em>165 Or App 442, 445, 998 P2d 222 (2000), and legal dictionaries for legal terms of art, <em>Powerex Corp. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>357 Or 40, 61, 346 P3d 476 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The parties primarily focus on three sections of ORS 419A.150:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201c(3) When the referee conducts a hearing, the persons entitled to request rehearing as provided in subsection (7) of this section must be notified of the referee\u2019s findings, recommendations or order, together with a notice to the effect that a rehearing may be had before a judge if requested within 10 days. <em>A rehearing before a judge of the juvenile court may be determined on the same evidence introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept, but, in any case, additional evidence may be presented.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201c(4) <em>All orders of a referee become immediately effective, subject to the right of review provided in this section, </em>and continue in full force and effect, unless stayed by order of the referee or by a juvenile court judge, until vacated or modified upon rehearing by order of a judge of the juvenile court. Any order entered by a referee becomes a final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of the juvenile court upon expiration of 10 days following its entry, unless a rehearing is ordered or requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">\"* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201c(8) All rehearings of matters heard before a referee shall be heard expeditiously by a judge of the juvenile court within 30 days after the filing of the request, unless the court orders a continuance. In no event may the rehearing occur later than 45 days after the date of the filing of the request. <em>The rehearing is conducted de novo!\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">To start, we address the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion in its letter opinion that a litigant who failed to appear before a referee is barred from presenting evidence at a rehearing. The text and context of ORS 419A.150 do not support that conclusion. ORS 419A.150 does not make any distinctions between appearing and nonappearing parties. The statute extends the right to \u201crequest rehearing\u201d to several classes of litigants, including \u201ca child, ward, * * *, the parent, guardian, district attorney, [DHS], juvenile department or other party affected by the order\u201d without regard to their participation in the hearing before the referee. ORS 419A.150(7). Nor is there anything in the statute to suggest that ORS 419A.150(3), providing that \u201cadditional evidence may be presented,\u201d is limited to parties who appeared before the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In its letter opinion, the court relied in part on ORS 419B.815(7). ORS 419B.815(7) allows for a juvenile court to \u201cestablish jurisdiction without further notice\u201d if a party fails to appear for \u201cany hearing related to the petition,\u201d as the referee did at the pretrial conference in this case, or as a rehearing court might do if a party fails to appear at a rehearing. The statute, however, is silent as to any limitations on the scope of a rehearing under ORS 419A.150 if a party failed to appear at a hearing before a referee, and it is not useful context for discerning the meaning of ORS 419A.150.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">For its part, DHS does not defend that portion of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling. Rather, as noted, DHS contends that we should interpret the statute to grant the juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>discretion to allow or deny the parties the opportunity to present additional evidence. That position, however, also is not supported by the text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Again, ORS 419A.150(3) provides that \u201c[a] rehearing before a judge of the juvenile court may be determined on the same evidence introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept, but, in any case, additional evidence may be presented.\u201d DHS argues that the second use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in that sentence grants discretion to the juvenile court to deny a party the opportunity to present additional evidence. We disagree and conclude that the phrase \u201cadditional evidence may be presented\u201d unambiguously provides litigants with permission to present new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In other contexts, the use of the passive voice (\u201cmay be presented\u201d) might create ambiguity as to the subject of a sentence <em>(i.e., </em>the identity of the actor who may present evidence). <em>See Alfieri v. Solomon, </em>358 Or 383, 399-400, 365 P3d 99 (2015) (explaining that, depending on the context, the passive voice might \u201cconvey [] [the legislature\u2019s] intent that a statute apply more broadly\u201d but also might simply \u201cgenerate[] ambiguity as to how the law should be applied\u201d); <em>Brentmar v. Jackson County, </em>321 Or 481, 487, 900 P2d 1030 (1995) (concluding that the legislature\u2019s use of the passive voice created an ambiguity as to the identity of the subject who was permitted to act as provided by the statute). Here, however, there is no ambiguity. Instead, the implicit subject of the sentence is clear from context: Litigants, not courts, \u201cpresent\u201d evidence\u2014and, thus, litigants may act under the statute to present additional evidence to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In this context, the word \u201cmay,\u201d which is a word in common usage, means \u201chave permission to\u201d or \u201chave liberty to.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third, New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1396 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, if additional evidence \u201cmay be presented\u201d by litigants, then they \u201chave permission\u201d to present such evidence. ORS 419A.150(3) plainly grants litigants permission to offer additional evidence on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">DHS contends that the statement in ORS 419A.150(3) that a rehearing \u201cmay be determined on the same evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept\u201d indicates that the court need not permit a party to present new evidence. However, as discussed above, the remaining portion of that sentence provides that, \u201cin any case, additional evidence may be presented.\u201d The statute therefore <em>permits </em>parties to present new evidence; however, it does not to <em>require </em>them to do so. Thus, the former clause allows a court to make a decision on rehearing on the record before the referee if a transcript is available and the parties choose not to present any additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The parties also dispute the significance of two other terms in ORS 419A.150\u2014the use of \u201crehearing\u201d to label the procedure provided by the statute and the description of the standard of review for that rehearing as \u201cde novo\u201d in ORS 419A.150(8). In a different context, the legislature\u2019s use of those terms might generate ambiguity. \u201cRehearing\u201d can mean either a \u201c[s]econd consideration of [a] cause for [the] sole purpose of calling to [the] court\u2019s attention any error, omission, or oversight in [the] first consideration\u201d or \u201c[a] retrial of issues\u201d with \u201cnotice to [the] parties entitled thereto and [an] opportunity for them to be heard.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1452 (4th ed 1968). Similarly, \u201cde novo,\u201d which means \u201canew,\u201d \u201cafresh,\u201d or \u201ca second time,\u201d often refers to an entirely new hearing \u201cin the same manner in which [the] matter was originally heard.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>at 483, 852; <em>see also State v. Knighten, </em>236 Or 634, 637, 390 P2d 166 (1964) (explaining that, under ORS 53.090, \u201c[u]pon appeal from the municipal court\u201d to a circuit court, \u201cthe cause is tried de novo as if originally commenced in such court\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). On the other hand, \u201cde novo\u201d review can also refer to a review of a matter on the record created in the prior tribunal, but without deference to that tribunal\u2019s factual determinations. <em>See Hannan v. Good Samaritan Hosp., 4 </em>Or App 178, 187, 471 P2d 831, <em>add\u2019d to on reh\u2019g, </em>4 Or App 199, 476 P2d 931 (1970) (when an appellate court conducts \u201cde novo review\u201d of a trial court\u2019s decision in equity, it reviews the decision based on the record created in the trial court, but gives the trial court\u2019s factual findings no weight, except those related to the credibility of witnesses). Thus, in the abstract, the legislature\u2019s use of those terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>could support either party\u2019s interpretation of ORS 419A.150. However, because ORS 419A.150(3) unambiguously grants litigants permission to present additional evidence, those terms indicate that the rehearing under ORS 419A.150 is a rehearing of the matter before the referee as if it had been originally commenced before the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Finally, DHS argues that there is tension between our interpretation of the statute and the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cright of review\u201d in ORS 419A.150(4). <em>See Black\u2019s </em>at 1483 (defining \u201creview\u201d as \u201c[t]o reexamine judicially. A reconsideration; second view or examination; revision; consideration for purposes of correction. Used especially of the examination of a cause by an appellate court.\u201d). However, DHS\u2019s redding, which would place the litigants\u2019 opportunity to present evidence at the juvenile court\u2019s discretion, cannot be squared with the plain text of ORS 419A.150(3). Furthermore, ORS 419A.150(4) refers to \u201cthe right of review <em>provided in this section\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, in context, the \u201cright of review provided in\u201d ORS 419A.150 is a rehearing that includes the opportunity to present additional evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We recognize the importance of the juvenile court\u2019s concern that nonappearing litigants might exploit the ORS 419A.150 rehearing procedure to receive a \u201csecond bite at the apple,\u201d as well as DHS\u2019s concerns about the \u201cstate\u2019s limited resources, the circuit courts\u2019 overcrowded dockets; and the need for prompt resolution of juvenile dependency proceedings.\u201d Those public policy arguments may inspire the legislature to change the text of ORS 419A.150. They do not persuade us that the existing text of the statute means something different than its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that, pursuant to ORS 419A.150, a party to a rehearing of a referee\u2019s decision may present additional evidence during that rehearing before the juvenile court. The juvenile court therefore erred in denying mother the opportunity to present additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-5\"> ORS 419A.150(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cWhen the referee conducts a hearing, the persons entitled to request rehearing as provided in subsection (7) of this section must be notified of the referee\u2019s findings, recommendations or order, together with a notice to the effect that a rehearing may be had before a judge if requested within 10 days. A rehearing before a judge of the juvenile court may be determined on the same evidence introduced before the referee if a stenographic transcript of the proceedings was kept, but, in any case, additional evidence may be presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> ORS 419B.815 sets out rules for the contents of a summons in a juvenile dependency case and establishes the consequences of failing to appear in response to a summons. In particular, ORS 419B.815(1) requires that the juvenile court serve a \u201csummons and a true copy of the petition\u201d on a parent before entering an order establishing jurisdiction. ORS 419B.815(2) then provides that the summons must require that the parent \u201c(a) <em>* </em>* * appear personally before the court at the time and place specified in the summons for a hearing on the allegations of the petition,\u201d \u201c(b) * * * appear personally before the court at the time and place specified in the summons to admit or deny the allegations of the petition,\u201d or \u201c(c) *** file a written answer to the petition within 30 days from the date on which the person is served with the summons.\u201d The purpose of the pretrial conference in this case was for mother to \u201cadmit or deny the allegations in the petition.\u201d Furthermore, ORS 419B.815(7) provides that, \u201c[i]f a person fails to appear for any hearing related to th[e] petition, * <em>* </em>* the court may establish jurisdiction without further notice [.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> We have also reviewed the legislative history provided by DHS, and it does not alter our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>DEHOOG, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In this case, DHS served mother with a juvenile dependency petition and a summons requiring her to personally appear in court on June 6, 2016, at 10:45 a.m., to admit or deny the allegations of the petition. As ORS 419B.815(4) requires, the summons told mother that \u201cappearing] personally\u201d did not mean having her attorney appear for her,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, if she failed to appear in person as required, \u201cthe court may establish jurisdiction without further notice either on the date specified in the summons\u201d or on some later date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Mother did not appear personally as required. Instead, at approximately 11:10 a.m., she left a voicemail message for her court-appointed attorney, explaining that her car had run out of gas approximately seven miles from the location of the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the juvenile referee called mother\u2019s case at approximately 11:30 a.m., mother\u2019s attorney conveyed that message to the referee. Counsel also returned mother\u2019s call, after which he told the referee that mother had confirmed her voicemail and was asking to appear by phone. The referee evidently denied that request for a telephonic appearance. Instead, after noting that he did not find mother to be particularly credible and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>did not consider the explanation for her absence adequate, the referee proceeded to hear DHS\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case and took jurisdiction on behalf of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In electing to proceed in that manner, the referee told mother\u2019s attorney that he would entertain a motion to set aside the order establishing jurisdiction if mother were later able to demonstrate that her absence was excusable. However, mother did not seek to have the referee set aside his order; instead, relying on ORS 419A.150, mother requested trial <em>de novo </em>before the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The majority now concludes that, at least to the extent that a juvenile court conducts a rehearing under that statute, the court must rehear the matter <em>de novo, </em>ORS 419A.150(8), which, in light of ORS 419A.150(3), means that the court must conduct a hearing in which the parties are permitted to present evidence in addition to any record that may have been created before the referee. Understood in that limited fashion, I agree with the majority opinion and, for the most part, its rationale. I write separately, however, to emphasize two considerations that the majority does not clearly address.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">First, in my view, the majority opinion should not be read as holding that the juvenile court could not have denied mother\u2019s request for a hearing altogether, as opposed to limiting the scope of the hearing that it held. As the majority explains, the juvenile court relied on two, ultimately faulty, rationales for limiting the rehearing to the record created before the referee. One rationale was that, in the juvenile court\u2019s view, it was unlikely that the legislature intended for a parent who missed a required hearing before a referee to get a \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d by having an opportunity to present new evidence at a rehearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>was that ORS 419A.150 gave the juvenile court discretion to decide the scope of a rehearing despite its provision for a trial <em>de </em>novo; in this case, the court concluded that mother\u2019s unjustified failure to appear warranted denying her the opportunity to present additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Notably, however, the juvenile court did not consider whether it could deny mother\u2019s request for a hearing altogether, nor does DHS advance that possibility on appeal. Thus, to the extent that the majority opinion suggests that the juvenile court could <em>not </em>deny mother\u2019s request for a rehearing in its entirety, mother\u2019s appeal does not present that issue for us to decide. As a result, I do not consider the majority opinion\u2019s discussion of ORS 419A.150(7)\u2014and that statute\u2019s failure to distinguish between parties who appear or do not appear before the referee\u2014as necessarily concluding that a party\u2019s unexcused failure to comply with a summons is never a default and, thus, a forfeiture of the right to a rehearing before the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Indeed, it is certainly not beyond dispute that mother\u2019s unexcused absence could be deemed such a forfeiture. Unlike, for example, ORS 36.400 to 36.425, the statutes governing mandatory arbitration, here, ORS 419A.150 and its statutory context suggest that a sanction <em>is </em>available when a party fails to participate in a mandatory proceeding. To illustrate that point, in <em>Monroe v. Harmon, </em>158 Or App 196, 198, 973 P2d 392, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 126 (1999), we held that, under ORS 36.425, a party who failed to participate in mandatory court-annexed arbitration retained an absolute right to have the matter heard <em>de novo </em>in the trial court. We acknowledged that, in at least some cases, if \u201cparties suffer [ed] no detriment for their failure to participate [in arbitration, they could] subvert the purposes of the arbitration system by simply not participating.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. Nonetheless, given the absence of any statute or rule allowing the court to penalize a party\u2019s failure to participate, we held that the trial court had no authority to dismiss that party\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 202-03; <em>see Treverton v. Arnold, </em>118 Or App 461, 465, 847 P2d 914 (1993) (reaching the same conclusion and acknowledging the legislature\u2019s apparent decision to allow parties to thwart \u201cmandatory\u201d arbitration provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In contrast, under the juvenile code, an unjustified failure to participate <em>does </em>have consequences. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. S. C. T., </em>281 Or App 246, 256-57, 380 P3d 1211 (2016), <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 851 (2017) (so stating after examination of text and legislative history of ORS 419B.815(7) and (8)). As noted, DHS was required to inform mother through its summons that \u201cif [she] fail[ed] to appear at the time and place specified in the summons * * * the court [could] establish jurisdiction without further notice either on the date specified in the summons or order or on a future date[.]\" ORS 419B.815(4)(a). And, in fact, ORS 419B.815(7) expressly allows a juvenile court to take just that action when a person fails to appear as required \u201cfor any hearing related to the petition.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, even though ORS 419A.150 does not expressly provide for sanctions in connection with the juvenile referee program, it cannot be said that the hearing that mother missed was not a \u201chearing related to the petition,\u201d ORS 419B.815(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">I recognize that it is one thing to authorize a court to hold a hearing without further notice, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to deny a hearing altogether. But the availability of arguments for and against forfeiture is what counsels against reading the majority opinion to have decided the issue. Those potential arguments also bring me, finally, to my second concern. That is, if, in fact, ORS 419A.150 can be read to afford a party an absolute right to trial <em>de novo, </em>regardless of whether that party disregards a properly issued and served summons to appear before a juvenile referee, then well-established referee programs such as that in Multnomah County could be ground to a halt.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In this case, arranging for and conducting the hearing that took place before the referee undoubtedly consumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>considerable quasi-judicial, attorney, and child-welfare resources. In other cases, one can readily envision a parent who appears as required to enter a denial, but who then fails, without explanation, to appear at a subsequent trial before a referee. In such a case, there would be at least the same\u2014 and likely much greater\u2014consumption of limited resources, as well as the very human toll of requiring family members, foster parents, court-appointed advocates, and possibly even the child or children at issue, to attend and participate in an ultimately fruitless exercise. While that duplication of effort may well be worthwhile if a parent attends the first hearing as is ostensibly required, it seems unlikely to me that the legislature would want to see such efforts expended on parties who are simply unwilling to participate in the referee process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Finally, I am cognizant of the critical interests at stake when the state intervenes in a family and contemplates removing a child from his or her parents\u2019 care, and do not intend to suggest that the protection of those interests should in any way be curtailed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 write only to caution against an interpretation of the law that could have widespread, unintended, and ultimately harmful effects on the state\u2019s efforts to protect families and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\"> In addition to other information, ORS 419B.815(4)(d) requires a summons to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c[a] statement that, if the person is represented by an attorney, the person must appear personally at any hearing where the person is required to appear!.] *** The statement must explain that \u2018appear personally\u2019 does not include appearance through the person\u2019s attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\"> ORS 419B.815(4)(a) requires the summons to contain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">\u201c[a] statement that the petition seeks to establish jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 and that, <em>if the person fails to appear at the time and place specified in the summons </em>or an order under ORS 419B.816 or, if the summons requires the filing of a written answer, fails to file the answer within the time provided, <em>the court may establish jurisdiction without further notice either on the date specified in the summons </em>or order or on a future date, and may take any other action that is authorized by law including, but not limited to, making the child a ward of the court and removing the child from the legal and physical custody of the parent or other person having legal or physical custody of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\"> Mother\u2019s voicemail message apparently indicated that she had run out of gas on or near the St. Johns Bridge.

That is because, in my view, <em>the very purpose of </em>ORS 419A.150\u2019s rehearing provisions is to give parties who are dissatisfied with a juvenile referee\u2019s decision \u201ca second bite at the apple\u201d by having the juvenile court hear the matter anew. Thus, the concern is not that resources will be wasted if parties are allowed two evidentiary hearings; the concern is that referee hearings will become meaningless (and incredibly wasteful) exercises if there is no consequence for a party who fails to appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\"> ORS 419B.815(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\"><em>\u201cIf a person fails to appear for any hearing related to the petition, </em>or fails to file a written answer, as directed by summons or court order under this section or ORS 419B.816, <em>the court may establish jurisdiction without further notice, </em>either on the date specified in the summons or order or on a future date, and may take any other action that is authorized by law including, but not limited to, making the child a ward of the court and removing the child from the legal and physical custody of the parent or other person having legal or physical custody of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> On a related note, I express no opinion on whether the justification that mother offered for not being personally present\u2014together with her availability to attend telephonically\u2014warranted some degree of accommodation either by the referee or the juvenile court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
