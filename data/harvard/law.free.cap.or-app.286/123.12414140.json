In the petition for post-conviction relief that gives rise to this appeal, petitioner alleged that his 800-month sentence for murder was unconstitutional because it was vertically disproportionate to his sentence for aggravated murder and because it was a de facto life sentence for a juvenile; he further alleged that his trial and previous post-conviction counsel were constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise those issues. The post-conviction court granted summary judgment to the state,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ruling that the asserted grounds for relief were untimely and successive and did not fall within the escape clauses of ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner now appeals the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">As we will explain, the issues raised by petitioner\u2019s appeal have been conclusively resolved by three other cases involving petitioners who were convicted of murder or aggravated murder as juveniles, including, most recently, a decision concerning post-conviction claims by petitioner\u2019s twin brother. <em>See White v. Premo, </em>285 Or App 570, 397 P3d 504 (2017) <em>(Lydell White); Cunio v. Premo, </em>284 Or App 698, 395 P3d 25 (2017); <em>Kinkel v. Persson, </em>276 Or App 427, 367 P3d 956, <em>rev allowed, </em>359 Or 525 (2016). In light of those cases, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Petitioner and his twin brother, Lydell White, were 15 when they murdered an elderly couple in 1993. Petitioner was waived into adult court and, on stipulated facts, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>convicted of one count of aggravated murder and one count of murder. He received an indeterminate life sentence on the aggravated murder conviction and an 800-month concurrent sentence on the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Petitioner filed a direct appeal in which he argued that the 800-month sentence was unlawful. His opening brief on appeal presented the following question: \u201cWas the sentence of 800 months imposed upon [petitioner] for his conviction for murder excessive, and did it constitute cruel and unusual punishment?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the \u201cSummary of Argument\u201d section of his brief, petitioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cThe sentence of 800 months imposed upon [petitioner] for murder was excessive and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. First, this sentence is disproportionate, in violation of Article I, Section 16 of the Oregon Constitution. Although permitted to do so by the statute existing at the time, the court violated [petitioner\u2019s] constitutional right to be free of excessive punishment by imposing 800 months, which is more than twice the presumptive sentence [petitioner] should have received. Second, because [petitioner] was a juvenile, the sentence of 800 months operates as a mandatory minimum sentence, in fact if not in name. This was impermissible, and [petitioner\u2019s] sentence should be vacated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Although that summary did not invoke the federal constitution, the argument in support of his sole assignment of error referred to the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201c*** The court apparently had [statutory] authority to impose 800 months. However, [petitioner] challenges the sentence of 800 months based on the proportionality clause of Article I, section 16 of the Oregon Constitution. In addition, the sentence was excessive, cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>After developing his proportionality argument, petitioner further contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that the crimes in this case were violent and offensive to society. However, [petitioner] was only 15 at the time the crimes were committed and 17 at the time of sentencing. The philosophy of the juvenile criminal code should be one of rehabilitation and not vindictive justice. The sentence of 800 months imposed upon [petitioner] was excessive, and for the reasons given, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The state, in its response, asserted that petitioner was \u201crely[ing] upon Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution, which requires that \u2018all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense\u2019 and prohibits the infliction of \u2018cruel and unusual punishments,\u2019 and upon the comparable Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d The state responded to the merits of the arguments, but its threshold contention was that the issues were not preserved because petitioner\u2019s arguments in the trial court had not cited Article I, section 16, the Eighth Amendment, or cases decided under those provisions, nor had petitioner\u2019s trial counsel \u201csa[id] or suggested] \u2018cruel and unusual punishment,\u2019 and nowhere [did trial] counsel suggest that the sentence is disproportionate to the offense.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) We affirmed without opinion, and the Supreme Court denied review. <em>State v. White, </em>139 Or App 136, 911 P2d 1287, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 691 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief in 1996, which the court denied. This court again affirmed without opinion, and the Supreme Court denied review. <em>White v. Thompson, </em>157 Or App 723, 972 P2d 1231 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 293 (1999). Thereafter, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in federal district court, arguing that his post-conviction counsel had rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by, among other things, failing to adequately object to the trial court\u2019s 800-month sentence on the ground that it exceeded state constitutional limitations on sentences for a juvenile. In 2001, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that petitioner \u201cfailed to fairly present\u201d that claim \u201cto the Oregon Court of Appeals or the Oregon Supreme Court when [petitioner] appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief.\u201d That is, the district court ruled that petitioner had procedurally defaulted on that claim by not raising it in state post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">In the years that followed, petitioner also litigated in state and federal court with regard to his life sentence for aggravated murder\u2014in particular, his parole eligibility on that sentence. At the time that petitioner and his twin brother were sentenced for their crimes, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision did not have rules in place to address parole for juvenile aggravated murders. <em>See generally Engweiler v. Board of Parole, </em>343 Or 536, 175 P3d 408 (2007) (discussing the complicated history of the law as it applied to juveniles who were convicted of aggravated murder). The board eventually adopted so-called \u201cjuvenile aggravated murderer (JAM) rules\u201d and, in 1999, established a prison term of \u201clife\u201d with a parole eligibility hearing after 40 years for petitioner and his brother. In 2010 and 2011, the federal district court and the Oregon Supreme Court invalidated those JAM rules in different respects. <em>See White v. Belleque, </em>Nos 02-0630-TC, 02-1453-TC, 2010 WL 5625800 (D Or Oct 21, 2010); <em>State ex rel Engweiler v. Felton, </em>350 Or 592, 260 P3d 448 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Then, in 2012, two events shaped the filing of the amended petition that is the subject of this appeal. One, the board held a hearing for petitioner and his brother in the wake of the federal and state decisions invalidating the JAM rules, and it set prison terms of 288 months on their aggravated murder convictions. And two, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 US 460, 132 S Ct 2455, 183 L Ed 2d 407 (2012), in which it held that the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. <em>Miller </em>had drawn on the reasoning in <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 US 48, 82, 130 S Ct 2011, 176 L Ed 2d 825 (2010), in which the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of a life sentence without parole on a juvenile offender for crimes other than homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Petitioner filed his amended petition after <em>Miller, </em>alleging various claims based on the lawfulness of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As relevant to his appeal, petitioner\u2019s amended petition alleged a claim that he was denied due process because his 800-month sentence was vertically disproportionate, in that it was longer than the 288-month prison term he would serve for aggravated murder, and was unconstitutional because it amounted to a de facto life sentence for a juvenile; a claim that trial counsel was inadequate by, among other things, failing to object to the 800-month sentence as vertically disproportionate; and claims that previous post-conviction counsel, including appellate post-conviction counsel, were inadequate in failing to raise and preserve claims regarding the proportionality of his 800-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In response, the state moved for summary judgment, arguing, as a threshold matter, that all the claims were untimely and successive under ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3), respectively. Petitioner acknowledged that his amended petition was successive because he had previously initiated post-conviction proceedings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but he argued that the claims were not barred because the grounds for relief in his amended petition could not reasonably have been asserted in a previous or timely petition, thereby bringing them within the escape clauses of those procedural bars. The post-conviction court agreed with the state and granted the motion for summary judgment, and petitioner appealed the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On appeal, petitioner advances four assignments of error, which are directed at the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on claims based on (1) the sentencing court\u2019s errors; (2) trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy; (3) post-conviction trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy; and (4) post-conviction appellate counsel\u2019s inadequacy. We reject each of those assignments for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A. <em>First Assignment of Error: Claim Based on Errors by Sentencing Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In his first assignment, petitioner argues that the court erred \u201cwhen it granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment on petitioner\u2019s claim for relief that is based on the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of an unconstitutional sentence.\u201d We understand the assignment to address two grounds on which the 800-month sentence for murder was unconstitutional: (1) that it was vertically disproportionate to the sentence on the more serious crime of aggravated murder and (2) that it was a de facto life sentence for a juvenile. Each raises distinct issues related to the successive nature of the grounds for relief in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">1. <em>Vertical proportionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Petitioner\u2019s vertical proportionality argument is summarized in his amended petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cThe trial court failed to insure that Petitioner was sentenced to a fair [and] impartial sentence that was proportionate to each count. The court\u2019s eight hundred (800) month enhanced sentence on the murder count is clearly disproportionate to the sentence that Petitioner will serve on the more serious charge of Aggravated Murder. The Oregon Board of Parole determined that Petitioner would serve a minimum of two hundred eighty eight (288) months for the Aggravated Murder count, or twenty-four (24) years. The eight hundred months sentence is almost sixty seven years and is clearly disproportionate to the crime with the greater severity. This sentence also constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">According to petitioner, that proportionality <em>issue\u2014i.e., </em>that he will serve an 800-month sentence for murder but a minimum of 288 months for the more serious crime\u2014requires a comparison that did not exist or was not reasonably available to petitioner until October 2012, when the board of parole established the length of time that petitioner would serve on his indeterminate life sentence for aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">We recently addressed the same issue in <em>Lydell White, </em>285 Or App 570, which involved petitioner\u2019s twin brother. As described earlier, petitioner and his brother, Lydell White, each received the same sentences for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>murder and aggravated murder they committed together. They also later received the same minimum prison term of 288 months for aggravated murder as a result of a parole board determination in October 2012. Thereafter, Lydell White, like petitioner, filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief and, on appeal, argued that he could not reasonably have raised a vertical proportionality challenge until after the parole board\u2019s 2012 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201c[P]etitioner also claims that the 800-month sentence for murder is vertically disproportionate to the sentence for aggravated murder, and asserts that he could not have raised that challenge before the parole board established a release date on his aggravated murder sentence in 2012, and, therefore, it falls within the escape clauses in ORS 138.510 and ORS 138.550.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><em>Lydell White, </em>285 Or App at 580. We rejected that argument, explaining that the parole board\u2019s decision had not changed Lydell White\u2019s sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c* * * As petitioner notes, his vertical proportionality challenge \u2018involves a comparison between the sentence for murder and the sentence for aggravated murder.\u2019 However, his sentence on each conviction was set forth in the 1995 judgment in this case and those sentences have not changed in the years since they were imposed. Thus, a challenge based on the premise that the 800-month sentence for murder is vertically disproportionate to an indeterminate life sentence for aggravated murder could have been raised at that time. <em>See Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 706 n 7. Furthermore, to the extent that his challenge is based on the board\u2019s decision, as the state correctly notes, petitioner cannot challenge the board\u2019s decision in post-conviction relief. <em>See id.; see also </em>ORS 138.530(1); ORS 138.540(2). Accordingly, we reject petitioner\u2019s assertion that his vertical disproportionality challenge to his sentences could not have been raised earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 580-81 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">That reasoning applies with equal force in this case and forecloses petitioner\u2019s vertical proportionality argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">2. <em>De facto life sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Under Kis first assignment of error, petitioner also contends that his sentence violates Article I, section 16, and the Eighth Amendment, because it is a de facto life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sentence that was imposed on him as a juvenile. The principles underlying that argument, petitioner argues, derive from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Miller, </em>which were \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d; thus, \u201c [p] etitioner could not have been expected to challenge his sentence based on the principle articulated in <em>Miller </em>during sentencing, on direct appeal, or in his prior post-conviction proceedings.\u201d Our decision in <em>Kinkel </em>forecloses that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">As described above, petitioner raised constitutional challenges to the length of his sentence on direct appeal based on the fact that he was a juvenile at the time of the crimes. Citing Article I, section 16, petitioner argued that, \u201cbecause [he] was a juvenile, the sentence of 800 months operates as a mandatory minimum sentence, in fact if not in name.\u201d And, after citing both Article I, section 16, and the Eighth Amendment, petitioner argued that he \u201cwas only 16 at the time the crimes were committed and 17 at the time of sentencing. The philosophy of the juvenile criminal code should be one of rehabilitation and not vindictive justice. The sentence of 800 months imposed upon [petitioner] was excessive, and for the reasons given, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In <em>Kinkel, </em>we explained that \u201cthe fact that, in an earlier appeal or petition for post-conviction relief, a petitioner unsuccessfully raised a ground for relief that would have been successful under later case law does not bring a claim for relief within the escape clauses of ORS 138.550(2) and (3).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 276 Or App at 442. \u201cOn the contrary, the fact that a petitioner earlier raised the same ground for relief demonstrates that that ground for relief <em>could </em>reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>been raised on appeal or in a first petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). That is, ORS 138.550(2) and (3) prevent petitioners from bringing successive petitions for post-conviction relief on grounds that could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal or in an earlier post-conviction petition, even if the grounds would not have been successful at the time. <em>Id. </em>And, \u201cwhere a petitioner did, in fact, earlier raise a ground\u2014even unsuccessfully\u2014ORS 138.550 (2) and (3) bar that ground for relief from being raised in a later post-conviction petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444; <em>see also id. </em>at 443 (\u201cORS 138.550(2) and (3) must be read together and, so read, express the legislature\u2019s intent that when a petitioner has appealed and files a petition for post-conviction relief, the petitioner must raise all grounds that could reasonably be asserted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Here, as in <em>Kinkel, </em>petitioner\u2019s earlier unsuccessful challenges to his 800-month sentence on the ground that it was disproportionate and cruel and unusual punishment to impose on a juvenile, bar that ground from being raised in a later post-conviction petition under ORS <em>138.550.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> Accord Lydell White, </em>285 Or App at 579-80 (reaching the same conclusion where the petitioner\u2019s earlier post-conviction petition had asserted that \u201cthe 1995 judgment violated \u2018the prohibition against cruel and usual punishment secured by the Eighth Amendment [to] the United States Constitution,\u2019 \u201d and \u201casserted that the \u2018life\u2019 and \u2018836 month\u2019 sentences imposed on him, \u2018a remanded juvenile,\u2019 violated the \u2018Eighth Amendment protection against Cruel and Unusual punishment\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">B. <em>Second Assignment of Error: Inadequate Assistance of Trial Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that \u201c[t]he post-conviction court erred when it granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment on petitioner\u2019s claim for relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\u201d However, petitioner combines his argument under that assignment with his argument concerning his third and fourth assignments of error, which address previous <em>post-conviction </em>counsel. Petitioner does not explain why, apart from post-conviction counsels\u2019 alleged errors, he could not reasonably have brought his claims in an earlier petition, nor does he develop any independent argument as to why the post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims regarding trial counsel\u2019s inadequacies. In the absence of a distinct and developed argument on those issues, we understand his second assignment to depend on our resolution of his third and fourth assignments, and we do not address it separately. <em>See Lydell White, </em>285 Or App at 574 n 4 (similarly concluding that, where the petitioner did not specifically discuss claims of trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy, or articulate any reason that those claims could not have been raised in his original post-conviction petition, he had not challenged the post-conviction court\u2019s dismissal of those claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">C. <em>Third and Fourth Assignments: Inadequacy of Post-Conviction Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In his final two assignments, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims that his previous post-conviction counsel, both at the trial level and on appeal, provided inadequate assistance in failing to raise various issues regarding the constitutionality of his sentence and trial counsel\u2019s performance. He argues that, based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>566 US 1, 132 S Ct 1309, 182 L Ed 2d 272 (2012), he is permitted to bring a successive petition based on grounds that should have been raised by previous post-conviction counsel\u2014that is, that his post-conviction counsels\u2019 alleged ineffectiveness provides a basis for him to invoke the escape clauses. Our recent case law forecloses that contention. <em>See Lydell White, </em>285 Or App at 581-82 (rejecting an identical argument based on <em>Martinez </em>and holding that the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s contention that he can satisfy the escape clauses based on his claim that his former post-conviction counsel was inadequate is unavailing\u201d (citing <em>Cunningham v.

However, as we explained in <em>Kinkel, Cunio, </em>and then <em>Lydell White, </em>we do not interpret <em>Montgomery </em>to preclude operation of ORS 138.610(3) or ORS 138.550(2) and (3). <em>Lydell White, </em>285 Or App at 579 n 9 (citing <em>Cunio, </em>284 Or App at 706 n 6, and <em>Kinkel, </em>276 Or App at 438 n 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\"> To the extent that petitioner is arguing that inadequacy of post-conviction counsel supplies an independent basis for relief, our case law forecloses that contention as well. <em>See Hayward v.
