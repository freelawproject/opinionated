Appellant asserts that the court erred by denying her motion to dismiss the case after she was detained on a physician\u2019s hold for more than five judicial days without a hearing. <em>See </em>ORS 426.232 (a licensed practitioner may cause a person to be detained or hospitalized, but \u201cunder no circumstances may the person be held for longer than five judicial days\u201d). The state concedes that the court erred. <em>See State v. A. E. B., </em>196 Or App 634, 635, 106 P3d 647 (2004) (circuit court erred by denying the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss civil commitment case, where commitment hearing was not held within five judicial days of when the appellant was detained on a physician\u2019s hold).
