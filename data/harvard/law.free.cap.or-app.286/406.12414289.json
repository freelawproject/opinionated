The award apportioned claimant\u2019s benefits under OAR 436-035-0013 (2013)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so as to exclude compensation for his preexisting arthritic condition. In claimant\u2019s view, under ORS 656.268(1), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Schleiss v. SAIF, </em>354 Or 637, 317 P3d 244 (2013), apportionment to exclude an award for impairment due to a preexisting condition is permitted only when the preexisting condition has been accepted as a part of a combined condition claim and then denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> SAIF argues that the board correctly concluded that apportionment was appropriate under ORS 656.214 and the administrative rules for rating disability in OAR chapter 436, division 35. We review the board\u2019s order for legal error, ORS 656.298(7) (providing that review of board order shall be as provided in ORS 183.482); ORS 183.482(8)(a) (providing for review for legal error), conclude that the board did not err, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Claimant suffered a compensable injury to his right knee that SAIF accepted as a strain and traumatic injury to the articular surface of the knee joint. During a surgical debridement, Dr. Hamilton observed preexisting arthritic changes. Hamilton opined that the work injury had combined with the preexisting arthritis to cause a combined condition. It is undisputed that claimant\u2019s arthritis is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>preexisting condition as defined in ORS 656.005(24); claimant did not seek to have the arthritis accepted as a part of a combined condition, and SAIF did not accept a combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">In the rating of claimant\u2019s disability, Hamilton attributed 40 percent of claimant\u2019s impairment to the accepted conditions and 60 percent to claimant\u2019s preexisting arthritic condition. SAIF closed the claim with an award of four percent \u201cwhole person impairment,\u201d apportioned as outlined by Hamilton. An administrative law judge and the board determined that apportionment was appropriate under OAR 436-035-0013 and upheld the award. Claimant seeks judicial review, contending that, under the pertinent statutes and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schleiss, </em>the apportionment of impairment allowed by the rule was not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">We begin our analysis with the text and context of the relevant statutes and rules. An injured worker who suffers permanent disability as a result of a compensable injury or occupational disease is entitled to benefits for impairment. ORS 656.214(2)(a) provides that, \u201c[w]hen permanent partial disability results from a compensable injury or occupational disease, benefits shall be awarded [when the worker has been released to regular work] *** for impairment only.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(c)(A) defines \u201cpermanent partial disability\u201d to mean \u201c[permanent impairment resulting from the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease.\u201d ORS 656.214(l)(a) defines \u201cimpairment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201c\u2018Impairment\u2019 means the loss of use or function of a body part or system due to the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease determined in accordance with the standards provided in ORS 656.726, expressed as a percentage of the whole person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Thus, ORS 656.214 authorizes permanent partial disability benefits only for impairment that \u201cresults from\u201d or that is \u201cdue to the compensable industrial injury.\u201d \u201cCompensable injury\u201d is defined by ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) to mean \u201can accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death *** subject to the following limitation[]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services has interpreted and applied ORS 656.214(1) through administrative rules that preclude an award of permanent partial disability for the portion of an impairment that is not due to or resulting from the compensable industrial injury but, instead, is due to or resulting from some other cause. Those rules were adopted by the director under his general authority in ORS 656.726(4)(a) to \u201c[m]ake and declare all rules * * * which are reasonably required in the performance of the director\u2019s duties,\u201d and, specifically, to implement ORS 656.726(4)(f), which delegates to the director the authority to determine the meaning of \u201cimpairment *** due to the compensable industrial injury.\u201d ORS 656.726(4)(f) delegates to the director the authority to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201c[p]rovide standards for the evaluation of disabilities. The following provisions apply to the standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201c(A) The criterion for evaluation of a permanent impairment under ORS 656.214 is the loss of use or function of a body part or system due to the compensable industrial injury or occupational disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">OAR chapter 436, division 35, sets out the director\u2019s standards for evaluation of a permanent impairment under ORS 656.214 \u201cdue to the compensable industrial injury.\u201d At the relevant time, OAR 436-035-0007 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201c(1) Except for OAR 436-035-0014, a worker is entitled to a value under these rules only for those findings of impairment that are permanent and were caused by the accepted compensable condition and direct medical sequela. Unrelated or noncompensable impairment finding\u00bb are excluded and are not valued under these rules. Permanent total disability is determined under OAR 436-030-0055.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c(2) Permanent disability is rated on the permanent loss of use or function of a body part, area, or system due to a compensable, consequential, or combined condition and any direct medical sequela, and may be modified by the factors of age, education, and adaptability. Except for impairment determined under ORS 656.726(4)(f), the losses, as defined and used in these standards, are the sole criteria for the rating of permanent disability under these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">OAR 436-035-0013(2), in turn, required the physician to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">\u201cdescribe [] the current total findings of impairment, then describe!] those findings that are due to the compensable injury. In cases where a physician determines a specific finding *** is partially attributable to the accepted condition, only the portion of those findings that is due to the compensable condition receives a value. When apportioning impairment findings, the physician must identify any applicable superimposed or unrelated condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">OAR 436-035-0014 provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201c(1) Where a worker has a pre-existing condition, the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201c(a) For purposes of these rules only, a prior Oregon workers\u2019 compensation claim is not considered a pre-existing condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201c(b) Under ORS 656.225, disability caused solely by a worker\u2019s pre-existing condition is rated completely if work conditions or events were the major contributing cause of a pathological worsening of the pre-existing physical condition or an actual worsening of the pre-existing mental disorder. Disability is rated without apportioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201c(c) Where a worker\u2019s compensable condition combines with a pre-existing condition, under ORS 656.005(7), the current disability resulting from the total accepted combined condition is rated under these rules as long as the compensable condition remains the major contributing cause of the accepted combined condition (e.g., a major contributing cause denial has not been issued under ORS 656.262(7)(b)). Disability is rated without apportioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Claimant\u2019s conditions were rated consistently with OAR chapter 436, division 35, to include the disability loss \u201cdue to the compensable industrial injury\u201d but to exclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>loss caused by claimant\u2019s preexisting conditions that were not otherwise compensable as part of a combined condition. Claimant argues that the rules requiring that result exceed the director\u2019s authority, because they are inconsistent with ORS 656.268(1), regulating the closure of claims, ORS 656.266(2)(a), allocating the burden of proving that a work injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the disability of a combined condition, and ORS 656.268(7)(b), pertaining to denial of a combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">As noted, ORS 656.268(1) describes the circumstances under which a claim involving disability may be closed. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cOne purpose of this chapter is to restore the injured worker as soon as possible and as near as possible to a condition of self support and maintenance as an able-bodied worker. The insurer or self-insured employer shall close the worker\u2019s claim, as prescribed by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and determine the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability, provided the worker is not enrolled and actively engaged in training according to rules adopted by the director pursuant to ORS 656.340 and 656.726, when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201c(a) The worker has become medically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201c(b) The accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined or consequential condition or conditions pursuant to ORS 656.005(7). When the claim is closed because the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined or consequential condition or conditions, and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability, the likely permanent disability that would have been due to the current accepted condition shall be estimated!)]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Thus, ORS 656.268(l)(b) explicitly provides for apportionment of the disability due to a combined condition under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) that has been accepted and then denied because the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of that combined condition. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>apportionment, of course, is consistent with the director\u2019s rules that preclude apportionment for a preexisting condition \u201cas long as the compensable condition remains the major contributing cause of the accepted combined condition.\u201d OAR 436-035-0014(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Nonetheless, claimant argues that, in allowing appor-. tionment between impairment caused by a preexisting condition and that caused by a work injury when the compen-sability of a combined condition has been denied under ORS 656.268(l)(b), the legislature intended to state the <em>only </em>occasion or process in which the disability due to a preexisting condition that has combined with a work injury can be excluded from the calculation of benefits. By negative inference, claimant reasons that, when the medical evidence at the time of closure shows the existence of a combined condition, and the combined condition has not been denied, the worker is entitled to a disability award for the entire combined condition\u2014even when, as here, there has been no claim for a combined condition and when, as here, the medical evidence shows that the compensable injury is not the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Importantly, claimant does not contend that the apportionment made by the board was inconsistent with the apportionment that would have been required by ORS 656.268(l)(b) had claimant filed a combined condition claim that was then denied. That is, claimant does not dispute the evidence that, at the time of the award, his compensable condition combined with a preexisting condition but that the compensable condition was not the major contributing cause of the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Instead, claimant contends that because ORS 656.268(1) requires closure when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined condition, the claim closure process is the only occasion in which a combined condition can be established and denied and the disability can be apportioned to only the work injury. Thus, claimant asserts that the portions of OAR 436-035-0007, OAR 436-035-0013(2), and OAR 436-035-0014, which require compensation for the impairment that results from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>a combined condition only when the compensable condition remains the major contributing cause of the combined condition, are inconsistent with the text and context of ORS 656.268.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In assessing whether those rules exceeded the statutory authority of the director, we assess whether the substance of the rule, \u201cthough within the scope of the agency\u2019s or official\u2019s general authority, departed from a legal standard expressed or implied in the particular law being administered, or contravened some other applicable statute.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 565, 573, 687 P2d 785 (1984); see <em>also Garrison v. Dept. of Rev., </em>345 Or 544, 549, 200 P3d 126 (2008) (\u201c[A] rule created within a statutory scheme cannot amend, alter, enlarge upon, or limit statutory wording so that it has the effect of undermining the legislative intent.\u201d); <em>Miller v. Employment Division, </em>290 Or 285, 288, 620 P2d 1377 (1980) (framing the rule validity issue as whether the rule \u201cconflicts with the clear, unambiguous words of [the statute]\u201d). Thus, where the issue is whether \u201can otherwise valid rule * * * conflicts with clearly stated statutory policy,\u201d a court must \u201cexamine the applicable statutory wording in its context to determine the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Managed Healthcare Northwest v. DCBS, </em>338 Or 92, 95-96, 106 P3d 624 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We conclude that the rules are not inconsistent with ORS 656.268(l)(b) for a number of reasons. ORS 656.268(1) delineates policies for claim closure in a manner consistent with its stated intention \u201cto restore the injured worker as soon as possible and as near as possible to a condition of self support and maintenance as an able-bodied worker.\u201d Accordingly, the statute sets out the circumstances under which an insurer \u201cshall close the worker\u2019s claim\u201d so as to restore the injured worker \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Those circumstances are when \u201cthere is sufficient information to determine permanent disability\u201d and either the worker has become medically stationary or the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of an accepted combined condition. On the face of it, ORS 656.268(1) provides for claim closure policies and does not provide directives on disability rating standards otherwise within the authority of the director to set.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Second, any inference that, in stating a particular rule of apportionment in ORS 656.268(l)(b) for the closure process, the legislature intended to preclude other apportionment rules applicable to the award of benefits is not apt. Claimant reasons that, in detailing the circumstances in which apportionment exists for a denied combined condition claim, the legislature intended to state in ORS 656.268(l)(b) the <em>only </em>circumstance in which a combined condition impairment can be apportioned. Claimant enlists the <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>maxim of statutory construction of statutory text (\u201cthe expression of one is the exclusion of others\u201d). That rule is of limited value, at least when used as a rule of deduction and not mere inference. In <em>Colby v. Gunson, </em>224 Or App 666, 671-72, 199 P3d 350 (2008), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>349 Or 1, 238 P3d 374 (2010), we cautioned about reliance on the <em>expressio unius </em>maxim to determine legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">\u201cWe qualified the value of that maxim in determining statutory intent in <em>State ex rel City of Powers v. Coos County Airport, </em>201 Or App 222, 234, 119 P3d 225, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 197 (2005):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201c\u2018[B]oth we and the Supreme Court have repeatedly warned the bench and bar that <em>expressio unius </em>is not a rule of law but is instead a guide to understanding legislative intent. * * * The maxim \u201cis to be applied with caution and merely as an auxiliary rule to determine the legislative intention.\u201d <em>Cabell et al. v. City of [Cottage] Grove et al., </em>170 Or 256, 281, 130 P2d 1013 (1942); <em>see also </em>Frank E. Horack Jr., 2 <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 4917, 418 (3d ed 1943) (warning that the maxim \u201crequires great caution in its application, and in all cases is applicable only under certain conditions\u201d).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThus, the <em>expressio unius </em>guide to legislative intent corroborates, rather than supplies, meaning to a statute. <em>See generally </em>Reed Dickerson, <em>The Interpretation and Application of Statutes, </em>23 (1975) (citing <em>expressio unius </em>as an example of\u2018maxims [that] masquerade as rules of interpretation while doing nothing more than describing results reached by other means\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">(Brackets in <em>Colby); see also MEC Oregon Racing, Inc. v. Oregon Racing Comm., </em>233 Or App 9, 20, 225 P3d 61 (2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>rev den, </em>348 Or 280 (2010) (a rule of permissible negative inference \u201cgives way to other, more direct, and contrary evidence of legislative intent\u201d); <em>State ex rel City of Powers, </em>201 Or App at 234 (the maxim is to be applied with caution).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The context of ORS 656.268(l)(b) rebuts any inference that the statute states the only occasion where disability related to a preexisting condition can be apportioned when evaluating impairment. ORS 656.214(2) requires a determination of \u201cimpairment,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>what loss of use is due to the compensable injury, and provides for an award of benefits for \u201cpermanent partial disability\u201d \u201cresulting from the compensable injury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 656.214 implicitly requires apportionment in the context of any claim when the impairment is not \u201cdue to\u201d or the result of the compensable injury under the applicable standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The preexisting regime of statutes and rules before the adoption of ORS 656.268(l)(b) provide context for its meaning that is consistent with our conclusion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ofodrinwa, </em>353 Or 507, 512, 300 P3d 154 (2013) (\u201cThe context for interpreting a statute\u2019s text includes *** the statutory framework within which the law was enacted.\u201d). That regime supports an interpretation of ORS 656.268(l)(b) as only a closure rule for accepted combined condition claims and not a rule that precludes apportionment in other contexts in which it is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Before 1990, the equivalent subsection of ORS 656.214 limited a worker\u2019s recovery of benefits for unscheduled permanent disability to loss of earning capacity \u201cdue to the industrial injury.\u201d ORS 656.214(5) (1989). In <em>Barrett v. D &amp; H Drywall, </em>300 Or 553, 715 P2d 90 (1986), the Supreme Court interpreted that version of the statute to require apportionment of impairment not established to be due to the compen-sable injury. <em>See id. </em>at 555-56 (holding that an award of compensation is required when the compensable injury produces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>symptoms of the preexisting condition and those symptoms produce loss of earning capacity). Necessarily, the claimant would have the burden to prove, by the major contributing cause standard of proof now applicable, ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), that the compensable injury produced symptoms of the preexisting condition. An apportionment of impairment for conditions that are not due to the compensable injury is a part of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme for the rating of disability'that predates the enactment of the provisions relating to combined conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The legislature made provision for the filing and acceptance of combined condition claims in 1990, Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 3 (Spec Sess), enacting ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">At that time, the legislature did not make separate provision for the processing or denial of combined condition claims that had been accepted. In <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. Brown, </em>127 Or App 253, 257, 873 P2d 326, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 572 (1994), we held that a combined condition claim, once accepted, remained an accepted part of the claim to be processed through closure of the underlying compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In 1995, the legislature enacted ORS 656.262(6)(c), Or Laws 1995, ch 332, \u00a7 28, to explicitly authorize the denial of a combined condition claim that had been previously accepted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cAn insurer\u2019s or self-insured employer\u2019s acceptance of a combined or consequential condition under ORS 656.005(7), whether voluntary or as a result of a judgment or order, shall not preclude the insurer or self-insured employer from later denying the combined or consequential condition if the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause of the combined or consequential condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The legislature enacted ORS 656.262(7)(b) at the same time. Or Laws 1995, ch 332, \u00a7 28. ORS 656.262(7)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201cOnce a worker\u2019s claim has been accepted, the insurer or self-insured employer must issue a written denial to the worker when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined condition before the claim may be closed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We explained in <em>SAIF v. Belden, </em>155 Or App 568, 575, 964 P2d 300 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 330 (1999), that ORS 656.262(7)(b) is a notice statute. It requires that an insurer that has taken advantage of the provision in ORS 656.262(6)(c) authorizing the denial of an accepted combined condition claim must issue a written notice of denial before it may close the claim pursuant to ORS 656.268. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Croman Corp. v. Serrano, </em>163 Or App 136, 140, 986 P2d 1253 (1999), we held that the preclosure denial authorized by ORS 656.262(6)(c) and (7)(b) applies only to an <em>accepted </em>combined condition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">ORS 656.268(l)(b) was enacted in 1995 as a part of the same bill that included the amendments to ORS 656.262 relating to the processing of accepted combined condition claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reading those provisions <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude that the amendments to ORS 656.262 and ORS 656.268 that were adopted in 1995 and subsequently amended in 1999, pertain only to the processing of accepted combined condition claims and not to the processing and rating of combined conditions that have not been accepted\u2014the construction of ORS 656.268(l)(b) advanced by claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Claimant contends that our construction of ORS 656.268(l)(b) would improperly shift the burden to the <em>worker </em>to prove, at the time the disability is rated, that the accepted work injury is the major contributing cause of the combined condition in order to receive disability benefits for that condition. According to claimant, that construction contravenes the burden of proof assigned to an <em>employer </em>by ORS 656.266(2)(a) \u201cto establish the otherwise compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition [,] \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The two statutes, however, are not <em>in pari materia. </em>Neither provides relevant context to the meaning of the other. ORS 656.266 pertains to the burden of going forward to prove compensability during claim processing set out in ORS 656.262. It is the claimant\u2019s initial burden to prove the com-pensability of a claim. ORS 656.266 (1). As we said in <em>Keystone RV Co.-Thor Industries, Inc. v. Erickson, </em>277 Or App 631, 633-34, 373 P3d 1122 (2016), under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), the claimant bears the initial burden to establish that an \u201cotherwise compensable condition\u201d has combined with a preexisting condition \u201cto cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment.\u201d Once that combined condition is shown, ORS 656.266(2)(a) shifts the burden of going forward to the employer to establish that the combined condition is not compensable under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). ORS 656.268(1) sets out the policies concerning the timing of claim closure. The burden of proof during an earlier stage in the claims process has little relevance to the closure policies set out in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Moreover, ORS 656.266(2)(a) was adopted in 2001. Or Laws 2001, ch 865, \u00a7 2. It provides no window into the legislature\u2019s intention in the adoption of ORS 656.268(l)(b) two years earlier. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 177 n 16, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (\u201cOrdinarily, only statutes enacted simultaneously with or before a statute at issue are pertinent context for interpreting that statute.\u201d); <em>Holcomb v. Sunderland, </em>321 Or 99, 105, 894 P2d 457 (1995) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>proper inquiry focuses on what the legislature intended at the time of enactment and discounts later events.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Thus, consistent with its text and current and past statutory and regulatory contexts, we interpret ORS 656.268 (l)(b) to state a rule of closure for an accepted, and then denied, combined condition claim but not to preclude the apportionment of impairment due to the compensable industrial injury from the loss caused by a preexisting condition or other causes in the benefits award process.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Claimant contends that that construction of ORS 656.268(l)(b) is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schleiss. </em>In <em>Schleiss, </em>the court held that OAR 436-035-0013 could not be applied to the extent that it required an apportionment of impairment due to noncognizable preexisting conditions in the award of permanent partial disability. The court held that that part of the rule conflicted with substantive policies on the apportionment of disability in ORS chapter 656. The court reserved and did not decide the issue presented in this case\u2014whether apportionment applies only to accepted and then denied combined condition claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The claim in <em>Schleiss </em>did not involve a combined condition. The worker had suffered a compensable back strain. In awarding benefits for permanent partial disability, the board approved a rating of the claimant\u2019s impairment under OAR 436-035-0013 (2009)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that excluded values for impairment due to smoking-related premature aging and preexisting mild disc degeneration. The court considered whether that application of the administrative rule was consistent with ORS 656.214. The claimant contended that apportionment was limited to claims described in ORS 656.268(l)(b), involving previously accepted and then denied combined conditions, and, separately, that the apportionment was inconsistent with substantive standards in the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Schleiss, </em>354 Or at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The court eschewed a determination as to whether apportionment is limited to accepted and then denied combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>condition claims and, instead, concluded that the challenged apportionment was erroneous because the preexisting condition was not substantively subject to apportionment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-3\">\u201cWe conclude that <em>it is unnecessary to resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement concerning the burdens of asserting and proving a combined condition claim, </em>because there is no evidence in the record that either of the contributing causes on which the medical arbiter and the board relied is a legally cognizable preexisting condition that would authorize the apportionment of claimant\u2019s impairment in a combined condition claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 651 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court then looked to the statutes relating to combined conditions in discerning the legislature\u2019s intentions with respect to apportionment of impairment under ORS 656.214. <em>Schleiss, </em>354 Or at 648. The court observed that ORS 656.268(1)(b) implicitly provides for apportionment of causes contributing to a worker\u2019s impairment; when an accepted combined condition claim is denied, the impairment \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury is limited to the percentage of the total impairment to which the injury contributed. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that, under ORS 656.268(l)(b), in the context of a \u201ctrue\u201d combined condition claim, contributing causes that are neither encompassed within the com-pensable injury nor <em>legally cognizable </em>as preexisting conditions (such as the aging effects of long-term smoking or a mild degenerative condition) may not be omitted from the rating of impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 653. The court reasoned that, if such conditions are not subject to apportionment in the rating of a \u201ctrue\u201d combined condition claim, then it would be anomalous to conclude that the legislature intended for them to be apportioned under ORS 656.214. Thus, the court explained, only preexisting conditions that would be \u201clegally cognizable\u201d in the context of a combined condition claim (because they fall within the definition of a \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d in ORS 656.005(24)) may be excluded from the calculus of impairment under ORS 656.214. \u201cIt defies reason to believe,\u201d the court explained, that, \u201cfor purposes of apportionment of a worker\u2019s impairment, the legislature would afford such preferential treatment to a preexisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>contributing cause that would not be legally cognizable in a combined condition claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. \u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the court said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cif a preexisting contributing cause would not qualify to reduce the impairment that is \u2018due to\u2019 a compensable combined condition under ORS 656.268(l)(b), it makes no sense to conclude that such a cause would qualify to reduce the impairment that is \u2018due to\u2019 a claimant\u2019s compensable injury under ORS 656.214.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>Id. </em>The court said that there was no reason to conclude that the phrase \u201cdue to\u201d in ORS 656.214 had a meaning different from its meaning in ORS 656.268, and concluded that, \u201cto qualify for the apportionment of impairment, a cause must be legally cognizable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. Thus, the court concluded, apportionment upon the rating of impairment under ORS 656.214 is limited to \u201clegally cognizable preexisting conditions,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>preexisting conditions as defined in ORS 656.005(24). Impairment due to preexisting conditions that would not be legally cognizable in a combined condition claim may not be omitted from the rating. Because, in <em>Schleiss, </em>there were no legally cognizable contributing causes of impairment apart from the compensable injury, the court concluded that the claimant\u2019s impairment was not subject to apportionment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As we understand <em>Schleiss, </em>contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, the opinion does not limit apportionment to combined condition claims. In fact, that issue is expressly not decided. We necessarily reject claimant\u2019s contention that <em>Schleiss </em>requires the conclusion that ORS 656.268(l)(b) describes the only circumstance under which apportionment is permissible. It is undisputed that claimant\u2019s arthritis is a legally cognizable preexisting condition within the meaning of ORS 656.005(24). Thus, under the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schleiss, </em>it is subject to apportionment, unless it is part of an accepted combined condition claim that remains compensable at the time of closure under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). We therefore conclude that the board did not err in upholding the apportioned award \u00f3f benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> Unless otherwise noted, throughout the opinion, references to the administrative rules are to the 2013 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> ORS 656.268(1) provides that an insurer or self-insured employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cshall close the worker\u2019s claim <em>* * </em>* and determine the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability <em>* * * </em>when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201c(a) The worker has become medically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\u201c(b) The accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined or consequential condition or conditions pursuant to ORS 656.005(7).

As the court framed the question in Schleiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cClaimant asserts that, for purposes of an award under ORS 656.214, \u2018due to\u2019 means \u2018caused in material part by,\u2019 so that, if the compensable injury materially contributed to the total impairment, all the impairment is \u2018due to\u2019 the compensable injury. SAIF, on the other hand, asserts that the phrase refers to the percentage of the worker\u2019s total impairment that was caused by the compensable injury, so that the percentage of the total impairment \u2018due to\u2019 any other contributing cause must be excluded from an award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>354 Or at 643. The court in <em>Schleiss </em>observed that, \u201c[o]n the surface of things, either of those proposed meanings is plausible\u201d and, therefore, proceeded to \u201ca detailed examination of the pertinent statutory framework\u201d to determine the meaning of \u201cdue to.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In examining \u201cthe pertinent statutory framework,\u201d the court in <em>Schleiss </em>gave particular consideration to the statutory changes that began in 1990, including the later adoption of what became ORS 656.268 (l)(b), because\u2014-prior to the enactment of those provisions\u2014\u201cno statute addressed the role in [permanent partial disability] award determinations of impairment that is attributable to a preexisting condition that has combined with a compensable injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649. ORS 656.268 describes when an employer shall close a claim and specifies that, at closure, the insurer must issue a notice that specifies \u201c[t]he amount of any further compensation, including permanent disability compensation to be awarded.\u201d <em>See also </em>ORS 656.268(1), (5)(c). Currently, ORS 656.268(1) specifies that the insurer shall close a claim when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\u201c(a) The worker has become medically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201c(b) The accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined or consequential condition or conditions pursuant to ORS 656.005(7).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">If the claim is closed under the circumstances of paragraph (b), that paragraph further provides that, if \u201cthere is sufficient information to determine permanent disability, the likely permanent disability that would have been due to the current accepted condition shall be estimated [.] \u201d The provision for closure under the circumstances of paragraph (b) was added after the legislature modified the definition of \u201ccompensable injury\u201d to exclude combined conditions caused in major part by the preexisting condition. Or Laws 1995, ch 332, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\"><em>Schleiss </em>describes the effect of those statutory changes in a way that should inform our analysis in the present case. As <em>Schleiss </em>concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c[T]he workers\u2019 compensation statutes now provide specific standards for determining how and when conditions that \u2018combine\u2019 workplace injuries with preexisting conditions are compensable and how and when impairment caused by such conditions can be apportioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">354 Or at 649. Based on that context, the court concluded that, \u201cif a preexisting contributing cause would not qualify to reduce the impairment that is \u2018due to\u2019 a compensable combined condition under ORS 656.268(l)(b), it makes no sense to conclude that such a cause would qualify to reduce the impairment that is \u2018due to\u2019 a claimant\u2019s compensable injury under ORS 656.214.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">That conclusion describes a proposition that is logically distinct from the proposition that the majority attributes to <em>Schleiss. </em>According to the majority, \u201cunder the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schleiss,\u201d </em>claimant\u2019s permanent disability award is subject to apportionment to eliminate the contribution from his \u201clegally cognizable preexisting condition\u201d of arthritis, \u201cunless it is part of an accepted combined condition claim that remains compensable at the time of closure under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).\u201d 286 Or App at 422. Phrased as a conditional proposition, the rule that the majority attributes to <em>Schleiss </em>for claims that are closed without the denial of a combined or consequential condition is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">If a preexisting contributing cause would qualify as a \u201clegally cognizable preexisting condition\u201d (as defined in ORS 656.005(24)), then it qualifies to reduce the impairment that is \u201cdue to\u201d a claimant\u2019s compensable injury\u2014\u25a0 unless it remains part of an accepted combined condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">However, the <em>Schleiss </em>court\u2019s actual conclusion, expressed as a conditional proposition, is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\u201c[I]f a preexisting contributing cause would not qualify\u201d as a \u201clegally cognizable preexisting condition,\u201d then it does not \u201cqualify to reduce the impairment that is \u2018due to\u2019 a claimant\u2019s compensable injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 654. In logic terminology, the proposition that represents Schleiss\u2019s actual holding is the inverse of the proposition that the majority attributes to <em>Schleiss, </em>which means that the two propositions are not logically equivalent. (For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>example, it may be true that, \u201cif you see the sun, then it is day time.\u201d But it is not necessarily true that, \u201cif you don\u2019t see the sun, then it is not day time.\u201d) The short answer is that the holding of <em>Schleiss </em>is not dispositive. It is, however, significant in two key ways that the majority fails to recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">First, <em>Schleiss </em>construes the rule of apportionment stated in ORS 656.268(l)(b) as implying a legislative intention to limit, at least somewhat, the director\u2019s ability to apportion impairment when the employer would be unable to obtain apportionment through closure under ORS 656.268(l)(b). <em>Id. </em>at 654. That holding is difficult to reconcile with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the legislature\u2019s authorization of apportionment under the circumstances described in ORS 656.268(l)(b) permits no inference that \u201cthe legislature intended to preclude other apportionment rules [.] \u201d 286 Or App at 415 (asserting that \u201cany\u201d such inference \u201cis not apt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Second, <em>Schleiss </em>demonstrates that the Supreme Court understands \u201cimpairment\u201d that is \u201cdue to\u201d a claimant\u2019s compensable injury to include impairment that is partially attributable to an \u201cunrelated condition.\u201d In <em>Schleiss, </em>the claimant had impairment of 13.8 percent due to \u201closs of range of range of motion\u201d in his back that the medical arbiter rated as 67 percent \u201csecondary to\u201d the claimant\u2019s preexisting degenerative joint disease and history of smoking. 354 Or at 640. Relying on OAR 436-035-0013, the department awarded the claimant compensation for only the 33 percent of his impairment that it viewed as \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury. <em>Id. </em>In holding \u201cthat all of [the] claimant\u2019s impairment is \u2018due to\u2019 the compensable injury for purposes of making a [permanent partial disability] award under ORS 656.214,\u201d the court necessarily rejected SAIF\u2019s argument\u2014and the understanding of the department\u2014that impairment \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury means only \u201cthe percentage of the worker\u2019s total impairment that was caused by the com-pensable injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 655. Thus, <em>Schleiss </em>strongly suggests that whether permanent impairment is \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury must be determined by considering the new impairment as a whole, unless the claim is closed under ORS 656.286(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>B. <em>ORS 656.268(l)(b) is a limited modification of the rule that impairment \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury means the entire new impairment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Further, although I agree with the majority that \u201c[t]he preexisting regime of statutes and rules before the adoption of ORS 656.268(l)(b) provide context for its meaning,\u201d 286 Or App at 416, I do not agree that the context supports the majority. Rather, I understand the prior \u201cregime\u201d to have provided no basis for apportioning permanent impairment that is caused when the work injury combines with a preexisting condition to produce new disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As the majority explains, the legislature created a special status for \u201ccombined conditions\u201d in 1990 when it altered the definition of a \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d 286 Or App at 416-17 (citing Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 3 (Spec Sess)); <em>see also Schleiss, </em>354 Or at 644. Before that time, the administrative rules that specified the standards for disability rating of impairment simply used the \u201cdue to an injury\u201d language of ORS 656.214 and contained no reference to apportioning impairment. <em>See </em>OAR chapter 436, division 35 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">More significantly, case law prior to 1990 specified that, when the work injury combined with a preexisting condition to cause new disability, the disability due to that combining was calculated without discounting for the contribution that was attributable to the preexisting condition. <em>See Barrett v. D &amp; H Drywall, </em>300 Or 325, 709 P2d 1083 (1985) <em>(Barrett II), adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>300 Or 553, 715 P2d 90 (1986) <em>(Barrett III). </em>In <em>Barrett II, </em>\u201cthe worker fell off a ladder, landing on his feet and hitting his back on a brick wall.\u201d 300 Or at 330. Those \u201cinjuries were superimposed upon\u201d the worker\u2019s underlying disease of osteoarthritis. <em>Id. </em>When the case was before us, we held that, in determining the worker\u2019s award for permanent partial disability, no consideration could be given to the preexisting condition, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201c[a]n award of permanent partial disability is to be rated on the basis of \u2018the permanent loss of earning capacity due to the compensable injury.\u2019 ORS 656.214(5).

D &amp; H Drywall, </em>73 Or App 184, 186, 698 P2d 498 <em>(Barrett I), rev\u2019d, </em>300 Or 325, 709 P2d 1083 (1985), <em>adh'd to on recons, </em>300 Or 553, 715 P2d 90 (1986) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The Supreme Court rejected that construction of impairment \u201cdue to the compensable injury.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201cThe oft-expressed maxim still applies: An employer takes the worker as he finds him. Whether the worker suffers greater permanent partial disability (measured by loss of earning capacity) because of a preexisting condition is irrelevant in deciding the amount of loss of earning capacity caused by a new injury superimposed on a preexisting condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\"><em>Barrett II, </em>300 Or at 328 (footnote omitted). On reconsideration, the Supreme Court clarified that its decision \u201cdoes not require any award of compensation for that disease or for any disability that may have existed by reason thereof before the present compensable injury.\u201d <em>Barrett III, </em>300 Or at 555. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the Supreme Court in <em>Barrett </em>did not hold that there could be any apportionment for disability related to new symptoms or that claimant would be required to prove disability according to a \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d standard. 286 Or App at 416-17. Rather, the court\u2019s opinion on reconsideration refused to disavow its original decision and re-emphasized that any contribution from a preexisting condition to disability is irrelevant if the work accident caused a preexisting \u201cdisease to produce symptoms where none existed immediately prior to the accident.\u201d <em>Barrett III, </em>300 Or at 555. If the symptoms were new, and if \u201cthose symptoms produced loss of earning capacity, then that loss of earning capacity is \u2018due to\u2019 the compensable injury, and the statute requires an award of compensation therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In <em>Nomeland v. City of Portland, </em>106 Or App 77, 81, 806 P2d 175 (1991), we reiterated the distinction that <em>Barrett </em>drew, between cases in which the injury combined with a \u201cpreviously asymptomatic condition\u201d to cause disabling symptoms, and cases in which some of the worker\u2019s \u201cdisability or loss of use or function\u201d existed before the employment. Because it was possible in <em>Nomeland </em>\u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>segregate [the amount of the claimant\u2019s hearing impairment] that preexisted his employment from that caused by the employment,\u201d the employer was only responsible for the work-related portion of the disability. <em>Id. </em>at 81. However, we emphasized <em>Barrett II's </em>\u201cmaxim that the employer takes the worker as it finds him\u201d and explained that, when a work injury combines with a \u201cpredisposition\u201d to suffer disability to cause \u201ca loss of use or function, the loss of use or function is due to the injury and is compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Although the legislature subsequently modified that rule by creating a specific process for an employer to limit its responsibility when the employer believes that a preexisting condition has combined with the compensable injury, the legislature did not amended the language of ORS 656.214 to more broadly modify the rule described by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Barrett. </em>Given that context, I see no basis for departing from the rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Barrett II </em>and reiterated by us in <em>Nomeland, </em>except in those cases in which the employer qualifies to reduce its liability under the \u201cspecific standards [that the legislature created] for determining how and when conditions that \u2018combine\u2019 workplace injuries with preexisting conditions are compensable and how and when impairment caused by such conditions can be apportioned.\u201d <em>See Schleiss, </em>354 Or at 643, 649, 654. In all other cases, when an injury causes new symptoms of a preexisting condition, the entire permanent impairment is \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II. THE PROCESS MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Finally, as the majority emphasizes, claimant does not specifically contend that his disability award would have been different if employer had followed the procedure to close the claim pursuant to ORS 656.268(l)(b). Although that might be a reason for declining to reach claimant\u2019s challenge, the majority has chosen to address the validity of the director\u2019s rules, which requires us to look beyond the circumstances of this particular case. In holding that the director\u2019s apportionment rule is valid, the majority\u2019s ruling reaches cases in which the rule will produce a result that is substantively different than what the legislature intended. In the wake of <em>Schleiss, </em>the board has construed OAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>436-035-0013 to avoid the result that <em>Schleiss </em>expressly prohibited: If the underlying condition, with which a claimant\u2019s compensable injury has combined, does not qualify as a \u201clegally cognizable preexisting condition,\u201d then the employer remains responsible for the full impairment caused by the combined condition. 354 Or at 654. But identifying a \u201clegally cognizable preexisting condition\u201d is only the starting point under the \u201ccombined condition\u201d process that the legislature created.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The legislature\u2019s process also requires the employer to issue a written denial that \u201cthe accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined condition.\u201d ORS 656.262 (7)(b). The significance of that written denial is that the claimant has the opportunity to request a hearing, at which the employer will bear the burden of proving not only that the work injury has combined with a qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d but also that the \u201cotherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition.\u201d ORS 656.266(2)(a). If the employer fails to meet that burden, the denial will not be upheld, and apportionment under ORS 656.268(l)(b) is unavailable. When an employer has not satisfied the prerequisites for closing a claim under ORS 656.268(1)(b), I would conclude that apportionment of any combined-cause disability is limited by the rule described by the Supreme Court in <em>Barrett, </em>at least until that court says otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In contrast to the legislatively approved apportionment process, OAR 436-035-0013 allows an employer to limit its responsibility for impairment resulting from a worker\u2019s combined condition without proving that a qualifying preexisting condition is the major cause of claimant\u2019s impairment. I would reverse the board\u2019s order and declare OAR 436-035-0013 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Ortega, Egan, Lagesen, Garrett, and Shorr, JJ., join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> Unless otherwise noted, throughout this opinion referernces to the administrative rules are to the 2013 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
