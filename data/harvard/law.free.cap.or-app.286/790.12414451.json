For that conduct, he was charged with seven counts of unlawfully being in a location where children regularly congregate, ORS 163.476 (2013), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 820, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was convicted after a bench trial. On appeal, he argues that the court should have entered a judgment of acquittal on each count because the evidence was insufficient to show that the location used by defendant\u2014the YMCA shower facility\u2014 qualified as a \u201cpremises where persons under 18 years of age regularly congregate\u201d as defined in ORS 163.476(2)(a). For the reasons explained below, we conclude that, a reasonable trier of fact could find that, the relevant \u201cpremises\u201d was the YMCA building as a whole, not a particular area within it. Further, under a proper construction of the statute, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant violated the statute even though his presence at the YMCA was mostly during times when children\u2019s programs were not scheduled. Accordingly, the trial court did not err, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">When a defendant\u2019s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence depends upon the meaning of the statute defining the offense, we review the trial court\u2019s construction of the statute for legal error. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>270 Or App 206, 210, 346 P3d 1285 (2015) (so stating with respect to the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal); <em>see also State v. Morgan, </em>361 Or 47, 51-52, 388 P3d 1085 (2017) (reasoning that, in a bench trial, a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence made in closing argument is considered \u201cthe functional equivalent of a motion for judgment of acquittal\u201d on review). Then, based on the proper construction of the statute, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational fact-finder could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Hunt, </em>270 Or App at 209. We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision designated defendant as a \u201cpredatory sex offender\u201d under <em>former </em>ORS 181.585 (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 181.838 (2013), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 820, \u00a7 36. After his release on parole from prison, defendant was supervised by Tillamook County Community Corrections. During their first meeting, defendant\u2019s parole supervisor specifically advised him that, due to a condition of his parole, he was not allowed to enter the Tillamook County YMCA because minors \u201ccongregate\u201d there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Two weeks after being released, defendant was without housing. An employee of the Salvation Army informed defendant that there were showers available for use at the YMCA during certain hours of the day. The employee referred defendant to a nonprofit organization that provided YMCA shower vouchers to people in need. Defendant was offered a voucher, but he declined, explaining that he could not use the facilities at the YMCA because he could not be around minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Nevertheless, during the months in which defendant was homeless, he went to the YMCA seven times to use the shower facilities. On six of the occasions, he arrived between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m., and on one occasion, he arrived at 7:09 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">During the relevant time period, the entire YMCA facility opened at 5:30 a.m. The YMCA offered daycare starting at 7:00 a.m. and preschool programs starting at 8:00 a.m. The YMCA also offered various classes and recreational activities for children. The evidence at trial was that scheduled programming for children occurred at the YMCA \u201call during the day\u201d and was \u201calways going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">All visitors to the YMCA, including children, are required to check in at the front desk before entering the facility. The childcare room, which is used for both preschool and daycare, is located along a hallway from which a person can also access the showers. When non-YMCA members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>pay to use the YMCA\u2019s showers, they are able to physically access other areas in the building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In his closing argument at trial, defendant argued that, in visiting the YMCA shower facility, he did not access a \u201cpremises where persons under 18 regularly congregate\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.476 because (1) the childcare room is separate from the areas that defendant visited, and (2) except for on one occasion, defendant used the showers at times when no children\u2019s programs were scheduled. The state countered that the relevant location for purposes of the statute was the entire YMCA facility, and, according to the state, the YMCA was covered by the statute regardless of the specific time when defendant was present there.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and convicted him of all seven counts, reasoning that the YMCA was \u201cclearly\u201d a place \u201cwhere people under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs,\u201d and \u201cif you wanted to go somewhere to find kids, the [YMCA] is * * * the number one place to go find kids.\u201d On appeal, defendant reprises his argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Whether the record contains sufficient evidence that the locations entered by defendant qualify as \u201cpremises where persons under 18 years of age regularly congregate\u201d presents, in part, a question of statutory construction. We construe statutes with the goal of determining the meaning that the legislature most likely intended. <em>Chase and Chase, </em>354 Or 776, 780, 323 P3d 266 (2014). We do so by considering the statutory text in context, any pertinent legislative history, and, when necessary, applicable maxims of statutory construction. <em>Id.; State v. Shockey, </em>285 Or App 718, 721, 398 P3d 444 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">At the time defendant used the YMCA shower facilities, ORS 163.476 (2013) provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of unlawfully being in a location where children regularly congregate if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00ab\u215c\u215c\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\">\u201c[(a)] (B) Has been *** designated a predatory sex offender under [former] ORS 181.838 [(2011)], and does not have written approval from the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision or the person\u2019s supervisory authority or supervising officer to be in or upon the specific premises; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u2021\u215c\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201c(b) Knowingly enters or remains in or upon premises where persons under 18 years of age regularly congregate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201c(2) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">\u201c(a) \u2018Premises where persons under 18 years of age regularly congregate\u2019 means schools, child care centers, playgrounds, other places intended for use primarily by persons under 18 years of age and places where persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Defendant argues that the locations in the YMCA that he entered are not covered by the statute because they are not \u201cplaces where persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To that end, defendant first argues that each \u201cseparate unit\u201d within a multi-purpose structure should be considered a separate \u201cplace\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.476(2)(a). In support, defendant relies on <em>State v. Macon, </em>249 Or App 260, 278 P3d 29, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 342 (2012), in which we concluded that the record contained sufficient evidence that a storage room in a toy store was a \u201cseparate unit\u201d for purposes of the second-degree burglary statute, ORS 164.215, because the room was \u201cself-contained,\u201d as evidenced, in part, by the fact that it had \u201cseparate physical access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">We are not convinced that our construction of the second-degree burglary statute in <em>Macon </em>is particularly relevant to our construction of ORS 163.476, given the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>different subject matter of the latter statute. However, even if we were to accept defendant\u2019s premise that every \u201cself-contained\u201d area of the YMCA should be considered a separate \u201cplace\u201d for purposes of applying that statute, the evidence is sufficient to permit a finding that the YMCA\u2019s childcare room is <em>not </em>\u201cself-contained\u201d within the meaning of <em>Macon. </em>Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the state, the YMCA\u2019s shower area and the childcare room share a common point of access\u2014the front desk. A factfinder could reasonably conclude that, after a person passes the front desk, there are no other controls to prevent a visitor from freely accessing all of the areas in the building. Thus, although the childcare room is apparently separated from the adjoining hallway by a doorway, there is evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that that room is not \u201cself-contained\u201d as that term was used in <em>Macon </em>(where the unit had a separate point of access altogether), despite the childcare room\u2019s distinct function. In short, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that a factfinder would be compelled to regard the YMCA\u2019s childcare room as a \u201cself-contained\u201d unit instead of determining that the public areas of the YMCA are the same \u201cplace\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.476.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We next address defendant\u2019s argument that a location qualifies as a place \u201cwhere persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs\u201d only at such times as that place <em>is being used </em>for such programs or when such programs are scheduled. The state disagrees, arguing that the text of the statute focuses on particular types of places, and that we should not construe the statute to include a temporal requirement when no such requirement is present in the statute\u2019s plain text.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">To discern the intended meaning of the phrase \u201cplaces where persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs,\u201d we first consider the dictionary definitions of the individual terms. <em>State v. McNally, </em>361 Or 314, 321, 392 P3d 721 (2017) (\u201c [T] o understand the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of a phrase, the court frequently consults dictionary definitions of the terms, on the assumption that, if the legislature did not give the term a specialized definition, the dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>definition reflects the meaning that the legislature would naturally have intended.\u201d (Brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The term \u201cplace\u201d has both broad and narrow meanings, depending on the context in which the term is used, but the word is generally used to refer to a physical location. <em>State v. Gonzalez-Valenzuela, </em>358 Or 451, 465, 365 P3d 116 (2015); <em>see Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1727 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cplace\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201cphysical environment\u201d or \u201ca building or locality used for a special purpose\u201d). The term \u201cregularly\u201d is defined in relevant part to mean \u201cin a regular, orderly, * * * or methodical way.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1913. Th\u00e9 term \u201cregular,\u201d as relevant here, means \u201csteady or uniform in course, practice, or occurrence\u201d and \u201cnot subject to unexplained or irrational variation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The term \u201cscheduled\u201d is an adjectival form of the verb \u201cto schedule,\u201d which means \u201cto appoint, assign, or designate to do or receive something at a fixed time in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2028. The term \u201cwhere,\u201d when used as a conjunction to refer to a \u201cplace,\u201d is defined to mean \u201cat or in which place.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2602. Taken together, those definitions indicate that the legislature sought to prohibit predatory sex offenders from being present in locations in which children\u2019s programming takes place at predetermined times, on a repeated and predictable basis. There is no textual indication of an intent to regard a place where children regularly congregate as such a place <em>only </em>within the hours that children\u2019s programming happens to be scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The other locations listed in ORS 163.476(2)(a) further indicate that the legislature was concerned with a fixed characteristic of a particular place, rather than its use at any specific hour of the day. <em>See Goodwin v. Kingsmen Plastering, Inc., </em>359 Or 694, 702, 375 P3d 463 (2016) (\u201cIt is a familiar rule that the meaning of words in a statute may be clarified or confirmed by reference to other words in the same sentence or provision.\u201d). The other listed locations include \u201cschools, child care centers, playgrounds,\u201d and \u201cother places intended for use primarily by persons under 18 years of age.\u201d ORS 163.476(2)(a). In ordinary usage, it is unlikely that the legislature would have considered a school to be a \u201cschool\u201d only during the hours in which classes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>are scheduled. Similarly, it is unlikely that the legislature would have defined a restricted location in terms of its primary <em>intended </em>use if the legislature had been concerned only with its <em>actual </em>use during specific periods during the day. Thus, viewing the phrase \u201cplaces where persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs\u201d in a manner consistent with its surrounding context, we conclude that a prohibited place under ORS 163.476 does not cease being such a place during routine periods of inactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In order for defendant to prevail on appeal, we would be required to adopt a construction of the statute under which the YMCA did not qualify a \u201cplace\u201d where children \u201cgather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs\u201d\u2014even though, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the state, children\u2019s programs are scheduled throughout every day of the week<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2014simply because on six of defendant\u2019s visits, he was present in the facility shortly before the children\u2019s programming was scheduled to begin. For the foregoing reasons, we reject that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\"> The 2015 amendments to ORS 163.476 did not alter the definition at issue in this case, and, therefore, we cite the current version of the statute throughout the remainder of this opinion unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\"> One condition of defendant\u2019s parole was that he not be present more than once, without prior written approval, \u201cat a place where persons under 18 years of age regularly congregate.\u201d The parole condition is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\"> A YMCA employee testified at trial that, when nonmembers paid to use the showers, she would \u201chop [e] that they\u2019re honest and they shower and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\"> Because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the YMCA is a place \u201cwhere persons under 18 years of age gather for regularly scheduled educational and recreational programs,\u201d we do not address whether the YMCA facility qualifies as any of the other locations listed in ORS 163.476(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\"> Defendant remonstrates that, under our interpretation of the statute, a predatory sex offender would be prohibited from attending, for example, counseling sessions in a church basement on a weekday evening if the building also holds children\u2019s classes on Sunday mornings. Put more generally, defendant\u2019s argument is that the phrase \u201cregularly scheduled educational and recreational programs\u201d implies some minimum level of frequency or significance. In a future case with different facts, we may be required to consider whether children\u2019s activities are too infrequent or <em>de minimis </em>as a part of a location\u2019s overall function to constitute \u201cregularly scheduled educational and recreational programs.\u201d This case does not require us to confront that question, because under any reasonable standard for what constitutes \u201cregularly scheduled,\u201d the YMCA facility here qualifies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
