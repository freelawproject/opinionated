In that order, LUBA remanded the City of Oregon City\u2019s decision to approve comprehensive plan map and zoning map amendments for Historic Properties, LLC property. LUBA\u2019s remand was based on its determination that the city\u2019s decision did not comply with Statewide Planning Goal 5. As relevant here, LUBA\u2019s order also sustained the city\u2019s determination that Historic Properties\u2019 application complied with Goal 2.3 (Corridors) of the Oregon City Comprehensive Plan (OCCP). On review, petitioner challenges LUBA\u2019s latter conclusion, asserting that LUBA erroneously deferred to the city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3 and that that aspect of LUBA\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence to support it. Historic Properties, which filed a cross-petition for review, challenges LUBA\u2019s determination that the city\u2019s decision failed to comply with Goal 5. We conclude that the city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3 is plausible and that petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence arguments do not provide a basis for this court to conclude that LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d under ORS 197.850(9)(a). Except to the extent discussed below, we reject petitioner\u2019s other challenges and Historic Properties\u2019 challenge without further written discussion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I. LEGAL CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">An amendment to the Oregon City zoning map or comprehensive plan map may be initiated by an application to the planning division. Oregon City Municipal Code (OCMC) 17.68.010. To approve such an application, the city must find that the requested amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the OCCP. OCMC 17.68.020 (for zone changes); <em>see also Sunnyside Neighborhood v. Clackamas Co. Comm., </em>280 Or 3, 18, 569 P2d 1063 (1977) (holding that \u201cwhen a comprehensive plan map is amended to change the permissible use of a single tract of land, without any change in the plan\u2019s underlying policies, the proponent of the change has the burden of proving that the change in the plan map is consistent with the goals and policies expressed in the plan as a whole\u201d). One of those goals, Goal 2.3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(Corridors), provides that the city should \u201c[flocus transit-oriented, higher intensity, mixed-use development along selected transit corridors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The issues in this case pertain to whether LUBA correctly affirmed the city\u2019s determination that the proposed amendments met the requirements of Goal 2.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The city approved Historic Properties\u2019 application to amend the comprehensive plan map and zoning map designations for its property, which is located at the intersection of Highway 213 and Beavercreek Road in Oregon City. As explained in LUBA\u2019s order, that decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cchange [d] the existing Low Density Residential and Medium Density Residential comprehensive plan map designations for [the property] to the Mixed Use Corridor (MUC) comprehensive plan map designation. The * * * decision also change [d] the existing R-3.5 Dwelling District, and R-6 and R-10 Single-Family Dwelling District zoning designations to the MUC-2 Mixed Use Corridor District zoning designation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">That is, the city approved a change of the property\u2019s comprehensive plan map designation to MUC, which, as the OCCP explains, provides for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">\u201chigher density mixed uses that are supportive of transit and conducive to pedestrian traffic. Urban density residential and commercial goods and services are typical uses. Zones in the Comprehensive Plan Land-Use Map district are intended to be compatible with Metro\u2019s Corridor design type.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">And, the city approved a change of the property\u2019s zoning designation to MUC-2, which is described by OCMC 17.29.010:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">\u201cThe Mixed-Use Corridor (MUC) District is designed to apply along selected sections of transportation corridors such as Molalla Avenue, 7th Street and Beavercreek Road, and along Warner-Milne Road. Land uses are characterized by high-volume establishments such as retail, service, office, multi-family residential, lodging, recreation and meeting facilities, or a similar use as defined by the community development director. A mix of high-density residential, office, and small-scale retail uses are encouraged in this District. Moderate density (MUC-1) and high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>density (MUC-2) options are available within the MUC zoning district. The area along 7th Street is an example of. MUC-1, and the area along Warner-Milne Road is an example of MUC-2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The city based the approval, in part, on its determination that the proposed amendments, \u201cwith conditions of approval,\u201d complied \u201cwith the requirements of the [OCMC] \u201d and with \u201cthe applicable Goal and Policies of the Oregon City Comprehensive Plan.\u201d With respect to Goal 2.3, the city determined that the application \u201c[c]omplie[d] as [p]roposed.\u201d Specifically, the city found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201cThe subject site abuts a state Highway (OR 213), an arterial (Beavercreek Road), and is located near a transit stop. The proposed zoning designation is designed to be transit-oriented and focused near transportation corridors such as Beavercreek Road as identified in OCMC 17.29.010. This goal is met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Petitioner and other individuals opposed to the amendments, who are not parties on review, appealed the city\u2019s decision to LUBA on a number of grounds. As relevant here, petitioner asserted in his first assignment of error that \u201cthe city\u2019s finding that the subject property is <em>near </em>a transit stop and transit corridor is insufficient to establish that it is <em>along </em>a transit corridor and transportation corridor, as required by OCCP Goal 2.3 and OCMC 17.29.010.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Petitioner argued that the city \u201cmisconstrued\u201d Goal 2.3 and made its decision \u201cbased on insufficient findings and without substantial evidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">LUBA rejected this challenge, reasoning that the term \u201calong\u201d is \u201csufficiently subjective that we cannot say [the city\u2019s] implicit interpretation that the subject property is sufficiently <em>near </em>the transit corridor to the northwest to satisfy OCCP Goal 2.3 is \u2018implausible.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, LUBA denied petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Petitioner thereafter sought review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">This court reviews whether LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure[.]\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">On review, the parties do not dispute that Goal 2.3 provides an approval standard for the proposed amendments. As mentioned above, Goal 2.3 provides that the city should \u201c[fjocus transit-oriented, higher intensity, mixed-use development along selected transit corridors.\u201d The MUC comprehensive plan map designation and the MUC zoning district allow for such development and, consequently, are to be focused \u201calong selected transit corridors.\u201d The parties dispute whether LUBA\u2019s order affirming the city\u2019s determination that the proposed amendments complied with that requirement was \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d In particular, the issues on review, as framed by petitioner, are (1) whether LUBA erroneously deferred to the city\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201calong selected transit corridors,\u201d and (2) whether the portion of LUBA\u2019s order affirming the city\u2019s Goal 2.3 determination lacks substantial evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">A. <em>Whether the City\u2019s Interpretation of Goal 2.3 was Entitled to Deference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Petitioner asserts that LUBA erroneously deferred to the city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3. He argues that the city was not entitled to deference because the city\u2019s interpretation is not plausible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>LUBA\u2019s acceptance of the city\u2019s interpretation of its own comprehensive plan is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d if it does not comply with ORS 197.829, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201c(1) The Land Use Board of Appeals shall affirm a local government\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan and land use regulations, unless the board determines that the local government\u2019s interpretation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201c(a) Is inconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On review, this court \u201cmust determine <em>for itself </em>whether the interpretation underpinning [the city\u2019s] decision \u2018is inconsistent with the express language\u2019 of the provision *** at issue.\u201d <em>Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>349 Or 247, 262, 243 P3d 776 (2010) (emphasis in original). As we summarized in <em>Friends of the Hood River Waterfront v. City of Hood River, </em>263 Or App 80, 88-89, 326 P3d 1229 (2014):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201cWhether the city\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan is inconsistent with the plan *** \u2018depends on whether the interpretation is plausible, given the interpretive principles that ordinarily apply to the construction of ordinances under the rules of <em>PGE [v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993),] as modified by <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).\u2019 <em>Setniker v. Polk County, </em>244 Or App 618, 633-34, 260 P3d 800, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original); <em>see also Mark Latham Excavation, Inc. v. Deschutes County, </em>250 Or App 543, 552-53, 281 P3d 644 (2012) (same).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In <em>Siporen, </em>the Supreme Court explained that, when \u201cthe interpretation is directed at a single term or statement,\u201d our task on review is to determine \u201cwhether the interpretation plausibly accounts for the text and context of the term or statement.\u201d 349 Or at 262. We focus our analysis of the plausibility of the city\u2019s interpretation: \u201c[T]he existence of a stronger or more logical interpretation\u201d does not render a \u201cweaker or less logical interpretation \u2018implausible.\u2019\u201d <em>Siegert v. Crook County, </em>246 Or App 500, 509, 266 P3d 170 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Petitioner asserts that the city\u2019s interpretation \u201cthat the subject property is \u2018near a transit stop\u2019 is inconsistent with the express language \u2018along selected transit corridors\u2019 in Goal 2.3.\u201d In this case, whether \u201cnear a transit stop\u201d is consistent with the express language \u201calong selected transit corridors\u201d is not dispositive because that is not the \u201cinterpretation\u201d that the city made. In rejecting petitioner\u2019s contention, LUBA\u2019s order describes the city\u2019s Goal 2.3 findings as an implicit interpretation that a site \u201cnear\u201d a transit corridor is within the scope of the phrase \u201calong selected transit corridors\u201d in Goal 2.3. However, the city also explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-3\">\u201cThe subject site abuts a state Highway (OR 213), an arterial (Beavercreek Road), and is located near a transit stop. The proposed zoning designation is designed to be transit-oriented and focused near transportation corridors such as Beavercreek Road as identified in OCMC 17.29.010. This goal is met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Based on the explicit text of the city\u2019s decision, we understand the city to have concluded that changing the property\u2019s comprehensive plan map and zoning map designations to MUC and MUC-2, respectively, satisfied the Goal 2.3 requirement that the transit-oriented, high intensity, mixed use development allowed by those designations be focused \u201calong selected transit corridors,\u201d not only because the property is \u201cnear a transit stop\u201d but also because the property \u201cabuts\u201d a state highway and an arterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In other words, we understand the city\u2019s interpretation to be that the scope of the phrase \u201calong a transit corridor\u201d is broad enough to include sites that abut, that is, are bordered by,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a state highway and an arterial and that are near a transit stop. <em>See Green v. Douglas County, </em>245 Or App 430, 438, 263 P3d 355 (2011) (a reviewable interpretation must \u201cidentify and explain in writing the decisionmaker\u2019s understanding of the meaning of the local legislation\u201d (quoting <em>Alliance for Responsible Land Use v. Deschutes County, </em>149 Or App 259, 266, 942 P2d 836 (1997), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>327 Or 555 (1998))); <em>Siegert, </em>246 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>App at 509 (explaining that one form of interpretation seeks to define the scope of an unclear term). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that that interpretation plausibly accounts for the text and context of Goal 2.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">As noted above, Goal 2.3 states, \u201cFocus transit-oriented, higher intensity, mixed-use development <em>along </em>selected transit corridors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The natural reading of the goal\u2019s text indicates that the city should concentrate such development in an area that tracks both the location and direction of \u201ctransit corridors.\u201d As used in Goal 2.3, \u201calong\u201d is a preposition that can mean \u201cover the length of (a surface);\u201d \u201cin the course of (as time or distance);\u201d and \u201cin a line parallel with the length or direction of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>60 (unabridged ed 2002). The adjective \u201cparallel\u201d can mean \u201cextending in the same direction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1637. These definitions imply both proximity between the locations of the \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201ctransit corridors\u201d and an alignment of the orientation of the \u201cdevelopment,\u201d and \u201ctransit corridors.\u201d It is plausible that a property bordered by a state highway and an arterial and located near a transit stop is within an area that tracks both the location and direction of a \u201ctransit corridor\u201d in Oregon City.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Moreover, we conclude that the city\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the express language of Goal 2.3, considered in the context of the OCCP, specifically, the OCCP\u2019s references to \u201ctransit corridors\u201d and \u201cCorridors.\u201d The OCCP does not expressly define the term \u201ctransit corridors,\u201d but explains that \u201c[t]ransit corridors are designated with the *** Mixed Use Corridors (MUC) district to encourage somewhat more intensive and mixed-use development than exists, creating more efficient land-use and travel patterns\u201d and that \u201c[t]he MUC designation is intended to implement Metro\u2019s vision of the Corridor design type.\u201d Similarly, the OCCP explains that the \u201c[z]ones in the [MUC] district are intended to be compatible with Metro\u2019s Corridor design type.\u201d These provisions indicate that the locations of \u201ctransit corridors\u201d in the city are intended to be consistent with \u201cMetro\u2019s Corridor design type.\u201d The OCCP glossary defines \u201cdesign type\u201d as \u201c[conceptual areas in the <em>Metro 2040 Growth Concept </em>text and map.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in original.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That definition also explains that some \u201cCorridors\u201d are \u201ccontinuous, narrow bands of high-intensity development <em>along arterial roads\u201d </em>while others are \u201ca series of smaller centers at major intersections or other locations <em>along an arterial\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Similarly, OCCP Policy 12.1.2 provides, \u201cContinue to develop corridor plans <em>for the major arterials </em>in Oregon City, and provide appropriate land uses in and adjacent to those corridors to optimize the land use-transportation connection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This context supports the city\u2019s interpretation that an \u201carterial\u201d is an appropriate location for a transit corridor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We disagree with petitioner\u2019s assertion that, in context, the <em>only </em>plausible interpretation of the phrase \u201calong selected transit corridors\u201d is that the property must have a transit line running the full length of one of the segments of road that borders the property. Again, our task is not to determine whether petitioner\u2019s proposed interpretation is better than the city\u2019s, but rather, whether the city\u2019s interpretation itself plausibly accounts for the text and context of the phrase. <em>Siegert, </em>246 Or App at 509. Moreover, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>context that petitioner cites in support of his interpretation is inconsistent with the city\u2019s interpretation. Petitioner notes that the \u201ccorridor\u201d definitions in the OCCP and Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept state that a \u201ccorridor\u201d is \u201c[s]erved extensively by transit [,] \u201d can be located \u201calong an arterial that [has] *** good transit service[,]\u201d and is \u201c[a]long good quality transit lines, *** [with] convenient access to transit[.]\u201d Those references to transit do not undermine the plausibility of the city\u2019s interpretation. Because the definitions do not further define the scope of any of these phrases, they can be understood to be prescriptive\u2014descriptions of how areas that are designated* as corridors should develop\u2014rather than prerequisites to the \u201ccorridor\u201d or \u201cMUC\u201d designation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Petitioner correctly notes that the property is not designated as a \u201ccorridor\u201d on Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept map. However, we disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that the city cannot designate a site as MUC unless it is along a \u201ccorridor\u201d on the 2040 Growth Concept map or \u201calong a duly-expanded Corridor pursuant to [Metro Code (MC)] 3.07.650(b).\u201d Nothing in the 2040 Growth Concept text or map clearly precludes the city from designating a Corridor in a location other than the locations designated on Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept map. In fact, as mentioned above, the Corridor description in the 2040 Growth Concept text supports the city\u2019s conclusion that an arterial road is an appropriate location for a transit corridor. Similarly, corridors that do appear on the 2040 Growth Concept also run along arterial roads. Additionally, petitioner\u2019s reliance on MC 3.07.650(b) is misplaced. Read in its own context, the provision applies to the revision of boundaries found on the \u201cCenters, Corridors, Station Communities and Main Streets <em>Map\u201d </em>which is a map that was adopted by Metro as part of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan, and which is distinct from both the 2040 Growth Concept map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and a local government\u2019s own comprehensive plan map. MC 3.07.650(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Finally, we recognize that at the core of this dispute is petitioner\u2019s concern that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201c[t]he Corridor comprehensive plan and zoning designation must be applied in a coordinated, if not simultaneous, manner to all of the properties creating the selected Corridor. That way, for example, the density of the formation can support the transit and the transit can support the density, in a synergistic manner. The subject property in this case, without transit, and isolated from other Corridor-designated properties, doesn\u2019t qualify for the applicable comprehensive plan and zoning designations. In isolation, its density level would be detrimental, for example by concentrating a high number of pedestrians who would have constrained options for mobility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Assuming that corridor-related designations must be applied so that \u201cthe density of the formation can support the transit and the transit can support the density,\u201d petitioner\u2019s assertions that the property is \u201cisolated\u201d and \u201cwithout transit\u201d are issues of substantial evidence, which, as we will explain, petitioner did not adequately raise before LUBA. And, to the extent that petitioner\u2019s concern relies on the assumption that the city\u2019s interpretation was limited to concluding that any property \u201cnear a transit stop\u201d satisfies the requirement of Goal 2.3 that the development be \u201calong selected transit corridors,\u201d we reiterate that our holding is based on the broader understanding, as explained above, of the city\u2019s interpretation of \u201calong selected transit corridors\u201d to include properties that are both bordered by a state highway and an arterial and near a transit stop. We do not reach any conclusions as to whether proximity to a transit stop, by itself, is sufficient to establish that a property is \u201calong selected transit corridors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">B. <em>Whether LUBA Made Findings of Fact that Were Not in the Record Below, and Sustained the City\u2019s Decision Despite a Lack of Substantial Evidence in the Whole Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Petitioner argues that LUBA erred \u201cin making findings of fact that were not in the record below,\u201d asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>that \u201cLUBA\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the board under ORS 197.835(2). ORS 197.850(9)(c).\u201d As an initial matter, petitioner misstates the standard of review; LUBA did not find facts under ORS 197.835(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">However, we also understand petitioner to argue that LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d because there is no evidence to support the city\u2019s finding that the application complied with Goal 2.3. ORS 197.850(9)(a). Specifically, petitioner asserts that \u201c[irrespective of whether *** the subject site is \u2018along a transit corridor\u2019 or \u2018near a transit stop,\u2019 the record below is completely devoid of <em>any </em>evidence to substantiate any finding.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We decline to address petitioner\u2019s argument. Petitioner did not make this argument before LUBA, and, as a result, has not preserved the issue, as now framed, for our review. <em>See </em>ORS 197.850(8) (\u201cJudicial review of an order issued under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 shall be confined to the record.\u201d). Moreover, LUBA did not make any substantial evidence rulings on the Goal 2.3 issue in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Before LUBA, petitioner\u2019s only substantial evidence argument relied on the conclusion that Goal 2.3 requires land designated as MUC to be \u201calong a good quality transit line.\u201d Petitioner argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s findings fail to establish that the subject property meets the standard for the Mixed Use Corridor OCCP designation or the MUC zoning designation: the property is simply not \u2018along\u2019 a good quality transit line. * * * For the subject property to satisfy the standard for the \u2018Mixed Use Corridor\u2019 comprehensive plan designation or the MUC zoning designation, it would have to have a good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>quality bus line running on the segment of Beavercreek Road along\u2014paralleling\u2014the property, from Highway 213 to Maplelane Road, or on the segment of Maplelane Road running from Beavercreek Road to Maplelane Court. The subject property has neither. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201cThere is also no evidence in the record that these segments ever will be served by \u2018good quality\u2019 transit in the future [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(Footnote omitted.) That is, petitioner\u2019s arguments were contingent on LUBA\u2019s rejection of the city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3 and on LUBA\u2019s adoption of his alternative interpretation. LUBA found that the city\u2019s interpretation was entitled to deference under ORS 197.829(1) (a) and, therefore, did not address this argument. As we summarized in <em>Root v. Klamath County, </em>260 Or App 665, 670, 320 P3d 631 (2014), when a petitioner asserts a substantial evidence issue under ORS 197.850 (9)(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cour role * * * is to ensure that LUBA has followed the proper \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard in reviewing the county\u2019s decision. \u215d\u215d\u215c Our task is not to assess whether the local government erred in making a finding, but to determine whether LUBA properly exercised its review authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">(Brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted.) Because LUBA did not exercise its review authority, there is nothing for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3 plausibly accounts for the text and context of the goal, and, therefore, LUBA did not err in deferring to that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Affirmed on petition and cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\"> As explained below in greater detail, LUBA\u2019s order did not address petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence argument. <em>See </em>286 Or App at 671-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> Petitioner also asserts that the city was not entitled to deference because the city interpreted standards set forth by Metro, a metropolitan service district encompassing land in Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas counties including the city of Oregon City, rather than its own land use regulation. He argues that LUBA erred in deferring to the city\u2019s interpretation because that interpretation was not actually an \u201cinterpretation of its comprehensive plan,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 197.829(1) and, therefore, the city\u2019s interpretation is \u201cnot entitled to deference under the judicial rule that an agency is not entitled to deference in its interpretation of an enactment of another agency.\u201d We disagree. The city directly interpreted Goal 2.3, which is an enactment of the city. The text of Goal 2.3\u2014\u201cFocus transit-oriented, higher intensity, mixed-use development along selected transit corridors\u201d\u2014is the result of the deliberative process of the City Commission of Oregon City and is not found anywhere in the Metro provisions cited by petitioner. However, we agree with petitioner that those provisions provide relevant context for assessing the plausibility of the city\u2019s interpretation of Goal 2.3. <em>See </em>286 Or App at 668 at n 4 (explaining why certain Metro provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>provide context for Goal 2.3); <em>id. </em>at 668 n 5 (discussing Metro\u2019s definition of \u201cCorridors\u201d as relevant context); <em>id. </em>at 669-70 (discussing Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept text and map descriptions of Corridors as relevant context; rejecting petitioner\u2019s assertion that Metro Code (MC) 3.07.650(b) provides context).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> \u201cAbut\u201d means \u201cto border on.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>8 (unabridged ed 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-5\"> These references render Metro provisions that discuss the Corridor design type, and particularly those found in the Metro 2040 Growth Concept text and map, part of the context on the express language of Goal 2.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We also pause to provide background on the regional planning scheme embodied in the various provisions cited by petitioner. As the OCCP explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cIn the mid-1990s, Metro adopted the <em>Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives </em>(RUGGO), which is part of the <em>Regional Framework Plan </em>(1997) and includes <em>Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept </em>(1995). RUGGO was developed to implement regional compliance with state goals for land use in a coordinated way and to ensure that housing and employment growth could be acconjmo-dated equitably across the region.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">(Emphasis in original.) Metro\u2019s 2040 Growth Concept explains that it \u201cstates the preferred form of regional growth and development\u201d and that it includes the Growth Concept map. Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan, codified at Metro Code (MC) Chapter 3.07, to \u201cimplement [the policies in the RUGGO], including the Metro 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan.\u201d MC 3.07.010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\"> As petitioner points out, the OCCP glossary definition of \u201cCorridors\u201d repeats \u201cverbatim the text of an expanded definition of\u2018Corridors\u2019 *** in Metro\u2019s Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives. Metro Ord. 95-625A (1995).\u201d Thus, Metro\u2019s own definition of \u201cCorridors\u201d also supports the city\u2019s interpretation that an \u201carterial\u201d is an appropriate location for a transit corridor.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">In addition, the OCCP also identifies Beavercreek Road as a \u201cCorridor.\u201d It provides, \u201cMolalla Avenue, 7th Street, Beavercreek Road, and Highway 99 are identified as Corridors [.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b689-5\"> Petitioner\u2019s argument presumes that designations are solely descriptive\u2014 that is, that they reflect existing conditions\u2014as opposed to being prescriptive. That presumption is at odds with the role that the designations play in land use <em>planning. </em>As the OCCP explains, the MUC designation is intended to <em>encourage </em>particular types of changes; specifically, the plan states that \u201c[t]ransit corridors are to he designated with the * * * Mixed Use Corridors (MUC) district to encourage somewhat more intensive and mixed-use development than exists, creating more efficient land-use and travel patterns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> Under ORS 197.850(9)(c), this court shall reverse or remand LUBA\u2019s order if it finds that \u201c[t]he order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the board under ORS 197.835(2).\u201d ORS 197.835(2) provides, in relevant part, that LUBA \u201cmay take evidence and make findings of facts on\u201d disputed allegations of \u201cstanding, unconstitutionality of the decision, <em>ex parte </em>contacts, actions described in subsection (10)(a)(B) of this section or other procedural irregularities not shown in the record that, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand!.]\u201d Before LUBA, there were no disputed procedural issues under petitioner\u2019s assignment of error that required L\u00dcBA to make findings of fact. Additionally, the \u201cfacts\u201d that petitioner asserts that LUBA erroneously found were statements made in footnotes, which, read in context, were not relied on by LUBA in making its rulings on the assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
