California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether: (a) the district court properly complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Sinclair\u2019s guilty plea; and (b) the district court properly sentenced Sinclair to the statutory minimum of 120 months. Counsel concedes, however, that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. In response, Sinclair has submitted a pro se supplemental brief claiming: (a) he only pleaded guilty based on the Government\u2019s implied assurances that it would move for a sentence below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000); and (b) certain juvenile offenses were wrongly included in calculating his criminal history category. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-21\">Because Sinclair did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review his challenges to the Rule 11 proceeding for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Apr. 10, 2002) (No. 02-5170). We have reviewed the plea hearing and the colloquy that the lower court undertook with Sinclair and find that the court fully complied with Rule 11 and that Sinclair\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Additionally, we find no merit to Sinclair\u2019s claim that his plea was improperly induced by any implied assurances that the Government would move for a \u00a7 3553(e) departure. Sinclair\u2019s plea agreement clearly stated that the decision as to whether to move for a \u00a7 3553(e) departure remained in the absolute discretion of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">We decline to address Sinclair\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him to the statutory minimum of 120 months. This sentence is within the guideline range and is below the statutory maximum sentence of life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000) (setting forth statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ry minimum and maximum). Because Sinclair\u2019s sentence does not exceed the maximum allowed by the Guidelines or statute, we will not review it on appeal. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990) (finding challenge to court\u2019s exercise of discretion in setting a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range not addressable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Finally, we find no merit to Sinclair\u2019s claim that certain juvenile offenses were wrongly included in calculating his criminal history category. We have reviewed the presentence report and find that the juvenile offenses in question were properly included in his criminal history pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Sinclair\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
