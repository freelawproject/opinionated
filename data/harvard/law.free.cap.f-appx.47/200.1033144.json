The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that Poole\u2019s prior convictions were not \u201crelated\u201d because they were not formally consolidated and because they were not part of a common scheme or plan. If the district court had considered the offenses related, Poole\u2019s criminal history score would place him in a lower criminal history category, resulting in a guideline range of 70-87 months of imprisonment as opposed to the range of 151-188 months of imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. On July 25, 2000, Poole robbed the First Community Bank in Bluefield, West Virginia. He was arrested the same day and admitted to committing the robbery. Poole also confessed to robbing banks in Coral-ville, Iowa; Columbia, Missouri; Mobile, Alabama; Columbus, Mississippi; Monaca, Pennsylvania; Toledo, Ohio; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Bloomington, Illinois; and Kansas City, Missouri between May 18 and July 17, 2000. Poole was indicted in the Southern District of West Virginia for the Bluefield robbery on August 17, 2000. He was charged by indictment or information with all of the other robberies, with the exception of the robbery in Kansas City, Missouri,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the district where the offense occurred. Subsequently, all of the charges were transferred to the Southern District of West Virginia pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 20. Poole pleaded guilty to all nine charges of bank robbery on February 12, 2001. The issue at Poole\u2019s sentencing hearing was whether he was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In 1992, Poole was convicted in the Southern District of Mississippi on sixteen counts of bank robbery. Those sixteen robberies occurred in various cities and states and over a time period of approximately one year. Poole was arrested after robbing a bank in Mississippi and, during the interrogation, admitted to committing the other robberies. All of the charges from other districts were transferred to the Southern District of Mississippi pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 20. The cases were processed under separate docket numbers and there was no formal order consolidating the cases. Poole eventually pleaded guilty to all of the charges and was sentenced to 57 months imprisonment on each charge, those sentences to be served concurrently. Separate judgment and commitment orders were entered in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia determined that Poole\u2019s 1992 convictions in Mississippi should be considered separate convictions and found that Poole was a career offender. He was then sentenced to 151 months imprisonment on each of the nine cases, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The parties disagree on the standard of review to be applied by this Court. Poole contends that the district court\u2019s conclusion that his prior offenses were not formally consolidated under Rule 20 as well as the conclusion that the prior offenses were not part of a common scheme or plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>should be reviewed <em>de novo. </em>The government, on the other hand, asserts that this Court should review the district court\u2019s determination that the prior offenses were not formally consolidated \u201cdeferentially\u201d rather than under a <em>de novo </em>standard. The government agrees with Poole that, otherwise, the question of whether the pri- or offenses are \u201crelated\u201d is a legal determination and subject to <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In <em>Buford v. United States, 532 </em>U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001), the Court was faced with the question of whether the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals applied the appropriate standard of review in assessing whether the district court properly determined that two cases had not been functionally consolidated for sentencing. The Seventh Circuit \u201cdecided to review the District Court\u2019s decision \u2018deferentially\u2019 rather than <em>\u2018de novo.\u201d\u2019 Id. </em>at 62-63 (quoting <em>Buford, </em>201 F.3d 937, 942 (2000)). The <em>Buford </em>case concerns \u201cfunctional consolidation,\u201d a <em>term recognized </em>in the Seventh Circuit. The court held that the Seventh Circuit properly reviewed the district court\u2019s decision deferentially rather than <em>de novo </em>because of the fact-intensive nature of the \u201cfunctional consolidation\u201d determination. <em>See id. </em>at 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276 (\u201cthe district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates \u2018functional consolidation\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We believe the case before us is distinguishable from <em>Buford </em>because such a fact-intensive inquiry is not necessary, in this case, to determine whether Poole\u2019s cases were consolidated. This circuit does not recognize \u201cfunctional consolidation\u201d and, thus, whether Poole\u2019s cases were consolidated is a purely legal question, as discussed below. \u2018We review an application of the Sentencing Guidelines by the district court for clear error in factual matters; legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In this case, with respect to the third part of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, application note 3, which asserts that prior offenses are related if they were consolidated for trial or sentencing, the conclusion rests on the purely legal question of whether a formal consolidation order was entered pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8, as we discuss below. Thus, the issue is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. On the other hand, the question of whether the prior offenses are related because they were part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d is a factual determination. Thus, the issue of whether the second part of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, application note 3 is satisfied is subject to clear error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">A defendant is a career offender and subject to enhanced punishment if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Poole concedes that he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant offense and that the bank robberies are crimes of violence. Poole argues that he is not a \u201ccareer offender\u201d because he does not have at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(3). \u201cTwo prior felony convictions,\u201d as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(3), is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. \u201cThe term \u2018two prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>felony convictions\u2019 means ... the sentences for at least two of the aforementioned felony convictions are counted separately under the provisions of \u00a7 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(c)(2). Section 4A1.2(a)(2) provides that \u201c[pjrior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately. Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence.\u201d An application note to the Sentencing Guidelines further explains: \u201c[P]rior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Poole contends that the bank robberies for which he was sentenced in the Southern District of Mississippi are \u201crelated\u201d offenses pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 because the offenses were part of a single common scheme or plan and because the offenses were consolidated for sentencing. First, Poole argues that he satisfies the third part of application note 3 which states that eases are considered related if they were consolidated for trial or sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3. Poole asserts that his prior convictions were effectively consolidated for sentencing by virtue of a consolidation order pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 20. The government contends that the prior convictions were not consolidated as they were docketed under separate docket numbers, separate judgment and commitment orders were entered for each case, and, most importantly, there was no formal order entered by the district court consolidating the cases. The government argues that a transfer, alone, does not formally consolidate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">This Court was presented with the issue of whether or not prior offenses were consolidated in <em>United States v. Breckenridge, </em>93 F.3d 132 (4th Cir.1996). In <em>Breckenridge, </em>the defendant\u2019s prior offenses were consolidated for trial. \u201cThe distinction between consolidation for trial and consolidation for sentencing is an important one. Totally unrelated cases may be informally consolidated for sentencing. It seems unlikely that the Sentencing Commission intended such cases to be treated as \u2018related\u2019 for purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s eligibility for career offender status.\u201d <em>Breckenridge, </em>93 F.3d at 137. Thus, the fact that Poole\u2019s prior convictions may have been informally consolidated for sentencing is not dispositive of whether the prior offenses were related. A formal consolidation order is required by this circuit before it will find cases to have been consolidated for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>50 F.3d 294, 297 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>515 U.S. 1167, 115 S.Ct. 2630, 132 L.Ed.2d 870 (1995). In <em>Allen, </em>we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">requiring charges to be formally consolidated ... is a rule that is consistent with interests of sentencing uniformity, predictability, and equity. There is no reason for certain defendants who receive concurrent sentences for prior charges to reap an additional windfall over other defendants whose prior crimes, though every bit as \u201crelated,\u201d may have been sentenced separately. While it is true that requiring formal consolidation is a rigid rule, if such an approach leads to the significant over-representation of any defendant\u2019s criminal history, the Guidelines provide for departures in such cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Poole contends that his prior sentences were consolidated pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 20(b). It is clear that Federal Rule of Criminal Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>dure 8<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the appropriate mechanism to formally consolidate cases and a formal consolidation order pursuant to Rule 8 is required before this Court will consider Poole\u2019s prior convictions to be related. Rule 20, on the other hand, provides merely for a transfer from one district to another for plea and sentencing. Moreover, not only does this Court believe that Rule 20 is not the proper mechanism to formally consolidate cases but, in fact, there was no <em>formal </em>consolidation order at all in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Poole has not met the requirement of <em>Allen\u2019s </em>\u201crigid rule\u201d that a formal order of consolidation be entered before this Court will consider the prior offenses \u201crelated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Poole also contends that even if the district court was correct in finding that the prior convictions were not formally consolidated, the convictions, nonetheless, should have been found to be related because they were part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d This Court recognized an eight-factor test to determine whether offenses are part of a common scheme or plan in <em>Breckenridge, </em>93 F.3d 132. Those factors include temporal proximity, geographic proximity, whether the crimes involved the same substantive offense, whether the crimes were directed at a common victim, whether the crimes were solved during the course of a single investigation, whether the crimes shared a similar <em>modus operands </em>whether the crimes were animated by the same motive, and whether the crimes were tried and sentenced separately only because of an accident of geography. <em>See id. </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The first two factors, although not determinative, \u201care significant indicators of a common plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Poole does not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that these factors favor the conclusion that the offenses were not related. In this type of case, we believe that these factors, temporal proximity and geographic proximity, are especially significant. The crimes for which Poole was convicted in the Southern District of Mississippi occurred over a t\u00fane period of more than one year and involved robberies in eight states and different cities within several of those states. We have held in prior cases, with different facts, of course, that these two factors weigh in favor of finding that prior offenses were related. In <em>Breckemidge, </em>the prior offenses occurred during the same one-month period and five out of six of the offenses occurred in the same city, with the sixth occurring in an adjoining county. <em>See id. </em>at 134. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Fonville, </em>5 F.3d 781, 785 (4th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1086, 114 S.Ct. 1839, 128 L.Ed.2d 466 (1994), the crimes at issue occurred within eight days of one another and within a close geographic proximity. This case is easily distinguished from <em>Breckemidge </em>and <em>Fonville </em>due to the lengthy time span between the bank robberies along with the vast geographical area over which the robberies occurred. These factors should be afforded significant weight in this case and both weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>against finding that such offenses were \u201crelated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">That Poole\u2019s prior offenses involved the same substantive offense, bank robberies, is undisputed and this factor weighs in favor of the finding that Poole\u2019s prior offenses were related.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The next factor, whether the offenses were directed at a common victim, is not as clear. Poole argues that this factor refers to a common \u201ctype\u201d of victim. He contends that because the victims were all banks, the district court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that this factor weighed in favor of the government\u2019s position because no bank was robbed twice \u2014 -was in error. The government does not seem to contest Poole\u2019s interpretation of this factor. This Court finds, in according due deference to the district court\u2019s interpretation of this factor, that the decision to weigh this factor in favor of finding Poole\u2019s prior offenses were not related was not in error. However, even if Poole is correct that this factor refers to \u201ctype of victim,\u201d the balancing of all the factors would still weigh in favor of the government\u2019s position that Poole\u2019s pri- or convictions were not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The next factor, whether the offenses were solved during the course of a single criminal investigation, is also in dispute. We agree with the district court that this factor should weigh in favor of the government. It is not evident that the offenses were solved by one criminal investigation but, rather, they were solved by accident when Poole confessed to the robberies after being apprehended for the robbery in Mississippi. We held in <em>Breckenridge </em>that the fact \u201cthat crimes were solved by a single police investigation \u2014 -if the crimes were discovered by accident and not by a targeted investigation \u2014 does not demonstrate that the offenses result from a common plan.\u201d <em>Breckenridge, </em>93 F.3d at 138. The situation at issue in this case is exactly the type of situation we referred to in <em>Breckenridge </em>because there was not one targeted investigation of all of the bank robberies committed by Poole. Rather, we can only assume that several law enforcement offices in the respective states where the robberies occurred were investigating the offenses. It was only by accident that the crimes were all solved at one time when Poole confessed during an interrogation. Thus, we believe that the district court was correct in weighing this factor in favor of finding the prior offenses were not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The next two factors, whether the offenses shared a similar <em>modus operandi </em>and whether the offenses were animated by the same motive, are not contested by either party and weigh in Poole\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">One factor remains, which is whether the offenses were tried and sentenced separately only because of an accident of geography. Poole claims that the district court did not properly consider this factor. The district court held that because Poole\u2019s cases were not consolidated for sentencing, the factor points to not treating the prior offenses as a common scheme or plan. Poole argues that because he was sentenced at a single hearing and because the sentences were ordered to run concurrently, the factor should weigh in favor of finding that the offenses were related or, at worst, be a neutral factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">In <em>Breckenridge, </em>we noted that if the \u201cevidence supports a finding that all ... offenses would have been consolidated for trial but for geography, then they ... should be treated as related for purposes of career offender sentencing.\u201d 93 F.3d at 139. We cautioned, however, \u201cthe mere fact that a defendant receives concurrent sentences for two crimes does not render the crimes related....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. We agree with Poole that this factor should not be discounted when there has been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>consolidation. The eighth factor of the <em>Breckemidge </em>test is whether the offenses <em>\u201cwould </em>have been consolidated for trial but for geography,\u201d not whether the offenses <em>were </em>consolidated. <em>Id. </em>at 139 (emphasis added). We ultimately agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the factor does weigh in favor of the government\u2019s position. The district court properly considered the eighth factor when it found that Poole\u2019s cases \u201ccould not have been consolidated for trial.... \u201d J.A. at 238. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s decision to weigh this factor in favor of finding that the prior offenses were not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">This Court agrees with the district court\u2019s ruling that Poole\u2019s prior convictions were not formally consolidated. We also agree with the district court\u2019s ruling that the <em>Breckemidge </em>factors weigh in favor of the government\u2019s position that the prior offenses were not related. Even if the factor regarding a common victim refers to \u201ctype of victim,\u201d thus weighing the factor in favor of Poole, the factors result in an even split. Given the significant weight to be given to temporal and geographic proximity in a case such as this, we believe that the factors ultimately result in a finding that Poole\u2019s prior convictions were not related. Accordingly, we find that Poole was appropriately sentenced as a career offender and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-13\">.
