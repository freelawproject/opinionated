Rollins, sentenced to 188 months\u2019 incarceration followed by three years\u2019 supervised release, challenges several facets of his sentencing. Rollins\u2019 arguments on appeal focus on whether the district court properly concluded he qualified for sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000) (\u201cACCA\u201d), and whether the district court erred in resolving his two factual objections to the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-25\">Rollins\u2019 contention that he does not qualify for sentencing under the ACCA is meritless. Rollins\u2019 PSR identifies four qualifying convictions, including two convictions for housebreaking involving businesses. While Rollins argues these two convictions are not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(e), the Supreme Court has found that a burglary is a qualifying crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>violence and encompasses any \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into ... a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2148, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Because the elements of housebreaking satisfy this definition, <em>see State v. Miller, </em>287 S.C. 280, 337 S.E.2d 883, 885 (S.C.1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Creech, </em>314 S.C. 76, 441 S.E.2d 635 (S.C.Ct.App.1993), Rollins was properly eligible for sentencing as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Based on Rollins\u2019 eligibility for sentencing under the ACC A, we find his remaining objections to be meritless. Rollins\u2019 188 month sentence is less than the ACCA\u2019s statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>280 F.3d 407, 416 (4th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. -, (U.S. June 3, 2002) (No. 01-10603). As a result, the district court\u2019s sentencing calculations do not implicate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 198-202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Likewise, Rollins\u2019 objection to the application of the two-level offense level enhancement of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) is meritless, as that provision applies even if Rollins was unaware the firearm he pled guilty to possessing was stolen. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.19); <em>see also United States v. Murphy, </em>96 F.3d 846, 849 (6th Cir.1996) (holding lack of <em>mens rea </em>requirement in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) does not violate Due Process).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Finally, Rollins\u2019 factual objections to his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) are without merit. Rollins\u2019 challenge to the PSR\u2019s characterization of the individual shot during his possession of the firearm in question as \u201cthe victim\u201d is misplaced. Because it is undisputed an individual was shot during Rollins\u2019 possession of the firearm in question, the characterization of that individual as a victim is immaterial. Moreover, the district court explicitly stated it would not be influenced by this characterization in imposing Rollins\u2019 sentence and sentenced Rollins at the bottom of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Neither is the district court\u2019s decision to allow reference in the PSR to an expert\u2019s opinion (that the firearm in question could not discharge by accident) inherently erroneous. The district court found the expert qualified to provide the opinion, and Rollins failed to either challenge those qualifications or proffer any evidence contradicting that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">To the extent the district court may have erred in not identifying the felony that Rollins\u2019 possession of the firearm facilitated in order to support an enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), or in not inquiring further into the circumstances of that possession in order to support that enhancement, <em>see United States v. Samuels, </em>970 F.2d 1312, 1316 (4th Cir.1992), we find no plain error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In order to demonstrate plain error, Rollins would have to show that the error was prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 376 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 213, 151 L.Ed.2d 152 (2001). Because we conclude this error would not affect Rollins\u2019 188 month sentence, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">Accordingly, because the district court properly concluded Rollins was eligible for sentencing under the ACCA and that Rol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Jins\u2019 related objections are meritless, we affirm Rollins\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\"> Because Rollins did not assert this issue at sentencing or on appeal, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Childress, 26 </em>F.3d 498, 502 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
