First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>155 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">The district court relied on <em>Edelman v. Lynchburg Coll., </em>228 F.3d 503 (4th Cir.2000), to find that Nye\u2019s sworn but untimely charge to the EEOC could not relate back to her unsworn but timely filing with the EEOC. Subsequent to the district court\u2019s order, however, <em>Edelman </em>was reversed. <em>See Edelman v. Lynchburg Coll., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002). The Supreme Court held that the EEOC\u2019s regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.12(b), was valid and that an untimely sworn EEOC charge could relate back to a timely but unsworn EEOC charge. <em>Edelman, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 122 S.Ct. at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-22\">Because the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Edelman, </em>we vacate and remand for compliance with that opinion. We decline to address the other issues raised on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-16\"> Nye also alleged state law claims, which she has abandoned on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
