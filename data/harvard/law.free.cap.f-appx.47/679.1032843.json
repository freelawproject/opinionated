Campos did not appeal that order. Instead, he filed a motion for reconsideration on November 27, 2001 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the court denied on December 18, 2001. Campos then filed a second motion for reconsideration on December 30, 2001, which the court denied on February 21, 2002. Campos\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on February 27, 2002. Because Campos filed his motions to reconsider more than ten days from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition, the time period for filing his appeal from the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief was not tolled. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4); <em>Panhorst v. United States, 241 F.8d 367, </em>370 (4th Cir.2001). In addition, Campos\u2019 notice of appeal is timely only as to the district court\u2019s order denying his second motion for reconsideration, which was properly construed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">This court reviews denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995) (per curiam). We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court\u2019s order denying Campos\u2019 second motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Campos\u2019 appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-14\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume the date appearing on Campos\u2019 filings is the earliest date they could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
