Because we may not review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Holmes argues his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines. Overstatement of the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s actual criminal history is a basis for downward departure. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3 (2000); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>977 F.2d 861, 866 (4th Cir.1992). Because it clearly appears that the district court knew it possessed the authority to grant Holmes\u2019 motion to depart downward when it declined to do so, we may not review the court\u2019s refusal to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352-53 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">We therefore dismiss Holmes\u2019 appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
