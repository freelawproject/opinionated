Adams alleged the Defendant failed to provide him with adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts. Adams also alleged the Defendant discriminated against him by providing another prisoner with special access to the prison law library. The district court dismissed Adams\u2019 discrimination claim without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A and dismissed Adams\u2019 access to courts claim pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">With regard to Adams\u2019 denial of access to courts claim, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Adams v. Dobbins, </em>No. CA-01-964 (W.D.Va. Apr. 12, 2002). With regard to Adams\u2019 discrimination claim, because he may cure any deficiency by filing an amended complaint, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not a final, appealable order. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). We deny Adams\u2019 motion to amend the caption in this case. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
