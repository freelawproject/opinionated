A petitioner must show that he has a clear right to the relief sought, that the respondent has a clear duty to perform the act requested by petitioner, and that there is no other adequate remedy available. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-33\">We find that Davis has failed to make the requisite showing of extraordinary cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>eumstances justifying mandamus relief because he cannot show that there is no other adequate remedy available. Davis is essentially seeking review of the lower court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel, which he filed along with a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion in the district court. We note that Davis\u2019s appeal of this order is currently pending before this court. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny his motion for appointment of counsel, and deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
