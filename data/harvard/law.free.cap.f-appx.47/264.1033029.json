Turner was sentenced to 324 months imprisonment. On appeal, Turner maintains there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy and the district court erred in its instructions on conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">This court must affirm the conviction if there is substantial evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government; we inquire whether there is evidence sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review witness credibility, and we assume the fact finder resolved all contradictions in the evidence in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). If the evidence supports different reasonable interpretations of the evidence, the jury decides which to believe. <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994). We have reviewed the record and we find sufficient evidence to support Turner\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">Turning to Turner\u2019s claim of erroneous jury instructions, we review a claim that a jury instruction inaccurately stated the law de novo. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>121 F.3d 908, 923 (4th Cir.1997). Jury instructions are not evaluated in isolated segments, but are considered as a whole. <em>See United States v. Cropp, </em>127 F.3d 354, 360 (4th Cir.1997); <em>see also Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). We find the district court\u2019s instruction based on our decision in <em>Cropp </em>was not a misstatement of the law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>considering the instructions as a whole, the <em>Cropp </em>instruction was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Turner\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
