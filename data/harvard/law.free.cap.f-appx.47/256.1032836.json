We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. The district court correctly determined Alexander failed to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge or disparate discipline because she failed to establish that she was performing at a level that met her employer\u2019s legitimate job expectations, <em>see Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 607 (4th Cir.1999), or that the prohibited conduct in which she engaged was comparable in seriousness to misconduct of white employees. <em>See Cook v. CSX Transp. Corp., </em>988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1993). Furthermore, even if Alexander could establish a prima facie case, she has presented no evidence of pretext. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 137-39, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
