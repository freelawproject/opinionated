However, the district court docket sheet reflects only the filing of a later letter from Williams inquiring about his appeal. Because, under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), a notice of appeal is considered filed as of the date Williams delivered it to prison officials for mailing to the court, the district court docket sheet is not conclusive on this issue. Thus, we remand the case for the district court to determine whether Williams filed a timely notice of appeal. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-21\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
