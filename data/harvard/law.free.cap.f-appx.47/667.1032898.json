The district court docket sheet reveals that on September 25, 2002, the district court entered a final order denying relief on Walker\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Accordingly, Walker has received the relief he seeks in his mandamus petition. A-though we grant Walker leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we dismiss the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
