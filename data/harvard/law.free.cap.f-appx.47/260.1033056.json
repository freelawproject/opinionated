Doe argues that the district court erred by finding no violation of due process and an insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>amount in controversy for diversity jurisdiction, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and failing to issue a protective order. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>Flood v. New Hanover County, </em>125 F.3d 249, 251 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Matkari, </em>7 F.3d 1130, 1134 (4th Cir.1993). Under <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), negligent or intentional deprivations of property by a state employee do not state a claim of constitutional magnitude when there is an adequate post-deprivation remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 533-34; <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). An adequate post-deprivation state remedy is available to Doe because the PIA sets forth procedures for gaining access to public records and for challenging the denial of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if the court has already dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (2000). Because the district court properly found no federal claim under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, the court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim. Nor did the court err in finding that it did not have diversity jurisdiction over the claim. <em>See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 347, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977) (holding that when a plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, the amount in controversy for purposes of \u00a7 1332 is the \u201cvalue of the object of the litigation\u201d); <em>McGaw v. Farrow, </em>472 F.2d 952, 954 (4th Cir.1973) (\u201ca claim not measurable in \u2018dollars and cents\u2019 fails to meet the jurisdictional test of amount in controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Finally, we find that the district court did not abuse the broad discretion afforded it in declining to rule on the motion for a protective order because the issue was moot. <em>See Seattle Times Co. v. Rinehart, </em>467 U.S. 20, 36, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
