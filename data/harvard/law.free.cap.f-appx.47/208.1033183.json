The Government sought an enhanced sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000), based upon Johnston\u2019s two previous felony drug convictions. Johnston\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one potential issue for review but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Johnston was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-23\">Johnston contends that the Government breached the plea agreement by refusing to file a motion for downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Johnston\u2019s plea agreement, however, contained no unconditional promise to file a motion for downward departure, but instead left the decision to the Government\u2019s discretion. There is no evidence that the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure was based upon an unconstitutional motive or that the Government acted in bad faith. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir.2000). We conclude that Johnston\u2019s allegation of a breach of the plea agreement is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case. Our review convinces us that Johnston\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, and was supported by an adequate factual basis. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Johnston\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment was statutorily mandated. We have found no meritorious issues for appeal, and we therefore affirm Johnston\u2019s convictions and sentence. We remand the case to the district court for correction of clerical errors in the judgment order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. Specifically, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d descriptions on page one of the order are incorrect for Counts One and Two, as is the statutory citation under Count Two. These errors do not affect the validity of Johnston\u2019s convictions or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-24\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
