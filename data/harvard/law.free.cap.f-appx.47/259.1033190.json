The district court sentenced Eatmon to 87 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-26\">Eatmoris brief on appeal raises three sentencing issues. First, Eatmon claims the district court erred by relying on the same conduct for upward adjustments in Eatmoris offense level pursuant to both <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3B1.1(c) and 2F1.1(b)(2)(A) (2000). Next, he contends the court erred in finding he obstructed justice. Lastly, Eatmon claims the court erred in making an upward departure, increasing his criminal history from category I to category II. In addition, Eatmon has filed a supplemental pro se brief on appeal that presents a number of additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-27\">A district court\u2019s factual determinations relating to the application of the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ing guidelines are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). Departures are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). A district court abuses its discretion when determining a departure is warranted if its conclusion is guided by erroneous legal principles, or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding. <em>See United States v. Barber, </em>119 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We have carefully reviewed Eatmon\u2019s objections to his offense level adjustments and find them meritless. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding an upward departure was warranted. We find the court made an adequate showing on the record to support its decision to depart and reasonably stated its basis from the bench. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 882 (4th Cir.1992). We have also fully considered the claims raised in Eatmon\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and reject them as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Accordingly we affirm the decision of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
