His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting: (1) the district court failed to meet the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at the plea hearing; and (2) the district court improperly applied the Sentencing Guidelines. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">On appeal, Fletcher contends his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea hearing was inadequate. In light of the district court\u2019s thorough plea colloquy, we find Fletcher was fully aware of his rights and the consequences of his plea, and that his plea was knowing and voluntary. Thus, we find the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">Fletcher also contends the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score under <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov. 2001), by failing to construe as a single offense three prior offenses informally consolidated for sentencing on the same day. The court, however, properly found the three factually unrelated offenses should count separately for purposes of computing Fletcher\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>50 F.3d 294, 298 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-21\">We have reviewed the entire record in this ease in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
