The District Court concluded that all of Spindler\u2019s claims were either untimely or proeedurally defaulted for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We exercise plenary review on this appeal, <em>see Omnipoint Communications Enterprises, L.P. v. Newtown Township, </em>219 F.3d 240, 242 (3d Cir.2000), and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Spindler was employed by SEPTA as a mechanic for over thirteen years, compiling during that time a long history of poor attendance and tardiness. Consequently, and as an alternative to outright discharge, in November 1998 Spindler signed a \u201cLast Chance Agreement\u201d by which he agreed that any infraction qualifying him for discipline under SEPTA\u2019s points-based attendance policy would subject him to immediate discharge. After a number of further attendance problems, Spindler was formally discharged on May 14,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">On July 2, 1999, Spindler, who suffers from sleep apnea, filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (\u201cPHRC\u201d) and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) alleging that his discharge was the result of disability discrimination. In November 2000, the PHRC dismissed Spindler\u2019s complaint, and gave him notice of his opportunity to request a preliminary hearing to seek a reopening of his case. In December 2000, Spindler, now represented by counsel, requested that hearing and, for the first time, alleged that his discharge was the result of racial discrimination. The PHRC rejected Spindler\u2019s request, reaffirming that the case was closed. The EEOC, which approved the scope of the PHRC\u2019s investigation and adopted its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>elusions, then issued Spindler a right to sue letter. Spindler consequently filed the present suit, alleging racial discrimination and corresponding violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq., the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43 \u00a7\u00a7 951 et seq., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, and granted summary judgment in favor of SEPTA, holding that Spindler\u2019s Title VII and PHRA claims were barred because Spindler had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and that his remaining \u00a7 1983 claim was time-barred because it was made after the relevant statute of limitations had run. Spindler appeals both determinations. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The District Court did not err in concluding that Spindler\u2019s racial discrimination claims under Title VII and the PHRA were precluded. The PHRA requires that any administrative complaint be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. <em>See </em>Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43 \u00a7 959(h). Under Title VII, the relevant term is 300 days. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). Spindler timely filed an administrative complaint accusing SEPTA of disability discrimination but failed to allege racial discrimination until his letter of December 2000, after the PHRC\u2019s administrative investigation was concluded, and long past the statutory deadlines. Spindler argues, however, that his original administrative complaint should be read to include his charge of racial discrimination, and that the administrative investigation was deficient for failing to examine that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">We were confronted with a very similar set of facts in <em>Antol v. Perry, </em>82 F.3d 1291 (3d Cir.1996). There, Antol filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination after his administrative complaint charging disability discrimination was dismissed. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the gender discrimination claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Reiterating that only those acts alleged that are \u201cfairly within the scope of the prior [administrative] complaint, or the investigation arising therefrom\u201d are considered to have been exhausted, <em>Antol, </em>82 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Waiters v. Parsons, </em>729 F.2d 233, 237 (3d Cir.1984) (per curiam)), we held that Antol\u2019s gender discrimination claim did not fall fairly within the scope of the EEOC complaint or investigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Analogously, we cannot conclude that Spindler\u2019s charges of disability discrimination \u201cfairly encompass\u201d his claim of racial discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1296. Throughout the entire seventeen month investigation by the PHRC, Spindler uniformly qualified his claims of discrimination with references to his sleep apnea, or more generally to his disability or medical condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, in completing a PHRC questionnaire designed to elicit all possible bases for the discrimination he alleged, Spindler notably marked only \u201cnon-job related handicap/disability.\u201d At no time during its investigation was the PHRC put on notice of any potential racial discrimination. Accordingly, the PHRC\u2019s extensive \u201cinvestigation was properly focused,\u201d as in <em>Antol, </em>\u201con the gravamen of [the] complaint \u2014 disability discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Spindler\u2019s reliance on our decisions in <em>Anjelino v. New York Times, </em>200 F.3d 73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>(3d Cir.1999), and <em>Hicks v. ABT </em>Assocs., <em>Inc., </em>572 F.2d 960 (3d Cir.1978), is misplaced. In <em>Anjelino, </em>the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 sexual harassment claims because it concluded that references in their administrative complaint of an \u201cabusive atmosphere\u201d because of sex were too vague to put the EEOC on notice of their sexual harassment claims. <em>Anjelino, </em>200 F.3d at 93. We reversed, stating that \u201cappellants\u2019 notification of their charges was sufficient because the terms \u2018abusive,\u2019 \u2018hostile,\u2019 \u2018environment,\u2019 and \u2018atmosphere\u2019 have been used interchangeably to describe sexual harassment,\u201d and that the \u201cinterchangeability convinces us that the harassment charge was within the scope of the complaints before the EEOC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The present situation bears little resemblance to <em>Anjelino. </em>At no time during the PHRC\u2019s investigation did Spindler make even a vague or oblique reference to racial discrimination, let alone include language that could reasonably be considered interchangeable with such a charge. Neither is this case analogous to <em>Hicks. </em>There we held that the District Court was not barred from hearing a sex discrimination claim that had not been included in the original administrative complaint because it was unclear whether the EEOC had improperly refused to amend the complaint. <em>Hicks, </em>572 F.2d at 964. Here there is absolutely no evidence of any agency impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Spindler\u2019s charge of racial discrimination does not fall fairly within the scope of either his original complaint or the related investigation. His claims under Title VII and the PHRC were therefore not administratively exhausted, and were properly dismissed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The District Court was also correct in holding that Spindler\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1983 was time-barred. The statute of limitations for claims brought in Pennsylvania under \u00a7 1983 is two years. <em>Sameric Corp. of Del., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir.1998). Spindler was discharged in May of 1999 and filed the present suit in August of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Spindler argues that his \u00a7 1983 claim is not time-barred because he is not directly challenging his discharge, but is instead challenging SEPTA\u2019s continued reliance on a miscalculated attendance-point total and its corresponding failure to end Spindler\u2019s discharge. Spindler attempts to fashion these actions as either \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or violations of equal protection, and claims that they took place as late as a state arbitration proceeding in May 2000, well within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Claims under \u00a7 1983 accrue when the \u201cplaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which [his] action is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Setting aside Spindler\u2019s attempted suggestions to the contrary, ultimately this action is premised on Spindler\u2019s allegedly discriminatory discharge. Even interpreting his claims charitably, Spindler alleges little more than that SEPTA defended its calculation of Spindler\u2019s accumulated attendance-point total, as well as its ultimate decision to discharge him, throughout the miscellaneous post-termination proceedings that took place in 1999 and 2000. \u201cThe pendency of a grievance, or some other method of collateral review of an employment decision,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not toll the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Del. State Coll. v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 261, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980); <em>see also, e.g., Mazzare v. Burroughs Corp., </em>473 F.Supp. 234, 238-39 (E.D.Pa.1979) (rejecting employee\u2019s claim that the employer\u2019s refusal to re-hire the employee extended the statute of limitations). Thus, regardless of whether Spindler is directly challenging the discharge or, rather, acts necessarily related to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>discharge, any potential action under \u00a7 1983 accrued in May of 1999. We therefore agree with the District Court that Spindler has failed to allege any unlawful acts actionable under \u00a7 1983 within the two year statute of limitations, and that Spindler\u2019s August 2001 complaint was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">. Spindler\u2019s argument that he raised his racial discrimination claim before the PHRC had closed his case is without merit. Spindler\u2019s first reference to race discrimination was in his letter to the PHRC requesting a hearing, after the PHRC had already closed his case. <em>See </em>16 Pa. Code \u00a7\u00a7 42.16-42.66.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
