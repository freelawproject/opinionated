Johnson filed a petition for a writ of mandamus alleging undue delay in the district court. Johnson filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (West 2000) on March 5, 2002. The action was referred to a magistrate judge on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be granted in those extraordinary situations when no other remedy is available. <em>In re: Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Because the matter has been pending before a magistrate judge for just over six months, we find that there has been no undue delay in processing Johnson\u2019s petition. We therefore deny the petition for mandamus relief without prejudice to Johnson\u2019s right to refile if the district court does not act expeditiously. We grant Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
