Brunson pleaded guilty to distribution of 41.5 grams of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000) (Count One); carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (2000) (Count Four), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000) (Count Five). He was sentenced as a career offender to 166 months on Count One, sixty months on Count Four, to run consecutively to the 166-month sentence, and 120 months on Count Five, to run concurrently with the sentence on Count One. Brunson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), complaining about the district court\u2019s denial of Brunson\u2019s motion for downward departure. Brunson has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Brunson was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). Brunson moved for a downward departure, claiming that his designation as a career offender significantly overstated the seriousness of his criminal history. After hearing argument, the district court denied Brunson\u2019s motion. Because the district court recognized that it had the authority to depart, its departure decision is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Brunson also claims that he should not have been classified as a career offender. One of Brunson\u2019s two predicate felonies for career offender status was his conviction in North Carolina of assault on a female. At the time Brunson was convicted of that offense, it was punishable by up to two years in prison. Several months following his conviction, the North Carolina legislature reduced the penalty to 150 days. Brunson contends that, given the subsequent reduction in the penalty, it is unfair to count the offense as one of the qualifying felonies under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. We rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 435, 444-45 (4th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">In both the <em>Anders </em>brief and the pro se brief, Brunson contends that it is a violation of substantive due process to treat as career offenders all defendants with at least two previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, regardless of the number and severity of those offenses. We approved such treatment in <em>United States v. Adkins, </em>937 F.2d 947, 952 (4th Cir.1991), and we therefore find Brunson\u2019s position to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Brunson\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
