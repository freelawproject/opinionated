The district court did not give Farwell notice and an opportunity to respond before recharacterizing his motion as one filed under \u00a7 2255, as required by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002). We therefore grant a certificate of appeal-ability, vacate the district court\u2019s orders, and remand in light of <em>Emmanuel </em>for the district court to provide Farwell with notice of its intention to recharacterize his filing and an opportunity for him to respond by proceeding with the recharacterization as a \u00a7 2255 motion or by electing to have the district court address the merits of his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 649-50. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
