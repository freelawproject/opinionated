The district court entered an order staying the application for fees pending the resolution of the administrative proceedings on remand. Because we conclude we are without appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-24\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b118-25\">Kershaw sought judicial review of a final decision by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) denying her application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>The Secretary had ruled that Kershaw failed to satisfy step four of the sequential evaluation because she was capable of returning to her prior work as a waitress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>6, 1991, the district court ruled that the record did not contain substantial evidence to sustain the Secretary\u2019s decision and entered an order reversing her determination as to step four and remanding the case for further proceedings to determine if Kershaw was capable of performing other employment. On January 17,1992, Kershaw filed an EAJA motion to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in successfully challenging the Secretary\u2019s determination of step four. On April 7, 1992, ruling that Kershaw was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d because any benefits she might receive were contingent on the administrative proceedings on remand, the magistrate judge ordered that the application for fees be held in abeyance pending the step five determination. On December 16, 1992, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s ruling and entered an order staying, the application for attorneys\u2019 fees until the outcome on remand. Kershaw now appeals the district court\u2019s order staying her application for attorneys\u2019 fees. We dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-2\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">At the time the district court ruled that Kershaw was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d, its decision followed then-existing precedent <em>Bertrand v. Sullivan, </em>976 F.2d 977, 979 (5th Cir.1992). <em>See also Sullivan v. Hudson, </em>490 U.S. 877, 886, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 2254-55, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989) (\u201c[Wjhere a court\u2019s remand to the agency for further administrative proceedings does not necessarily dictate the receipt of benefits, the claimant will not normally attain \u2018prevailing party<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> status within the meaning of \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) until after the result of the administrative proceedings is known.\u201d). The Supreme Court, however, has since ruled that a party obtaining a \u201csentence four\u201d judgment reversing the Secretary\u2019s denial of benefits is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) regardless of the outcome on remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Shalala v. Schaefer, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014,\u2014, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 2631-32, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993). Although <em>Schaefer </em>likely renders the district court\u2019s stay order improper, we are without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because the order is interlocutory and is not within a recognized exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">I. Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">For this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction, we must first determine whether the district court\u2019s order staying Kershaw\u2019s EAJA motion was a final appealable judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ment for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An order staying judicial proceedings is ordinarily not considered final and is hence not ap-pealable. <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 10 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 927, 934 n. 10, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). Kershaw argues that the district court\u2019s order is appealable under the exception stated in <em>Moses Cone </em>for situations in which the \u201cstay order amounts to a dismissal of the suit\u201d because it will put the party \u201ceffectively out of court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 103 S.Ct. at 934. The narrow holding in <em>Moses Cone, </em>however, does not encompass the present stay order. In <em>Moses Cone, </em>the Court held that \u201ca stay order is final when the sole purpose and effect of the stay are precisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to a <em>state </em>court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11 n. 11,103 S.Ct. at 934 n. 11 (emphasis added). Because \u201carbitrability was the only substantive issue present in the federal suit ... a stay of the federal suit pending resolution of the state suit meant that there could be no further -litigation in the federal forum; the state court\u2019s judgment on the issue would be res judicata.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 103 S.Ct. at 934. This result would not occur, and hence the <em>Moses Cone </em>exception should not apply, where a district court enters an order staying its own proceedings in favor of other proceedings within the same federal judicial system. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. Neches Butane Products Co., </em>704 F.2d 144, 151 (5th Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cMoses Cone </em>was unique because the district court\u2019s <em>Colorado River </em>stay order put the plaintiff \u2018effectively out of court\u2019 and kept the means for returning to court entirely beyond the plaintiff\u2019s control.\u201d). The eventual decision of the Secretary will be fully reviewable by the district court, and that court\u2019s decision will be fully reviewable by this Court. Thus, unlike certain abstention stay orders, the present order does not deprive the plaintiff of an effective appeal in a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">II. Collateral Order Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We also consider whether the district court\u2019s order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine despite its lack of finality. In order to be reviewable under this doctrine, an order must meet four requirements: (1) The order must finally dispose of an issue so that the district court\u2019s decision may not be characterized as tentative, informal or incomplete; (2) the question must be serious and unsettled; (3) the order must be separable from, and collateral to, the merits of the principle case; and (4) there must be a risk of important and irreparable loss if an immediate appeal is not heard because the order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468-69, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. Kerrville Bus Co., Inc., </em>925 F.2d 129, 134 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Acosta v. Tenneco Oil Co., </em>913 F.2d 205, 207-08 (5th Cir.1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Absent a <em>Moses Cone </em>situation, stay orders rarely satisfy these requirements, and therefore, are usually not reviewable as collateral orders. The present stay order is no exception. First, the district court\u2019s order could certainly be characterized as tentative and incomplete. In <em>Coopers v. Lybrand, </em>for instance, the Court characterized a district court\u2019s order as \u201cinherently tentative\u201d where the order could be \u201caltered or amended before the decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>437 U.S. at 469 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. at 2458 n. 11. The present order does not prevent Kershaw from recovering her fees for the charges incurred in gaining the sentence four remand; rather it directs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>her to \u201cfile an updated application for attorney\u2019s fees within 30 days of the final decision of the Secretary if the plaintiff is a \u2018prevailing party* on remand.\u201d Given that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent ruling in <em>Schaefer </em>indicates that Kershaw may already qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d, a motion for reconsideration (accompanying an updated application for fees) may be appropriate to allow the district court to \u201calter or amend\u201d its order in light of <em>Schaefer. </em>In addition, there is no risk of irreparable loss because the Secretary\u2019s final decision on remand will be reviewable as a final order. The only harm Kershaw could claim is a delay in the recovery of her fees. Such a loss is insufficient to warrant interlocutory review. <em>Cf. Shipes v. Trinity Indus. Inc., </em>883 F.2d 339 (5th Cir.1989) (finding that an order granting interim attorneys\u2019 fees did not satisfy the collateral order doctrine because the order could be effectively reviewed upon entry of final judgment); <em>Kerrville Bus, </em>925 F.2d at 135 (finding that the added expense of litigation does not constitute an irreparable harm). <em>See also Marler v. Adonis Health Products, </em>997 F.2d 1141 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">III. Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">When a district court for a legally erroneous reason refuses to act on a matter properly before it, mandamus is generally the appropriate remedy. Here, however, the district court\u2019s stay of the fee application was in accord with the law of this circuit at the time, and the court did not have the benefit of <em>Schaefer. </em>There is no reason to believe that the district court, on proper application, will not reconsider its earlier stay in light of <em>Schaefer. </em>In such circumstances, mandamus at this stage would appear inappropriate. In any event, no application for mandamus has been filed. <em>See Neches Butane, </em>704 F.2d at 151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">This Court lacks jurisdiction of the instant appeal and the appeal is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-13\">. The Secretary evaluates disability claims under the Social Security Act through a five-step process: (1) Is the claimant currently working? (2) Can the impairment be classified as severe? (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Does the impairment meet or equal a listed impairment in Appendix One of the Secretary's regulations? (in which case, disability is automatic) (4) Can the claimant perform her previous relevant work? and (5) Is there other work available in the national economy that the claimant can perform? 20 C.F.R. 404.1520, 416.920 (1992). In the present case, the Secretary determined that (1) Kershaw had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since 1986; (2) she had severe polymyositis; (3) she did not have an impairment listed in Appendix One; but (4) she was able to perform her previous relevant work. Once the Secretary determined that Kershaw did not satisfy step four, she terminated her review and denied benefits without the need to consider step five. 20 C.F.R. 404.1520(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-5\">. Sentence four of section 405(g) provides: \"The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">. In <em>Bertrand </em>this Court reviewed a similar appeal of a district court order staying an EAJA motion for attorneys' fees pending resolution of the administrative proceedings on remand. We do not consider our exercise of jurisdiction in <em>Bertrand </em>to constitute a binding precedent, however, because the jurisdictional issue was neither raised by the parties nor addressed by the Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 38, 73 S.Ct. 67, 69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952) ( ... \"this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed <em>sub silentio\u201d </em>(footnote omitted, citing numerous cases)); <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Auto Transp., </em>S.A., 763 F.2d 745, 750 n. 10 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>755 F.2d 1138, 1145 n. 14 (5th Cir.1985). <em>See also United States v. Mitchell, </em>271 U.S. 9, 11-15, 46 S.Ct. 418, 419-20, 70 L.Ed. 799 (1926). <em>Cf. Norton v. Mathews, </em>427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976) (stating that \"there is no need to decide the theoretical question of jurisdiction ... when the case alternatively could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same party\u201d); <em>Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Jaclcson, </em>862 F.2d 491, 496-97 n. 8 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc) (electing not to resolve a difficult issue of jurisdiction because the same result would be reached on the merits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-4\">. The lower court in <em>Moses Cone </em>issued the stay pursuant to the abstention doctrine first announced in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). This Circuit has also found the <em>Moses Cone </em>exception to apply to cases involving Burford-type abstention, <em>Barnhardt Marine Ins. v. New England Int'l Surety of America, Inc., </em>961 F.2d 529, 531 (5th Cir.1992), as well as federal court abstention under the <em>Younger </em>doctrine. <em>Allen v. Louisiana State Board of Dentistry, </em>835 F.2d 100 (5th Cir.1988). Each of these abstention doctrines leads to a common result \u2014 the resolution of the state case necessarily terminates the federal case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\">. There may be some question whether the second requirement is still viable. <em>See Marler v. Adonis Health Products, </em>997 F.2d 1141, 1143 (5th Cir.1993). We need not resolve that issue here, as we do not rely on this requirement in holding the order in question not within the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
