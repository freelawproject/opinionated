Shiver, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the government in his employment discrimination suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, and Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791. Specifically, the district court found that Shiver\u2019s complaint was untimely because the charging period began on December 3, 2004, when Shiver learned that he was going to be demoted. Shiver contests the district court\u2019s finding and claims that his administrative complaint was timely filed on January 5, 2005, when he learned that his demotion had become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard used by the district court. <em>Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Ga., </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1242 (11th Cir.2001). We draw all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 1243. Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of production. <em>Fickling v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2007). If the moving party meets this burden, \u201cthe nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSpeculation does not create a <em>genuine </em>issue of fact.\u201d <em>Cordoba v. Dillard\u2019s, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). As the Supreme Court stated, \u201cthe plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>guage of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-15\">\u201cThe [Rehabilitation] Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating in employment against otherwise qualified individuals with a disability.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Crowell, </em>228 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791(g), 794a. The remedies, procedures, and rights of Title VII are available to plaintiffs filing complaints under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-16\">Under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, federal employees are required to initiate administrative review of any alleged discriminatory or retaliatory conduct with the appropriate agency within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory act. <em>See id.; </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1); <em>see also Mullins, </em>228 F.3d at 1310-11 (applying the 45-day exhaustion requirement to federal employees raising claims under the Rehabilitation Act). When the discriminatory act results in a personnel action, the employee must contact an EEO counselor \u201cwithin 45 days of the effective date of the action.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). The EEOC \u201cshall extend the 45-day limit ... when the individual shows ... that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have [ ] known that the ... personnel action occurred.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(2). Generally, when the claimant does not initiate contact within the 45-day charging period, the claim is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant failed to establish that the plaintiff did not initiate contact within the 45-day charging period).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">In this case, the record demonstrates that Shiver contacted an EEO counselor within 45 days of January 5, 2005, which was the date that he learned that his demotion had become effective. Thus, we conclude that his administrative complaint was timely, and, therefore, the district court erred in finding that Shiver\u2019s action was time-barred. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the government and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
