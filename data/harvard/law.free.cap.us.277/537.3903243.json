S. 449, it was held that the right of a partnership association limited organized under the laws of Pennsylvania to sue in the federal court was dependent upon the citizenship of its shareholders. This organization possessed far more of the characteristics of a corporation than the trust here in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-7\">The contract here sued upon was made in the course of interstate commerce and is entitled to recognition and enforcement by Michigan under the Commerce Clause. The not\u00e9 was given by the defendant in error for the assignment to her of certain notes for automobile trucks which had been sold by the Orloff Company to the Trust and the delivery to her of five of the six trucks covered by the paper. The Commercial Investment Trust at no time rented an office in Michigan; it never had a bank account, furniture, equipment; etc., of any kind in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>State. It commenced to purchase Michigan automobile paper in May 1919.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-4\">Not only did.the instructions themselves require that the notes, contracts, etc., be sent to New York for acceptance or rejection, but all of these documents and papers contained in the record show that this practice was invariably followed. Every transaction betwefen the Orloff Company and the Trust was- examined, and without exception the papers were sent with accompanying letter from the Orloff' Company to the Trust at New York; after investigation and acceptance the payments in the form of drafts on a New York bank or trust company were sent from the Trust there to the Orloff Company at Detroit. The only deviation from this course was that on one occasion, on Orloff\u2019s request for expedition, the Trust, after passing on the papers, sent payment by telegraph from -New York' to the Orloff Company\u2019s bank at Detroit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-5\">The essence of the trust dealing then was that automobile dealers, and later a discount company in Michigan, sent certain automobile paper to the Trust at New York, offering it for sale.

See <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>185 Mass. 202; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>215 Mass. 1, and cases cited; <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>219 Mass. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">It was held by the court below that the Trust must' be regarded as a corporation within intendment of the Michigan statutes which could not lawfully carry on local business within the State or make valid contracts in connection therewith without having complied with prescribed requirements. There was no attempt to comply therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Plaintiff in error insists that, as construed by the Supreme Court, the statutes of Michigan deny to the trustees, collectively called <em>\u201c </em>Commercial Investment Trust,\u201d the benefits of Section 2, Article IV, of the Constitution. \u201c The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d Also that they deprive the trustees of property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and restrain interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">It is settled doctrine that a corporation organized under the laws of one state may not carry on local business within another without the latter\u2019s permission, either express or implied. A corporation is not a mere collection of individuals capable of claiming all benefits assured them by Section 2, Article TV, of .the Constitution. <em>Bank of Augusta </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>13 Peters 519, 584, 586, 587; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>8 Wall. 168; <em>Western Turf Association </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>204 U. S. 359, 363. See also <em>Slaughter House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, 77. In the first of the causes just cited, Chief Justice Taney, for the Court, said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\u201c It is true, that in the case referred to, [<em>United States Bank </em>v. <em>Deveaux, </em>5 Cranch 61] this Court decided that in a question of jurisdiction they might look to the char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>acter of the persons composing a corporation; and if it appeared that they were citizens of another state, and the fact was set forth by proper averments, the corporation might sue in its corporate name in the courts of the United States. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201c But the principle has never been extended any farther than it was carried in that case; and has never been supposed to extend to contracts made by a corporation; especially in another sovereignty. If it were held to embrace contracts, and that .the members of a corporation were to be regarded as individuals carrying on business in their corporate name, and therefore entitled to the privileges of citizens, in matters of contract, it is very clear that they must at the same time take upon themselves the liabilities of citizens, and be bound by their-contracts in like manner. The result of this would be to make a corporation a mere partnership in business, in which each stockholder would be liable to the whole extent of his property for the debts of the corporation; and he might be sued for them, in any state in which he might happen to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">\u201cThe clause of the Constitution referred to certainly never intended to give to the citizens of each state the privileges of citizens in the several states, and at the same time to exempt them from the liabilities which the exercise of such privileges would bring, upon individuals who were citizens of the state. This would be to give the citizens of other states far higher and greater privileges than are enjoyed by the citizens of the state itself. Besides, it would deprive every state of all control over the extent of corporate franchises proper to be granted in the state; and corporations would be chartered in one, to carry on their operations in another. It is impossible upon any sound principle to give such a construction to the article in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\u201cWhenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity; of the artificial being created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>by the charter; and not the contract of the individual members. The only rights it can claim are the rights which are given to it in that character, and not the rights which belong to its members as citizens of a state; and we now proceed to inquire what rights the plaintiffs in error, a corporation created by Georgia, could lawfully exercise in another state; and whether the purchase of the bill of exchange on which this suit is brought was a valid contract\", and obligatory on the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Obviously the Trust here involved, is a creature of local law which demands the privilege of carrying on business in Michigan as an association \u2014 an entity \u2014 clothed with peculiar rights and privileges under a deed of settlement undertaking to exempt all of the associates from personal liability. As in the case of a corporation, and for the same general reasons, it cannot rely upon rights guaranteed to the individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Whether a given association is called' a corporation, partnership, or trust, is not the essential factor in determining the powers of a state concerning it. The real nature of the organization must be considered. If clothed with the ordinary functions and attributes of a corporation, it is subject to similar treatment. This was distinctly pointed out in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>The Liverpool &amp; London Life &amp; Fire Ins. Co., </em>100 Mass. 531, affirmed here <em>sub nom. Liverpool Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>10 Wall. 566. See also <em>Flint, </em>v. <em>Stone-Tracy Co., </em>220 U. S. 107, 162; <em>Hecht </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>265 U.
