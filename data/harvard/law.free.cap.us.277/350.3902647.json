They are numerous, and it requires no great' amount of capital to start new ones. Nineteen States have established competitive free state employment agencies, and in at. least seven others there are municipal agencies. An organization has been established called the \u201cAmerican Association of Public Employment Offices,\u201d which is seeking to put the private agencies out of business. . These facts appear in the publications'utilized by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is in his dissenting opinion in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Tanner, supra. </em>Business schools, trade schools, Y. M. C. A\u2019s, Y. W. C. A\u2019s, college bureaus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>typewriter companies, and bar associations, maintain agencies, while the \u201c want <em>\u201d </em>columns of newspapers contribute an entirely different kind of competition. It is also a well-known fact that the labor unions of the country .frequently conduct employment, offices, and that many large employers of labor secure their recruits through established employment departments. Under these conditions, it appears that the business of an employment agency is distinctly a private business of a highly competitive nature, with no. known tendencies toward monopoly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">From the very nature of the business, there cannot be any, uniformity in respect of the conditions under which it.is carried on. An attempt to .establish a uniform fee for the more valuable service and the less valuable service, without regard to the expenses of overhead \u2014 which make possible the. more valuable service \u2014 would seem to be hopelessly impracticable, within the limits of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">In a business like insurance, each singl\u00e9 insurance contract is not a single and separate transaction, but is so involved that it affects the whole or a large part of the entire mass of insurance transactions. That is not true of employment agencies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">Employment agencies \u2014 and emphatically those dealing with clerical, engineering and executive positions \u2014 are certainly not as much' affected with a public interest as wages and rentals; and this Court has held that- price-fixing is not a valid exercise of the legislative power' in those businesses, except temporarily in case of emergencies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJW\"><em>Mr. Harry R.

S. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">In the above cases, this Court, in effect, held that, the right to regulate rates or; fees depended upon the necessity of so doing in order properly to regulate the business itself. In at least twenty-one States the amount of fee which may be charged is controlled either by fixing a specified fee for the service or limiting the charge to a percentage of the wages. It would thus appear that the regulation of the fee has been found essential to regulating the business. All of these States have, in effect, de-, dared not only that the business has superimposed upon it a public interest requiring its regulation, but also that that public interest necessitates that the fees charged should be reasonable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">It can scarcely be argued that the action of the New Jersey legislature in limiting ,these fees was either unwise or arbitrary, in view of the nature of the business and the abuses which might result from unlimited charges.

A penalty is imposed for failure, to do so.\u2018 The application for such license must be made in writing to tjie Commissioner of Labor and, among other requirements, the applicant must <em>\u201c </em>file with the Commissioner of Labor, for his approval, a schedule of, fee's .proposed t\u00f3 be charged for any services rendered to employers seeking employees, and persons seeking employment, and all charges must conform thereto. The schedule of fees may be changed only with the approval of the Commissioner of Labor.\u201d The Commissioner of Labor may refuse to issue or may revoke any license for any good cause shown within the meaning and purpose of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiff in error fijfed with the state Commissioner of Labor a written application for' \u00e1 license to conduct an employment agency. All conditions of the statute were complied with; but the commissioner rejected the application upon the sole ground that, in his opinion, the fees proposed to be charged in respect of certain permanent positions were excessive and unreasonable. This action of the commissioner was brought up for review to the supreme cburt of the state, and that court construing the statute\u2019 as empowering 'the commissioner to fix and limit the charges to be made by the applicant,, nevertheless sustained at as constitutional under the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 4 N. J. Mis. R. 623. .Upon appeal to the state court, of errors.and appeals, the judgment, w^ affirmed.., 103 N. J. L. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>That the state has power to require a license and regulate the business of an employment agent does not admit of doubt. But the question here presented is whether the due process of law clause is contravened by the legislation attempting to confer upon the Commissioner of Labor power to fix the prices which the employment agent shall charge for his services. The question calls for an answer under the last of the three categories set forth by this Court in <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, </em>262 U. S. 522, 535, that is to say: Has the business in question been devoted to the public use and an interest in effect granted to the public in that use? Or, in other words, is. the business one \u201c affected with a public interest,\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as heretofore defined by this Court? As was recently pointed out in <em>Tyson &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Banton, </em>273 U. S. 418, 430, the phrase is not capable of exact definition; but, nevertheless, under all the decisions of this Court from <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, it is the standard by which the validity of price-fixing legislation, in respect of a business like that here under consideration, must.be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In the <em>Tyson </em>case it was said (p. 430) that the interest' meant was not \u201c such as arises from the mere fact that the public derives benefit, accommodation, ease or enjoyment from the existence or operation of the business; and while the word has not always been limited narrowly as strictly denoting \u2018 a right,\u2019 that synonym more nearly than any other expresses the sense in which it is to be understood.\u201d The business must be such (p. 434) \u201c as to justify the conclusion that it has been <em>devoted </em>to a public use and its use thereby, in effect, <em>granted </em>to the public.\u201d And again (p. 438) after reviewing former decisions, it was said that ' \u201c each of the decisions of this court upholding governmental price regulation, aside from cases involving legislation to tide over temporary emergencies, has turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration, which bore such a substantial and definite relation to the public interest as to justify an indulgence of the legal fiction of a grant by the owner to the public of an interest in the use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, supra, </em>p. 537, it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201c It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the Constitution, that the business of the-butcher, or the baker, the tailor,.the wood chopper, the mining operator or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by State regulation. . . .. one does not devote one\u2019s property or business to the public use or clothe it with a public interest merely because one makes commodities for, and sells to, the public in the common callings of which those above mentioned are instances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital, </em>261 U. S. 525, this Court had under consideration an act of Congress fixing minimum wages for women and children in the District of Columbia. The legislation, so far as it affected women, was held invalid as contravening the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it was an arbitrary interference with the right to contract in respect of terms of private employment. It was said (p. 546) that while there was no such thing as absolute freedom of contract,', nevertheless, freedom of contract was the general rule and restraint the exception; and that \u201cthe exercise of legislative authority to abridge if can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The business of securing employment for those seeking work and employees for those seeking workers is essentially that of a broker, that is, of an intermediary. While we do not undertake to say that there may not be a deeper concern , on the part of the public in the business of an employment agency, that, business does not differ in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>stantial character from the business of a real estate broker, ship broker, merchandise broker or ticket broker. In the <em>Tyson </em>case, <em>supra, </em>we declared unconstitutional \u00e1n act of the New York legislature which sought to fix the price at'which theatre tickets should be sold by a ticket broker, and it is not easy to see how, without disregarding that decision, price-fixing legislation in respect of other brokers of like character can be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">An employment agency is essentially a private business. True, it deals with the public, but so do the druggist, the butcher, the baker, the grocer, and the apartment or tenement house owner and the broker who acts as intermediary between such owner and his tenants. Of course, anything which substantially interferes with employment is a matter of public concern, but in the same sense that interference with the procurement of food and housing and fuel are of public concern. The public is de\u00e9ply interested in all these things. The welfare of its. constituent members depends upon them. The interest of the public in the matter of employment is not different in quality or character from its interest in the other things enumerated; but in none of them is the interest that \u201cpublic interest <em>\u201d </em>which the law contemplates as the basis for legislative price control. <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, supra, </em>p. 536. Under the decisions of this Court it is no longer fairly open to question that, at least in the absence of a grave.emergency, <em>Tyson &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>pp. 431, 437, the fixing of prices for food or clothing, of house rental or of wages to be paid, whether minimum or maximum, is beyond the legislative power. And we perceive no reason for applying a different rule in the case of legislation controlling prices to be paid for services rendered in securing a place for an employee or an employee for a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\"><em>Brazee </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>241 U. S. 340, cited by defendant in error lends no support to the judgment below. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>case involved the validity of \u00e1 Michigan statute in respect of employment agencies. Section 5 of the act attempted to limit the fees which should be charged. ' The state supreme court held that the business was one properly subject to police regulation and control, but did not rule concerning the validity of. \u00a7 5. This Court held that it was within the power of the state to require licenses for employment agencies and prescribe reasonable regulations to be enforced by the Commissioner of Labor. But it. was said (p. 344):</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">. \u201c Provisions of \u00a7 5 in respect of fees to be demanded or retained are severable from other portions of the act and, we think, might be eliminated without destroying it. Their validity was not passed upon by the Supreme Court of the State and has not been considered by us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">And we since have held definitely that the power to require a license for and to regulate the conduct of a business is distinct from the power to fix prices. \u201cThe latter power is not only a more definite and serious invasion of the rights of property and. the freedom of contract, but its exercise cannot .always be justified by circumstances which have been held to justify legislative regulation of the manner in which a business shall be carried on.\u201d <em>Tyson &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>p. 431; and see pp. 440-441.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">To urge that extortion, fraud, imposition, discrimination \u2022and the like have been practiced to some, or to a great, extent in connection with the business here under consideration, or that the business is one lending itself peculiarly to such evils, is simply to restate grounds already fully considered by this Court. These are grounds for regulation but not for price fixing, as we have already definitely decided. <em>Tyson &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>442-445.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">There are a number of states which have statutes like that now under consideration, and we are asked to give weight to that circumstance. It is to be observed, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ever, that with the exception of the decision now under review none of these, statutes has been judicially considered, except in the State of California, where the legislation was declared unconstitutional. <em>Ex parte Dickey, </em>144 Cal. 234; <em>In re Smith, </em>193 Cal. 337. And it was said in oral argument, and not disputed, that, while legislation of this character existed in several states, generally it was not enforced, in some instances because the state\u2019s attorney-general had advised that the legislation was unconstitutional. In any event, under all the circumstances, and in the face of our prior decisions, we do not regard the mere existence in other states of statutory provisions like the one now under review as entitled to persuasive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b397-6\">Mr. Justice Sanford,</author>\n<p id=\"Ags\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">I concur in this result upon the controlling authority of <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Banton, </em>273 U.

As the case is presented we must take it that the New Jersey Commissioner of Labor was right in holding that Ribnik\u2019s list of fees was unreasonably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Under the decisions of this Court not all price regulation, as distinguished from other forms of regulation, is forbidden. As those decisions have been\u2019 explained^ price regulation is within the constitutional power of a state legislature when the business concerned is \u201c affected with a public interest.\u201d That phrase is not to be found in the Constitution. Concededly it is incapable of any precise definition. It has and can have only such meaning as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>may be given to it by the decisions of this Court. As I read those decisions, such regulation is within a state\u2019s power whenever any combination of . circumstances seriously curtails the regulative force of competition, so' that buyers or sellers'are placed at such a disadvantage in the bargaining struggle that a legislature might reasonably anticipate serious consequences to the community as a whole. <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113; <em>Brass v. Stoeser, </em>153 U. S, 391; <em>German Alliance Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>233 U. S. 389, 409; <em>Terminal Taxicab Co. </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>241 U.

S. 242; see also <em>Knoxville Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Harbison, </em>183 U. S. 13; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>211 U. S. 539; <em>Mutual Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Martell, </em>222 U. S. 225; <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>United States, </em>157 U. S. 160. The price regulation may embrace businesses \u201cwhich though not- public in their inception may fairly be said-to, have risen to be such and have become-subject in consequence to some governmental regulation.\u201d <em>Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, </em>262 U. S. 522, 535. The use by the public generally of the specific thing or business affected is not the test. The nature of the service rendered, the exorbitance of the charges and the arbitrary control to which the public may be subjected without, regulation,- are elements to be considered in determining whether the \u201c public interest\u201d exists. <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court\\ swpra, </em>538. The economic disadvantage of a class and the attempt to ameliorate its condition may alone, be sufficient to give rise to the \u201c public' interest \u201d and to justify the regulation of coiitracts with its members, <em>Knoxville Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Harbison, supra; McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra; Mutual Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Martell, supra, </em>and obviously circumstances may so change in poipt of time <em>pv. </em>so differ in space as to clothe a business with such an interest which at other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>times or in other places would be a matter purely of private concern. <em>Block </em>v. <em>Hirsh, supra, </em>155.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">I' cannot say <em>a priori </em>that the business of employment agencies in New Jersey lacks the requisite \u201c public interest.\u201d We are judicially aware that the .problem of unemployment is of grave public concern; that the cqnduct of the employment agency business bears an important relationship, to that larger problem and affects vitally the lives of great numbers of the population, not only in New Jersey but throughout the United States; that employment agencies, admittedly subject to regulation in othei; respects, <em>Brazee </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>241 U. S. 340, and in fact very generally regulated, deal with a necessitous class, the members of which are often dependent on them for opportunity to. earn a livelihood, are not free to move from place to place, and are often under exceptional economic compulsion to accept such terms as the agencies offer. We are not judicially ignorant of what all human experience teaches, that those so situated are peculiarly the prey of the unscrupulous and designing. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>244 U. S. 590, a statute of Washington which in effect attempted to abolish the business was held unconstitutional because employment agencies were deemed not \u201c inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare,\u201d but, as was there emphasized, capable, under regulation, of being conducted in a useful and honest manner. But it was not questioned that the business was subject to grave abuses, involving frauds and impositions upon a peculiarly helpless class, among which the exaction of exorbitant fees was perhaps the' least offensive. The Supreme Court of New Jersey,- in an opinion in the present case which was adopted by the Court of Errors and Appeals, said: \u201c It is common knowledge that an employment agency is a business dealing with a great body of our population, native and foreign born, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>susceptible to imposition, deception'and immoral influences. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA4I\">In dealing with the. question of power to require reasonable prices in this particular business, we should remember what was specifically pointed out by the- Court in <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Banton, </em>273 U. S. 418, 438, that.whether a business is affected with a \u201c public interest \u201d turns \u201c upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration.\u201d In the respects mentioned, or most of them, and in others to be pointed out, it seems to me that there is a marked difference between the character of this business and that of real estate brokers, ship brokers, mechandise brokers, and, more than all, of ticket brokers, who were involved in <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Banton, supra. </em>There the attempt was made to limit the advance which brokers might charge over box office prices for theatre tickets, an expedient adopted to break up their monopolistic control of a luxury, not a necessity. Those affected by the practices of the ticket brokers constituted a relatively small part of the population within a comparatively small area of the State of New York. They were not necessitous* The consequences of the fraud and extortion practiced upon them were not visited upon the community as a whole in any such manner as are fraud and imposition practiced upon workers seeking employment. Here the effort is made, as in <em>Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, supra; McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra; Mutual Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Martell, supra; Erie R. R. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>233 U. S. 685, first, to protect from abuses a. class unable to protect itself, for whose welfare the police power has often been allowed broad play, and, second, to mitigate the evil's which unemployment brings upon the community as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Some presumption should be indulged that the New Jersey legislature had an adequate knowledge of such local conditions as the circumstances of those seeking employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ment, the number and distribution of employment agencies; the local efficacy of competition, the prevalent practices with respect to fees. On this deserved respect for the judgment of the local lawmaker depends, of course, the presumption in favor of constitutionality, for the validity of a regulation turns \u201c upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to 'the business under consideration.\u201d <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>438. Moreover, we should not, when the matter is not clear, oppose our notion of the seriousness of the problem' or the necessity of the legislation to that of local tribunals. \u201c This Court, by an unbroken line of decisions from Chief Justice Marshall to the present day, has steadily adhered to the rule that every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of an act of Congress until overcome beyond rational doubt.\u201d <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital, </em>261 U. S. 525, 544. And the enactments of state legislatures are entitled to no less respect. - If, therefore, our consideration of the general conditions surrounding employment agencies, which it was thought in <em>Brazee </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>made them subject to. regulation, was to go no further than that of the Court, I should still have \u2019 supposed that plaintiff in error had not sustained the burden which rests on him to show that this law is unconstitutional. <em>Erie R. R. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra. </em>But even if the presumption is not to\"be indulged, and the burden no longer to be cast on him who attacks the constitutionality of a law, we need not close our eyes to available data throwing light oh the problem with which the legislature had to deal. See <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>208 U. S. 412, 420-421; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>549.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">For thirty years or more the evils found to be connected with the business of employment agencies in the United States have been the subject of repeated investigations, official' and unofficial, and of extensive public comment. They have been the primary reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>establishment of public employment offices in the various States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Quite apart from the other evils laid at the door of the private agencies,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the data supplied by these investigations and reports afford a 'substantial basis for the conclusion of the New Jersey legislature that the busin\u00e9ss is peculiarly subject to abuses relating <em>to </em>fee-charging, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that for the correction of these the restriction to a reasonable maximum charge is the only effective remedy. These data, tobe gathered from numerous independent and public investigations, may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>First. </em>They show that the agencies, left to themselves, very generally charge extortionate fees. The Commission on Industrial Relations, created by Act of August 23, 1912, c. 351, 37 Stat. 415, reported to Congress at a time when prices were materially lower than today, <em>\u201c Fees </em>are often charged out of all proportion to the service rendered. We know of cases where $5, $9, $10, and even $16 a piece has been paid for jobs at common labor. In one city the fees paid by scrubwomen is at the rate of $24 a year for their poorly paid work.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exorbitant fees are taken- for merely registering the applicants, no effort whatever being made to find them work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To stimulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the payment of such fees the agencies advertise for classes of laborers for whom no jobs are available.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the Massachusetts Commission to Investigate Employment Offices, the ordinary forces of' competition seem powerless to prevent or remedy this situation, because but little capital is required to open an office, and because the clients of the agencies are constantly new.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Second.\"These data show that the fees charged are often discriminatory. It is made known in slack season that but few jobs are available and that to these will be referred the applicants who tender the larger \u201c extra fees \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>or \u201cpresents.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is ground for the belief that this is a particular danger in New Jersey, for a large proportion of its agencies specialize in employees for hotels and resorts where the positions are seasonal and temporary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The whole supply of labor must, at the. beginning and again at the end of the season, search for new positions at the same time.-</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><em>Third. </em>Fee-splitting has been a recurrent subject of complaint. It \u201c is frequently practiced, part of the fee charged to the worker being paid over by the private employment agent to the employer or his foreman. This practice is closely akin to job selling by foremen and superintendents. . . . Both \u2018 fee-splitting \u2019 and \u2018 job-selling \u2019 result in short time employment and frequent discharges, for each time a job is filled a new fee is \u2018 split \u2019 or a fresh price exacted. The resultant wastage from accelerated labor turnover, from extortionate and multiplied fees, from demoralization of workers, from unemployment and irregularity of. employment is incalculably great.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Public Employment Offices in the United States, U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin No. 241 (1918) p. 6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While their fees are unregulated, the private agencies are free to charge those seeking employment enough to cover both the charge for their service and the gratuity paid to the foreman or employer. A legislature would certainly not be unreasonable in concluding that the fixing of a reasonable maximum fee was the appropriate ,and only effective method 'of assuring private agencies fair compensation while preventing them from abuses of this character:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>It is reported that at times of widespread unemployment the private agencies are known to raise their fees out of all proportion to the reasonable value of their services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is a public interest at such times in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>bringing about a prompt readjustment of the labor supply to industry\u2019s need for labor. The additional barrier to a quick readjustment created by the agencies\u2019 raising of their rates affects that interest adversely. The establishment of a reasonable maximum rate<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is well calculated to obviate the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><em>Fifth. </em>Finally, it is pointed out that the private agencies charge the employee and do not charge the employer for a service that is rendered to both. The convenience of being furnished with employees is similar to that of being directed to a-position; but less effort is required to collect compensation for the whole service from the employee alone. His necessities are normally greater. His bargaining power is normally weaker. The setting of a maximum fee need not mean \u2014 in New,Jersey, does not mean \u2014 that an absolute limit' is placed on the agency\u2019s return. The agency may still charge the employer in addition for such service as is rendered to him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The establishment of reasonable fees is thus, in one aspect, merely a method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>providing that the patrons of the agency shall be required to pay only for the service rendered to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Legislation for the correction of these and other evils has been general throughout the United States.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>' Among the earliest comprehensive schemes for that purpose was the Act of June 19, 1906, c. 3438, 34 Stat. 304, adopted by Congress for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ous classes of employees (including all domestic servants and farm help) it regulates (\u00a78) not only the fee which may be charged to the applicant for work, but also the amount that the agency may receive from the employer. It requires a refund of half (he fee if a fair opportunity for work is riot secured in four days, and a refund of the whole fee and transportation expenses if no employment of the kind asked was vacant at the place to which the applicant was directed.-</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Among.the states, twenty-one have limited the total fees that may be charged, - ten by fixing a stated maxi-' mum,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and .eleven by restricting the charge- to a named percentage of the salary earned during some period.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>. In eight states the maximum registration fee is fixed by statute, and that fee is required to be returned .if rio work is found for the applicant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In seventeen states if no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>work is furnished the agency must return the entire fee collected.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ae8b\">It is of course true that the enactment of a particular type of legislation, even though general, and a widespread and competent opinion that it is wise and necessary, do not establish its constitutionality. But that such legislation has been enacted and continued in force over considerable periods of time and in widely separated areas, and is supported by a concurrence of informed opinion, may not be disregarded in determining, first, whether the conditions peculiar to the business under consideration make it one in which, as in insurance companies, there is a paramount public concern; and, second, whether the regulation adopted is reasonably calculated to safeguard that interest. See <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Oregon, supra, </em>420-421; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Examination of the various reports of public bodies and the legislation referred to can, I think, leave no\" doubt that the practices of the private agencies with respect to their fees presented a problem for legislative consideration different from any other' that this Court has passed on in ruling on the power to regulate prices, but certainly more akin to that in <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>and <em>German Alliance Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas, supra, </em>than to that in <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>and, unless we are to establish once and for all the rule that only public utilities may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>regulated as to price, the validity of the statute at hand would seem to me to be beyond doubt. Certainly it would 'be difficult to show a. greater necessity for price regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"A-qm\">It is said that if there be abuses in this business, the business may be regulat\u00e9d but not by the fixing of reasonable prices, and that that was decided in <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Bynton, supra. </em>So far as the significant facts in that case are concerned, it bears little resemblance to this one. Ticket brokers and employment brokers are similar in name: in no other respect do they seem alike to me. To overcharge a man for the privilege of hearing the opera is one thing; to control the possibility of his earning a livelihood would appear to be quite another. And I shall not stop to argue that the state has a larger interest in seeing that its workers find employment without being imposed upon, than in seeing that its citizens are entertained. Here, too, if the business is subject to regulation, as seems to be admitted, the regulation which is appropriate and effective is some curtailment of the. exorbitant fees charged and not some other form of control which would have no tendency to. correct the evils aimed at.</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">I, cannot accept as valid the distinction on which the opinion of the majority seems to me necessarily to-depend, that granted constitutional power to regulate there is any controlling difference between reasonable regulation of price, if appropriate to the evil to be remedied, and other forms of appropriate regulation which curtail liberty of contractor .{the use and enjoyment of property. Obviously, even in the case of -,businesses affeeted with a public interest, other control than price regulation may be appropriate, and price regulation may be so inappropriate -as to be arbitrary or unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional. T\u00f3 me. it seems equally obvious that the Constitution does not require, us fp hold that a busi ness, subject to every other form of reasonable regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>is immune from the requirement of reasonable prices, where that requirement is the only remedy appropriate to the evils encountered. In this respect I can see no difference between a reasonable regulation of prica and a reasonable regulation of the use. of property, which affects its prices or economic return. The. privilege of contract and the free use of property are as 'seriously cut down in the one case as in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">To say that there is constitutional power to regulate a business or a particular use of property because of the public interest in the welfare of a class peculiarly affected, and to deny such power to regulate price for the accomplishment of the same end, when fhat alone appears to be an appropriate and effective remedy, is to make- a distinction based, on no real economic difference, and for which I can find no warrant in the Constitution itself nor any justification in th\u00e9 opinions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The price paid for property or services is only one of the terms in a bargain; the effect on the parties is similar whether the restriction on the power to contract affects the price, or the goods or services sold. Apart from the cases involving the historic public-callings, immemorially subject to the closest regulation, this Court has sustained regulations of the price in cases where the legislature fixed the charges which grain el\u00e9vators, <em>Brass </em>v. <em>Stoeser, supra; Budd </em>v. <em>New York, </em>143 U. S. 517, and insurance' companies might make, <em>German Alliance Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas, supra; </em>or required miners to be paid per ton of coal unscreened instead of. screened, <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra; Rail Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio Industrial Commission, </em>236 U. S. 338; or required employers who paid their men in store orders to redeem them in cash, <em>Knoxville Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Harbison, supra; Dayton Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>183 U. S. 23; <em>Keokee Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>234 U. S. 224; or fixed the fees chargeable by attorneys appearing for injured employees before workmen\u2019s compensation commissions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Yeiser </em>v. <em>Dysart, </em>267 U. S. 540; or fixed the rate of pay for overtime work, <em>Bunting </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>243 U. S. 426; or fixed the time within which the services of employees must .be paid for, <em>Erie R. R. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra; </em>or established maximum rents, <em>Block </em>v. <em>Hirsh, </em>256 U. S. 135; <em>Marcus Brown Co. </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>256 U. S. 170; or fixed the maximum rate of interest chargeable on loans, <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>218 U. S. 563. It has sustained restrictions on the other element in the bargain where legislatures have established maximum hours of labor for men, <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>169 U. S. 366, or for women, <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>208 U. S. 412; <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>232 U. S, 718; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>232 U. S. 671; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>236 U. S. 373; <em>Bosley </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>236 U. S. 385; on prohibited the payment of wages in advance, <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Bark Eudora, </em>190 U. S. 169; <em>Strathearn S. S. Co. </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>252 U. S. 348; or required loaves of bread to be of a certain size, <em>Schmidinger </em>v. <em>Chicago, 226 U. </em>S. 578. In each of these cases the police power of the state was held broad enough to warrant an interference with free-bargaining in cases where, despite the competition. that ordinarily attends that freedom, serious evils persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Similar - evils are now observed in the. conduct of employment. agencies. I see no reason why a state may not resort to the same remedy. There may be, reasonable differences of opinion as to the wisdom of the solution here attempted. These I would be the first to' admit. But a choice between them involves a step from the judicial to the ^legislative field. <em>Erie R. R. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>699; <em>German Alliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas, supra; Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>132. That choice should be left ' where, it seems to me, it was left by the Constitution\u2014 to the States and to Congress.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-5\">Me. Justice Holmes and Me.
