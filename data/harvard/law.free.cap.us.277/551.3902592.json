The statute discloses the-exact contrary. The Board has the most limited jurisdiction and merely serves to give the taxpayer an additional hearing before he is compelled to pay. \u00a7 900 (k), Act of 1924. In the event the decision is against the taxpayer, he will be required to pay |he tax according to the assessment and have recourse to the courts for the recovery thereof. If the decision is against the Government, it will likewise have recourse to the courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">The Senate committee, in reporting the tax bill, recognized clearly that a case under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 can be taken to court after a Board of Tax Appeals decision. No additional statutory jurisdiction having been conferred on the courts respecting such cases, they must have had this jurisdiction before the Board was created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">The court must compute the correct tax in every case where overpayment is contended by the taxpayer. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>237 U. S. 28, and <em>Rock Island R. R. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>254 U. S. 141, this Court stated, in substance, that it was the Commissioner\u2019s duty to determine, assess and levy the tax, but that does not mean that a federal court may not compute the tax correctly when the Commissioner refuses to do it. To say that a court is without jurisdiction to compute and determine the correct tax is simply to say, in effect, that a court is without jurisdiction to render a judgment for a refund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">It is well settled that there can be no remedy by mandamus.

S. 220, it was held that the statutes giving the Board of Tax Appeals authority to review decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on determination of deficiencies were not subject to the limitation that the decisions of the Commissioner, making or refusing special assessments \u2018under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 19X8, were not open to review.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">The question here is whether the statutes giving to the Court of Claims jurisdiction to entertain suits to recover taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, read in connection with \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918, deny to the court the power to review the decisions of the Commissioner under those sections. We have been unable to find any ground for contending that the cases are distinguishable. If the statute giving the Board of Tax Appeals general jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Commissioner on deficiencies was not subject to any qualification as to special assessments, we see no reason why the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to award judgment for taxes illegally or erroneously assessed or collected should be so limited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">At present the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals are reviewable in the Circuit Court of Appeals. If the decisions of the Commissioner under the special assessment sections are reviewable in the courts under that procedure, we see no reason why they should not be reviewable in the courts where the- other course is followed and suit is commenced in the district court or the Court of Claims for the collection or the tax alleged to have been erroneously .assessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">Notwithstanding the decision in <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Oesterlein Machine Company, </em>the Court of Claims adheres to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>view that it has no. jurisdiction in thes\u00e9 special assessment cases, and it is necessary to submit the matter for the decision of this Court. The principal point seems t\u00f3 be that the Court of Claims cannot grant relief in such cases, because the determination of the true tax under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 involves an assessment of the tax. The Court of Claims also contends that its jurisdiction' to award recovery for taxes illegally collected is limited to cases where the correct section of the Revenue Act has been applied by the Commissioner, but erroneously applied, and that where, as in this case, the Commissioner has applied \u00a7 301, which prescribes the general formula, and has refused to apply the special assessment sections, the Court of Claims may not itself determine what the true tax should have been under the special assessment sections.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-4\"><em>Messrs.

The petition alleged the following facts: The Company had conceded in its return, and had paid, a total tax of $306,381.77,. for the year 1918. In Aprir, 1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue levied upon it an additional assessment of $89,094.85, which the Company paid under protest. On June 10, 1924, a portion of the sum so paid was refunded. Four days later, the Company filed a claim for a further refund of $100,000. The claim alleged that for reasons there set forth, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>repeated in the petition, the Company was entitled, under subdivisions (a) and (d) of \u00a7 327 of the Revenue Act of 1918, to have a special assessment made under \u00a7 328 of that Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner having failed to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>refund within six months after demand, this suit was brought. The Government demurred to the petition on the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, and the demurrer was sustained. 63 Ct. Cls. 463. The case is here on certiorari. 275 U. S. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In its petition for a writ of certiorari, the Williamsport Company alleged that its rights would presumably be determined by the decision in <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Oesterlein Machine Co., </em>a case then pending in this Court; and the Solicitor General, being of the same opinion, did not feel justified in opposing the granting of the writ. Decision on the petition was postponed pending decision of the <em>Oesterlein </em>case. That case, 275 U. S. 220, was decided November 21, 1927. We there held that the exercise of the judgment or discretion of the Commissioner to allow or deny the special assessment provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 was subject to review by the Board of Tax Appeals; and that therefore the taxpayer was entitled to an order compelling the Commissioner to respond to the subpoena of the Board issued under \u00a7 900(i) of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 338, requiring him to answer interrogatories and to furnish information contained in the returns of other corporations. On November 28, the writ of certiorari in this case was granted. Thereupon, the Williamsport Company moved, presumably in analogy to motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>affirm under Rule 6, that the judgment against it be reversed on the authority of the <em>Oesterlein </em>case. The Solicitor General, while not opposing the motion, advised-us that the Court of Claims had, since the decision of the <em>Oesterlein </em>case, adhered to the view that it was without power to determiner whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had erred in refusing to make a special assessment under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328. We then assigned the case for oral argument, without passing on the motion to reverse .and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The contention here is that, since the Commissioner\u2019s action was made reviewable on appeal by the Board of Tax Appeals, it is and was always reviewable in an original proceeding before the Court of Claims. The argument is that Congress has conferred upon the Court of Claims' jurisdiction over -suits to recover taxes alleged to have been \u201cerroneously or illegally assessed or collected;\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that here its jurisdiction .is invoked to recover taxes claimed to have been assessed illegally, because assessed under \u00a7 301 instead of under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328; that it must therefore have power to determine whether conditions existed which entitled the Company to the special assessment provided for by \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328; that if it finds that' such condition did exist, it must also have power to determine the true amount of the tax computed as therein directed; and that if it appears that the tax actually paid exceeds that which would have been exacted under the special assessment, the Court may award judgment for the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Sections 327 and 328 were intended to broaden the powers of relief first conferred by \u00a7 210 of the War Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 307.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was <em>\u201c </em>believed necessary to provide a special method of determining the tax for those cases in which the ordinary method of assessment would result in grave hardship or serious inequality.\u201d Senate Report, 65th Cong. 3d Sess., No. 617, p. 14. The special assessment is to be made under paragraph (a) when the Commissioner \u201c is unable to determine the invested capital.\u201d It is to be made under paragraph (d) if he <em>\u201c </em>finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without the benefit of this section would . . . work ... an exceptional hardship . . .\u201d The task imposed on the Commissioner by \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 was one that could only be performed by an official or a body having wide knowledge and experience with the class of problems concerned. For the requirement of a special assessment under paragraph (d) of \u00a7 327 and its computation in all cases, are dependent on \u201c the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or-business.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>To perform that task, power discretionary in character was necessarily conferred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether, as provided in paragraph (d) of \u00a7 327, there are \u201cabnormal conditions;\u201d whether, because of these conditions, computation under \u00a7 301 would work \u201c exceptional hardship;\u201d whether there would be \u201c gross disproportion \u201d between the tax computed under \u00a7 301 and \u201c that computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328;\u201d what are \u201c representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business; \u201d which corporations are \u201c as nearly as may be, similarly circumstanced with respect to gross income, net income, profits per unit of business transacted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and circumstances \u201d \u2014 these are all questions of administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The soundness of the judgment exercised by the individual or body to whom the task was confided would depend largely upon the extent both of the knowledge of the special subject possessed and of the experience had in dealing with this particular class of problems. The conclusions reached would rest largely upon considerations not entirely susceptible of proof or disproof. Congress did not, by the Revenue Act of 1918, require the Commissioner to embody the results of his deliberation in findings of fact. The purpose of the meagre record prescribed by \u00a7 328(c) in case the Commissioner concludes to order a special assessment is apparently to protect the Treasury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>not the taxpayer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For if the Commissioner refuses to make the special assessment, he is not required to state the grounds of his refusal, or, indeed, even to record the fact of such refusal. Thus the aims which induced Congress to enact \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328, the nature of the task which it confided to the Commissioner, the methods of procedure prescribed, and the language employed to express the conditions under which the special assessment is required, all negative the right to a review of his determination by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">It is true that where the Commissioner\u2019s action is reviewable judicially, his findings of fact in making an assessment, as distinguished from his determinations involving administrative discretion, constitute only prima facie evidence; and that, in cases arising under the internal revenue laws, such findings are commonly reviewable by courts in appropriate proceedings in which the facts become an issue. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rindskopf, </em>105 U. S. 418, 422; <em>Wickwire </em>v. <em>Reinecke, </em>275 U. S. 101, 105. It is also true that in reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s findings on such matters as value, compare <em>Costner, Curran &amp; Bullitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lederer, </em>275 Fed. 221; <em>Little Cahaba Coal Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>15 F. (2d) 863; allowances for depreciation, compare <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>234 Fed. 474; <em>Camp Bird, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Howbert, </em>262 Fed. 114; or the accuracy with which a taxpayer\u2019s books reflect his income, compare <em>In re Sheinman, </em>14 F. (2d) 323, courts may be confronted with problems requiring a high degree of technical knowledge for their solution. But such problems involve primarily the situation of a single taxpayer, and the controlling data can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>easily be made available to the court. Here, the considerations which demand special assessment under \u00a7 327 (d), and those which govern its computation in all cases, are facts concerning the situation of a large group of taxpayers which can only be known to an official or a body having wide experience in such matters and ready access to the means of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, if any, rests on statutory provisions which long antedate the Revenue Act of 1918. Its jurisdiction over suits to recover taxes is based on the clause in the original Act of February 24, 1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612, empowering it to determine \u201c all claims founded upon any law of Congress.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>96 U. S. 567, 569; <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>182 U. S. 222. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Emery, Bird, Thayer Co., </em>237 U. S. 28. But we have held that the Court of Claims is without jurisdiction where the statute creating the claim expressly refers it for final determination to an executive department. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>250 U. S. 328, 331. And that it is equally without jurisdiction where from an examination of all the terms of the statute it appears that Congress intended to vest final authority in an administrative agency. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>249 U. S. 451; <em>Silberschein </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U. S. 221. Long ago Congress conferred final authority upon such an agency in the enforcement of the appraisal provisions by which the amounts payable under the customs laws are determined. Compare <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>16 How. 263, 272; <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>110 U. S. 97, 105; <em>Passavant </em>v. <em>United States, </em>148 U S. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Moreover, whatever jurisdiction is possessed by the Court of Claims to review determinations under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328, would\u2019 be possessed also by the district courts in suits against collectors and in actions against the United States, under \u00a7 24(20) of the Judicial Code. Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>determinations of the Commissioner in this delicate and complex phase of revenue administration would be subjected to review by a large number of courts, none of which have ready access to the information necessary to enable them to arrive at a proper conclusion in revising his decisions; whose experience in passing upon questions of this character would be limited; and whose varying decisions would tend to defeat, rather than promote, that equality in the application of the revenue law which \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 were designed to insure. We conclude that the determination whether the taxpayer is entitled to the special assessment was confided by Congress to the Commissioner, and could not, under the Revenue Act of 1918, be challenged in the courts \u2014 at least in the absence of fraud or other irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">It remains to consider whether jurisdiction to review the Commissioner\u2019s action was conferred upon the Court of Claims as a result of the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 336, which created the Board of Tax Appeals. There is nothing in that Act which purports to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims or to extend the scope of judicial review over determinations of the Commissioner. The contention that it had this effect rests wholly on our decision in <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Oesterlein Machine Co., </em>275 U. S. 220. The contention fails to take account of the important differences between an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, on the one hand, and an original suit in the Court of Claims, or in a district court, on the other. The Board of Tax Appeals was created to perform the administrative functions theretofore discharged by the. Committee on Appeals and Review, which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had established in his office.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See House Report, 68th Cong. 1st Sess., No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>179, p. 7; Senate Report, 68th Cong. 1st Sess., No. 398, p. 8. The Committee had regularly reviewed determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>nations granting or denying special assessment under \u00a7 \u00a7 327 and 328.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The granting of these powers of review to the Board of Tax Appeals did not change the character of the appeal. And it affords no reason to conclude that Congress intended that the Court of Claims and the district courts should also be authorized to reexamine the decisions of the Commissioner on questions of the character here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">It is true that, unlike the Committee, the Board of Tax Appeals is not a part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The Board is an independent agency. But by specific provision of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, \u00a7 900 (k), 43 Stat. 253, 338, it was defined as an agency \u201c in the executive branch of the Government.\u201d Compare <em>Goldsmith </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Appeals, </em>270 U. S. 117, 121-122. Its sole function consists in reviewing, on appeal; determinations of the Commissioner under the revenue, laws. The fact that the Commissioner is a party to all cases be-fore it enables the Board, by rules of procedure which it has developed, to leave to the Commissioner the initial determination of many questions requiring the use of facts not in the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its limited, specialized functions en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>able its members to acquire the extensive special knowledge and the specific experience essential to a sound exercise of judgment in dealing with questions arising under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As was said in the <em>Oesterlein </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at p. 226, there is no reason for thinking that Congress considered the Commissioner to be better qualified for making determinations under \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328 than this administrative agency specially established to review his decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-4\"> Sec. 327.

The Commissioner might submit to the Board and on the request of a taxpayer must submit any question relating to the interpretation or administration of the income, war-profits or excess-profits tax. The functions of the Board were, in some degree, similar to those of the excess-profits tax advisers and reviewers who had aided the Commissioner in applying the 1917 act. See Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1918, p. 13. Procedure as to the submission of questions and practice before the Board was established by Regulations 45, art. 1701 (T. D. 2831). The Board, which was organized qn March 13, 1919, came to an end on October 1 of that year.

Report, 1919, p. J4. The procedure for taking appeals to this committee, which was known as the Committee on Appeals and Review, was laid down in O. D. 709, 3 C. B. 370. The nature of the work of this body is described in the Commissioner\u2019s Report for 1920, pp. 14-15, and for 1921, pp. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">Section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265-266, provided that if on examination of a return under the Acts of 1916, 1917, 1918, or 1921, a tax or deficiency in tax should be discovered, the taxpayer should be notified and given a period of not less than 30 days in which to file an appeal. See House Report, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., No. 350, p. 14; Senate Report, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., No. 275, pp. 20-21. The procedure for perfecting appeals under this section was laid down by T.

By paragraph (b) it is provided that the hearing may, in the discretion of the Board, on motion, be limited to the question whether the petitioner is entitled to have its tax determined under \u00a7 328 (or \u00a7 210). Paragraph (c) provides that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Board decides that the petitioner is so entitled, the Commissioner shall file within 60 days after such decision, a proposed redetermination showing the basis and method of the computation. If, within 20 days after service by the Board upon the petitioner of a copy of such proposed redetermination, the parties are unable to agree on the amount of the tax, either party may move or the Board on its own motion may order that the case be placed on the calendar for further hearing.

See Hearings before the Select Committee on Investigation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, U. S. Senate, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., pursuant to S. Res. 168, p. 136.

Congress plainly did not intend to remove altogether the right to a review of determinations under \u00a7 327 which, by virtue-of \u00a7 1301(d) of the Act of 1918, \u00a7 250(d) of the Act of 1921, and the regulations of the Bureau, the taxpayer had theretofore enjoyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
