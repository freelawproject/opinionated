Co., </em>278 Ill. 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-4\">The statute attempts to establish rules of evidence under which the depositor may prove his case against the directors. It does not enact a rule of substantive law. To give the statute the effect which the Kansas Court announces, the statute would have to read that every director shall be liable to depositors if he fails to make ah examination of the bank. The liability is based upon assent after knowledge of insolvency, and the conclusive presumption raised is a' method provided for proving knowledge. Conceding.for the moment the power of the legislature to establish a rule of absolute liability upon the part of a director who failed to examine, it is plain that the legislature had no intention of so doing. What the legislature,did intend was to make it easier for the depositor to prove his case. <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>270 U. S. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">And the legislature cannot impose upon a director liability on the ground that he would have had knowledge of the true condition of the bank had he'made an examination, when the fact is such examination would not have disclosed the condition of the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">If the statute be treated as a rule of substantive law, it at the most imposes a civil liability to comp\u00e9nsate the depositors <em>fop </em>loss resulting from the failure of the director to perform the duty imposed by the statute, to examine the bank. Such a statute would be unconstitutional because of being unreasonable and arbitrary in placing such a liability upon the directors without regard to whether such neglect of duty to examine occasioned the loss or not. If an examination into the affairs of the bank would not have shown its true condition, then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>award compensatory damages to the depositors because of the failure to examine, is to take the property of the directors without due process of law, because their neglect had no causal relation to the injury. 29 Cyc., 439; <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>12 Fed. Cas. 6565, affirmed, 1 Cranch 345.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-6\">The statute very positively creates not a \u201c mere <em>prima facie </em>presumption,\u201d but a conclusive presumption against a director who does not examine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-7\">Section 9-164 is, we contend, also violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, but for a somewhat different reason. It is the rule as stated in many of the authorities, that even a <em>prima fade </em>presumption cannot be created where there is no rational or logical connection between the fact upon which the presumption is to rest and the fact to be proved. The existence of the estaba lished fact must reasonably tend to raise an inference of the main fact. Now how can it be said that the fact that a bank is insolvent reasonably tends to raise an inference that its officers assented to its receiving deposits? Ordinarily courts do not assume that persons intend to violate the law. <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>American Sugar Co., </em>241 U. S. 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-8\">The statute here provides that proof of insolvency shall constitute <em>prima fade </em>evidence not only of knowledge, but of assent. Therefore, inasmuch as assent is based in part upon knowledge, the statute provides for a presumption upon a presumption. One presumption cannot be based on another presumption. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Baumgartner, </em>74 Kans. 148; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>92 U.

The statutes were upheld by the State Court. 122 Kans. 675. <em>Ibid. </em>691.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The plaintiffs, (the defendants in error,) made deposits in the. bank at a time when it was insolvent but had not' closed its doors. The statutes under which the directors were held liable to depositors and which are attacked here are Revised Statutes of Kansas, 1923, Chapter 9, \u00b6\u00b6 163, 164; The former of these makes it unlawful for any director to assent to the reception of deposits by his bank after he shall have had knowledge of the fact that it is insolvent. The law makes it the duty of the directors to examine into th\u00e9 affairs of the bank, and, if possible, to know its condition, and in case of his failure to do as required, he is to be held to have had knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, and is made \u2018 individually responsible for such deposits so received.\u2019 By. 9-164, in suits for deposits against officers \u201c the fact that such banking institution was so insolvent or in failing., circumstances at the time of the reception of the deposit charged to have been so received . . . shall be prima facie evidence of such knowledge and assent to such deposit ... on the part of such officer . . \u2022 so charged therewith,\u201d It is said that 163 denies due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cess of law by creating a conclusive presumption of knowledge from ignorance and by implying that the director knowingly assented to a deposit that he should not have received, of which in fact he knew nothing. As to 164 it is said that facts are made prima facie evidence of other facts that they have no rational tendency to prove. The law as construed by the Supreme Court of Kansas meets its severest test in the cases against the executor of Kramer, because Kramer, although not so ignorant or incapable of knowledge as thought by the Court of first instance, was seriously ill at the time of the deposits and seemed to have much to be said in his behalf, if the actual state of his knowledge had any relevancy as an excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">It is said that the liability is founded by the statute upon the directors\u2019 assent to the deposit and that when this is the ground the assent cannot be proved by artificial presumptions that have no warrant from experience. But the short answer is that the statute might have made the directors personally hable to depositors in every case, if it had been so minded, and that if it had purported to do so, whoever accepted the office would assume the risk. The statute in short imposed a liability that was less than might have been imposed, and that being so, the thing to be considered is the result reached, not the possibly inartificial or clumsy way of reaching it. If without any mention of assent or presumptions or prima facie evidence the statute had said: \u2018Every director of a bank shall be personally liable to depositors for every deposit accepted by the bank after it has become insolvent,\u2019 all objections would be met by the answer, \u2018You took the office on those terms.\u2019 The statute would be none the worse if it allowed a defence in the single case of the defendants having made an honest examination and having been led to believe that the bank was solvent. The mention of assent and evidence of knowledge cannot be pressed to conclusions that the statute manifestly does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>not allow. The conclusions that, as construed by the State Court, it does impose, it imposes however much it may cut down the significance of the assent or knowledge to which it refers. As a matter of law there is nothing new in charging a party with knowledge of what' it is his duty to know, in this case the insolvency of the bank, or with assent to deposits that he must expect while the bank\u2019s doors remain open. But the essential thing is that, whether in a roundabout or a perfectly natural way, the statute has said if you take the office you must take the consequences of knowledge whether you have it or not. In most contracts men take the risk of events over which they have imperfect or no control. The acceptance of a directorship is as voluntary an act as\" a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The Supreme Court of Kansas affirmed judgments against Ferry and reversed judgments in favor of the executor of Kramer based on Kramer\u2019s incapacity to know of or assent to the deposits in' question and ordered judgments against him. In so doing it violated no provision of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b133-8\">Me.'Justice Sutherland,</author>\n<p id=\"Afv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">In respect of the prima facie presumption created by \u00a7 9-164 of the Kansas statute, I am unable to agree with the opinion of the Court insofar as that section affects the cases against Harris, Executor of the Will of Kramer, deceased. The evidence shows very clearly that, at the: time the deposits in question were made and for a long time prior thereto, Kramer was physically incapable of investigating and ascertaining the condition of the bank, Or of assenting to the reception of deposits by the bank, because of his serious illness which resulted in his death after undergoing a major surgical operation. It was substantially so found by-the jury in one of the cases and by the trial court in the others. Under these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>th\u00e9 application :of the statutory presumption was obviously injurious. ' Section 9-163 provides that it shall be unlawful for any president, director, etc., to assent .to the reception of deposits, etc., after he shall have had knowledge of the fact that the bank is insolvent. Section 9-164, which creates, the objectionable presumption, provides that \u201c the fact that such banking institution was so insolv\u00e9nt or in failing circumstances at the time, of the reception of- the deposit charged to have been so received . . .' shall be prima facie evidence of such . ... assent to such deposit . . ..on the part of such officer . . .\u201d Of course,, the state may provide that proof of one fact shall be prima facie evidence of another; but this can. be done consistently with the due process of law clause, of the Fourteenth Amendment only where there is a rational relation between the two facts. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>219 U. S. 219, 238; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>American Sugar </em>Co., 241 U. S. 79, 86. In the latter case this Court said, quoting from <em>Mobile, J. &amp; K. C. R. R. </em>v. <em>Turnipseed, </em>219 U. S. 35, <em>43:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u201c It is \u2018 essential -that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact pre-. sumed, and that th\u00e9 inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be sq unreasonable.as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.\u2019 \u201d\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"A2H\">To me it seems dear that there, is no rational relation between the fact of insolvency and the fact here presumed, namely,- assent to the reception of a. particular deposit. Rather, th\u00e9 rational presumption is the other way, since \u2022the law itself requires that an insolvent bank shall not receive deposits; and' the assent of the director thereto would be ah assent to a violation of law. I do not quarrel with the suggestion that it was within the constitutional power of the state to create ah -absolute liability against a director if, while insolvent, tli\u00e9 bank of which he is a director receive a deposit. But this the state did not do. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Instead, it adopted a statute creating a liability only in case the director <em>assents </em>to the deposit; and I should have supposed the liability of the director must be measured by what the state has enacted and not by what it had the power to enact. Under such a statute, without more, it is perfectly plain that' proof by the state of such assent' would be necessary. But'here the state by legislative fiat substituted for such proof on its part the prima facie presumption set forth. It was said that the bank was open and doing business and that it is a reasonable presumption from that fact that assent was given to the receipt of particular deposits. But we are dealing with a specific statutory provision and must take it as we find it; and by that provision the general transaction of business by the bank at the time it received the particular deposits is not made the basis of the statutory presumption. If it were, a different question would be presented. Under these circumstances, as it seems to me, the rule, requiring a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact to be presumed therefrom, plainly applies; and consequently the .statutory provision in question is void.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-6\">Mr. Justice Butler and Mr. Justice Sanford concur in this opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
