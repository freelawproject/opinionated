The Jones Act is not a local statute of 'a State merely seized on by the courts as supplementary to the maritime law in absence of any similar right afforded by that law. <em>Cf. The Corsair, </em>145 U. S. 335; <em>The Albert Dumois, </em>177 U. S. 240; <em>The Hamilton, </em>207 U. S. 398; <em>The J. E. Rumbell, </em>148 U. S. 1. On the contrary, it is a part of the general maritime law, enacted by Congress, the legislative body empowered to declare and modify the maritime law, and concerns itself only with seamen and .their own and their employers' relative rights \u2014 a subject peculiarly maritime \u2014 and is uniformly applicable throughout the country wherever the American maritime law applies. <em>Panama R.

S. 158, is applicable to this case, petitioner failed to make out any cause of action because the accident was due to the negligence of a fellow servant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-11\">Mr. Justice McReynolds</author>\n<p id=\"AK5\">delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Plamals, the petitioner, a subject of Spain, belonged to the crew of the British ship \u201c Pinar Del Rio.\u201d She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>anchored at Philadelphia, April 27, 1923. He was being hoisted, up to paint the smoke stack; a rope broke; he fell to the deck and sustained serious injuries. The accident resulted from the negligence of the mate who selected a defective rope. An abundant supply of good rope was on board.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Six months after the accident Plamals began this proceeding <em>in rem </em>against the ship in the District Court, Southern District of New York. The libel alleged that his injuries \u201c were due to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope was old, worn and not suitable for use,' in that libellant was ordered to perform services not within the scope of his duties, and in other respects that libellant will point out on the trial of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">There is nothing to show that painting the smoke, stack was beyond the scope of the duties assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In the District Court the petitioner asserted by his proctor that he claimed under Sec. 33, Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, which follows \u2014 .</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u201c That section 20 of such Act of March 4, 1915, be, and is, amended, to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u2018 Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal inj'ury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any sea-\u2019 man as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regu-lating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in s\u00fcch actions shall be under the court of the district in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is lbcated.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The District Court ruled that the rights and liabilities of the parties were fixfed by the law of the ship\u2019s flag and was of opinion that (he British Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act afforded the only remedy. It accordingly dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that a lien against the vessel is essential to every proceeding <em>in rem </em>against her; and that no such lien arose, by reason of Sec. 33 of the Jones Act in favor of the injured seaman. Upon that ground it affirmed the questioned decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We .agree with the view of the Circuit Court .of Appeals and find it unnecessary now to consider whether the provisions of Section 33 are applicable where a foreign seaman employed on a foreign ship suffers injuries while in American waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The record does, not support the suggestion that, the \u201c Pinar Del Rio \u201d was unseaworthy. The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We must treat the proceeding as one to enforce the liability prescribed by Sec. 33. It was so treated by petitioner\u2019s proctor at the original trial; and the application for certiorari here spoke of it as based upon that section. The evidence would not support a recovery upon any other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Sec. 20, Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1185), originally provided \u2014 \u201c That in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow-servants' with those under their authority.\u201d <em>Chelentis </em>v. <em>Luckenbach Steamship Co. </em>(1918), 247 U. S. 372, 384, pointed out that this imposed no new liability upon the shipowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">, Sec. 33 brings into our maritime law the provisions of certain statutes which define the liability of masters, to employees originally intended to be enforced in actions at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>law. They imposed personal liability and gave no lien of any kind. The statute which extended them to seamen expressly provided that the employer might be sued only in the district where he resides or has his principal office. This provision repels , the suggestion that the intention was to subject the ship to <em>in rem </em>proceedings. Generally, at least, proceedings of that nature may be brought-wherever the ship happens to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The ordinary maritime privilege or lien, though adhering to the vessel, is a secret one which may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice and is therefore <em>stricti juris. </em>It cannot be extended by construction, analogy or inference. The <em>Corsair, </em>145 U. S. 335, 347; The <em>Albert Dumois, </em>177 U. S. 240, 257; <em>Osaka Shosen Kaisha </em>v. <em>Lumber Co., </em>260 U. S. 490, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Panama R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>264 U. S. 375, 386, 391, declares \u2014 Sec. 33 \u201c is.concerned with the relative rights and obligations of seamen and their employers arising out of personal injuries sustained by the former in the course of their employment.\u201d \u201c The injured seaman is permitted but not required to proceed on the common-law side of the court.\u201d \u201c The statute leaves the injured seaman free under the general law \u2014 Secs. 24 (par. 3) and 256 (par. 3) of the Judicial Code \u2014 to assert his right of action under the new rules on the admiralty side of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In the system from which these new rules come no lien exists to secure claims arising under them and, of course, no right to proceed <em>in rem. </em>We cannot conclude that the mere incorporation into the maritime law of the rights, which they create to pursue the employer was enough to give rise to a lien against the vessel upon which the injury occurred. The section under consideration does not Undertake to impose liability on the ship itself, but by positive words indicates a contrary purpose. Seamen may invoke, at their election, the relief accorded by the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>rules against the ship, or that provided by the new against the employer. But they may not have the benefit of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. To subject vessels during all the time allowed by the statute of limitations to secret liens to secure undisclosed and unlimited claims for personal injuries by every seaman who may have suffered injury thereon would be a very serious burden.. One desiring to purchase, for example, could only guess vaguely concerning the value. \u201cAn Act to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American Merchant Marine \u201d ought not to be so construed in the absence of compelling language.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The judgment of the court below' must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
