On September 8,1988, he was sentenced to forty years in the Montana State Prison for robbery, and death for the kidnapping and homicide convictions. His conviction Was appealed to this Court and affirmed in <em>State v. Vernon Kills On Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 793 P.2d 1273, <em>cert. denied </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 1259, 111 S.Ct. 2910, 115 L.Ed.2d 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">On February 19, 1992, the petitioner filed a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, in the same District Corut in Custer County. In that petition, he claimed fifteen separate grounds for relief. All but part of one claim were dismissed by the District Court by summary judgment. Part of the petitioner\u2019s second claim which was not dismissed by summary judgment was denied after an evidentiary hearing. In addition, the petitioner\u2019s motion to amend claims 2 and 11 and add claims 16-18, and his motions for investigative assistance, leave to conduct discovery, and a court-appointed psychiatrist, were all denied. The District Court also denied petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Vernon Kills On Top appeals from the District Court\u2019s orders which denied his amended petition for postconviction relief and his motion for reconsideration. We affirm the District Court in part, reverse in part, and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The issues presented on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">1. Did the District Court err when it denied the petitioner the opportunity to amend his petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">2. Did the District Court err when it denied the petitioner the opportunity to present evidence at a hearing in support of all but one of his claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>3. Did the District Court err when it held that nine of the petitioner\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res </em>judicata?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">4. Is the imposition of the death penalty based on a conviction for aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicide disproportionate to the petitioner\u2019s conduct and therefore in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, when the petitioner was not personally involved in and not present when injuries were inflicted which caused the victim\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">5. Did the District Court err when it denied five of the petitioner\u2019s claims based on the procedural bar found at \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, because they were not previously raised on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The petitioner, Vernon Kills On Top, raised the following grounds in his original petition for postconviction relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">1. The District Court lacked jurisdiction over a homicide committed in the state of Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">2. The petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to trial, during trial, in the sentencing phase of his prosecution, and on appeal from his convictions for robbery, aggravated kidnapping, and deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">3. The District Court improperly excluded evidence pertaining to Diane Bull Coming\u2019s participation in the crimes for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">4. The jury which convicted him was improperly influenced when the deputy clerk of court and bailiff wore badges which urged \u201cTake a bite out of crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">5. The District Court erred when it refused to instruct the jury regarding lesser included offenses, including ordinary kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">6. The District Court erred when it instructed the jury regarding the effect of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">7. The District Court erred when, at petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing, it considered evidence of prior criminal charges which had been dismissed and convictions which had been obtained without the benefit of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">8. The sentencing hearing was unfair because it was based on a biased report from an uninformed and hostile probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">9. The District Court erred when it considered petitioner\u2019s failure to testify in making its sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>10. The District Court failed to adequately consider mitigating evidence before imposing the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">11. Heinous acts of others were improperly attributed to the petitioner as aggravating circumstances in support of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">12. Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated kidnapping is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">13. The District Court violated individualized punishment notions central to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when it sentenced the petitioner to death under the circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">14. The Montana Supreme Court\u2019s independent review of the petitioner\u2019s sentence was flawed by its erroneous assumption of aggravating facts and its disregard for other mitigating facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">15. Based on the facts in this case, imposition of the death sentence was disproportionate, cruel, and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">On March 18, 1992, prior to any responsive pleading by the State of Montana, the petitioner moved to amend his petition to include allegations that his counsel had been ineffective based on political interests which were in conflict with his defense of the petitioner and based on his failure to cite authorities to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The State of Montana, in its response to Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s amended petition, affirmatively alleged that claims 1, 4, 5, 9-11, and 13-15 were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata-, </em>and that claims 3, 6-8, and 12 were procedurally barred based on \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. On March 30, 1992, the State moved for partial judgment on the pleadings based on those affirmative defenses. The State also sought dismissal of all but part of the petitioner\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a matter of law. The State conceded that petitioner\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to testify could only be resolved after an evidentiary hearing. On May 6, 1992, the District Court issued its notice that based on information submitted by the parties in support of and in opposition to the State\u2019s motion, which was in addition to that information included in the pleadings, the State\u2019s motion was converted to a motion for partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">On June 30,1992, the District Court entered an order in which it set July 15 as the deadline for proposing amendments to the petition. The petitioner\u2019s proposed amendments to his petition were filed on July 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">On March 30, 1993, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. It concluded that claims 1, 4, 5, 9-11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>and 13-15 were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>and that claims 3, 6-8, and 12 were procedurally barred pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. It further concluded that all of petitioner\u2019s claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit as a matter of law, except for that claim in subparagraph (h) of claim 2 to the effect that the petitioner was denied the opportunity to testify at his sentencing hearing. The District Court granted a hearing at which the parties were allowed to present evidence regarding the merits of claim 2(h). However, following that hearing, the District Court found that the petitioner had been informed of his right to testify and voluntarily chose not to do so. The court concluded that that decision was binding on his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On February 10, 1994, judgment was entered against the petitioner and in favor of the State regarding all claims made by the amended petition for postconviction relief. On March 14, 1994, the petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Specific facts which served as the basis for the petitioner\u2019s conviction and his sentence to death will be discussed where appropriate to the issues we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We review district court orders granting summary judgment, as we do district court conclusions of law, to determine if they are correct. <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 318, 880 P.2d 829, 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Bower </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 1, 7, 833 P.2d 1106, 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend the pleadings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Porter v. Galarneau </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 174, 188, 911 P.2d 1143, 1151-52; <em>United Methodist Church v. D.A. Davidson, Inc. </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 288, 292, 741 P.2d 794, 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Did the District Court err when it denied the petitioner the opportunity to amend his petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">On June 30, 1992, the District Court entered an order in which it set July 15, 1992, as the deadline for proposing any further amendments to the petition for postconviction relief. On July 14, 1992, within the deadline set by the court, Vernon proposed amendments to his claims 2 and 11, and proposed adding claims 16-18. On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>30, 1993, the District Court denied Vernon\u2019s motion to amend his postconviction petition based on its determination that \u201cthe proposed amendments would be futile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In his motion to amend his pleadings, Vernon sought to amend claim 2(b) to allege that his trial attorney was ineffective because he failed to investigate and discover Diane Bull Coming\u2019s prior acts of violence against men and acts of prostitution, and because he failed to obtain a psychiatric evaluation for Vernon. He sought to amend claim 11, regarding the required mental state for imposition of the death penalty, by adding reference to \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Proposed claim 16 sought the opportunity to allege newly discovered evidence based on the affidavit of Diane Bull Coming in which she questioned whether Vernon had actually consented to kill the victim. Claim 17 sought to allege multiple violations of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, including the State\u2019s failure to disclose Diane\u2019s allegation that she had been raped by a Custer County jailer, and other evidence that the victim had been mutilated by Diane. Finally, proposed claim 18 alleged a cumulative denial of due process based on all the circumstances alleged in previous claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">A petition for postconviction relief is civil in nature. <em>State v. Black </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 39, 43, 798 P.2d 530, 532; <em>Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 433, 633 P.2d 624, 627. Therefore, in most instances the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure apply. In this case, because the postconviction relief statute does not specify a procedure for the amendment of a postconviction petition, we will apply Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">A party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In this case, neither the District Court nor the State provide any justifiable basis for denying Vernon the opportunity to amend his petition for postconviction relief. The stated basis for denying the motion was its futility. However, the amended pleading would have set forth at least one basis for relief which this Court found controlling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>in Lester Kalls On Top\u2019s claim for postconviction relief. <em>See Lester Kills On Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 45, 901 P.2d 1368, 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The amendment to claim 2(b) alleged that Vernon\u2019s trial attorney was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate the State\u2019s primary witness. We have held that failure to adequately investigate a case prior to trial could form the basis for a finding that counsel was ineffective and that when such an allegation is made, a hearing is necessary to determine whether in fact the allegation is true. <em>Fitzpatrick v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 310, 318, 638 P.2d 1002, 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Proposed claim 16 sought the opportunity to allege newly discovered evidence based on an affidavit of Diane Bull Coming in which she questioned whether Vernon had actually consented to kill the victim. Since his alleged consent to the victim\u2019s murder served as a partial basis for the District Court\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, and since newly discovered evidence is a justification for postconviction relief, this allegation, if true, could hardly have been considered futile. <em>In re J.R.T. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 520, 522, 853 P.2d 710, 711; <em>State v. Greeno </em>(1959), 135 Mont. 580, 586, 342 P.2d 1052, 1055-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Claim 17 sought to allege multiple violations of <em>Brady, </em>including the State\u2019s failure to disclose Diane\u2019s allegation that she had been raped by a Custer County jailer. As previously pointed out, this Court has already concluded, in response to Lester\u2019s claim for postconviction relief, that this <em>Brady </em>violation was cause to set aside Lester\u2019s death penalty. A similar claim could not have been futile for Vernon when Diane Bull Coming was the only witness who even linked Vernon to Etchemendy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The proposed claim 18 would have alleged cumulative denial of due process based on all the circumstances alleged in the previous claims. Cumulative error can serve as a basis for reversal, even when individual errors alone would not serve as a sufficient basis for reversal. <em>State v. Grant </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 122, 137, 717 P.2d 562, 572; <em>State v. Close </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 229, 245, 623 P.2d 940, 948. Therefore, it cannot be said that this allegation, if established, would have been futile in Vernon\u2019s effort to receive postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The dissent concurs that most amendments should have been allowed, but contends that the amendment to the petitioner\u2019s 11th claim should have been disallowed because it was futile. The petitioner sought to amend claim 11 by adding reference to \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, regarding the required mental state for finding one person accountable for the conduct of another. The point of claim 11 was that sentencing Vernon to death for torture committed by Lester violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the rule of proportionality established in <em>Enmund v. Florida </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140. Section 45-2-302(1), MCA, provides that before a person can be legally accountable for the conduct of another, he or she must share the mental state described in the statute defining the offense. While this is not the subsection pursuant to which the petitioner was charged, he presumably sought to argue by analogy that he could not be accountable for Lester\u2019s torture in order to satisfy the aggravating circumstance requirement for imposition of the death penalty. Since, as discussed later in this opinion, there is merit to the petitioner\u2019s proportionality argument, attempts to fortify the argument were not futile as a matter of law at the pleading stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Whether one person lives and another dies for conduct alleged to have occurred during the same transaction should not hinge on a district court\u2019s discretionary denial of a motion to amend a petition for postconviction relief. The District Court\u2019s denial of Vernon\u2019s motion to amend is particularly unreasonable in light of Rule 15(a)\u2019s admonition that \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d and based on the facts that in this case Vernon\u2019s motion to amend his petition was filed by the date the District Court had established for the amendment and no prejudice to the State was established which would justify its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court erred when it denied Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s motion to amend his amended petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Did the District Court err when it denied the petitioner the opportunity to present evidence at a hearing in support of all but one of his claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In his petition for postconviction relief, Vernon Kills On Top alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to trial, during trial, in the penalty phase of his case, and on appeal. The District Court denied Vernon the opportunity to present evidence at a hearing in support of all but one of his claims of ineffective assistance, and dismissed all but one claim by summary judgment. In order to avoid summary judgment, a party claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in a petition for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving facts justifying relief by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Peck </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 1, 3-4, 865 P.2d 304, 305; <em>Yother v. State </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 351, 355, 597 P.2d 79, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Vernon alleged that his counsel was ineffective for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">1. He had a conflict of interest based on his candidacy for county attorney which was inconsistent with his defense of Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">2. He had a strong antipathy for criminal defendants, as publicly stated in a book that he authored.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">3. He made numerous errors during trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">4. He associated with the victim\u2019s family during a party at a local hotel following Vernon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">5. He failed to have venue changed from Billings and failed to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>once the trial commenced in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">6. He failed to adequately investigate Diane Bull Coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">7. He failed to take advantage of numerous sources of impeachment of Diane Bull Coming from Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial, or to even order the transcript of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">8. He called a witness whose testimony was in fact more harmful than helpful to Vernon\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">9. He failed to object to improper closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">10. He failed to object to improper jury instructions regarding intoxication and flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">11. He failed to adequately investigate and discover mitigating evidence prior to the penalty phase of Vernon\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">12. He pressured Vernon into not testifying at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">In the amended petition for postconviction relief, Vernon also alleged that his counsel was ineffective for failing to cite leading authority on the court\u2019s duty to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses and on the court\u2019s improper use of Vernon\u2019s silence against him at the time of sentencing. Finally, Vernon moved to amend his petition to allege that his counsel was ineffective because of his failure to obtain a psychiatric evaluation of Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">Attached to the petition for postconviction relief, or provided later, were numerous documents, including affidavits from several attorneys which supported some, but not all of Vernon\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">A hearing was granted by the District Court during which Vernon was allowed to submit evidence in support of his claim that he had been prevented by his trial counsel from testifying at either his trial or his sentencing hearing. During that hearing, a copy of a book authored by his trial counsel and entitled <em>Death Sentence, Murder on the Prairie </em>was admitted as an exhibit. In that book, the author described another murder case which he had handled as a prosecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ing attorney. However, Vernon\u2019s postconviction attorney was precluded from asking him questions about the book in an effort to establish anti-defendant sentiment on his part. Specifically, Vernon sought to introduce and have explained the following passages from his trial attorney\u2019s book which had been published in 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">A theme of the book is the war between good and evil, represented by law enforcement versus those who would frustrate law enforcement. The high intensity and many dimensions of that struggle extend from the Montana prairie to the highest court, from investigative science and psychoanalysis to prison breakouts and a kidnap-rape-murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">Ultimately each individual, whether law officer, attorney, juror, judge, justice or reader, decides for himself which side must win and thereby influences the result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">Criminal prosecution at its best creates a naked struggle between good and evil. The good forces use their weapons of scientific investigation, exposure of the truth at public trials and in the media, and the threat and use of punishment against the wicked. The evil forces counter with distortion and lies, secrecy, delay and every device that diminishes the good weapons. Can we doubt that God is involved in these titanic clashes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">It is frustrating to see the evil force apparently succeed, as murderers and other criminals go undetected or are freed on technicalities, and big lies masquerade popularly as the truth. It is most unfortunate in capital cases to have the federal court system duplicate the already redundant, multiple reviews of the state court. Since we have so little faith in our courts, and since our courts have so little faith in themselves, it is not surprising that our courts are so ineffective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">What a shame that Peggy Harstad\u2019s murderers could formulate and carry out her death in a few hours, but our court system waits ten years or more to respond with equal justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Following the District Court\u2019s hearing, findings of fact and conclusions of law were entered pursuant to which that part of Vernon\u2019s ineffective assistance claim which alleged that he had been denied the opportunity to testify was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The State contends that the District Court properly dismissed all but one of Vernon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims by sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>mary judgment because before he was entitled to a hearing he had to make a substantial showing of ineffective assistance by use of affidavits, records, or other evidence as required by \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">(1) The petition for postconviction relief must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">(c) have attached any affidavits, records, or other evidence supporting its allegations or state why the evidence is not attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aml\">This Court has interpreted \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, to require that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be grounded on facts in the record and not merely on conclusory allegations. <em>Eiler v. State </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 39, 42-43, 833 P.2d 1124, 1127; <em>State v. McColley </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 524, 527, 807 P.2d 1358, 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The State further contends that the petition\u2019s general conclusory allegations did not meet the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, for proof of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part test requires that the defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Under similar circumstances in <em>Fitzpatrick v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 310, 638 P.2d 1002, we reversed a district court\u2019s summary dismissal of a petition for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In that case we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">We determine that an evidentiary hearing is necessary on petitioner\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel both at trial and at sentencing. In his petition, <em>Fitzpatrick </em>alleged that his court-appointed counsel failed to adequately investigate and prepare a defense, and that he was unfamiliar with critical areas of the applicable law. He cited numerous and substantial facts to support his allegations, which were found to be speculative and conjectural by the district judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Petitioner is entitled to have at his trial \u201ceffective assistance of counsel acting within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State v. Rose </em>(1980), [187 Mont. 74, 86-87] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>608 P.2d 1074, 1081, 37 St. Rep. 642, 649-50. From the information presented in Fitzpatrick\u2019s petition, we cannot say, as the district judge did, that \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief....\u201d Section 46-21-201(1), MCA. Many of the errors of which petitioner complains involve failures of counsel to act, i.e., omissions rather than commissions, and a mere review of the record cannot show that petitioner is entitled to no relief on these grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">We find an abuse of discretion in the district judge\u2019s dismissal of these claims. We do not hold that petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel, but we do find that his allegations were sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing on the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALu\"><em>Fitzpatrick, </em>194 Mont. at 318, 638 P.2d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Likewise, in this case several of Vernon\u2019s allegations that he received ineffective assistance of counsel were sufficiently articulated and documented that a hearing was required. We hold that he was entitled to a hearing regarding four of his claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">First, we hold that Vernon is entitled to a hearing based on two of his claims of conflict of interest. Specifically, we hold that Vernon\u2019s claims that his attorney had a conflict of interest based on (1) his campaign for the office of county attorney which was allegedly based on a promise to crack down on crime, and (2) his hostility toward criminal defendants as evidenced by his book entitled <em>Death Sentence, Murder on the Prairie, </em>if true, may have deprived Vernon of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment guarantee comprises both the right to reasonably competent counsel and the right to that counsel\u2019s undivided loyalty. <em>Fitzpatrick v. McCormick </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 869 F.2d 1247, 1251; <em>Mannhalt v. Reed </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 847 F.2d 576, 579. The United States Supreme Corut enunciated the standard for establishing a violation of the Sixth Amendment based on an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333. In <em>Cuyler, </em>the Court stated that in order to establish a Sixth Amendment violation based on conflict ofinterest, a defendant must show that (1) an actual conflict of interest existed, and (2) that actual conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1718. In this case, although Vernon presented documentation of his attorney\u2019s apparent conflict of interest, we hold that a hearing is necessary to determine the extent of that conflict and to determine whether the conflict adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>affected his lawyer\u2019s performance in either the trial, the sentencing, or the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Second, we hold that Vernon is entitled to a hearing based on his claims that (1) his attorney failed to take advantage of the transcript from Lester\u2019s trial which allegedly included numerous opportunities to impeach Diane Bull Coming, and (2) his attorney failed to adequately investigate Diane\u2019s background prior to trial and therefore was not prepared to adequately cross-examine her at the time of trial. It is well established that \u201ccounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. To that end, courts have long recognized that an attorney\u2019s failure to investigate potential defense witnesses may fall below the level of competent representation required by professional standards and the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Code v. Montgomery </em>(11th Cir. 1986), 799 F.2d 1481, 1483; <em>Gomez v. Beto </em>(5th Cir. 1972), 462 F.2d 596, 597. Indeed, \u201c[o]ne of the primary duties defense counsel owes to his client is the duty to prepare himself adequately prior to trial.\u201d <em>Magill v. Dugger </em>(11th Cir. 1987), 824 F.2d 879, 886. We hold therefore that a hearing is required in this case to determine whether Vernon was deprived of a fair trial by virtue of his counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate Diane Bull Coming prior to trial and to make use of Diane\u2019s prior trial testimony during cross-examination of her at Vernon\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We conclude that the remaining allegations of ineffective counsel are either inadequately supported in Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, or relate to the sentencing phase, and therefore, based on the later conclusions in this opinion, are no longer relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Therefore, we reverse in part and affirm in part the District Court\u2019s order which dismissed Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and we remand this case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing at which the petitioner is entitled to present evidence in support of his remaining claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Did the District Court err when it held that nine of the petitioner\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res </em>judicata?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The doctrine of <em>\u201c[r]es judicata </em>bars reconsideration in a post-conviction relief proceeding of claims previously raised and considered on direct <em>appeal.\u201d Hawkins v. State </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 348, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>351, 790 P.2d 990, 992. The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>has, in fact, been extended to petitions for postconviction relief in death penalty cases in spite of the argument that \u201c[t]he Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires greater reliability of judgments in capital cases.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 310, 317, 638 P.2d 1002, 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">This Court has cited the policy considerations of judicial economy and judicial finality as the basis for the doctrine of <em>res judicata. See, e.g., State v. Black </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 39, 44, 798 P.2d 530, 533; <em>State v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 463, 758 P.2d 268, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">However, the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>as it applies to postconviction relief proceedings, has been judicially adopted and is not provided for by statute in Montana. In fact, the Montana Legislature has specifically chosen not to a adopt the statutory codification of <em>res judicata </em>set forth in the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">As the United State Supreme Court stated in <em>Sanders v. United States </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">The judge is permitted, not compelled, to decline to entertain [a successive <em>habeas corpus </em>application on previously litigated grounds], and then only if he \u201cis satisfied that the ends of justice will not be served\u201d by inquiring into the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\"><em>Sanders, </em>373 U.S. at 12, 83 S.Ct. at 1075:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The criteria for the application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>which is followed in Montana was most recently set forth in <em>State v. Baker </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 273, 282, 901 P.2d 54, 59, where this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-P\">We will apply the bar of res judicata to the re-litigation of issues already determined on direct appeal if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">(1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">In this case, we conclude that, with the exception of those claims which challenge the imposition of the death sentence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>disproportionality pursuant to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, the ends of justice are not served by reaching the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims a second time. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s claims numbered 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 14 are barred by <em>res judicata </em>is affirmed. To the contrary, the \u201cends of justice\u201d do compel reconsideration of the petitioner\u2019s death sentence in light of this State\u2019s constitutional prohibition against the infliction of cruel or unusual punishments. Mont. Const., art. II, \u00a7 22. As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted: \u201cConventional notions of finality of litigation have no place where life or liberty is at stake and infringement of constitutional rights is alleged.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>373 U.S. at 8, 83 S.Ct. at 1073. This sentiment was recently echoed by the Indiana Supreme Court in a similar felony murder death penalty case when that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">With due respect for the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>this Court has always maintained the option of reconsidering earlier cases in order to correct error. \u201cA court has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance, although as a rule courts should be loathe to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as where the initial decision was \u2018clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finality and fairness are both important goals. When faced with an apparent conflict between them, this Court unhesitatingly chooses the latter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKU\"><em>State v. Huffman </em>(Ind. 1994), 643 N.E.2d 899, 901 (emphasis added; citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In addition, the Montana Supreme Court has always recognized an exception to the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>under circumstances which are present in this case. We noted that exception in <em>State v. Zimmerman </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 179, 185, 573 P.2d 174, 178, when we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">In any event an exception to this general rule exists where the case must be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings because of reversal on an unrelated issue. In such case this Court may correct a manifest error in its former opinion and announce a different ruling to be applied prospectively to future proceedings in the case. This exception to the general rule is recognized in Montana at least since 1955.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In <em>Lester Kills On Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 901 P.2d 1368, we vacated the death sentence imposed on Lester Kills On Top based on the State\u2019s failure to disclose potentially exculpatory information about its principal witness, Diane Bull Coming, in violation of <em>Brady </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Specifically, we held that the State had a duty to disclose Bull Coining\u2019s allegation that she was raped by a jailer while in custody in Custer County for charges related to this case and that she had previously been convicted of misdemeanor assault, misdemeanor theft, and other misdemeanors. <em>Lester Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 43, 901 P.2d at 1375. We concluded that while Lester\u2019s conviction was sufficiently supported by other evidence that the outcome would probably not have been different even with the exculpatory evidence, we could not say the same about the punishment which was imposed. We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">Focusing on Bull Coming\u2019s undisclosed rape allegation and on Bull Coming\u2019s undisclosed criminal record, which included convictions for misdemeanor assault and theft, we conclude that our confidence in the sentence is undermined. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">... We hold that there is a reasonable probability that, had Bull Coming\u2019s rape allegation and criminal record been provided to Appellant, the result of the sentencing proceeding could have been different. Therefore, we vacate Appellant\u2019s sentences imposed for robbery, aggravated assault, and deliberate homicide and remand to the trial court for resentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\"><em>Lester Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 45, 901 P.2d at 1376-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Our holding in Lester\u2019s case requires that no less be done in Vernon\u2019s case. Bull Coming was the principal witness who linked Vernon to the kidnapping of John Martin Etchemendy, Jr., and the person on whose testimony Vernon\u2019s death sentence was largely based.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Therefore, we conclude that for a second reason we are not precluded from reconsidering the constitutionality of petitioner\u2019s death sentence pursuant to this petition for postconviction relief. Since this case must, at a minimum, be remanded to the District Court for resentencing based on the State\u2019s violation <em>of Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, and pursuant to our decision in <em>Lester Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. 32, 901 P.2d 1368, the District Court may correct any former error in its or our former opinion and apply a different rule prospectively to future proceedings in this case. <em>Zimmerman, </em>175 Mont. at 185, 573 P.2d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Is the imposition of the death penalty based on a conviction for aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicide disproportionate to the petitioner\u2019s conduct and therefore in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, when the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tioner was not personally involved in and not present when injuries were inflicted which caused the victim\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">At this point it is necessary to review the evidence which led to Vernon Kills on Top\u2019s conviction for aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicide and his sentence to death for those crimes. While our prior opinion accepted the testimony of Diane Bull Coming at face value, and based our result largely on that testimony, a closer review of the record is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On October 17,1987, Vernon and Lester Kills On Top, Doretta Four Bear, and Diane Bull Coming were drinking at the Golden West Lounge in Miles City, Montana. After they left the bar, had gotten in their vehicle, and were about to leave, they were approached by John Martin Etchemendy, Jr., who stated that he had misplaced his vehicle and asked them for their help finding it. They agreed to help him and he got in the back seat of their vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">After a brief effort to locate Etchemendy\u2019s vehicle, Diane spoke to the Kills On Top brothers in the language of the Northern Cheyenne and Vernon, who was driving, reversed directions and headed out of town. When he asked where they were going, Etchemendy was told by Diane that they were headed to Broadus. According to Doretta, Etchemendy originally agreed, but subsequently changed his mind after being assaulted by Lester and Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">According to Doretta, several altercations occurred involving Lester, Vernon, and Etchemendy between Miles City and Broadus. During one fight involving Lester and Etchemendy in the back seat of the vehicle, Diane removed Etchemendy\u2019s wallet from his pocket. At that time, Lester was holding him and Vernon was driving the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Although Doretta testified that Vernon participated in beating Etchemendy during the trip, including the first altercation, she stated in her first written statement immediately following the incident that only Lester had initially fought with \u201cthe white guy.\u201d She testified at trial that at some point during the trip Etchemendy was told by Vernon to take his clothes off and, by someone she could not identify, to get in the trunk. However, prior to trial in her written statement she stated that it was Lester who told the victim to take his clothes off and get in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Doretta also told Vernon\u2019s attorney, in the presence of her attorney and the Deputy County Attorney, that she did not actually see Vernon hit or strike Etchemendy and that during the second scuffle outside the vehicle after leaving Miles City she saw Vernon standing there while Etchemendy wrestled on the ground with Lester.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>After Etchemendy entered the trunk, Doretta never saw him again. When the group arrived in Rabbit Town on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, Doretta left the group and knew nothing more about what occurred later that day or the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Flora Parker was a friend of Doretta. She testified that Doretta arrived at her house early in the morning on October 17 after she left the Kills On Tbp brothers and Diane Bull Coming. She related what Doretta told her at that time. Doretta\u2019s statements at that time apparently placed most responsibility for kidnapping and beating Etchemendy on Lester and Diane and attributed little culpability to Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">While in Ashland, the group picked up LaVonne Quiroz. She testified that when they left Ashland she was driving; Vernon was in the front seat, and they were returning to Miles City until Lester awoke and told them to turn around and proceed in the other direction. She first learned that there was someone in the trunk after they had arrived in Broadus and Etchemendy informed them that he had to go to the bathroom. She stated that he was allowed to do so outside of Biddle and described several other stops between Broadus and Gillette. During these stops she described Lester and Diane as the principal actors and Vernon as a passive participant. She also indicated that Lester and Diane were principally responsible for cashing Etchemendy\u2019s checks on the way to Gillette and that some of the money they received was distributed to her and Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">LaVonne testified that after they had arrived in Gillette, while Etchemendy was still in the trunk of their vehicle, Lester took the keys from her and left with Diane. Vernon was surprised and angry that they had left. She and Vernon were later called by Diane and told to meet them at another location in Gillette. However, when they did meet them it was apparent that Etchemendy was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Before Lester and Diane left with the vehicle, Etchemendy was alive and sufficiently active that he was creating a disturbance in front of the bar where the group had stopped to drink. They were sufficiently concerned about the disturbance that LaVonne moved the vehicle around to the alley behind the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">LaVonne testified that at no time during the entire trip did Vernon express any interest in hurting the victim and that at one point while in Gillette Lester had agreed with Vernon to take Etchemendy back to Miles City, but that at that point Diane got mad at both of them. LaVonne testified that it was originally Diane\u2019s idea to treat Etchemendy as a hostage and that when the brothers discussed returning him to Miles City, she stated: \u201cLet\u2019s use him for all he\u2019s got.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>LaVonne testified that Vernon was not present when Etchemendy was killed and had no idea that it was going to happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Lester Kills On Top also testified at his brother\u2019s trial. He stated that it was he, not Vernon, who fought with Etchemendy between Miles City and Ashland, that it was Diane who ordered Etchemendy into the trunk, and that it was Diane\u2019s idea to kill the victim. He testified that Vernon had never expressed any interest in hurting Etchemendy while in Gillette and had no knowledge of what he and Diane planned to do when they left the Lobby Bar with Etchemendy in the trunk of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Prior to testifying in this case, Diane Bull Coming, who by all other accounts was the principal actor, entered into a plea agreement with the State pursuant to which she pled guilty to the offense of robbery and the State agreed to recommend a maximum penalty of forty years. As part of the plea agreement, she agreed to testify in the two Kills On Top trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">At the time she entered into the seven or eight page plea bargain agreement, she had been charged with robbery and aggravated kidnapping and she knew the possible penalty was death or a life sentence. Pursuant to the plea agreement, she was classified a nondangerous offender for purposes of parole, which meant that she was eligible for parole in eight years. She had also been advised that with good time she may serve less than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Another part of the plea agreement provided that if she changed her testimony from what she had indicated it would be prior to entering into the plea agreement, the agreement would be revoked and the prior charges reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Diane\u2019s description of the chronology of events was generally consistent with what has already been described, except that she minimized her own culpability and placed greater blame for harm to the victim on the Kills On Top brothers. Diane was also the only witness who was present at the time when Etchemendy was killed and described how his life was ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Several of the facts related by Diane were relied on by this Court in its prior opinion. For example, she stated that it was Vernon, not her, who went through Etchemendy\u2019s wallet in search of credit cards and money; that Vernon participated in at least one of Etchemendy\u2019s beatings and in another altercation with Etchemendy on the way to Ashland; and that Vernon agreed with Lester at some point when Lester exclaimed that because Etchemendy could identify them, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>However, Diane\u2019s testimony was riddled with inconsistencies. She also testified that it was Lester, not Vernon, who forced Etchemendy into the trunk of the vehicle; she testified that Vernon, on occasion, inquired of Etchemendy about his well-being; and that when Etchemendy\u2019s checks were forged and used to purchase drinks and groceries, Vernon remained in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Most significantly, Diane testified that when Lester told Vernon, while in the bar in Gillette, that they had to get rid of Etchemendy, Vernon asked him to wait. She testified that when Lester brought it up again, Vernon again asked him to wait but that Lester accused him of stalling and demanded the keys to the vehicle. She testified that when Vernon produced the keys she and Lester left the bar, headed to a rural gravel road, and at that location Lester severely beat the victim and caused the injuries which ultimately led to his death. However, when they returned to Gillette Etchemendy was apparently still alive. It was at that point that Diane, according to her testimony, called Vernon and requested that he rejoin them. He asked whether Etchemendy was still alive and was told that he was. Only after getting off the phone was she advised by Lester that Etchemendy was now dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">According to Diane she passed out a short time later and the next thing she remembers was when she awoke and was in the vehicle on the interstate highway heading back to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Based on even Diane\u2019s testimony, Vernon Kills On Top was not present when Etchemendy was killed, and he did not participate in any act which caused Etchemendy\u2019s death. While she did testify that on two separate occasions he agreed that something would have to be done with the victim, she also testified that he sought to postpone any further harm to the victim and that after his expression of reluctance, she and Lester took the victim to another location where Lester performed the murderous act himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Even that part of Diane\u2019s testimony which suggested Vernon\u2019s acquiescence in Etchemendy\u2019s murder is questionable in light of her affidavit filed in this proceeding in which she states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">In regard to the time when the victim\u2019s blindfold was removed, Lester was hollering at everyone and Lester was giving everybody orders. When Vem took the blindfold off the victim, Lester got mad and said now he knows what we look like so we have to kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Vem grunted and I, at the time, interpreted this as agreement. In response to a question by Mr. Ranney, I agree that it is possible that my interpretation could have been wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On cross-examination, Diane stated that at no time while Etchemendy was in the trunk of the group\u2019s vehicle did Vernon ever strike him, injure him, or take anything of monetary value from him. She agreed that he never initiated talk of murder other than in response to Lester and then he said \u2018later.\u201d She stated that during conversations with Lester after Etchemendy\u2019s death, Lester took credit for the beatings and the killing of Etchemendy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">From this Court\u2019s thorough review of the record in this case, it is undisputed that Vernon Kills On Top was not present at and did not participate in the infliction of injuries which caused the death of John Martin Etchemendy, Jr. Furthermore, any evidence that Vernon had any intent to kill Etchemendy is at best equivocal and unpersuasive. The only credible evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The dissent criticizes the majority opinion for minimizing the evidence about the extent of Vernon\u2019s participation in Etchemendy\u2019s death, and concentrating primarily on the testimony of Diane Bull Coming. The problem with the concern expressed by the dissent is that the testimony of Diane Bull Coming is the only evidence which linked Vernon Kills On Top to the death of John Martin Etchemendy, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In addition, the dissent repeatedly refers to factual matters in the record which have been ignored by the majority. However, what is clear from the dissent\u2019s recitation of the facts is that the author of the dissent has not personally reviewed the record to which the author refers, but instead merely recites this Court\u2019s prior characterization of the record which was anything but complete or accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The author of the majority opinion has personally reviewed every line of the extensive record on which the jury\u2019s verdict and the District Court\u2019s sentence were based, and can personally vouch for the accuracy of every factual characterization in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The following are several examples of inaccuracies found in this Court\u2019s previous opinion which are simply parroted by the dissent without further investigation or inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The dissent contends that Vernon Kills On Top participated in homicide committed by means of torture. However, nowhere in the record is there any evidence that Vernon Kills On Top participated in causing John Etchemendy\u2019s death. Nor is there any evidence that Vernon, at any time, tortured Etchemendy. We have previously approved the following definition of the term \u201ctorture\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Whoever purposely assaults another physically for the purpose of inflicting cruel suffering upon the person so assaulted for the particular purpose of enabling the assailant to either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">(a) extort anything from such person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">(b) or to persuade such person against his or her will; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">(c) to satisfy some other untoward propensity of the assailant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAI\"><em>State v. McKenzie III </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 481, 509, 608 P.2d 428, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The District Court concluded that Lester Kills On Top had tortured Etchemendy by the brutal manner in which he caused his death. However, even that conclusion was incorrect, based on our prior definition. Lester killed his victim in a brutal and clumsy fashion which surely resulted in a great deal of suffering. But he killed him to eliminate him as a witness, not to extort anything from him or persuade him to do anything. No one has alleged that subsection (c) is applicable. Furthermore, Vernon did not participate in the conduct which caused Etchemendy\u2019s death, and was not present at the time the acts occurred. The District Court first mischaracterized Lester\u2019s acts as torture, and then attributed them to Vernon by some unstated notion of accountability. However, pursuant to the individualized treatment required by statute in Montana, and rules of proportionality required by the United States and Montana Constitutions, the propriety of a death sentence must be evaluated based on the conduct of Vernon, and not by attributing to him the conduct of some other person which he neither participated in nor approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The dissent contends that Vernon was \u201cdirectly involved in the serious beating of the victim\u201d which was \u201cso severe it could have caused death even absent further infliction of physical violence.\u201d Neither is that correct. Dr. Robert Deters, the pathologist who performed an autopsy on Etchemendy and testified on behalf of the State, expressed the opinion that the cause of death was extensive and severe head injuries \u2014 specifically a cluster of five injuries on the left side of Etchemendy\u2019s head which crushed his skull. It was his opinion that the injury was caused by a rounded object like a stick or a bat. The only one who ever struck Etchemendy with any object other than his fist or foot was Lester Kills On Top.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Deters did testify that he also observed a subdural hematoma which had been caused prior to the fatal blows and which could have been caused by blows from hands or feet. However, he stated that before a subdural hematoma is lethal, it requires an accumulation of fifty millimeters of blood, and that in this case, even though any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>beatings in which Vernon participated occurred twelve hours prior to death, only twenty millimeters of blood had accumulated. In this case, the subdural hematoma observed could not have caused death unless combined with other injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The dissent contends that after beating Etchemendy, Vernon participated in placing him in the trunk of the vehicle where he did nothing for him in the ensuing twelve-hour period. However, neither is that contention (again lifted from the previous opinion) supported by the record. Whether Vernon had anything to do with placing Etchemendy in the trunk is anything but clear from the record. However, while Etchemendy was in the trunk, it was Vernon who let him out to go to the bathroom; Vernon who checked on his condition; and Vernon who incurred his brother\u2019s wrath by removing Etchemendy\u2019s blindfold so that he could go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The dissent contends that Vernon lifted the victim\u2019s wallet, cashed his checks, and distributed the proceeds. The only reliable evidence is that Diane Bull Coming confiscated Etchemendy\u2019s credit card and that Diane and Lester cashed Etchemendy\u2019s checks and divided the money. While a portion of the money was given to Vernon, he misplaced it, and even that portion was subsequently retrieved by Diane. Neither is the dissent correct when it repeats the allegation from this Court\u2019s previous opinion that Vernon did nothing in the pre-murder stages to prevent the homicide. According to even Diane\u2019s testimony, Vernon repeatedly stalled suggestions that Etchemendy be murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The dissent contends that the majority opinion is \u201cretrying\u201d matters here. The dissent mistakenly assumes that by characterizing the evidence, the majority opinion is somehow contrary to the jury\u2019s verdict. However, the jury made no findings of fact which could be inconsistent with those recited in the majority opinion, the jury simply returned a verdict that Vernon was guilty of robbery, aggravated kidnapping, and deliberate homicide. The majority opinion has done nothing to alter that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The only findings of fact entered in this case were those made by the District Court in support of its imposition of the death penalty. However, by statute, this Court is given a very clear responsibility to review a district court\u2019s findings in support of the death penalty, and that review is not limited to a determination of whether there is any evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings, as was suggested by this Court\u2019s prior opinion and is now asserted by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In the first place, the substantial evidence standard is not the standard by which we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>held <em>in Interstate Production Credit Association v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 820 P.2d 1285, that we will review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for the following criteria: (1) the Court will determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Court will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the evidence; and (3) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence and that evidence has not been misapprehended, this Court may still find \u201ca finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287 (citing <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co. </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed 746).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">However, our statutory obligation to review a district court\u2019s findings in support of a death penalty is even broader than the clearly erroneous standard. This Court\u2019s statutory obligation for the independent review of a death sentence is set forth in \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">The supreme court shall consider the punishment as well as any errors enumerated by way of appeal. <em>With regard to the sentence, the court shall </em>determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">(1) whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(2) <em>whether the evidence supports the judge\u2019s finding </em>of the existence or nonexistence of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances enumerated in 46-18-303 and 46-18-304; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">(3) whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. The court shall include in its decision a reference to those similar cases it took into consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">In this case, the District Court made several findings which it relied on for the imposition of a death sentence which clearly were not \u201csupported by the evidence.\u201d For example, the District Court found, as one of two aggravating circumstances which justified imposition of the death penalty, that: \u201cThe offense was Deliberate Homicide and was committed by means of torture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">However, for reasons previously stated, Etchemendy\u2019s death was not committed by means of torture. That finding was not supported by any evidence, regardless of what standard we apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Furthermore, for reasons previously noted, the District Court\u2019s findings that Vernon helped strip and place the victim in the trunk and agreed that the victim had to die, are not supported by credible evidence, and after thorough review of the record, we are left with a firm conviction that those findings are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Other than as mentioned above, there is nothing inconsistent with the majority\u2019s recitation of the facts and the findings of fact entered by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On the other hand, the District Court\u2019s critical finding to the effect that \u201cdefendant had no involvement [during] the period of time when the victim was finally beaten and killed by Lester Kills On Top,\u201d is completely consistent with the evidence and the majority opinion, and in fact, is a critical basis for this Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In response to the dissent\u2019s contention that the majority\u2019s recitation of facts is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s recitation of facts in its previous decision, it is sufficient to note, as pointed out previously, that several statements from the previous opinion were not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\n<em>The question we must decide is not whether Vernon Kills On Top can, under these circumstances, be convicted of aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicide and severely punished, including imprisonment for life. The question is whether under these circumstances the imposition of a death sentence is disproportionate to the degree of Vernon\u2019s culpability.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In his petition for postconviction relief, Vernon contends that imposition of the death penalty in his case violates both the requirement of individualized punishment and the proportionality requirement. Both requirements are mandated by the United States Constitution; in addition, proportionality is compelled by the Montana Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The proportionality requirement and the necessity of individualized punishment are derived from the Eighth Amendment, and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Justice O\u2019Connor explained the inter-relationship of the two principles in <em>Enmund v. Florida </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\"><em>[Coker v. Georgia </em>(1977), 433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 1140] teaches ... that proportionality-at least as regards capital punishment~not only requires an inquiry into contemporary standards as expressed by legislators and jurors, but also involves the notion that the magnitude of the punishment imposed must be related to the degree of the harm inflicted on the victim, as well as to the degree of the defendant\u2019s blameworthiness. Moreover, because they turn on considerations unique to each defendant\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>these latter factors underlying the concept of proportionality are reflected in this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, [98 S.Ct. 2954, 2965, 57 L.Ed.2d 973] (1978), that \u201cindividualized consideration [is] a constitutional requirement in imposing the death sentence\u201d (opinion of Berger, C.J.) (footnote omitted). See <em>id. </em>at 613, [98 S.Ct. at 2969 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\u201cthe Ohio judgment in this case improperly provided the death sentence for a defendant who only aided and abetted a murder, without permitting any consideration by the sentencing authority of the extent of her involvement, or the degree of her <em>mens rea, </em>in the commission of the homicide\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\n<em>In sum, in considering the petitioner\u2019s challenge, the Court should decide not only whether the petitioner\u2019s sentence of death offends contemporary standards as reflected in the responses of legislatures and juries, hut also whether it is disproportionate to the harm that the petitioner caused and to the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the crime, as well as whether the procedures under which the petitioner was sentenced satisfied the constitutional requirement of individualized consideration set forth in Lockett.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 815-16, 102 S.Ct. at 3386-87 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Although the Eighth Amendment ofthe U.S. Constitution contains no explicit prohibition against disproportionate sentences and no express mandate for individualized punishment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has held that the cruel and unusual punishment clause of that Amendment bans sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime for which the defendant is convicted. <em>See, e.g., Solem v. Helm </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637. In addition, in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (followed in <em>Lockett v.

In <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 290, 103 S.Ct. at 3009-10, Justice Powell noted that, as a matter of principal, \u201ca criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted,\u201d and that \u201cno penalty is <em>per se </em>constitutional.\u201d In addition, in the seminal proportionality case <em>of Enmund v. Florida </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 782, 797-98, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 3376-77, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140, the United States Supreme Court recognized that the death penalty is unique in its severity and irrevocability, and required that the State must focus on the defendant\u2019s personal intent, character, and culpability, and not merely the defendant\u2019s role as an accomplice, before the death penalty may be constitutionally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The Montana Constitution contains a provision virtually identical to its federal counterpart. Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, specifically provides that: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, or excessive fines imposed, or cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d Although that constitutional provision has not yet been applied in the proportionality context, proportionality review is specifically mandated by statute in Montana. As previously noted, \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA, while making no mention of a similar responsibility at the district court, requires the state Supreme Court to review the proportionality of each death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We now hold that pursuant to Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, the imposition of a death sentence by state courts in Montana must be reviewed for compliance with the proportionality and individualized treatment requirements set forth in <em>Enmund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Therefore, pursuant to the mandates of both the federal and state constitutions and the Montana Legislature, this Court must undertake a review of the proportionality of Vernon\u2019s sentence. We have divided our discussion of proportionality into Federal Proportionality Review and Montana Proportionality Review. We note at the outset that Vernon\u2019s sentence was reviewed on direct appeal pursuant to only the Eighth Amendment, and that a discussion of Montana\u2019s parallel prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was never undertaken by this Court. <em>See Vernon Kills On Top I </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 104-09, 793 P.2d 1273, 1306-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Based on an extremely narrow and unfounded application of \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, the dissent contends that because independent state grounds for proportionality were not argued on the previous appeal, consideration of our state constitution is precluded in this case. However, \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, simply precludes considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cgrounds for relief\u2019 that could have been, but were not raised by direct appeal. In this case, the \u201cground for relief\u2019 is that the sentence imposed on Vernon Kills On Top was disproportionate to the conduct for which he was convicted. The fact that that conclusion is based on one authority, as opposed to another, does not change the \u201cgrounds for relief \u2019 anymore than if the conclusion was based on a citation from <em>American Jurisprudence Second, </em>rather than <em>Corpus Juris Secundum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The issue of proportionality and individualized treatment has not been raised for the first time in this proceeding. It was raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">To first of all conclude that a procedural bar is more important than a human life, and then unreasonably and without authority construe the procedural bar more narrowly than it was ever intended in order to preclude consideration of an issue of such great importance, is not an approach supported by prior case law of this Court, nor commonly accepted notions of justice. The only principle applicable to this Court\u2019s reconsideration of the proportionality issue is the principle of <em>res judicata, </em>which has already been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">FEDERAL PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Enmund v. Florida </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140, and <em>Tison v. Arizona </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127, mark the starting point for federal proportionality review in the context of accomplice liability. In <em>Enmund, </em>the defendant drove a getaway car and his two colleagues killed two intended robbery victims. The Florida court sentenced the defendant to death for his conviction of murder, based on felony-murder and accomplice-liability theories. <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 786, 102 S.Ct. at 3370-71. The United States Supreme Court held that death is a disproportionate penalty \u201cfor one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 787, 801, 102 S.Ct. at 3371, 3378. The Court applied federal proportionality principles found in <em>Lockett, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, and <em>Woodson, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, and focused its inquiry on Enmund\u2019s personal culpability. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Enmund did not kill or intend to kill and thus his culpability is plainly different from that of the robbers who killed; yet the State treated them alike and attributed to Enmund the culpability of those who killed the [victims]. This was impermissible under the Eighth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\"><em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S at 798, 102 S.Ct. at 3377.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In 1987, the Court decided <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676. <em>Tison </em>did not overrule <em>Enmund-, </em>however, it arguably restricted its scope. Although the Tison brothers, like Enmund, did not kill or attempt to kill, their case was unlike Enmund\u2019s case in that their participation in the crime was judged \u201cmajor\u201d and their mental state \u201chighly culpable,\u201d \u2014 one that was characterized as showing \u201creckless indifference to human life.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 157-58, 107 S.Ct. at 1687-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The <em>Tison </em>defendants were brothers who had helped arrange the escape from prison of their father and his cell mate, both convicted murderers. Their getaway car broke down and the group decided to steal another car from a passing motorist. A family stopped to help the group and the group forced them off the highway and down a dirt road. The defendants\u2019father told his sons to return to the car for some water and when they returned the defendants witnessed their father and his cell mate shotgun the family to death. The defendants were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death under Arizona\u2019s felony-murder and accomplice liability statutes. <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 139-42, 107 S.Ct. at 1678-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On appeal, the defendants argued that their death sentences were disproportionate, and therefore, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as construed in <em>Enmund. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed and found that <em>Enmund </em>left open \u201cthe intermediate case of the defendant whose participation is major and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference to the value of human life.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 152, 107 S.Ct. at 1685. The Court addressed the defendants\u2019 contention that they did not, in <em>Enmund\u2019s </em>terms, \u201ckill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill,\u201d when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">A narrow focus on the question of whether or not a given defendant \u201cintended to kill,\u201d however, is a highly unsatisfactory means of definitively distinguishing the most culpable and dangerous of murderers. Many who intend to, and do, kill are not criminally liable at all \u2014 those who act in self-defense or with other justification or excuse. ... On the other hand, some nonintentional murderers may be among the most dangerous and inhumane of all \u2014 the person who tortures another not caring whether the victim lives or dies, or the robber who shoots someone in the course of the robbery, utterly indifferent to the fact that the desire to rob may have the unintended consequence of killing the victim as well as taking the victim\u2019s property. This reckless indifference to the value of human life may be every bit as shocking to the moral sense as an \u2018intent to kill.\u2019 ... [W]e hold that the reckless disregard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>human life implicit in knowingly engaging in criminal activities known to carry a grave risk of death represents a highly culpable mental state, a mental state that may be taken into account in making a capital sentencing judgment when that conduct causes its natural, though also not inevitable, lethal result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 157-58, 107 S.Ct. at 1687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Therefore, because the Tisons\u2019 participation in the underlying crime was deemed \u201csubstantial,\u201d in that each was \u201cactively involved in every element of the kidnapping-robbery and was physically present during the entire sequence of criminal activity culminating in the murder,\u201d and because actual armed escape and kidnapping involved a \u201creckless indifference to human life,\u201d the Court held that the Tisons\u2019 conduct did not fall within the confines of <em>Enmund. Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 158, 107 S.Ct. at 1688.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On the basis of <em>Enmund </em>and <em>Tison,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">[i]t is now clear, as a matter of federal proportionality principles, that capital punishment may be imposed on one who commits a homicide without the purpose or knowledge that death will result, at least to the extent that the defendant\u2019s conduct can be characterized as \u201crecklessly indifferent to human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>State v. Gerald </em>(N. J. 1988), 549 A.2d 792, 810. However, this approach has been criticized by both courts and scholars. As one author stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azf\">[T]he ... lack of an identifiable core inherent in the <em>Tison </em>rule renders it incapable of carrying out any constitutionally meaningful delineation between classes of felony murder accomplices because every felony murder accomplice arguably is recklessly indifferent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">...

Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>by manipulating the facts, or the terms of the new standard, lower courts are free to impose the death penalty on all felony murderers unless the court is presented with a fact pattern identical to that in the <em>Enmund </em>decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">She continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The <em>Tison </em>Court\u2019s imposition of the death penalty with only superficial regard to the defendant\u2019s \u201cblameworthiness\u201d has effectively allowed courts to disregard the defendant\u2019s state of mind or level of culpability in their evaluation of death sentences. Many courts have simply inferred the \u201creckless indifference to human life,\u201d required by <em>Tison </em>from a defendant\u2019s \u201cmajor participation\u201d in a felony, and have found the <em>Tison </em>standards are thus satisfied. By disregarding the teachings of <em>Furman [v. Georgia </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972)], <em>Gregg, </em>and <em>Coker </em>on how punishment must be proportionate to the crime, courts are imposing the death penalty arbitrarily and without regard to individual culpability, a result which would appear to overreach the Court\u2019s intent in <em>Tison </em>and violate the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Note, <em>Constitutionalizing the Death Penalty for Accomplices to Felony Murder, </em>26 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 463, 482, 489-490.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">This concern is echoed by others who criticize <em>Tison </em>for its new standards. For example, one author deplores the Court\u2019s use of the term \u201crecklessness\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">Not only is the Court\u2019s new language likely to lead to disparate applications among the states, but the standard also is inconsistent with the major principle of <em>Furman </em>and recognized in <em>Enmund. </em>Inherent in <em>Enmund\u2019s </em>requirement of an individualized consideration of culpability is the idea that the death penalty, typically a punishment reserved for first-degree murder, should not be inflicted on one whose level of culpability is not equivalent to that of other death penalty recipients. Thus, <em>Enmund </em>prohibited using the element of participation in the felony to supply the intent requirement for first-degree murder at the sentencing stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">The <em>Tison </em>Court further confuses the issue by collapsing the element of a high level of participation in the underlying felony into the reckless indifference element.... Collapsing the issues in this way endangers the individualized consideration of culpability required in death penalty cases ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Note, <em>Overstepping Precedent?

As for deterrence, the <em>Enmund </em>Court made clear that only those who premeditate and deliberate can be deterred. The Court stated \u201cif a person does not intend that life will be taken, or that lethal force will be employed by others, the possibility that the death penalty will be imposed for vicarious felony murder will not \u2018enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Note, <em>Overstepping Precedent?, </em>66 N.C. L. Rev. at 833 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Other scholars have lamented the application of the death penalty to the \u201cnontriggerman\u201d accomplice. As Richard Garnett stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">[T]he nontriggerman convicted of felony murder is three <em>times removed </em>from the locus of blame: the killing is murder by reason of the felony murder rule, the defendant is responsible for the killing under accomplice liability principles, and he faces the executioner because of the manner in which another person killed. Such a defendant may be at the outer reaches of personal culpability, yet still face death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Richard W.

J. 2471, 2473 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Courts, too, have criticized the state of federal proportionality review in the <em>post-Tison </em>era. As the New Jersey Supreme Court noted in <em>Gerald:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">The failure to distinguish, for purpose of punishment, those who intend the death of their victim from those who do not does violence to the basic principle stated [in <em>Tison] </em>that \u201cthe more purposeful the conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>more severely it ought to be punished.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 156, 107 S.Ct. at 1687.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIA\"><em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Vernon Kills On Top I, </em>we cited <em>Tison </em>for the proposition that \u201cmajor participation in the felony committed, combined with reckless indifference to human life, is sufficient to satisfy the <em>Enmund </em>culpability requirement,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe fact that [Vernon] did not deliver the final fatal blows does not preclude imposition of the death penalty.\u201d <em>Vernon Kills On Top I, </em>243 Mont. at 106, 793 P.2d at 1307. This Court then considered (despite Vernon\u2019s failure to argue the issue) the statutory requirement that the sentence not be excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crimes and the defendants. The Court\u2019s brief discussion on proportionality included a list of the cases to which it had compared Vernon\u2019s sentence. <em>Vernon Kills On Top I, </em>243 Mont. at 108, 793 P.2d at 1308. These included: <em>State v. Lester Kills on Top </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 378, 787 P.2d 336; <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 345, 761 P.2d 352; <em>State v. Keefe </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 258, 759 P.2d 128; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 461, 705 P.2d 1087; <em>State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 187, 606 P.2d 1343; <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 299, 605 P.2d 1000; <em>State v. McKenzie </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 278, 557 P.2d 1023. The court noted that each of the cases, except <em>Keefe, </em>involved a death penalty imposed for the aggravated kidnapping and subsequent death of a victim. <em>Vernon Kills On Top I, </em>243 Mont. at 109, 793 P.2d at 1308. This Court concluded that Vernon was a major participant in the crimes committed, and that he exhibited a reckless disregard for human life. <em>Vernon Kills On Top I, </em>243 Mont. at 109, 793 P.2d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Our prior review, however, was flawed based on even the <em>Tison </em>standard. First, the cases the Court \u201ccompared\u201d are markedly dissimilar to Vernon\u2019s case because, while Vernon was not present at the actual murder and arguably displayed no intent to kill the victim, the defendant in each of the \u201ccomparable\u201d cases was the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>actor (and not the \u201cnontriggerman\u201d) in the actual killing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, Vernon\u2019s sentence was not compared to that of Diane Bull Coming, who, based on everyone\u2019s testimony, including her own, was more directly involved in Etchemendy\u2019s death than Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Second, Vernon\u2019s case presents a situation more similar to the facts of <em>Enmund </em>than the facts of <em>Tison. </em>The defendants in <em>Tison </em>provided firearms to convicted murderers to aid their escape from prison and were admittedly willing to kill, if necessary, in furtherance of that escape. In addition, the <em>Tison </em>court attached significance to the fact that the defendants were physically present when the murders were committed. Justice O\u2019Connor, speaking for the majority, emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\">Far from merely sitting in a car away from the actual scene of the murders acting as the getaway driver to a robbery, each petitioner was actively involved in every element of the kidnapping-robbery <em>and was physically present during the entire sequence of criminal activity culminating in the murder of the Lyons family and the subsequent flight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 158, 107 S.Ct. at 1688 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">For these reasons we reverse our prior conclusion that based on a review for proportionality pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the State proved sufficient culpability on the part of Vernon for the death of John Martin Etchemendy, Jr., to justify imposition of a death sentence. However, because we conclude that <em>Tison </em>does not provide sufficient guidance for future determination of who can and who cannot be constitutionally sentenced to death under Montana\u2019s Constitution, we choose to afford clearer protection consistent with the standard in <em>Enmund </em>under Montana\u2019s Constitution, and therefore, the following discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>STATE PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted. Montana may interpret this section more strictly than the United States Supreme Court interprets the federal equivalent because \u201c[s]tates are free to grant citizens greater protections based on state constitutional provisions than the United States Supreme Court divines from the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 383, 901 P.2d 61, 75. As we stated in Bullock: \u2018We have chosen not to \u2018march lock-step\u2019 with the United States Supreme Court, even when applying nearly identical language.\u201d Bullock, 272 Mont. at 384, 901 P.2d at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the importance of the state court\u2019s role in death sentence review. In <em>Cabana v. Bullock </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 376, 106 S.Ct. 689, 88 L.Ed.2d 704, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded a case to the state court system to make factual findings consistent with the Eighth Amendment as mandated by <em>Enmund. </em>According to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">[I]t is the [state court], therefore, not the federal habeas corpus court, which should first provide [the defendant] with that which he has not yet had and to which he is constitutionally entitled \u2014 a reliable determination as to whether he is subject to the death penalty....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\"><em>Cabana, </em>474 U.S. at 391, 106 S.Ct. at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The Court further noted that \u201c [considerations of federalism and comity counsel respect for the ability of state courts to carry out their role as the primary protectors of the rights of criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Cabana, </em>474 U.S. at 391, 106 S.Ct. at 699 (citing <em>Younger v. Harris </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669). The Supreme Court has also observed that in capital cases, as in other constitutional contexts, the states \u201care free to provide greater protections in their criminal justice system than the Federal Constitution requires.\u201d <em>California v. Ramos </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 992, 1013-14, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 3460, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">It is therefore appropriate to analyze the death penalty pursuant to not only the federal constitution, but our state constitutional standards as well. This approach was undertaken by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d 792. In <em>Gerald, </em>the issue before the court was \u201cwhether a sentence of death is disproportionate for a defendant who had no intent to kill his or her victim, but rather intended only to inflict serious bodily injury, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the injury did in fact result in death.\u201d <em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d at 811. The court first worked through the federal proportionality analysis and determined that: \u201cDefendant\u2019s conduct in this case appears (or so a jury could find) to fall within the <em>Tison </em>category of nonintentional murders that manifest a reckless indifference to human life.\u201d <em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d at 810. However, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><em>The federal constitutional analysis, of course, does not end the inquiry </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">... Resort to a state-constitutional analysis is especially appropriate in light of the fact that \u201ccapital punishment is a matter of particular state interest or local concern and does not require a uniform national policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d at 810-11 (citation omitted). The <em>Gerald </em>Court did look to the Supreme Court for guidance where it deemed the Court\u2019s language persuasive:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We sometimes look to aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional analysis, where persuasive, for guidance in establishing principles under our state constitution. We observe at the outset that the death penalty statute must \u201climit imposition of the penalty to what is assumed to be the small group for which it is appropriate.\u201d (Citing Furman <em>v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. at 310, [92 S.Ct. at 2762-63] (White, J., concurring).) We also record our agreement with the <em>Tison </em>Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[d]eeply ingrained in our legal tradition is the idea that the more purposeful the conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the more severely it ought to be punished.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 156, 107 S.Ct. at 1687.</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\"><em>Gerald, </em>549 A.2d at 811 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Although we agree with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding and rationale in <em>Enmund </em>and the language from <em>Tison </em>cited by the New Jersey Court in <em>Gerald, </em>we do not believe that wholesale application of <em>Tison </em>to the Montana Constitution would sufficiently distinguish between various forms of conduct for purposes of imposing the death penalty. Montana\u2019s statute which requires proportionality review strengthens our conclusion, as does the U.S. Supreme Court's apparent inclination to further erode its holding in <em>Enmund. </em>As one source stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOk\">Though <em>[Pulley v. </em>Harris<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1984), 465 U.S. 37, 104 S.Ct. 871, 79 L.Ed.2d 29] arguably departs from the Court\u2019s previous ringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>endorsement of proportionality review as a constitutional requirement, it does not contradict the language in <em>[Gregg v. Georgia </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859] indicating that proportionality review is important because it can help eliminate \u201cwanton\u201d and \u201cfreakish\u201d death sentences. <em>In addition, Pulley is not particularly important in states that, by providing statutorily mandated proportionality review, go beyond what the United States Constitution requires.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Comment, <em>A Critical Evaluation of State Supreme Court Proportionality Review in Death Sentence Cases, </em>73 Iowa L. Rev. 719, 725 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Tennessee is another state with a statutory requirement of proportionality review. In 1992 the Tennessee Supreme Court addressed the issue of the proportionality of the death penalty to the crime of felony murder. <em>State v. Middlebrooks </em>(Tenn. 1992), 840 S.W.2d 317, 335-47. Like the <em>Gerald </em>court, the Tennessee Supreme Court first applied \u201cthe minimum standards for determining whether a sentence of death may be constitutionally imposed under the United States Constitution for felony murder\u201d by applying the <em>Enmund/Tison </em>analysis. <em>Middlebrooks, </em>840 S.W.2d at 337. The Court continued, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">These federal standards do not, however, answer the question under the state constitution .... [W]e may not impinge upon the minimum level of protection established by Supreme Court interpretations of the federal constitutional guarantee, but may impose higher standards and stronger protections than those set by the federal constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\"><em>Middlebrooks, </em>840 S.W.2d at 338. The Court ultimately relied on its own statutory provision to determine that its state constitution required stronger protections for felony murderers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">An integral part of the death penalty statute that must be construed in pari materia is the automatic review of every death sentence by this Court. Subsection (c) of that statute enumerates our duties that include eliminating any arbitrary, excessive, or disproportionate imposition of the death penalty. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">Accordingly, rather than an absolute rule of <em>per se </em>disproportionality, this Court has in the past relied on its statutory duty of review under [Tennessee statute] to assure that the sentence <em>in each case </em>is not disproportionate or excessive. We agree with that approach and with Justice Blackmun\u2019s rejection of the <em>per se </em>proportionality approach in his dissent in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>586, 613-619, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2969-71, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. He observed in that connection that a sentence in felony murder should be based on evidence of a particular defendant\u2019s participation in homicide and his mens rea in regard to the homicidal act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">We, therefore, reaffirm the rejection of a <em>per se </em>proportionality approach in favor of the required statutory proportionality review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYa\"><em>Middlebrooks, </em>840 S.W.2d at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Like the Tennessee court, we do not today adopt a rule that the death sentence can never be imposed on someone convicted of felony murder. What we do hold is that, pursuant to statute and the Montana Constitution, each case has to be reviewed on the basis of its unique facts to assure that the death sentence is not disproportionate to the degree of that defendant\u2019s culpability for a victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We reject wholesale adoption of the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Tison </em>because we agree that it lacks any \u201cidentifiable core\u201d which provides us with a meaningful way of delineating under our own constitution between those felony murder participants who possess sufficient culpability to warrant imposition of the death penalty and those who lack any intent whatsoever to cause the death of another. We conclude that a finding of mere \u201creckless indifference\u201d is not sufficient for imposition of the death penalty under the proportionality review required pursuant to the Montana Constitution, and that the \u201creckless indifference\u201d standard allows courts to provide only superficial regard to a defendant\u2019s \u201cblameworthiness\u201d before imposing a punishment, which, if imposed without regard to blameworthiness, would be cruel and unusual. Furthermore, we conclude that imposition of the death penalty without a requirement that there have been some intent to kill on the part of the defendant would serve no purpose of deterrence. If a person has no intent to kill from the beginning, then the fact that he might suffer the imposition of a death penalty cannot \u201center into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 799, 102 S.Ct. at 2931 (quoting <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 186, 96 S.Ct. at 2931). Although the deterrent purpose of the death penalty is not its only purpose (see <em>Enmund </em>and <em>Tison), </em>it is one factor to consider in the course of our individualized review for proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">After thorough review of the record in this case, we conclude, on independent state constitutional grounds, that because Vernon Kills On Top was not present when John Etchemendy was killed, did not inflict the injuries which caused his death, and because there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>no reliable evidence that he intended his death \u2014 but instead evidence that he sought to avoid it \u2014 the imposition of his death sentence was disproportionate to his actual conduct, cannot withstand individualized scrutiny, and must be set aside. To the extent that <em>State v. Vernon Kills On Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 793 P.2d 1273, is inconsistent with this opinion, it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Nothing in this opinion precludes the imposition of any other penalty provided by law for the crimes of which Vernon was convicted (should his conviction survive further challenge), including life in prison as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and -303(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Did the District Court err when it denied five of the petitioner\u2019s claims based on the procedural bar found at \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, because they were not previously raised on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Vernon Kills On Top contends that the District Court erred when it dismissed his claims numbered 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12 based on the procedural bar found at \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA. Subparagraph (2) of that section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">(2) When a petitioner has been afforded a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised in the original or amended petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In <em>Lester Kills On Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 60, 901 P.2d 1368, 1386, we cited with approval our recent observation in <em>In re Manula </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 166, 169, 866 P.2d 1127, 1129. There we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">We have applied that statutory bar [in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA] consistently in order to prevent the abuse of postconviction relief by criminal defendants who would substitute those proceedings for direct appeal and in order to preserve the integrity of the trial and direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">In <em>Lester Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 60, 901 P.2d at 1386, we also overruled that part of <em>State v. Henricks </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 469, 474, 672 P.2d 20, 23, which suggested that the procedural bar would not be applied, and held that we would apply \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, based on its plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">In accord with the statutory requirement and our prior decision in <em>Lester Kills On Top, </em>we conclude that claims 3 and 6 could reasonably have been raised during Vernon\u2019s direct appeal to this Court, but were not. Our refusal to consider those issues now will not result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>fundamental miscarriage of justice, and therefore Vernon is procedurally barred from raising them in this petition for postconviction relief. We also observe that claims 7, 8, and 12 relate to the District Court\u2019s imposition of the death sentence. That sentence has now been vacated. We conclude, therefore, that those issues are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">For these reasons, the District Court\u2019s summary dismissal of claims numbered 3 and 6 is affirmed and we decline to address the District Court\u2019s summary dismissal of claims numbered 7, 8, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In summary, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s petition for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel is vacated and this case is remanded to the District Court for a hearing at which the petitioner is entitled to present evidence of ineffective assistance limited to the issues previously set forth in this opinion. Furthermore, the imposition of the death sentence as a penalty in this case is vacated and, in the event that Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s conviction is affirmed, following the hearing to consider his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, the death penalty is not a sentencing option for the District Court. He may otherwise be sentenced for the crimes of which he was convicted consistent with all remaining options set forth in Montana\u2019s Criminal Code, including life in prison without parole.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON, LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE CHRISTENSEN concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-12\">.

Any proportionality review of Vernon\u2019s sentence must take into account the facts that Vernon was not present at the murder and arguably did not intend the murder; therefore a proportionality review which uses only these ten Montana cases is fatally flawed. In addition, in the later case of <em>Turner, </em>262 Mont. at 60, 864 P.2d at 248, this Court performed a proportionality review for Turner, who was the principle actor in a deliberate homicide. This Court found that \u201cTurner\u2019s conduct was <em>significantly more culpable than that of Vern Kills on Top.\u201d Turner, </em>262 Mont. at 60, 864 P.2d at 248 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s opinion points out that Vernon was not present at the time of the killing. On the basis of <em>Turner, </em>it is arguable that if Vernon is indeed less culpable, his sentence should proportionally reflect his less purposeful conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\">. <em>Pulley </em>held that the Eighth Amendment does not invariably require state appellate courts, before confirming a death penalty in any case, to compare the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner. <em>Pulley, </em>465 U.S. at 43-44, 104 S.Ct. at 876.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b445-7\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AEh\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issues two and five and in parts of that opinion on issues one and three. I respectfully dissent from portions of the Court\u2019s opinion on issues one and three and from the entirety of that opinion on issue four.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Issue one is whether the District Court erred in denying petitioner the opportunity to amend his petition for postconviction relief. With regard to the proposed amendments relating to ineffective assistance of counsel, newly discovered evidence, <em>Brady </em>violations and cumulative denial of due process, I agree with the Court that the amendments were not futile and that the District Court abused its discretion in determining otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">I disagree with the Court\u2019s determination that the proposed amendment to claim 11 to refer to \u00a7 45-2-302(1), MCA, should have been allowed. First of all, it is undisputed that petitioner was not charged under this particular subsection of the \u201clegal accountability\u201d statute which requires that the mental state necessary for the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>lying offense must be \u201cshared\u201d by the person the State seeks to hold legally accountable for the acts. Subsection (3) of \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, which is applicable in this case, requires only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or aid such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Moreover, this \u00a7 45-2-302(1), MCA, issue \u2014 which by the Court\u2019s own characterization relates to the existence or lack thereof of a statutory aggravating circumstance and not to proportionality \u2014 could have been raised in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal and was not. On that basis, the issue is procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, and <em>Lester Kills on Top, </em>901 P.2d at 1386-87. For these reasons, it is my view that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the proposed amendment to claim 11 on the basis that it was futile. The remainder of my disagreement with the Court over this particular proposed amendment relates to my strenuous disagreement regarding issue four, the proportionality issue, which is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">With regard to issue one, I also am concerned with the Court\u2019s sweeping suggestion that any and all motions to amend a petition for postconviction relief \u2014 at least in a death penalty case \u2014 must be granted. It is my view that neither the law nor \u201cjustice\u201d supports such a theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Nor do I see the relevance of the Court\u2019s observation that \u201cno prejudice to the State was established which would justify\u201d denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to amend his petition for postconviction relief. The Court cites to no authority under which the State must establish prejudice regarding a proposed amendment prior to such time as the proposing party establishes that justice requires that the motion be granted, and I know of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">My final observation with regard to the Court\u2019s discussion of issue one relates to the 1995 amendments to \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, which are not applicable to the case presently before us. As amended, \u00a7 46-21-105(1), MCA, expressly provides that a petition for postconviction relief \u201cmay be amended only once.\u201d Presumably the Court will apply that limitation, pursuant to the clear intent of the legislature, in future postconviction proceedings to which it applies, absent a successful constitutional challenge. I fear, however, that the Court\u2019s sweeping suggestion in this case \u2014 that any and all motions to amend a petition for postconviction relief in a death penalty case must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>granted \u2014 will prove a significant stumbling block to anyone attempting to argue that this Court must follow the law duly enacted by the legislature in \u00a7 46-21-105(1), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Issue three is whether the District Court erred in concluding that certain of the petitioner\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>The Court holds that, except as to the claims which raise proportionality arguments pursuant to the United States and Montana Constitutions, the District Court did not err in concluding that certain of petitioner\u2019s claims are so barred. I agree with the Court that the specified claims are barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">With specific regard to the proportionality claims, I agree with the Court that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>was not enacted into the postconviction relief statutes by the Montana legislature and, therefore, that the doctrine is a judicial creation. I also agree that we have recognized an exception to its applicability where the case already must be remanded for further proceedings because of reversal on an unrelated issue. <em>See Zimmerman, </em>573 P.2d at 178. This threshold <em>Zimmerman </em>procedural circumstance is present in this case because we have concluded that the <em>Brady </em>violations require that petitioner be resentenced, for the reasons discussed in some detail in petitioner\u2019s brother\u2019s recent postconviction case. <em>See Lester Kills on Top, </em>901 P.2d at 1375-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">However, <em>Zimmerman </em>authorizes us to revisit an issue resolved on direct appeal only \u201cto correct a manifest error in [our] former opinion.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>573 P.2d at 178. Based on <em>Zimmerman, </em>the Cotut refuses to bar petitioner\u2019s proportionality arguments under either the federal or the Montana Constitution and proceeds, in issue four, to address those arguments on the merits under both Constitutions. I disagree that <em>Zimmerman </em>authorizes us to address proportionality under either Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">With regard to the issue of proportionality under the United States Constitution which we addressed and resolved in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, it is my view that our earlier opinion did not contain manifest error and that the Court\u2019s proportionality analysis in the present case is flawed. Therefore, I would apply the <em>res judicata </em>bar to petitioner\u2019s proportionality argument under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Before even beginning its proportionality analyses, the Court \u201creviews\u201d the evidence which led to petitioner\u2019s conviction for aggravated kidnapping and deliberate homicide and to the imposition by the sentencing court of the death penalty. Its review rather pointedly minimizes the evidence about the extent of petitioner\u2019s participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>in the episode which resulted in Etchemendy\u2019s death. Instead, it focuses largely on the testimony of Diane Bull Coming and, in the guise of \u201creviewing\u201d that testimony, reweighs her testimony and redetermines her credibility. The Court cites to no authority under which it is authorized to do so, and I submit that the sole intent of this \u201creview\u201d is to buttress the conclusion the Court determined in advance to reach. In my opinion, we are bound on these factual matters by the record which supported the jury verdicts and the findings of fact made by the sentencing court and which we reviewed and affirmed on appeal in <em>State v. Kills On Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 793 P.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">That record indicates that the deliberate homicide was committed by means of torture and that the aggravated kidnapping resulted in the death of the victim; that petitioner was \u201cdirectly involved in the serious beating of the victim;\u201d that this severe physical brutality engaged in by petitioner was so severe it could have caused death even absent further infliction of physical violence by petitioner\u2019s brother; that after that potentially fatal beating, petitioner participated in placing the nude victim in the trunk of the vehicle and did nothing for him in the subsequent twelve-hour period; and that later, on two occasions, petitioner agreed that the victim had to die. <em>Kills on Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1300-1308. Indeed, we specifically determined that the sentencing court\u2019s finding that petitioner \u201cagreed that the victim had to die\u201d was supported by the record. <em>Kills on Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1308. Notwithstanding this record, and our related determinations in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, the Court resorts to \u201cretrying\u201d these matters here. I cannot join in such a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Court then proceeds to its \u201cFederal Proportionality Review.\u201d It sets forth, briefly, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s controlling <em>Enmund </em>and <em>Tison </em>cases, and then presents lengthy criticisms of <em>Tison </em>from law review articles and one court. There appears to be no reason for including this segment, other than the Court\u2019s implicit agreement with the criticisms of <em>Tison </em>advanced by others. The question before us here, however, is not whether we agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tison; </em>the issue here is whether this Court erred in applying that decision in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. Thus, the \u201ccriticism\u201d is totally irrelevant to the Court\u2019s purported federal proportionality review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Court does finally advance its analysis regarding whether, under federal proportionality standards set forth in <em>Enmund </em>and <em>Tison, </em>this Court\u2019s opinion in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cmanifest error\u201d for purposes of applying the <em>Zimmerman </em>exception to the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>In one short paragraph, it concludes that our previous analysis under <em>Tison </em>was flawed. That paragraph is followed by another single paragraph asserting that petitioner\u2019s case \u201cpresents a situation more similar to the facts of <em>Enmund </em>than the facts of Tison.\u201d I submit that the Court is incorrect in both regards. As a result, it is my view that our opinion on this issue in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was not manifestly erroneous and does not support refusing to apply <em>res judicata </em>here pursuant to <em>Zimmerman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Regarding <em>Tison, </em>the facts in that case were as follows. The Tison brothers planned and executed their father\u2019s armed escape from the Arizona State Prison. When a tire blew out on their vehicle after the escape, they decided to flag down a passing motorist and steal a car; they armed themselves and waited at the side of the road. When the Lyons family stopped to render assistance, they were forced into the backseat of the Tison vehicle and driven into the desert, where they were ordered out while the Tisons stole their property and put it into the Tison vehicle. Within the view of the Tison brothers, their father and his co-escapee murdered the Lyons family with the shotguns used in the escape. Neither brother made any effort to help the victims. <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 139-41, 107 S.Ct. at 1678-80. The brothers subsequently were convicted of armed robbery, kidnaping, car theft and felony-murder. The sentencing court found three statutory aggravating factors and no statutory mitigating factor; it specifically found that the brothers\u2019 participation in the crimes giving rise to the application of the felony-murder rule was \u201cvery substantial.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 142, 107 S.Ct. at 1680. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court determined that the record established that both brothers were present during the homicides and that the homicides \u201coccurred as part of and in the course of the escape and continuous attempt to prevent recapture.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 143, 107 S.Ct. at 1680. The brothers subsequently challenged their death sentences in postconviction proceedings, which ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court. <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 143, 145-46, 107 S.Ct. at 1680, 1681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Eighth Amendment permitted imposition of the death penalty for nontriggermen who took no act desired, or substantially certain, to cause death but whose participation in the crimes was major and whose mental state was one of reckless indifference to the value of human life. <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 152, 107 S.Ct. at 1685. Distinguishing the facts from <em>Enmund, </em>the Supreme Court determined from the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the petitioners were \u201cactively involved in every element of the kidnaping-robbery and physically present during the entire sequence of criminal activity culminating in the murder of the Lyons family. ...\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 158, 107 S.Ct. at 1688. On that basis, the Supreme Court held that \u201cmajor participation in the felony committed, combined with reckless indifference to human life, is sufficient to satisfy the <em>Enmund </em>culpability requirement.\u201d <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. at 158, 107 S.Ct. at 1688.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">It is clear that the <em>Tison </em>Court premised its holding on the brothers\u2019 major participation in the underlying felonies which gave rise to the felony-murder death sentences, and the reckless indifference to human life shown by that participation and their failure to do anything to prevent the murders. We applied these <em>Tison </em>criteria in <em>Kills On Top </em>and held that the facts of this case were sufficient to satisfy the individual culpability requirement set forth in <em>Enmund. Kills on Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1306-1308. It is clear that we were correct in doing so; indeed, it is my view that petitioner\u2019s culpability here is greater than that of the Tison brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Petitioner was driving the vehicle at the inception of the lengthy episode which culminated in Etchemendy\u2019s death and, indeed, drove the group out of town for the purpose of \u201crolling\u201d and stealing from him; petitioner confiscated Etchemendy\u2019s credit cards and employment checks from his wallet. <em>Kills On Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1280. When petitioner\u2019s brother and Etchemendy were fighting in the back seat of the vehicle, petitioner stopped the car because he \u201cwanted in on some of this;\u201d while Etchemendy screamed and pleaded with them to stop, petitioner and his brother continued beating him and kicked him while he was lying on the ground. Petitioner then attempted to choke the victim in the back seat of the car. <em>Kills On Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1280. Petitioner later told Etchemendy to remove his clothes and helped place the nude victim into the trunk of the car. <em>Kills On Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1280. Petitioner and his brother subsequently cashed one of Etchemendy\u2019s checks and divided the money between them. Later, petitioner agreed with his brother on two occasions that they would have to kill and \u201cget rid of\u2019 Etchemendy. <em>Kills On Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1281. While petitioner was not physically present when Etchemendy was murdered, he did nothing in the lengthy pre-murder stages of the episode to help the victim or prevent the homicide. Indeed, petitioner aided in leaving the area after the murder. <em>Kills On Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1282. Petitioner did not inflict the final fatal blows, but the record established that the kick in the head which petitioner did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>inflict on Etchemendy could have caused his death eventually even without further infliction of physical violence. <em>Kills on Top, </em>793 P.2d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">A proper application of <em>Tison </em>to these facts and this record mandates two conclusions: First, petitioner was a major participant in the felony offenses \u2014 robbery and kidnaping \u2014 committed prior to the actual fatal blows which killed Etchemendy and upon which the State charged him with deliberate homicide by accountability under the so-called felony-murder rule. Second, petitioner\u2019s acts demonstrated, at the very least, a reckless indifference to human life. These are precisely the conclusions we reached on this issue in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. They were correct then, and they remain correct today. The Court simply prefers to ignore the facts and the record concerning petitioner\u2019s culpability in its determination to find \u201cmanifest error\u201d regarding federal proportionality requirements in our earlier decision \u2014 all for the purpose of avoiding the <em>res judicata </em>effect of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Nor is the Court correct in stating that the present case more closely resembles <em>Enmund </em>than <em>Tison. </em>In <em>Enmund, </em>two persons committed robbery and then shot and killed their victims. <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 784, 102 S.Ct. at 3369-70. Defendant Enmund was believed by law enforcement to have been waiting in a car outside the premises for the offenders to return and to have driven the \u201cgetaway car.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 784, 102 S.Ct. at 3369-70. One of the primary offenders was tried with Enmund, and both were convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of robbery; Enmund was sentenced to death for his role as an accomplice in the commission of an armed robbery which resulted in two deaths. <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 784-85, 102 S.Ct. at 3369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The United States Supreme Court granted Enmund\u2019s petition for certiorari from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of the death sentences in order to address the issue of whether death is a valid penalty under the Eighth Amendment for one who \u201caids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 787, 797, 102 S.Ct. at 3371, 3376. The Supreme Court determined that Enmund \u201cdid not kill or attempt to kill; and, as construed by the Florida Supreme Court, the record before us does not warrant a finding that Enmund had any intention of participating in or facilitating a murder.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 798, 102 S.Ct. at 3377. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the \u201c <em>\u2018only </em>evidence of the degree of [Enmund\u2019s] participation is the jury\u2019s likely <em>inference </em>that he was the person in the car by the side of the road near the scene of the crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 786, 102 S.Ct. at 3370 (emphasis added). On the basis of this record, the Supreme Court reversed the imposition of the death penalty. <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 801, 102 S.Ct. at 3378.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">I will not reiterate the record before us in this case regarding petitioner\u2019s actual involvement and participation in the extensive criminal episode which culminated in Etchemendy\u2019s death. Nor will I present a detailed analysis of the extent to which that participation differed both qualitatively and quantitively from the record before the Supreme Court in <em>Enmund. </em>Suffice it to say that it is my view that the negligible degree of personal culpability present in <em>Enmund </em>bears no resemblance whatsoever to petitioner\u2019s personal culpability in this case. The Court is clearly, and simply, wrong in concluding that the present case is more like <em>Enmund </em>than like <em>Tison. </em>It is equally, and as clearly, wrong in using its incorrect analysis as a means by which to conclude that our decision in the direct appeal of petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences was \u201cmanifest error\u201d which allows us to revisit the proportionality issue already \u2014 and correctly\u2014 addressed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">I also disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to address petitioner\u2019s proportionality argument under the Montana Constitution. The Court correctly notes that no proportionality issue under the Montana Constitution was raised or addressed in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. Under such a circumstance, the law is clear that we cannot address that claim in this postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">When a petitioner has been afforded a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised in the original or amended petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In our recent opinion in petitioner\u2019s brother\u2019s postconviction proceeding, we overruled an earlier case to the extent it stood for the proposition that this Court can review issues in postconviction proceedings which could have been \u2014 but were not \u2014 raised on direct appeal. <em>See Lester Kills On Top, </em>901 P.2d at 1386-87. We then applied the statutory procedural bar to each and every postconviction claim which could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>See Lester Kills On Top, </em>901 P.2d at 1387-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>We must do the same here with regard to petitioner\u2019s proportionality arguments under the Montana Constitution. These matters clearly could have been raised on direct appeal. Since they were not, we are obligated to apply the statutory procedural bar contained in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. The Court does not affirmatively address the statutory bar in any respect regarding the proportionality arguments petitioner raises under the Montana Constitution although, interestingly, it has no difficulty in affirming the District Court\u2019s application of that bar to other of petitioner\u2019s claims in issue five. While I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue five, I cannot agree with its totally inconsistent approach in not applying the \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, procedural bar to the proportionality issue raised under the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Nor do I agree with the Court\u2019s view that the Montana Constitution is not a separate \u201cgrounds for relief\u2019 which could have been raised on direct appeal for purposes of applying the procedural bar contained in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. I note that we used \u201cgrounds for relief\u2019 interchangeably with \u201cissues,\u201d \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201carguments\u201d in <em>Lester Kills on Top, </em>901 P.2d at 1385-90. Moreover, it is clear, even from the Court\u2019s opinion in this case, that the Montana Constitution is being used as a basis for relief separate and distinct from that available under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Moreover, the Court\u2019s castigation of the dissent as putting a procedural bar ahead of human life is mere rhetoric which appeals to the emotions but ignores the law. The statutory procedural bar contained in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, was duly enacted by the Montana legislature and it is our clear and simple duty to apply that bar pursuant to its terms. We did so in <em>Lester Kills on Top </em>and we are obligated to do so here. The Court\u2019s attitude only fuels the public\u2019s perception that courts are unwilling under any circumstances to allow implementation of death sentences and are willing to ignore applicable law in order to impose their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Nor does \u2014 or can \u2014 the Court support its charge that the dissent construes the statutory procedural bar more narrowly than it was ever intended. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, speaks for itself regarding the legislature\u2019s intent. It was intended to do precisely what it should do in this case: preclude a petitioner for postconviction relief who has been afforded a direct appeal from raising thereafter \u2014 in the postconviction context \u2014 an issue which could have been raised on direct appeal but was not. While this Court may not agree with the legislature\u2019s intention, we are obliged to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>It is relatively clear that the Court feels compelled to rely on a proportionality analysis under the Montana Constitution as specifically providing a separate ground for relief in order to avoid review by the United States Supreme Court of the <em>EnmuncUTison </em>rationale it sets forth under the United States Constitution. While I often join my brethren in avoiding such review by relying on \u201cindependent state grounds,\u201d I cannot do so here where the only means of achieving that end is to breach the consistent application of the statutory procedural bar to which we so recently and strongly committed in <em>Lester Kills on Top.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">It is our role \u2014 unpopular as it often is with the public \u2014 to ensure that the State does not violate the rights of criminal defendants. It is not our role to ignore the law in order to provide those defendants with rights to which they are not entitled. It is my view that the Court has allowed its determination to limit the availability of the death penalty in Montana to override its obligation to apply the statutory procedural bar to petitioner\u2019s contention that the Montana Constitution precludes imposition of the death penalty in this case. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b454-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ANg\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The dissent touches all the politically-correct buttons. It pays homage to the Legislature and crows about judicial restraint. It accuses the majority of ignoring the law, basing its decision on emotions, and refusing to enforce the death penalty based on the members\u2019 own views. The author of the dissent first weaves a procedural bar out of transparent whole cloth, and then wears the procedural bar she has woven as her own mantelet of judicial honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The dissent gets high marks for political pandering, but has little basis in law or in fact. The dissent is replete with factual inaccuracies and exaggerations which the author would apparently prefer to perpetuate, rather than recognize the record by which she contends we are bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The dissent suggests that this Court first arrived atits conclusions, and then sought to buttress them by its \u201creview\u201d of the facts. Anyone who participated in the extensive arguments, deliberations, and discussions conducted by this Court, and paid even minimal attention, knows better. But the statement makes a good sound bite.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The dissent contends that the facts stated in this Court\u2019s previous opinion were correct then and are correct now, apparently operating on the assumption that saying so makes it so. The author of the dissent has obviously not personally reviewed the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The dissent accuses the majority of failing to affirmatively address the procedural bar to consideration of Montana\u2019s Constitution. The omission is for good reason. Not even the State of Montana has contended that there is a procedural bar to consideration of the proportionality issue pursuant to Montana\u2019s own Constitution. The issue was first raised <em>sua sponte </em>by the author of the dissent when her first written dissent was circulated. It is difficult to reconcile this type of activism with the same author\u2019s refusal to address our constitution in <em>State v. Zabawa </em>(Mont. 1996), 928 P.2d 121, simply because the defendant did not assert that it provided greater protection than the federal constitution. So much for the judicial restraint that the dissent purports to idealize.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The dissent suggests that to ignore a procedural bar (incorrectly assuming that one exists) simply because this case involves the death penalty infers some kind of weak-kneed idealism based on emotion, rather than the law. In doing so, the author of the dissent, herself, ignores repeated declarations by the U.S. Supreme Court and its members to the effect that death penalty cases must be treated differently when the issue of a procedural bar is considered. As pointed out by Justice Stevens in his dissent to <em>Smith v. Murray </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 527, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 91 L.Ed.2d 434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(\u201cThe Court, as well as the separate opinions of a majority of the individual Justices, has recognized that the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination\u201d); <em>Zant v. Stevens, </em>462 U.S. 862, 884, [103 S.Ct. 2733, 2746-47, 77 L.Ed.2d 235] (1983) (\u201c[T]here is a qualitative difference between death and any other permissible form of punishment\u201d); <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, [100 S.Ct. 1133, 1138, 63 L.Ed.2d 382] (1980) (\u201cThis theme, the unique nature of the death penalty for purposes of Eighth Amendment analysis, has been repeated time and time again in our opinions. ... [A] sentence of death differs in kind from any sentence of imprisonment\u201d); <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, [98 S.Ct. 2954, 2965, 57 L.Ed.2d 973] (1978) (BURGER, C.J.) (\u201c[T]he imposition of death by public authority is ... profoundly different from all other penalties\u201d). Cf. Meltzer, State Court Forfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>(1986) <em>(\u201c[WJhen a capital defendant raises a nonfrivolous constitutional question, neither state nor federal courts should be free to refuse to decide it simply because it was not raised in accordance with state procedural requirements. Rather, federal law should expressly provide that in matters of procedural default, as in other matters, death is different\u201d).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Indeed, the Court has recognized that even the threat of a death penalty may, in certain circumstances, exert a special pull in favor of the exercise of the federal court\u2019s undisputed statutory power to entertain a habeas corpus writ on a claim that was procedurally defaulted.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>Smith, </em>477 U.S. at 545-46 n. 11, 106 S.Ct. at 2673 n.11 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">While the dissent is strong on political rhetoric, its legal analysis is faulty, its regard for the record is questionable, and its recognition of the judiciary as an independent branch of government responsible for enforcement of Montana\u2019s Constitution is apparently less important than stoking the flames of public reaction to a grisly series of events, even if that means exaggerating this defendant\u2019s involvement in those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">It is always a challenge to decide brutal and sensationalized cases strictly on the law. That responsibility is only made more difficult by irresponsible and factually inaccurate and exaggerated statements like those made by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">If the author of the dissent had as much regard for the record as she claims, and limited her discussion to those legal issues over which there is arguably a basis for disagreement, the opinion and the dissent would be shortened considerably, and the public would be better served.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
