(Berg) appeals from the denial by the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, of his motions for a new trial and to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor. The State of Montana, ex rel. State Compensation Mutual Insurance Fund (State Fund), cross-appeals from the judgment entered by the District Court and, in particular, from its order denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. We affirm on the appeal, reverse on the cross-appeal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">We restate the issues on appeal and cross-appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial which was based on juror misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial which was based on failure to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cmisrepresent?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor which was based on the State Fund\u2019s failure to plead constructive fraud with sufficient particularity?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor which was based on a statute of limitations bar to the constructive fraud claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">5. Did the District Court err in denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict which was based on the existence of a disputable presumption of employee status?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Berg owns and operates a lumberyard, sawmill and planing operation in Lewistown, Montana. Montana law requires him to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance and unemployment insurance for his employees. Berg\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance through the State Fund authorized the State Fund to examine and audit Berg\u2019s payroll records, general ledger, disbursements, vouchers, contracts, tax reports and all other books, documents and records at any reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In February of 1989, the Unemployment Insurance Division of the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (Department) requested an audit of Berg\u2019s operations as a result of an unemployment insurance benefits claim filed by Tim Murnion (Murnion). Murnion claimed to have been employed by Berg, but no wage credits based on employment by Berg were on file with the Unemployment Insurance Division. Mike Knecht (Knecht), a Department field representative, was assigned to conduct an unemployment insurance audit of Berg\u2019s operations for the January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, period and a workers\u2019 compensation audit of those operations for the July 1, 1987, through September 30, 1988, period. The workers\u2019 compensation audit period was subsequently extended to December 31, 1988. Between the beginning of Knecht\u2019s audit of Berg\u2019s operations on February 22, 1989, and December of 1990, when he conducted a physical inspection of Berg\u2019s operations, Knecht visited the sawmill six or seven times.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Based on the results of Knecht\u2019s audit, the State Fund sued Berg in Lewis and Clark County on January 17,1992. It alleged that Berg did not properly remit workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums in that he (1) failed to make payments for individuals improperly treated as independent contractors rather than employees; (2) under-reported employees\u2019 wages; and (3) misclassified employees\u2019 wages. Berg moved for a change of venue to Fergus County and the motion was granted. In March of 1993, the State Fund moved to amend its complaint to add actual and constructive fraud claims and the District Court granted the motion over Berg\u2019s objections. Berg answered the amended complaint by generally denying the State Fund\u2019s allegations and asserting the statute of limitations and estoppel as affirmative defenses. The parties conducted discovery and filed numerous pretrial motions. The District Court ruled on the motions and entered a pretrial order prepared by trial counsel for both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>After several trial dates were scheduled and vacated, a jury trial began on June 27, 1994, in Lewistown, Montana. The State Fund moved for a mistrial and change of venue, contending that it could not get a fair trial in Fergus County. The District Court declared a mistrial, but denied the State Fund\u2019s motion for change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The second trial began on June 6, 1995. At the conclusion of the State Fund\u2019s case-in-chief, the District Court granted its motion for a directed verdict on Berg\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation premiums for the first quarter of 1991 in the amount of $13,333.49. At the end of the trial, the State Fund moved for a directed verdict on the employee status of certain individuals Berg claimed were independent contractors. The State Fund argued that Berg had presented insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of employee status for the question to go to the jury. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The jury ultimately returned a special verdict finding that Berg committed constructive fraud in dealing with the State Fund and misrepresented payroll, employee status and employee duties by misclassifying his employees. The jury awarded $305,857.46 in damages to the State Fund. The District Court added the $13,333.49 directed verdict amount to the jury\u2019s award and entered judgment for the State Fund for $319,190.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Berg obtained new counsel and moved for a new trial and to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor. He premised the new trial motion on alleged juror misconduct and instructional error. His motion to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor was based on the State Fund\u2019s alleged failure to plead constructive fraud with sufficient particularity and a statute of limitations bar to the constructive fraud claim. The District Court denied Berg\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Berg appeals from the denial of his postjudgment motions and the State Fund cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion for a directed verdict. Additional facts are provided below as necessary for our resolution of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial which was based on juror misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Berg contended in his new trial motion that juror misconduct by juror James Carroll (Carroll) constituted irregularity in the proceedings of the jury. He supported his motion with an affidavit from juror Robert Flinders (Flinders). According to Flinders, Carroll said to him, on several occasions during the trial, \u201cThat\u2019s it; [t]hat\u2019s all I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>need to hear; [i]t\u2019s all over.\u201d Flinders also stated that Carroll pointed to another juror during several recesses and said, \u201cThat\u2019s one we\u2019ll have to convince.\u201d Flinders either ignored Carroll\u2019s statements or told Carroll to be quiet.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In denying Berg\u2019s new trial motion, the District Court concluded that Carroll\u2019s conduct was not an external influence on the jury but was, if anything, an internal influence for which a juror affidavit could not be used to impeach the verdict. The court determined, therefore, that Flinders\u2019 description of Carroll\u2019s conduct did not provide a basis on which it could grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Kelman </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 253, 260, 915 P.2d 854, 859; <em>State v. Brogan </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 156, 160, 900 P.2d 284, 286. Whether certain conduct is an internal or external influence on the jury is a question of law, however. <em>See Geiger v. Sherrodd, Inc. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 505, 510, 866 P.2d 1106, 1109. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Topco, Inc. v. State Dept. of Highways </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 352, 357, 912 P.2d 805, 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The grounds on which a new trial may be granted are statutorily defined in Montana. Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(2) misconduct of the jury. Whenever any one or more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special verdict or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the court by a resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any one of the jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Motions for a new trial based on irregularity in the proceedings of the jury under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, may be made \u201con affidavits or on the minutes of the court;\u201d new trial motions based on jury misconduct under \u00a7 25-11-102(2), MCA, must be made \u201conly on affidavits.\u201d Section 25-11-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>At the outset, we note the District Court\u2019s observation \u2014 in its order denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial based on Flinders\u2019 affidavit\u2014 that it was difficult to determine whether Berg was proceeding under subsection (1) or (2) of \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA. It is no more apparent to us on appeal. Therefore, we will address Berg\u2019s reliance on the Flinders affidavit under both subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Section 25-11-102(1), MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Berg contends that Flinders\u2019 affidavit relating the \u201cprejudgment remarks\u201d Carroll made to him indicates Carroll\u2019s disregard of the District Court\u2019s daily admonitions to the jury not to discuss the case among themselves. According to Berg, that conduct constitutes an irregularity in the jury proceedings which prevented him from having a fair trial and entitles him to a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">As a general rule, the use of juror affidavits is confined exclusively to cases alleging misconduct of the jury under \u00a7 25-11-102(2), MCA. <em>Rieger v. Coldwell </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 507, 512, 839 P.2d 1257, 1260 (citing Rasmussen <em>v. Sibert </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 286, 293, 456 P.2d 835, 839). In <em>Rasmussen, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">[J]uror affidavits are not permissible in support of a motion for new trial under subd. 1 of section 93-5603 [now \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA]; their use is confined exclusively to cases of misconduct of the jury under subd. 2 of that statute. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">We base this holding, in part, on statutory language. Section 93-5603, R.C.M. 1947 [now \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA], sets forth the grounds on which a new trial may be granted. Only on the ground mentioned in subd. 2, i.e. juror misconduct, are juror affidavits authorized as proof. The following statute, section 93-5604, R.C.M. 1947 [now \u00a7 25-11-104, MCA], provides that affidavits may be used in support of a motion for new trial under subd. 1 and that they must be used under subd. 2 and three other subdivisions. <em>It is clear to us that the affidavits referred to therein, with the sole exception of juror affidavits specifically authorized under subd. 2 of section 93-5603 [now \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA], are affidavits of counsel, potential witnesses on retrial, court reporters, and others with knowledge of the facts on which the grounds for a new trial are based. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAh\"><em>Rasmussen, </em>456 P.2d at 839 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Berg contends, however, that <em>Ahmann v. American Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 184, 766 P.2d 853 (overruled on other grounds), allows consideration of the Flinders affidavit in support of his \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, new trial motion. <em>In Ahmann, </em>the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>irregularity in the proceedings did not involve alleged juror misconduct; rather it concerned conduct of a bailiff in a conversation with one of the jurors. <em>Ahmann, </em>766 P.2d at 856. We noted our <em>Rasmussen </em>holding that affidavits of counsel, court personnel and potential witnesses on retrial are permissible to support a new trial motion under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, but affidavits of jurors are not <em>.Ahmann, </em>766 P.2d at 856-57. We concluded, however, that, where the only two people with personal knowledge of the alleged irregularity are a juror and the individual who committed the alleged infraction, juror affidavits would be admissible under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA; under such facts, it would be irrational to permit the use of the bailiff\u2019s affidavit, but not the juror\u2019s. <em>Ahmann, </em>766 P.2d at 857. We also observed that the bailiff\u2019s conduct constituted an outside influence on the jury for which a juror affidavit properly could be considered pursuant to Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., and warned that only the facts regarding the alleged irregularity, and not any allegations relating to the effect of such an irregularity on the jurors\u2019 thought processes, were admissible even in a situation like that before us <em>in Ahmann. Ahmann, </em>766 P.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><em>Ahmann </em>is distinguishable from the situation presently before us. The irregularity asserted by Berg in this case involves allegedly improper communications from one juror to another. It does not involve conduct or communications between a nonjuror and a juror. Therefore, the limited and carefully drawn <em>Ahmann </em>exception to the <em>Rasmussen </em>prohibition against use of a juror affidavit in support of a \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, motion for a new trial is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We conclude that the Flinders affidavit could not be considered in conjunction with Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Section 25-11-102(2), MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial also was premised on his contention that Carroll\u2019s remarks constituted juror misconduct under \u00a7 25-11-102(2), MCA. In denying Berg\u2019s motion, the District Court noted the general prohibition against using juror affidavits to impeach the verdict contained in Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., and determined that the Flinders affidavit did not fall within the exceptions to that general prohibition under which it could consider the affidavit. On appeal, Berg claims that the misconduct set forth in Flinders\u2019 affidavit was an external influence on the jury and, therefore, that Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., permits consideration of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201c[A] juror may not testify as to ... the effect of anything upon that or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror\u2019s mental processes in connection therewith.\u201d Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. Insofar as is relevant to Berg\u2019s argument here, however, a juror may testify about what occurred during jury deliberations when the information pertains to whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention or whether any outside influence was brought to bear on any juror. Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid.; <em>Kelman, </em>915 P.2d at 859; <em>Brogan, </em>900 P.2d at 287. Thus, while juror affidavits may not be used to impeach a verdict based on internal influences on the jury, such as a mistake of evidence or misapprehension of the law, they can provide the basis for overturning a judgment where external prejudicial information is brought to the jury\u2019s attention or external influence is exerted on the jury. <em>Kelman, </em>915 P.2d at 860 (citing <em>Brogan, </em>900 P.2d at 287).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">We must determine, therefore, whether the conduct of juror Carroll set forth in Flinders\u2019 affidavit was an external influence on the jury so as to permit consideration of the Flinders affidavit. Examples of external prejudicial information brought to the jury\u2019s attention or external influence exerted on the jury include a juror\u2019s telephone call obtaining information with regard to previous litigation by the plaintiff, visiting the scene of an accident, or bringing a newspaper article about the trial into the jury room for the jurors to see. <em>Kelman, </em>915 P.2d at 860 (citations omitted). Juror Carroll\u2019s remarks to Flinders are not similar in any way to the clearly external matters described in <em>Kelman. </em>Indeed, those remarks by one juror to another contain no external information and, because they relate solely to juror Carroll\u2019s thoughts about the evidence presented and another juror, they do not constitute an external influence on the jury. We conclude, therefore, that the Flinders affidavit describing juror Carroll\u2019s statements did not fall within an exception to the general prohibition against use of juror affidavits to impeach a verdict contained in Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Berg also contends that \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, requires a new trial in cases where the substantial rights of a party have been affected. We need not address this contention, however, given our conclusion above that Carroll\u2019s conduct was not an external influence and, therefore, that the jury verdict cannot be impeached via Flinders\u2019 affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Finally, Berg argues that the conduct of juror Carroll reflected in Flinders\u2019 affidavit constituted a prejudgment of the case which vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>lated both the statutory proscription contained in \u00a7 25-7-402, MCA, and the District Court\u2019s daily admonitions thereunder that discussions between jurors could occur only at the conclusion of the case and in the presence of all of the jurors. Recognizing that we have not previously addressed juror misconduct of this type, Berg urges us to follow California\u2019s lead on this issue and conclude that Carroll\u2019s conduct prejudiced his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury so as to require a new trial. Berg relies primarily on <em>In re Hitchings </em>(Cal. 1993), 860 P.2d 466; <em>Andrews v. County of Orange </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1982), 182 Cal. Rptr. 176; and <em>Deward v. Clough </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1966), 54 Cal. Rptr. 68. <em>Andrews </em>is the most analogous factually to the case presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>In Andrews, </em>juror affidavits were submitted in support of a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. <em>Andrews, </em>182 Cal. Rptr. at 180. Among the information disclosed in the juror affidavits was a possible prejudgment of the case by one juror in contravention of the statutorily-required admonition by the trial court. <em>Andrews, </em>182 Cal. Rptr. at 183. As a necessary prerequisite to determining whether the plaintiffs had been deprived of a fair trial, the California court reviewed applicable California law regarding the use of juror affidavits to impeach a verdict. Under Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 1150, \u201cany otherwise admissible evidence\u201d could be submitted to impeach a verdict based on \u201cstatements made, or conduct, conditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, of such a character as is likely to have influenced the verdict improperly.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>182 Cal. Rptr. at 180 n.4. The only limitation on evidence admissible to impeach a verdict under California law is that no evidence may be submitted regarding the \u201ceffect of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon a juror either in influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or concerning the mental processes by which it was determined.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>182 Cal. Rptr. at 180 n.4. Having determined that the juror affidavits could be used to impeach the verdict, the court concluded that a juror had prejudged the case and the plaintiffs had not received a fair trial. <em>Andrews, 182 </em>Cal. Rptr. at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Andrews </em>clarifies that California law regarding the use of juror affidavits differs significantly from Montana law. Under California law, juror affidavits generally are admissible to impeach a verdict regarding obj ective conduct or events either in or out of the jury room which may have influenced the verdict improperly; the only limitation is that an affidavit cannot be used to establish the effect of such conduct or events on a juror\u2019s decision regarding the verdict or on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>jury\u2019s mental processes in reaching the verdict. In Montana, on the other hand, juror affidavits generally cannot be used to impeach a verdict regarding either matters occurring dinring the jury\u2019s deliberations or the effect of conduct or events on a juror\u2019s decision regarding the verdict or the mental processes by which the verdict was determined. Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. The only exception to the general prohibition is narrowly drawn and, as we have concluded above, inapplicable here. Thus, while <em>Andrews </em>is factually similar to the case presently before us, the significant differences between California law and Montana law regarding the use of juror affidavits preclude its application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion for a new trial which was based on failure to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cmisrepresent?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Question No. 2 on the special verdict form asked the jury whether Berg misrepresented payroll, employee status and employee duties by misclassifying his workers to the State Fund. The jury responded in the affirmative. Berg moved for a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the definition of the word \u201cmisrepresent,\u201d maintaining that the District Court and all trial counsel, including his own, were at fault in this regard. The District Court denied Berg\u2019s motion. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Kelman, </em>915 P.2d at 859; <em>Brogan, </em>900 P.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We note, at the outset, that Berg did not offer an instruction defming the word \u201cmisrepresent.\u201d Rule 51, M.R.Civ.P, provides that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the failure to instruct on any point of law unless that party offers an instruction thereon.\u201d Where no instruction was offered by the party asserting a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct, the party is precluded from assigning error in that regard. <em>Werre v. David </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 376, 394, 913 P.2d 625, 636; <em>State v. Courchene </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 381, 388, 847 P.2d 271, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Berg urges that, notwithstanding his failure to offer an appropriate instruction, the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine applies. Under very limited circumstances, the plain error doctrine permits review of errors not objected to at trial which result in substantial injustice by denying a party a fair trial. <em>Geiger, </em>866 P.2d at 1108 (citing Rule 103(d), M.R.Evid.; <em>Halldorson v. Halldorson </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 170, 573 P.2d 169); <em>Guertin v. Moody\u2019s Market, Inc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 61, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>67, 874 P.2d 710, 714. However, \u201c \u2018[p]lain error\u2019 generally involves an act or omission of a more serious nature than \u2018reversible error,\u2019 and only on rare occasion is the former doctrine invoked in civil cases.\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>866 P.2d at 1108 (quoting Reno <em>v.

Maryann\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 21, 664 P.2d 295, in contending that the District Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the definition of the word \u201cmisrepresent\u201d affected his right to a fair trial. His reliance on <em>State Bank of Townsend </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In <em>State Bank of Townsend, </em>the trial court had prepared an extensive pretrial order which included agreed facts and both parties\u2019 contentions. <em>State Bank of Townsend, </em>664 P.2d at 298. It appeared from the jury instructions that the theory of the defendants\u2019 case had changed during the course of the trial, resulting in confusion on the part of both the attorneys and the trial court regarding the law of the case. <em>State Bank of Townsend, </em>664 P.2d at 298. As a result, contradictory and confusing instructions were given to the jury and we were unable to determine what the jury had been instructed to do or what the jury had done. <em>State Bank of Townsend, </em>664 P.2d at 298-99. Despite the absence of adequate objections to the instructions, we applied the plain error doctrine because the error affected the substantial right of both parties to instructions which correctly set forth a legal basis for assessing damages, as well as an understandable method of computing the amount of such damages. <em>State Bank of Townsend, </em>664 P.2d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, there was no change in legal theory over the course of trial and no resulting contradictory and confusing jury instructions. Moreover, both parties had a significant amount of time to review proposed jury instructions and submit additional instructions as needed. Trial counsel simply failed to propose an instruction defining \u201cmisrepresent\u201d in the ordinary course of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In addition, Berg helped draft the special verdict form containing the word \u201cmisrepresent\u201d and did not object to it. A district court will not be put in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced or participated, or to which the appellant made no objection. <em>In re Pedersen </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 284, 287, 862 P.2d 411, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We decline to apply the plain error doctrine to the case presently before us.

The District Court denied his motion and determined that, when the amended complaint was filed, Berg was put on notice regarding the allegations of constructive fraud and that he was not prejudiced due to a lack of actual notice or understanding of the allegations regarding constructive fraud. The District Court concluded that the pleadings were not so defective as to require that the judgment in favor of the State Fund be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s discretionary rulings, such as trial administration issues, rulings on posttrial motions and similar rulings, to determine if the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Van Loan v.

It also alleged that an audit of Berg\u2019s operations completed on or about July 19,1991, resulted in Berg being billed an additional $390,131.56 for premiums due for the periods audited. Finally, the State Fund alleged that Berg\u2019s conduct constituted a pattern of misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Berg contends that the State Fund\u2019s amended complaint is defective because not all elements of a constructive fraud claim are alleged with particularity. However, the appropriate interplay between the \u201cparticularity\u201d requirement of Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.P., and Montana\u2019s \u201cnotice pleading\u201d rule is well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">\u201cOf primary importance in understanding the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) is the recognition that it does not render the general principles set forth in Rule 8 entirely inapplicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>pleadings alleging fraud; rather, the two rules must be read in conjunction with each other. It should be kept in mind that Rule 8(a) requests \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 for relief!.] ...

School Dist. No. 1-1A </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 460, 467, 813 P.2d 417, 421 (quoting <em>Fraunhofer v. Price </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 7, 14-15, 594 P.2d 324, 328-29).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We focus first on the \u201cmost basic consideration\u201d in determining the sufficiency of a pleading under the so-called <em>Fraunhofer </em>rule; namely, whether the State Fund\u2019s allegations of constructive fraud were sufficiently detailed to provide Berg with adequate notice of the claim so as to enable him to prepare a responsive pleading. <em>See Irving, </em>813 P.2d at 421. The State Fund alleged a constructive fraud claim based on Berg\u2019s pattern of misrepresentation via underreporting and nonreporting of payroll, employee status and employee duties under his workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy with the State Fund. It further alleged that Berg\u2019s conduct reflected an effort to reduce the proper premiums he owed the State Fund and that the State Fund was misled by his conduct vis-a-vis calculation of his workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums. Finally, the State Fund alleged that it was damaged by Berg\u2019s conduct in the amount of underbilled workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Berg did not contend in the District Court, and does not contend in this Court, that the allegations provided insufficient notice of the claim or were so lacking in detail as to negate his ability to prepare responsive pleadings. Indeed, in answering the claim, he denied the allegations of constructive fraud. Berg later filed a motion for summary judgment and supporting brief on a \u201ctime limitations\u201d issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>pursuant to the policy in which he argued, in part, that his reporting practices to the State Fund were not fraudulent. Berg again denied the allegations of actual and constructive fraud in the pretrial order and stated that he did not admit any fraud. Thus, Berg\u2019s own conduct in responding to the claim and putting the State Fund to its proof belies any notion that its allegations of constructive fraud were insufficient to provide adequate notice and enable Berg to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In addition, it is appropriate to consider the context in which the fraud is alleged to have occurred in determining how much detail is required to render a pleading sufficiently particular under Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.R <em>Irving, </em>813 P.2d at 421. Here, Berg and the State Fund had been involved in an insured-insurer relationship via Berg\u2019s State Fund workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy for some fifteen years at the time the original complaint was filed in this case. Berg\u2019s policy required him to timely and accurately report employee wages so the State Fund could calculate his workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums. His own reports, together with the findings of the audit of his operations \u2014 of which he was aware and in which he was involved \u2014 formed the basis for the State Fund\u2019s action against him for constructive fraud. In this context, requiring more detailed allegations of constructive fraud would serve no rational purpose and would exalt form over substance. Indeed, to do so would ignore the \u201cgeneral simplicity and flexibility [in pleading] contemplated by the rules ....\u201d <em>See Irving, </em>813 P.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Berg contends that <em>C. Haydon Ltd. v. Montana Min. Properties </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 321, 864 P.2d 1253, overrules the appropriate interplay between Rules 8(a) and 9(b), M.R.Civ.R, which we enunciated in <em>Irving </em>and <em>Fraunhofer, </em>leaving a strict requirement that all elements of a fraud claim be pled with particularity. In C. <em>Haydon Ltd., </em>we agreed with the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant failed to meet the \u201cparticularity\u201d requirements of Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.P., because various of its fraud allegations were contradictory, based only \u201con information and belief\u2019 of defendant\u2019s counsel, or unsupported by facts. C. <em>Haydon Ltd., </em>864 P.2d at 1256. In addition, we observed that the defendant\u2019s allegations did not address seven of the nine fraud elements at all. C. <em>Haydon Ltd., </em>864 P.2d at 1256. On that basis, we held that the defendant failed to allege fraud with sufficient particularity. We reaffirmed that Rules 9(b) and 8(a), M.R.Civ.R, must be harmonized, but noted that the statement of the claim cannot be so short or plain, under Rule 8(a), M.R.Civ.R, as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>defeat the purposes of Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.P. <em>C. Haydon Ltd., </em>864 P.2d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Here, the State Fund\u2019s claim for constructive fraud did not contain either contradictory allegations or \u201cinformation and belief\u2019 allegations. While perhaps \u201cinartful,\u201d as the District Court stated, the State Fund\u2019s constructive fraud allegations were not so short or so plain as to defeat the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.R, or the \u201cmost basic consideration\u201d underlying that requirement \u2014 namely, that the allegations provide adequate notice to enable Berg to prepare responsive pleadings. Moreover, as noted above, far from overruling the <em>Fraunhofer </em>rule that Rules 8(a) and 9(b), M.R.Civ.R, be harmonized, <em>C. Haydon Ltd. </em>clarified that neither Rule 8(a) nor Rule 9(b), M.R.Civ.R, can be applied exclusively when determining whether a pleading alleges fraud with sufficient particularity. <em>See C. Haydon Ltd., </em>864 P.2d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On this record, we conclude that the State Fund\u2019s allegations of constructive fraud were sufficient to meet the requirements of Rules 8 and 9, M.R.Civ.R, and the <em>Fraunhofer </em>rule. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment which was based on the State Fund\u2019s failure to plead constructive fraud with sufficient particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in his favor which was based on a statute of limitations bar to the constructive fraud claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Berg also based his motion to vacate the judgment on the two-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. He contended that the statute of limitations began to run on or about February 24, 1989, when Knecht began the audit of his operations, and had run prior to the State Fund filing its complaint in January of 1992. In denying the motion, the District Court rejected Berg\u2019s statute of limitations argument both procedurally and substantively. In pertinent part, the District Court determined that the statute of limitations defense was not included in the pretrial order signed by the parties and that the pretrial order was not amended to include that defense prior to trial. We review discretionary trial court rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Van Loan, </em>895 P.2d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">A party must set forth affirmatively any statute of limitations defense in pleading to a preceding pleading. Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.R A pretrial order entered pursuant to Rule 16(e), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>M.R.Civ.P., however, governs and controls the subsequent course of the lawsuit unless modified by a subsequent order. <em>See Zimmerman v. Robertson </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 105, 111, 854 P.2d 338, 342; <em>Naftco Leasing Ltd. v. Finalco, Inc. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 89, 93, 835 P.2d 728, 731. The purpose of pretrial orders is to prevent surprise, simplify the issues and permit counsel to prepare their case for trial on the basis of the pretrial order. <em>Zimmerman, </em>854 P.2d at 342 (citing <em>Workman v. McIntyre Const. Co. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 5, 617 P.2d 1281). Failure to raise an issue or theory in the pretrial order may result in a waiver of that issue or theory. <em>Nentwig v. United Industry, Inc. </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 134, 138, 845 P.2d 99, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Here, Berg pleaded the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in answering the State Fund\u2019s amended complaint, as required by Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P. Thereafter, and via a discovery response, he abandoned this theory. Specifically, in answer to an interrogatory requesting information about the statute of limitations defense he had pleaded, Berg stated that he \u201cintend [ed] to abandon this defense.\u201d Moreover, the pretrial order in this case, prepared by trial counsel for both parties and approved by them as to form and content, does not contain a statute of limitations defense by Berg. Given Berg\u2019s interrogatory response, this is not surprising.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Pursuant to both its terms and <em>Zimmerman, </em>the pretrial order superseded the pleadings and governed the subsequent course of the action. We conclude that, because Berg did not include the statute of limitations defense in the pretrial order, he waived that defense. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berg\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment which was based on the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">5. Did the District Court err in denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict which was based on the existence of a disputable presumption of employee status?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">When Knecht began his audit of Berg\u2019s operations in February of 1989, he questioned whether certain individuals were independent contractors, as Berg claimed, or employees. He investigated the status of the individuals and determined that all but twenty-three of them were independent contractors. Knecht asked Berg for additional information regarding the remaining twenty-three individuals. He told Berg that, if the required documentation was not provided, the individuals would be classified as Berg\u2019s employees and additional workers\u2019 compensation premiums would be owed for them. Berg did not provide any further information and Knecht classified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the individuals as Berg\u2019s employees. On that basis, the State Fund alleged that Berg owed additional workers\u2019 compensation premiums based on the unreported wages of the twenty-three employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Before closing arguments at trial, the State Fund moved for a directed verdict on the issue of workers\u2019 compensation premiums owed by Berg on the unreported wages of the individuals Knecht classified as employees but Berg contended were independent contractors. The State Fund argued that \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA, contains a presumption that an individual performing services for remuneration is an employee unless the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-120(1), MCA, for independent contractor status are met, and that Berg had not rebutted that presumption by presenting evidence that the twenty-three individuals were independent contractors. The District Court denied the State Fund\u2019s motion. Although the District Court did not specifically address whether \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA, creates a presumption of employee status, it implicitly concluded that the statute did not contain such a presumption in denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The District Court then allowed the jury to decide whether Berg owed premiums for the twenty-three individuals and the jury returned a verdict in Berg\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A directed verdict should be granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury; all inferences which can be drawn from the evidence must be considered in a light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 630 (citing <em>Pierce v. ALSC Architects, PS. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 97, 107, 890 P.2d 1254, 1260).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Under the law in effect during the time period covered by the workers\u2019 compensation audit, an independent contractor was statutorily defined as \u201cone who renders service in the course of an occupation\u201d and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">(a) has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of the services, both under his contract and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(b) is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Section 39-71-120(1), MCA (1987). Pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), \u201c[a]n individual performing services for remuneration is considered to be an employee under this chapter unless the requirements of subsection (1) are met.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>When the facts surrounding an individual\u2019s arrangement with an employer are relatively undisputed, the question of whether the individual is an independent contractor or an employee is a question of law. <em>Potter v. Department of Labor &amp; Ind. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 476, 479, 853 P.2d 1207, 1209 (citation omitted); <em>see also Northwest Pub. v. Department of Labor &amp; Ind. </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 360, 362, 846 P.2d 1030, 1031 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Topco, Inc., </em>912 P.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The State Fund contends that the phrase \u201cis considered to be\u201d in \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), creates a statutory presumption that an individual providing services for another is an employee and not an independent contractor. Therefore, according to the State Fund, once sufficient facts are established to give rise to the presumption, the party asserting independent contractor status bears the burden of rebutting the presumption. Berg\u2019s sole argument is that \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), does not create a disputable presumption of employee status because \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-601 and 26-1-602, MCA, and Rule 301, M.R.Evid., contain an exhaustive and exclusive list of conclusive and disputable presumptions which does not include an employee status presumption pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Rule 301, M.R.Evid., defines presumptions and generally addresses their classification and effect. All presumptions, other than conclusive presumptions, are disputable presumptions and may be controverted. Rule 301(b)(2), M.R.Evid. If a disputable presumption is not overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, the trier of fact must find the assumed fact in accordance with the presumption. Rule 301(b)(2), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Section 26-1-601, MCA, states that \u201c[t]he following presumptions are conclusive\u201d and then specifically lists three conclusive presumptions; subsection (4) provides that any other presumption which, by statute, is expressly made conclusive is a conclusive presumption. Thus, \u00a7 26-1-601, MCA, limits conclusive presumptions to those listed therein or expressly set forth in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The language of \u00a7 26-1-602, MCA, which addresses disputable presumptions, is markedly different. It states that \u201c[a]ll other presumptions are \u2018disputable presumptions\u2019 and may be controverted by other evidence.\u201d Section 26-1-602, MCA. The statute then states \u201c[t]he following are of that kind,\u201d and provides a listing of thirty-eight disputable presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We have not previously addressed whether the list of disputable presumptions contained in \u00a7 26-1-602, MCA, is exhaustive. Certainly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the language of \u00a7 26-1-602, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he following are of that kind [disputable presumptions]\u201d does not indicate an intent that the list be exhaustive or exclusive. Moreover, while our Commission on Rules of Evidence provided a table of statutory conclusive presumptions, statutory disputable presumptions and common law disputable presumptions, the Compiler\u2019s Comments clarify that the list of presumptions in that table \u201cis not intended as an authority for whether or not any particular presumption exists, but only as a research guide to presumptions generally.\u201d Part Compiler\u2019s Comments, Title 26, chapter 1, part 6, Table D-Presumptions. The Comments further state that \u201c[t]his list is intended only as an aid to Montana judges and lawyers, and the inclusion or exclusion from this table of any particular presumption should have no effect on a court\u2019s treatment of that particular presumption.\u201d Part Compiler\u2019s Comments, Title 26, chapter 1, part 6, Table D-Presumptions. We conclude, therefore, that the absence of the \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), \u201cis considered to be\u201d language in the \u00a7 26-1-602, MCA, enumeration of disputable presumptions does not establish that the phrase at issue here is not a disputable presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Moreover, in interpreting \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), we look first to the plain meaning of the words it contains. <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 631 (citing <em>Clarke v.

Where the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation. <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 631 (citing <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088). \u201cIn the search for plain meaning, \u2018the language used must be reasonably and logically interpreted, giving words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 631 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cConsider\u201d means to think about, regard or classify. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 483 (1971). Therefore, an individual who performs services for another person may be thought about, regarded or classified as an employee unless the requirements for independent contractor status are met. A reasonable and logical interpretation of the phrase \u201cis considered to be\u201d leads us to conclude that this phrase in \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), creates a disputable presumption of employee status and the District Corut erred in concluding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In order for the State Fund to rely on the employee status presumption contained in \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), it necessarily must have established that the individuals it contended were employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>had performed services for Berg for remuneration. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-401, MCA. Berg does not dispute that the State Fund did so. Having satisfied this threshold requirement, the State Fund became entitled to the presumption that the twenty-three individuals were Berg\u2019s employees. Section 39-71-120(2), MCA(1987). Thereafter, the burden shifted to Berg to rebut the presumption by presenting evidence establishing that the individuals were independent contractors pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-120(1), MCA (1987), and our cases thereunder. Section 26-1-602, MCA; Rule 301(b)(2), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">As noted above, Berg\u2019s sole contention in responding to the State Fund\u2019s cross-appeal is that \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987), does not constitute a disputable presumption of employee status and, therefore, that he bore no burden of establishing that the twenty-three individuals were independent contractors. We have concluded otherwise. Because Berg did not dispute the fact that the twenty-three individuals had performed services for him for remuneration and because he does not argue that he met his burden of establishing independent contractor status for the individuals in question, Rule 301(b)(2), M.R.Evid., and <em>Potter </em>required the District Court to direct a verdict as a matter of law that the twenty-three individuals were Berg\u2019s employees in accordance with the presumption contained in \u00a7 39-71-120(2), MCA (1987). Therefore, we hold that the District Court erred in denying the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict which was based on the existence of a disputable presumption of employee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES ERDMANN, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
