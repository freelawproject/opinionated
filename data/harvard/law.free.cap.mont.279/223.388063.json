We reverse and remand with instructions consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it granted the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict because Elizabeth Kuzara presented insufficient proof of notice of a work-related injury as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">All references to the facts of this case are obtained from the sworn testimony of Elizabeth Kuzara at the trial held before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. It is noted that the judge found Kuzara to be a credible witness, stating, \u201cI can at this point and do assume that she is telling me the truth about her conversations. And indeed I don\u2019t have any reason to disbelieve her and sitting here listening to her and observing her, she impresses me as credible up to this point.\u201d It is further noted that the State Fund did not offer any testimony or evidence at trial rebutting or contradicting the testimony of Kuzara, although it had the opportunity and chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Kuzara was employed as a dragline groundsman by the Spring Creek Coal Company at an open pit coal mine near Decker, Montana. Spring Creek is insured by the State Fund. Kuzara claims that she sustained a work-related injury on July 18, 1993. While cleaning dried mud from a dragline machine shoe, Kuzara suffered intense pain in her lower back, through her hips, and down her right leg. At trial she described the pain as \u201cenough that I had to cease what I was doing \u2014 it was like getting an electrical shock almost.\u201d No one other than Kuzara witnessed this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Kuzara worked with Ed Bebee, a dragline operator. Kuzara testified that she did not specifically tell Bebee, a co-worker, about the July 18 incident on the day that it occurred. However, the next day Kuzara could not complete her shift due to back pain. Bebee allowed her to rest inside his dragline cab for the remainder of the shift. While in the cab, Kuzara and Bebee talked about their back injuries for several hours. During that discussion Kuzara informed Bebee, \u201cI thought I\u2019d hurt my back.\u201d She also testified, \u201cI told him at that time that \u2014 as far as what led to this, that I thought I had done it when I was down cleaning on the shoe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Spring Creek employees participated in a gain-sharing program. Spring Creek set aside a percentage of its profits to be distributed to employees every three months. The program was based on a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of factors, including the number of lost-time accidents reported by employees. Thus, when an employee reported an accident, lost time was subtracted from the employee\u2019s overall gain share, and all other employees\u2019 shares were also reduced. In the quarter immediately preceding her injury, Kuzara earned approximately $950 through Spring Creek\u2019s gain-sharing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Kuzara was not scheduled to work on July 20 and 21, 1993. Because she had experienced difficulty sleeping since July 18 and was still in pain, Kuzara called Dr. Robert Wood, a neurosurgeon in Billings, Montana, and scheduled an appointment for August 5,1993. Kuzara worked for the next two weeks after the dragline incident but did not inform Spring Creek or any co-workers about her back problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On August 4,1993, Kuzara told her supervisor, Clark Izzard, about her August 5 doctor\u2019s appointment but did not inform him of the reason for it. During the summer of 1993, rumors had circulated among Spring Creek employees that a layoff might occur. Kuzara feared that if she reported her injury to Spring Creek she would be targeted as an injured employee and would be laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Kuzara drove to Billings, Montana, on August 5 for her appointment with Dr. Wood. Following a myelogram, Dr. Wood diagnosed Kuzara with a herniated disc. He recommended surgery to treat the herniated disc. Kuzara then realized she would have to report her injury to Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On August 8, 1993, Kuzara returned home to Decker, Montana. According to Kuzara, she called Izzard at home and told him that she would not be able to come into work the next day. When asked why, Kuzara explained that she had a bad disc and would require back surgery. Kuzara stated at trial that she volunteered the following information to Izzard: \u201c[The injury] was work related, but [Izzard] was \u2014 he was asking how it happened. I told him it was from a combination of things over a period of time, but most recently from lifting several weeks earlier, meaning about three weeks earlier, two to three weeks earlier.\u201d Kuzara did not say her injury happened at work but told Izzard that her injury was work related. She informed Izzard that she was getting sick and could not talk anymore and that, if Izzard needed more information concerning her injury, he should contact Bebee, \u201cbecause [Bebee] knew more than anyone else about [the situation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">That same evening, Kuzara also called Gene Kilpatrick, Spring Creek\u2019s department superintendent, and told him much of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>information she had told Izzard. At trial, Kuzara testified that she told Kilpatrick, \u201c[The injury] was from operating equipment, from slips and falls. Told him it was mostly from lifting the power cable within the last couple of weeks, several weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">On August 9, 1993, Kuzara called Don Gibboney, Human Resources Manager at Spring Creek. She called him \u201cbecause I knew I needed to inform him that there was probably some kind of paperwork that needed to be done regarding this, and that they were the folks to call and they\u2019d take care of it.\u201d She informed Gibboney that her back problem was work related, had been determined to be a surgical condition, and was \u201cfrom a combination of things over a period of time.\u201d Gibboney advised Kuzara to take sick leave and file a claim with Aetna Life and Casualty Company (Aetna), Spring Creek\u2019s group health insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">When Gibboney questioned Kuzara about how much sick leave she had accrued, Kuzara responded that she did not know. Gibboney transferred Kuzara to Connie Haugen, who worked in Spring Creek\u2019s Human Resources Department. Kuzara informed Haugen that her back injury was work related. Then, according to Kuzara, Haugen stated that \u201cshe would \u2014 they would take care of everything. They would handle it all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On August 10, 1993, Kuzara spoke with Kilpatrick again. She claims she told him three times that her condition was work related. Spring Creek placed Kuzara on sick leave and encouraged her to file a claim with Aetna. Spring Creek\u2019s Aetna policy did not cover work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Dr. Wood performed back surgery on Kuzara on August 11, 1993, and released her on August 17,1993. By mid-September, Kuzara had not received any paperwork regarding the injury she claims that she reported to Izzard, Kilpatrick, Gibboney, and Haugen on August 8-10, 1993. Concerned that she had not heard from Spring Creek, Kuzara drove to work on September 20,1993, and informed Steve Velasquez, Spring Creek Safety Director, the details of the July 18 dragline incident. This conversation was the first time Kuzara gave specific notice to a Spring Creek supervisor of the exact time, place and nature of her injury. At trial Kuzara testified that she believed she told Velasquez that her condition \u201cwas from that incident ... and was brought on also from just years of wear and tear from the mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">On October 15, 1993, Kuzara received a phone call asking her to come to Sheridan, Wyoming, to meet with Kilpatrick, Haugen, and Gibboney. In Sheridan, Kuzara learned that her employment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>be terminated on October 16, 1993, and that she had no remaining sick leave with Spring Creek. Kuzara contacted the State Fund and was informed that Spring Creek had not filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for her July 18 injury. Kuzara filed a claim with the State Fund which it denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Kuzara filed a petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court seeking an award of benefits under the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. On November 14, 1995, the matter was heard before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Following Kuzara\u2019s testimony, the State Fund moved for a directed verdict, arguing that based on Kuzara\u2019s testimony there was insufficient evidence to establish that she had provided her employer with sufficient notice of an injury as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). The following exchange then occurred between Kuzara and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">THE COURT: Is [the September 20, 1993, discussion with Velasquez] the first time that you told him [about the July 18 incident] or told anybody that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">KUZARA: That I was that specific?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">THE COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">KUZARA: That I was that specific about it, I informed- when I spoke with Clark \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">MR. SHEEHY: August 8th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">KUZARA: Yes, August 8th, with Clark and Gene, and then Don Gibboney on August 9th, I wasn\u2019t that specific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">THE COURT: As I recall your testimony, you said you told him that the latest thing had happened while you were lifting several weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">KUZARA: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">THE COURT: And that is as specific you got then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">KUZARA: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">THE COURT: Okay. So at the time you talked to these fellows on August 8th, 9th, and 10th, you weren\u2019t keying specifically in on the work that you were doing with the shoe and lifting the grates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMZ\">KUZARA: No. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">THE COURT: Were you keying in on that day to the \u2014 at least the date that this all started, or were you even vague about that at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-17\">KUZARA: I was vague about that. I told them several weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Following this discussion, Kuzara\u2019s counsel agreed that there was no additional testimony that would prove Kuzara had provided a more specific report of an injury having occurred on July 18, 1993. The court granted the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. In a judgment issued on November 27, 1995, the court deemed Kuzara\u2019s testimony to be credible. The court explained in its findings of fact that Kuzara\u2019s notice was insufficient because it was too vague. Kuzara admitted at trial that at the time of her conversations on August 8, 9 and 10, she had identified no specific incident or series of incidents from which her work-related problems arose and did not do so until after the thirty-day period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Kuzara, proceeding pro se, appeals the judgment granting the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination that Kuzara had presented insufficient evidence to establish notice is a finding of fact. A reviewing court uses a three-step test to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. First, if a court\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial credible evidence, they are clearly erroneous. Second, if a court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, its findings are clearly erroneous. Third, if a review of the record leaves the reviewing court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, the lower court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Spence v. Ortloff </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 533, 535, 898 P.2d 1232, 1233 (citing <em>Interstate Production Credit Ass\u2019n v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it granted the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict because it concluded that Kuzara had provided Spring Creek with insufficient notice of an injury as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993)?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Kuzara argues that she provided sufficient notice of her work-related injury to Spring Creek. Spring Creek and the State Fund counter that Kuzara failed to provide notice of the specific time, place and nature of her injury as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). We agree with Kuzara.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Workers\u2019 compensation laws in effect at the time of a claimant\u2019s injury are controlling. <em>Crittendon v. Terri\u2019s Restaurant &amp; Lounge </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 293, 295, 806 P.2d 534, 535. Because Kuzara claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>she was injured on July 18, 1993, this case is governed by the notice provision of \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">Notice of injuries other than death to he submitted within thirty days. No claim to recover benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, for injuries not resulting in death, may be considered compensable unless, within 30 days after the occurrence of the accident which is claimed to have caused the injury, notice of time and place where the accident occurred and the nature of the injury is given to the employer or the employer\u2019s insurer by the injured employee or someone on the employee\u2019s behalf. <em>Actual knowledge of the accident and injury on the part of the employer or the employer\u2019s managing agent or superintendent in charge of the work upon which the injured employee was engaged at the time of the injury is equivalent to notice. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgS\">The determinative issue in this case is notice. The evidence presented by Kuzara indicates that Spring Creek operated under an informal policy that discouraged its employees from reporting work-related injuries. Spring Creek\u2019s gain-sharing plan discouraged employees from reporting injuries because if one employee reported a work-related injury, all employees stood to lose a percentage of their gain-sharing profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Spring Creek argues that Kuzara\u2019s report of a work-related injury was vague in terms of specific time, place, and event. On August 8, 1993, Kuzara called her supervisor, Clark Izzard, and informed him that she was going to require back surgery. Kuzara told Izzard that her injury was work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">While Kuzara\u2019s statements to Izzard on August 8 could have been more specific in terms of time, place, and event, Izzard could have learned more about what happened by contacting Bebee, as Kuzara suggested. When Kuzara called Izzard on August 8, 1993, Kuzara informed him that she was in significant pain from a post-operative headache and was unable to speak on the telephone any longer. She informed Izzard that if he wanted any additional information, he should contact Bebee, who knew the whole story. Izzard made no attempt to contact Bebee. Had he done so, as Kuzara suggested, Spring Creek could have learned the details of Kuzara\u2019s injury on August 8,1993, which she had already explained to Izzard were work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We conclude that during her case-in-chief Kuzara supplied sufficient evidence of notice of her work-related injury to her employer when she informed Izzard on August 8,1993, that he should contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Bebee for more information. However, respondents should have the opportunity to present evidence to rebut Kuzara\u2019s claim that she gave Spring Creek sufficient notic\u00e9 of her injury. Therefore, we remand this issue to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Notwithstanding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found Kuzara to have testified truthfully and to be a credible witness, the court granted respondents a directed verdict. We conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in misapprehending the evidence that supports Kuzara\u2019s claim of having given sufficient notice of her work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">As a secondary issue to the notice provisions of \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993), we also consider principles of estoppel. Equitable estoppel applies when an employer or insurer has taken some positive action which either prevents a claimant from filing a timely claim or leads the claimant reasonably to believe she need not file such a claim. <em>Davis v. Jones </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 464, 466, 661 P.2d 859, 860. Six elements make up the doctrine of equitable estoppel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">1. There must be conduct amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">2. These facts must be known to the party estopped at the time of the conduct, or at least the circumstances must be such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">3. The truth concerning these facts must be unknown to the other party claiming the benefit of the estoppel, at the time when it was acted upon by him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">4. The conduct must be done with the intention, or at least with the expectation, that it will be acted upon by the other party, or under such circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it will be so acted upon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">5. The conduct must be relied upon by the other party, and, thus relying, he must be led to act upon it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">6. He must in fact act upon it in such a manner as to change his position for the worse, in other words, he must so act that he would suffer a loss if he were compelled to surrender or forego or alter what he has done by reason of the first party being permitted to repudiate his conduct and to assert rights inconsistent with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-12\"><em>Davis, </em>661 P.2d at 860-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">We now apply the facts provided in Kuzara\u2019s testimony, which the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found to be credible, to the six elements of estoppel. First, Spring Creek represented to Kuzara and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>concealed from her material facts. It did so on August 10,1993, when Haugen stated that Spring Creek would take care of everything and when she also encouraged Kuzara to file a nonwork-related claim with Aetna. Haugen had to know that for a claim to be compensable by Aetna it could not be work related. Haugen did not inform Kuzara of this Aetna policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Second, Spring Creek was aware or should have been aware of the effect its representation and concealment of material facts would have on Kuzara. After being told by Haugen that Spring Creek would take care of everything, Spring Creek could reasonably assume that Kuzara would not file a claim with the State Fund. Additionally, after thirty days, Kuzara would be statutorily barred from filing a claim with the State Fund. Spring Creek was aware of this fact and also knew that Kuzara was unaware of the consequences of filing a claim with Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Third, Kuzara did not know the truth concerning Spring Creek\u2019s representation and concealment at the time her claim was filed with Aetna. Kuzara did not know what the Aetna policy said or that she had to report her work-related injury to Spring Creek or the State Fund within thirty days in order to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Fourth, Spring Creek encouraged Kuzara to file a nonwork-related claim with Aetna, expecting that she would file a claim with Aetna and not report her work-related injury to the State Fund. Spring Creek also knew or should have known that after Haugen represented that Spring Creek would take care of everything, Kuzara would not report her injury to the State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Fifth, Kuzara relied on Haugen\u2019s representation that Spring Creek \u201cwould take care of everything. They would handle it all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Sixth, by acting on Spring Creek\u2019s representation, Kuzara acted in a manner which changed her position for the worse. Believing that Spring Creek would take care of everything and that Aetna would cover her injury, Kuzara did not file a claim with the State Fund until the thirty-day statutory notice period had expired. By relying on Spring Creek\u2019s representation, Kuzara was placed in a far worse position that she would have been in had she filed a timely claim with the State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Based on the record before this Court and unless rebutted by substantial credible evidence, Spring Creek\u2019s representation and concealment of material facts led Kuzara reasonably to believe that she did not have to file a claim with the State Fund. Equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>estoppel would therefore be proper to prevent Spring Creek and the State Fund from claiming that Kuzara supplied improper notice under \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). Spring Creek encouraged Kuzara to file a nonwork-related injury claim with Aetna and also told Kuzara that it would \u201ctake care of everything.\u201d We hold that unless rebutted by Spring Creek and the State Fund, they are estopped from claiming that Kuzara provided insufficient notice of her work-related injury under \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). As with the issue of notice, respondents should have the opportunity to present evidence during their case-in-chief to rebut the issue of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">We emphasize that this holding is limited to the narrow facts of this case. The notice Kuzara supplied to her employer was not by any means perfect and is not a model by which employees should notify their employers about work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Remanded to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a continuation of the trial and with respondents to be given the opportunity to present evidence rebutting Kuzara\u2019s claim that she supplied adequate notice of her injury to Spring Creek and to rebut the issue of estoppel.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-6\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b253-7\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AgI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">I respectfully dissent from almost the entirety of the Court\u2019s opinion. Indeed, it is my view that the opinion is so riddled with error as to be difficult to address. My concerns begin with the \u201cFactual Background\u201d set forth by the Court and are heightened by the Court\u2019s discussion of both the issue which is actually before us and the issue which is not, but which the Court inexplicably feels compelled to raise and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The Court begins by reciting purported \u201cfacts\u201d at some length, observing both there and later in its opinion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that Kuzara was credible. It is important to note that the trial court\u2019s credibility determination was limited to her testimony regarding matters at issue in its consideration of the State Fund\u2019s motion for directed verdict; namely, the conversations with various people at Spring Creek Coal on which she relied in attempting to establish that she had provided sufficient notice. Contrary to the Court\u2019s implicit suggestion, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not \u201cfind\u201d all of her testimony credible in all particulars; indeed, it could hardly have done so since the State Fund had not presented its version of the \u201cfacts.\u201d Moreover, the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>suggestion that, in successfully obtaining a directed verdict on the notice issue without the necessity of putting on its case, the State Fund somehow <em>chose </em>not to rebut or contradict the portions of Kuzara\u2019s testimony which did not relate specifically to the notice question at issue in its motion for directed verdict is disingenuous at very least. Kuzara\u2019s testimony on matters apart from the conversations she had with Spring Creek personnel within 30 days of the date of her alleged injury does not establish \u201cfacts\u201d for any purpose other than determining whether the notice required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993), was given and is not relevant to the issue before us as stated at the outset of the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">I also disagree with the standard under which the Court has chosen to review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision in this matter. The issue before us is whether that court erred in directing a verdict on the notice question. Our standard in reviewing a court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict certainly is not whether the court\u2019s decision is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Nor do I agree that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination that Kuzara presented insufficient evidence to establish notice is a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. Questions relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to meet statutory requirements are questions of law subject to de novo review by this Court to determine whether they are correct. Thus, while I recognize that matters relating to standards of review often seem esoteric or unimportant to some, I register my strenuous objection to what the Court is doing here in applying an incorrect standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The reason the standard of review matters here is this: under the standard for reviewing findings of fact, this Court need not rely on any legal authority in support of its ultimate conclusion regarding whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are sufficiently supported by the record. That is, under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, we need only review the record and apply the three-part clearly erroneous test. The Court apparently chooses this standard here because \u2014 as will become more apparent later \u2014 no legal authority exists for the conclusion it reaches. The only way in which the Court can reach the result it seeks is to skewer the standard of review. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In addition to applying the wrong standard of review, the Court also misapplies the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard it has chosen. It never determines, pursuant to the first prong of that test, whether the trial court\u2019s alleged \u201cfinding\u201d is supported by substantial credible evidence; instead, it proceeds directly to its determination \u2014 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the second part of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review \u2014 that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court \u201cmisapprehended the effect of the evidence\u201d before it relating to notice. One can only suppose that this is because the Court is aware that the decision it purports to review as a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d is not a factual finding at all and, therefore, is not susceptible to a record review to determine whether it is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">I do agree with two portions of the Court\u2019s opinion. First, immediately below its \u201cDiscussion\u201d heading, the Court correctly states the issue before us as whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in granting the State Fund\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based on its <em>conclusion </em>that Kuzara provided her employer with insufficient notice of an injury under \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). Second, the Court correctly quotes the applicable statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The problem is that no further mention of the <em>law </em>\u2014 either the statute and its requirements or our cases thereunder \u2014 appears in the Court\u2019s resolution of the issue before us. The Court does not even bother to try to apply the language of the statute to Kuzara\u2019s testimony to determine the legal question of whether her conversations constituted notice as defined by the statute. The Court\u2019s failure to include even a shred of legal support for the result it reaches here is both transparent and irresponsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Applying the statutory terms only briefly here, it is clear from Kuzara\u2019s testimony \u2014 as quoted by the Court \u2014 that she did not notify Spring Creek Coal or the State Fund of \u201cthe time and place where the accident occurred and the nature of the injury...\u201d within 30 days. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). It is also clear that neither the employer nor the employer\u2019s managing agent or superintendent in charge of the work upon which Kuzara was engaged at the time of the injury had \u201c[a]ctual knowledge of the accident and injury [,]\u201d as alternatively required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Instead of applying these statutory requirements to the evidence before it, the Court simply ignores them. In an apparent effort to buttress its totally insupportable resolution of the issue, it goes on to state that Izzard \u201ccould have learned more\u201d by contacting Bebee. It cites to no authority under which the employee\u2019s obligation to provide legally sufficient notice directly, or at least establish the employer\u2019s actual knowledge pursuant to the statute, can be \u201ctransferred\u201d to the employer. Nor does it cite to any authority under which an employee\u2019s legally insufficient notice becomes sufficient as a matter of law where the employer may have had the means to acquire additional informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tion about the accident and injury. The reason for this total absence of authority is clear: no such legal authority exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Furthermore, the Court\u2019s statement \u2014 at the end of its discussion of the issue before us \u2014 that Spring Creek Coal and the State Fund should have an \u201copportunity to rebut\u201d Kuzara\u2019s \u201csufficient evidence of notice\u201d on remand is apparently intended to suggest that the notice issue remains unresolved. The suggestion is an empty one. As discussed above, Kuzara\u2019s testimony about the extent of the notice she gave \u2014 taken as true by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, this Court and myself \u2014 is insufficient as a matter of law to constitute the notice required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993). It does not need to be rebutted. The Court\u2019s suggestion is merely another outgrowth of its application of the wrong standard of review to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Court states that, on September 20, 1993, Kuzara informed a Spring Creek supervisor of the details of the July 18 incident. The Court also correctly observes that this was the first such notification by Kuzara of the time, place and nature of her injury. It is clear that this notification was not made within the statutorily-mandated thirty-day period for notice. The Court simply refuses to apply the law to these facts. Applying \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA (1993), to the facts regarding notice set forth in Kuzara\u2019s testimony, I would affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Finally, I feel compelled to address the Court\u2019s \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d discussion. This issue is not before the Court. It was neither raised nor argued in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and is neither raised nor argued in this Court. Simply put, the Court has \u201ccreated\u201d this issue out of whole cloth and then resolved it, apparently recognizing that its discussion and resolution of the issue actually before us is transparently incapable of standing alone. Moreover, the Court performs this feat of prestidigitation based on the so-called \u201cfacts\u201d in Kuzara\u2019s testimony. There are no <em>facts </em>of record regarding this issue never raised or tried in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, however. Likewise, there is no decision by that court for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">This Court raises the issue, makes findings of fact regarding lack of knowledge by Kuzara which even Kuzara\u2019s own testimony does not support, makes further findings regarding Spring Creek\u2019s knowledge from a nonexistent record, and then resolves the question. To say that this entire portion of the Court\u2019s opinion is dicta is true; the Court resolved the only issue before it \u2014 albeit erroneously \u2014 before reaching out and creating this issue from thin air. But to say that this part of the opinion is dicta is an understatement. This is as extreme an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>example of lack of respect and regard for this Court\u2019s proper role as I have ever seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion in this case raises \u201cresult oriented\u201d opinion writing to an art-form.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-6\">JUSTICES NELSON and ERDMANN join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
