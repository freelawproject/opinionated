We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Gregory and Dale Stires\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Gregory and Dale Stires (collectively, Stires) and Stanley Hall (Hall) owned and operated the Elk Valley Game Ranch (Game Ranch) as partners beginning in 1986. The partnership originally was formed pursuant to an oral agreement; however, Stires and Hall executed a written partnership agreement with regard to the Game Ranch in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">In June of 1986, Hall purchased thirty-eight head of elk from Martin Carelli (Carelli). He signed a promissory note agreeing to pay Carelli $36,000 by December 20, 1986, for the elk. The promissory note refers solely to Hall as the purchaser and contains no reference to Stires or the Game Ranch. Hall also signed a security agreement covering the elk purchased from Carelli. The security agreement names, and is signed by, Hall as the debtor; it reflects that the elk will be kept at the Game Ranch and will be used for business purposes. Finally, Carelli and Hall signed, and Carelli filed, a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement identifying Hall as the debtor and the elk as the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Stires and Hall dissolved their partnership in 1988. Pursuant to the partnership dissolution agreement, Stires would continue to operate the Game Ranch. The dissolution agreement listed the partnership debt and divided it between Stires and Hall. The debt attributable to the promissory note executed by Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor was not listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">After Hall failed to pay Carelli pursuant to the promissory note, Carelli sued Hall for the principal and interest owing on the note, together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Hall answered, denying liability on the promissory note. He also filed a third-party complaint against Stires alleging that, pursuant to the partnership dissolution agreement, Stires was obligated to pay Carelli the debt evidenced by the promissory note. In response to Hall\u2019s third-party complaint, Stires denied liability for the debt, arguing that the debt evidenced by the promissory note was Hall\u2019s personal obligation and, therefore, Stires could not be held liable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Stires attempted to depose Hall on three occasions. The first two dates were rescheduled and Hall failed to appear for the third. Thereafter, Carelli moved for summary judgment against Hall pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R, as well as for entry of judgment in his favor against Hall as a Rule 37 sanction for Hall\u2019s failure to appear at the depositions. Stires also moved for Rule 37 sanctions against Hall, requesting the court to dismiss Hall\u2019s third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The District Court concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding Hall\u2019s liability on the promissory note and granted summary judgment in favor of Carelli. In addition, the court granted Rule 37 sanctions against Hall in favor of both Carelli and Stires and, accordingly, entered judgment against Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor and dismissed Hall\u2019s third-party complaint against Stires. The District Court then permitted Carelli to amend his complaint, pursuant to Rule 15, M.R.Civ.R, to assert a claim against Stires for liability on the debt evidenced by the promissory note Hall executed. Stires answered, denying liability on the note, and both Stires and Carelli conducted discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Stires subsequently moved for summary judgment against Carelli, arguing that the promissory note, security agreement and financing statement clearly and unambiguously identified Hall as the sole debtor on the note. Thus, according to Stires, no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether Stires was a debtor liable on the note and Stires was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under UCC, contract and partnership principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Carelli opposed Stires\u2019 motion. After oral argument on Stires\u2019 summary judgment motion, the District Court determined that genuine issues of material fact existed and Stires was not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>judgment as a matter of law. It provided no further explanation or analysis of its denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Following a bench trial, the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that Hall was authorized to \u2014 and did, in fact \u2014 purchase the elk on behalf of the partnership and, therefore, that Stires was liable on the promissory note. The court entered judgment accordingly and Stires appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Did the District Court err in denying Stires\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P, criteria used by that court. <em>Johnson v. Nyhart </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 379, 384, 889 P.2d 1170, 1173 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Brinkman &amp; Lenon v. P &amp; D Land Enters. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 238, 241, 867 P.2d 1112, 1115. Only where the moving party satisfies its initial burden does the burden shift to the party opposing summary judgment to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Matter of Estate of Lien </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 295, 298, 892 P.2d 530, 532 (citing <em>Owen v. Ostrum </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 249, 255-56, 855 P.2d 1015, 1019). The nonmoving party may not rest upon the allegations in the pleadings or on speculative or conclusory statements. <em>Estate of Lien, </em>892 P.2d at 532 (citing <em>Simmons v. Jenkins </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 429, 432, 750 P.2d 1067, 1069). Moreover, only admissible evidence can be considered in determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>See Treutel v. Jacobs </em>(1990), 240 Mont. 405, 408, 784 P.2d 915, 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u201cMaterial issues of fact are identified by looking to the substantive law governing the proceedings.\u201d <em>Estate of Lien, </em>892 P.2d at 532 (citation omitted). Here, Carelli and Stires agree that the UCC is the primary source of law applicable in this case because the sale of elk at issue here is a sale of \u201cgoods\u201d under \u00a7 30-2-105(1), MCA (1985), and, additionally, that the promissory note is an \u201cinstrument\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 30-3-102 and 30-3-104, MCA (1985). They also agree that contract and partnership principles apply only secondarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The central issue in this case is whether Stires is liable on the debt evidenced by the promissory note and security agreement for the purchase of the elk executed by Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor. Stated differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ently, the issue is whether Hall bound the Game Ranch partnership and, as a result, Stires, when he executed the note and security agreement. In support of his motion for summary judgment, Stires relies on the promissory note and the related security agreement, both executed solely by Hall and identifying only Hall as the debtor. Stires contends that they clearly and unambiguously establish, via their express terms, that Hall is the sole person liable for the debt evidenced by the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The note specifically provides that \u201cthe undersigned promises to pay ... MARTIN CARELLI ... the sum of Thirty-six Thousand and no/100 ($36,000.00) Dollars on or before the 20th day of December, 1986. ...\u201d for the thirty-eight head of elk. Hall is the sole signatory of the note and neither the Game Ranch nor Stires is referenced in any way. Thus, the promissory note clearly establishes that Hall is the person liable for the promise to pay contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In addition, \u00a7 30-3-401(1), MCA (1985), expressly provides that \u201c[n]o person is liable on an instrument unless his signature appears thereon.\u201d Because neither Stires nor the Game Ranch is identified in the note and Stires\u2019 signature is not contained therein, Stires is not liable on the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We conclude that, as the party moving for summary judgment, Stires met the initial burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding Stires\u2019 liability on the promissory note executed by Hall and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The burden then shifted to Carelli to present affirmative evidence of a material and substantial nature raising genuine issues of material fact regarding Stires\u2019 liability; he could not rest on the allegations in his pleadings or on conclusory or speculative statements. <em>See Estate of Lien, </em>892 P.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Carelli\u2019s argument that Stires is liable for the debt evidenced by the promissory note executed by Hall is based on the UCC and contract and partnership law. Conceding that the promissory note is clear and identifies Hall as the sole debtor, Carelli nonetheless argues that his deposition establishes the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Hall signed the promissory note on behalf of the Game Ranch and that the District Court properly determined that this factual issue precluded summary judgment. Specifically, he relies on his deposition testimony that, in negotiating for the purchase of the elk, Hall represented to him that Hall was purchasing the elk on behalf of the Game Ranch and that the partnership and, more specifically, Stires, would pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Carelli concedes that parol evidence is inadmissible to alter the express and unambiguous terms of a written agreement. He also implicitly recognizes that Hall\u2019s alleged representations could be considered in the summary judgment context only if they would be admissible into evidence at trial. <em>See Treutel, </em>784 P.2d at 917. Carelli advances alternative arguments under which Hall\u2019s alleged representations that he signed the promissory note in a representative capacity \u2014 that is, on behalf of the Game Ranch \u2014 constitute admissible evidence properly considered by the District Court in denying Stires\u2019 motion for summary judgment. His arguments in this regard are premised on his contention that reference to the Game Ranch in the security agreement creates an ambiguity as to the identity of the debtor on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Extrinsic evidence of contemporaneous or prior oral agreements which contradicts the express terms of a written agreement is admissible where the written agreement is ambiguous. <em>See Haggerty v. Gallatin County </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 109, 117, 717 P.2d 550, 555. Whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law. <em>See Klawitter v. Dettmann </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 275, 281, 886 P.2d 416, 420; <em>Weldon v. Montana Bank </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 88, 93, 885 P.2d 511, 514. Where the language of an agreement is clear and unambiguous and, as a result, susceptible to only one interpretation, the duty of the court is to apply the language as written. <em>Audit Services, Inc. v. Systad </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 62, 65, 826 P.2d 549, 551 (citation omitted). An ambiguity exists, however, when a contract is subject to two different interpretations; under such a circumstance, parol evidence can be used to determine the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Audit Services, </em>826 P.2d at 551; <em>see also Morning Star Enters. v. R.H. Grover </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 105, 111, 805 P.2d 553, 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As discussed above, the promissory note identifies Hall as the sole debtor. It also states that \u201c[t]his note is in conjunction with that certain Security Agreement bearing date of June 30, 1986, covering 38 head of elk.\u201d The security agreement, like the promissory note, designates Hall as the debtor and is signed only by Hall. It further provides that the elk will be used for business purposes and kept at the Game Ranch. The security agreement does not refer to Stires or indicate in any manner that Hall signed in a representative capacity on behalf of the Game Ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The promissory note and security agreement are susceptible to only one interpretation with regard to the identity of the debtor liable on the note. The promissory note expressly states that Hall is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>person responsible for paying the obligation owed for the sale of the elk. Moreover, the security agreement expressly designates Hall as the debtor. Thus, because Hall is \u201cthe person who owes payment... of the obligation secured,\u201d he is the \u201cdebtor\u201d as that term is used in the Secured Transactions chapter of the UCC. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-9-105(l)(d), MCA (1985). The reference to the Game Ranch in the security agreement does not render ambiguous the plain language of the note and the security agreement identifying Hall as the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Carelli also argues that \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA (1991), permits extrinsic evidence that Hall was acting on behalf of the Game Ranch in signing the promissory note. Recognizing that the 1985 version of \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA, was in effect at the time of the transaction at issue, Carelli argues that the 1991 amendment to \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA, was merely procedural and, as a result, properly can be applied retroactively. Stires contends, on the other hand, that the 1991 amendment was substantive and cannot be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">As a general rule, statutes cannot be applied retroactively unless expressly so declared by the Montana legislature. Section 1-2-109, MCA. A statute does not operate retroactively merely because it is applied to conduct occurring prior to its enactment. <em>Porter v. Galarneau </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 174, 183, 911 P.2d 1143, 1148 (citation omitted). A retroactive law is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">one which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, attaches a new disability in respect to transactions already passed, or gives a transaction a different legal effect from that which it had when it occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Porter, </em>911 P.2d at 1150 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In order to determine whether the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA, were substantive, so as to constitute a retroactive law if applied to the promissory note at issue here, it is necessary to examine several related statutes from both the 1985 and 1991 versions of Montana\u2019s UCC. As noted above, \u00a7 30-3-401(1), MCA (1985), expressly provides that \u201c[n]o person is liable on an instrument unless his signature appears thereon.\u201d A signature may be made by an agent or other representative, and the representative\u2019s authority to make that signature may be established \u201cas in other cases of representation.\u201d Section 30-3-403(1), MCA (1985). Conversely, where an authorized representative signs his own name to an instrument, the representative \u2014 rather than the represented person \u2014 is personally obligated unless the instrument either names the person represented or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>shows that the representative signed in a representative capacity. Section 30-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Here, it is clear that neither Stires\u2019nor the Game Ranch\u2019s signature appears on the promissory note executed by Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3-401(1), MCA (1985), Stires is not liable on the note. Since Stires\u2019 signature does not appear, subsection (1) of \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA (1985), cannot be used to establish that Hall had authority to make the signature. Moreover, even if Hall were authorized to sign instruments on behalf of Stires or the Game Ranch, he would remain personally \u2014 and solely \u2014 liable on the promissory note to Carelli under \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1985), because the note neither names the person represented nor indicates that Hall signed in a representative capacity. Thus, under the 1985 versions of \u00a7\u00a7 30-3-401 and 30-3-403, MCA, Stires is not liable on the promissory note as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The 1991 versions of these two statutes are significantly different. Under \u00a7 30-3-401, MCA (1991), a person can be hable on an instrument, even absent that person\u2019s signature, if the person \u201cis represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under 30-3-403.\u201d Section 30-3-403(1), MCA (1991), provides that, \u201c[i]f a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing... the name of the signer,\u201d the represented person can be bound by \u2014 and liable under \u2014 the signature under certain circumstances, \u201cwhether or not identified in the instrument.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Thus, under the 1991 version of the UCC, if Hall acted or \u201cpurported to act\u201d on behalf of the Game Ranch partnership and Stires in executing the promissory note to Carelli, Stires potentially could be liable for the debt underlying the note. Carelli argues that Hall\u2019s alleged representations that he was acting on behalf of the Game Ranch and Stires in executing the note are admissible under \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA(1991), as evidence that Hall was so acting and purporting to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The 1991 amendment to \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA, provides for potential liability of represented persons which did not exist under the 1985 version of the statute. If applied here, \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA (1991), could impose a new obligation on Stires with regard to a transaction already passed. Thus, the 1991 amendment is substantive and cannot be applied retroactively unless expressly declared retroactive by the legislature. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-109, MCA; <em>Porter, </em>911 P.2d at 1150. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>30-3-403, MCA (1991), does not contain an express declaration that the legislature intended it to apply to transactions already passed. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA (1991), is not applicable in this case and, as a result, Hall\u2019s alleged representations to Carelli that he purchased the elk on behalf of the Game Ranch and that Stires would pay the debt are not admissible thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Notwithstanding his argument above that the 1991 version of \u00a7 30-3-403(1), MCA, applies in this case, Carelli relies on cases interpreting the 1983 and 1985 versions of \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA, in support of his argument that parol evidence is admissible here to prove Hall signed the promissory note on behalf of the Game Ranch partnership. The 1983 and 1985 versions of \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA, are identical; accordingly, we refer only to \u00a7 30-3-403, MCA (1985), in discussing the cases on which Carelli relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Carelli argues that <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank v. Papp </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 494, 698 P.2d 851, and <em>Accounts Management Corp. v. Lyman Ranch </em>(1987), 230 Mont. 35, 748 P.2d 919, are factually similar to the present case and support the admissibility of his deposition testimony regarding Hall\u2019s alleged representations as evidence. In both <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <em>Accounts Management </em>Corp., we concluded that parol evidence was admissible to determine whether the promissory notes at issue were signed in a representative or individual capacity under \u00a7 30-3-403(2), MCA (1985), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">An authorized representative who signs his own name to an instrument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(b) <em>except as otherwise established between the immediate parties, </em>is personally obligated if the instrument <em>names the person represented but does not show that the representative signed in a representative capacity....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">(Emphasis added). Under this statute, where an instrument names the represented party but the representative does not indicate that he or she signed in a representative capacity, parol evidence is admissible to determine the actual agreement between the immediate parties to the instrument regarding liability on the instrument. <em>See Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 853; <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 922-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>involved a promissory note executed in favor of Clarks Fork National Bank (Clarks Fork) which identified the debtors as \u201c\u2019Papp, Ellak and Violet dba Papp Landscaping Co.\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The note was signed by Ellak and Violet Papp without any further reference to Papp Landscaping Co. <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 852. Clarks Fork sued Ellak and Violet Papp (the Papps) for the debt evidenced by the note, contending that the note was their personal obligation. The Papps asserted, however, that they had executed the note in their corporate capacities. The district court granted Clarks Fork\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding the Papps personally liable for the debt evidenced by the promissory note. <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">On appeal, Clarks Fork argued that the promissory note was unambiguous and, as a result, evidence could not be presented to vary the terms of the note. We agreed that parol evidence generally is inadmissible unless the note is ambiguous or uncertain. <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 853. We concluded, however, that \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985), specifically allowed proof beyond the provisions of the note because the language of the note itself \u2014 -that is, the reference to both the Papps and Papp Landscaping as the borrowers \u2014 suggested that the Papps and Clarks Fork, as the immediate parties to the note, \u201cmay have \u2018otherwise established\u2019 as provided in [\u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985)].\u201d Accordingly, we reversed the summary judgment against the Papps and remanded for the district court\u2019s consideration of parol evidence to determine what the Papps and Clarks Fork intended. <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 853-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>Lyman Ranch had borrowed a considerable amount of money from Farmers Union Oil (Farmers), but failed to repay it. Howard Lyman (Lyman) executed a promissory note for the benefit of Farmers to cover the delinquent debt. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 920-21. The top part of the promissory note commemorated the debt owed by Lyman Ranch to Farmers and was signed by Lyman on behalf of Lyman Ranch. The bottom part of the note contained an unconditional promise to repay the debt, did not identify the debtor and was signed by Lyman in his individual capacity. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Farmers sued Lyman in his individual capacity, as the signatory of the note, and Lyman Ranch. Lyman Ranch admitted liability for the debt, but Lyman denied personal liability. Prior to trial, Farmers assigned its rights against Lyman and Lyman Ranch to Accounts Management. The district court concluded that the bottom portion of the promissory note contained an unambiguous, unconditional promise by Lyman to repay the debt and, accordingly, entered judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>against Lyman individually. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We determined on appeal that, as Farmers\u2019 assignee, Accounts Management stepped into Farmers\u2019 shoes and was considered an immediate party to the promissory note for purposes of the first requirement under \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985). <em>See Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 922-23. Additionally, since the promissory note named Lyman Ranch as the debtor but failed to show that Lyman signed in a representative capacity, the second requirement of \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA(1985), was satisfied. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 923. We concluded, therefore, that \u201cby statute, as between the immediate parties, the [promissory note] creates an ambiguity in regard to the second signature.\u201d <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Under those circumstances, and relying on <em>Clarks Fork Nat'l Bank, </em>we concluded that the issue of who was obligated on the note was a question of fact for the trier of fact. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 923. For purposes of resolving that issue, we concluded that \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985), allows parol evidence in litigation between the immediate parties to prove that the signature was, or was not, in a representative capacity. <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Thus, <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <em>Accounts Management Corp. </em>share the same dispositive facts with regard to the admissibility of parol evidence under \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985). First, the litigation in both cases was between the immediate parties to the promissory note. Second, in both cases the promissory note referenced the corporate entity in identifying the debtors, but contained a signature which did not indicate that the signatory signed in a representative capacity. Those facts fell squarely within the purview of \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985), and, therefore, we concluded that parol evidence was admissible to determine whether the notes were signed in an individual or representative capacity. <em>See Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>698 P.2d at 853; <em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>748 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The present case is factually distinguishable from both <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <em>Accounts Management Corp.. </em>Here, the litigation is not between the immediate parties to the promissory note. The promissory note was executed by Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor and they were the immediate parties to the note; Stires was not a party to the transaction. Moreover, the promissory note does not refer to the Game Ranch or Stires in any way. Unlike in <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Accounts Management Corp., </em>the facts in the present case do not fall within the purview of \u00a7 30-3-403(2)(b), MCA (1985). Thus, <em>Clarks Fork Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <em>Accounts Management Corp. </em>do not support Carelli\u2019s argument that parol evidence is admissible here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Finally, Carelli argues that Stires is liable for the debt evidenced by the promissory note executed by Hall in Carelli\u2019s favor because Stires accepted the benefit of the transaction between himself and Hall. In other words, Carelli argues that Stires ratified Hall\u2019s purchase of the elk on behalf of the Game Ranch, even if Hall did not have authority to bind the Game Ranch partnership, because Stires accepted the elk at issue and used them for business purposes. In this regard, he contends that the reference to the Game Ranch in the security agreement \u201ccreated a strong, if not absolute, probability that the elk were kept on the partnership property and used for hunting purposes.\u201d He argues that his deposition testimony regarding his visits to the Game Ranch created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Game Ranch had possession of the elk.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Review of Carelli\u2019s deposition testimony reflects that Carelli did not offer any evidence establishing that Stires took possession of the elk. Carelli did not state with certainty that any of the elk purchased by Hall were located at the Game Ranch or received by Stires. In fact, Carelli testified that he had visited the Game Ranch, but that he did not get close enough to the elk to positively identify any of them as the elk he sold to Hall. Carelli\u2019s argument that Stires is liable on the note due to possession of the elk is entirely speculative and, therefore, is insufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. <em>See Estate of Lien, </em>892 P.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We conclude that Carelli failed to meet his burden on summary judgment of presenting admissible evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding Stires\u2019 liability for the debt evidenced by the promissory note. On that basis, we further conclude that Stires was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in denying Stires\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of Stires.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
