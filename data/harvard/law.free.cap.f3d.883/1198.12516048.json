He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and in calculating his sentence because it improperly determined that Studhorse's prior Washington State conviction for attempted first degree murder qualified as a \"crime of violence.\" We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 17, 2016, a two-count indictment was filed against Defendant-Appellant Keith Bennett Studhorse, II, charging him in one count with a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (felon in possession of a firearm), and in a second count with a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20931\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 924(a)(7) (violent felon in possession of body armor). Studhorse moved to dismiss Count 2 on July 8, 2016. Studhorse argued that dismissal was required because his three relevant prior convictions under Washington state law (for attempted first degree murder, second degree manslaughter, and riot with a deadly weapon) did not constitute crimes of violence as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its response, the Government argued that attempted first degree murder and riot constituted crimes of violence; it declined to address whether second-degree manslaughter was a \"crime of violence\" as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the district court held a hearing on Studhorse's motion. The court denied the motion on August 2, 2016, on the basis that attempted first degree murder is a \"crime of violence.\" Studhorse then entered a plea of guilty pursuant to a conditional plea agreement that permitted him to later challenge the denial of his motion and his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A presentence investigation report (PSR) was prepared in advance of Studhorse's sentencing. The PSR relied on the district court's determination that Studhorse's prior conviction for attempted first degree murder qualified as a \"crime of violence,\" and calculated that Studhorse's base offense level was 20, total adjusted offense level was 17, and criminal history category was IV. This resulted in an advisory guideline range of 37-46 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At sentencing on December 7, 2016, Studhorse objected to the PSR's categorization of his prior conviction for attempted first degree murder as a \"crime of violence.\" The Government also objected to the PSR, arguing that Studhorse's two other convictions for second-degree manslaughter and riot should be counted as crimes of violence. Studhorse disputed this, and the district court overruled the Government's objections, but affirmed its holding with regard to Studhorse's attempted first degree murder conviction. The district court adopted the PSR's sentencing calculations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   though it ultimately varied upward to sentence Studhorse to 84 months' incarceration.

Studhorse argues that section 9A.32.030 is overbroad with regard to its\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   requirement \"because any slight act in furtherance of the crime suffices.\" However, this is no longer the law in Washington. Before 1975, Washington law recognized that \"slight acts in furtherance of a scheme\" could \"establish the necessary element of overtness\" where intent was \"clearly shown.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Washington changed its attempt statute in 1975, replacing the prior statute's \"overt act\" requirement with the present statute's \"substantial step\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Studhorse's argument focuses on the inscrutability of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), but that focus is misplaced.

An attempted first degree murder conviction under Washington law has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. Thus, for the reasons outlined in Section I above, it qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" according to \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1)'s plain text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Studhorse's motion to dismiss Count 2 of the indictment and its interpretation and application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The PSR and the district court used the 2015 Guidelines to preclude a possible\n    <em>\n     Ex Post Facto\n    </em>\n    Clause challenge to its sentence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beckles v.

When he appeared to raise the argument for the first time on appeal, the Government responded with a claim that the new argument was waived and beyond the court's consideration because Studhorse had not shown good cause for his failure to raise it earlier. We disagree. Studhorse argued below that his attempted first degree murder conviction was not a \"crime of violence\" as defined by \u00a7 16, and \"it is claims that are deemed waived or forfeited, not arguments.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
