TLIC's Relationship with 401(k) Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs are members of employer-supported, defined-contribution 401(k) plans governed by ERISA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (34). Because the daily administration of the plans often requires particularized expertise, employers commonly contract with third-party administrators to operate the plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' employers contracted with Transamerica Life Insurance Company (\"TLIC\") to manage and operate their retirement plans. Each employer entered into an Application and Agreement for Services (\"Services Agreement\") and a Group Annuity Contract (\"GAC\") with TLIC. From a list of potential investment options provided by TLIC in the GAC, the employers selected those offered to employees. The list of potential investments includes several advised and managed by TLIC affiliates, Transamerica Asset Management (\"TAM\") and Transamerica Investment Management (\"TIM\"). Many of the investments offered in the GAC have multiple share classes, and TLIC did not always offer the lowest-priced share class. If an employer selects a \"model line-up\" of investment options, TLIC warrants that the bundle satisfies ERISA's \"[p]rudent man standard.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After an employer chooses an investment bundle, TLIC structures each selected investment option (typically a mutual fund) as a separate account. The contributions of all plan members choosing the option are pooled in the separate account. Pooling \"substantially reduces the mutual funds' administrative, marketing, and service costs\" because the fund effectively has only one investor-the separate account.\n   <em>\n    Leimkuehler v.

When negotiating with the employers, TLIC plainly did not exercise discretionary control over the plan, possess authority over its assets, render investment advice, nor have any discretionary authority in the administration of the plan. The district court believed that failing to assign a fiduciary duty to a service provider during negotiations with employers would allow the provider to \"negotiate for a fee of 99% of each separate account and still be considered to be fulfilling its fiduciary duty of managing the separate account.\" But, as the Third Circuit correctly noted, \"any plan sponsor who agreed to a 99% fee arrangement would\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   be liable for breaching its fiduciary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265846\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/284/#p293\">\n    768 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   295 n.6. The employer has the express duty under \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A)(ii) of \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan,\" and, absent some sort of conduct not alleged in plaintiffs' complaint, claims that fully disclosed fee arrangements are unreasonable lie against the employer, not the service provider.\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265846\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/284/#p293\">\n    768 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   295 &amp; n.6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Indeed, any other outcome would lead to absurd results. If service providers were fiduciaries while negotiating fees, they would have to promise that its fees were no higher than those of any competitor, rather than negotiate at arm's length with an employer. And, an employer who knowingly agreed to a fee structure could nonetheless later sue to lower it, invoking the administrator's fiduciary obligation. We agree with the Third Circuit that \"a service provider owes no fiduciary duty with respect to the negotiation of its fee compensation\" because \"[n]othing prevented the trustees from rejecting [the provider's] product and selecting another service provider; the choice was theirs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 295 (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.H.
