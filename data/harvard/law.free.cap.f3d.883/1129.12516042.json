When this case was last before the court, we determined that the operators of the now-defunct Hacienda Resort Hotel and Casino and Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas (the \"Employers\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violated section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), by unilaterally terminating the Union's dues-checkoff without bargaining to agreement or impasse.\n   <em>\n    Local Joint Exec. Bd. v. NLRB\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    LJEB III\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833518\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/865/#p876\">\n    657 F.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (9th Cir. 2011). In light of that violation, we remanded for the Board to determine what relief was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On remand, the Board declined to award make-whole relief, the standard remedy when an employer unlawfully ceases union dues-checkoff. The Board reasoned that make-whole relief was not warranted because, inter alia, the Employers had relied on a Board rule providing that dues-checkoff is not subject to mandatory bargaining. Instead, the Board awarded the Union prospective-only relief against the defunct Employers and their unidentified successors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude, for two reasons, that the Board clearly abused its discretion in declining to award the standard remedy of make-whole relief. First, the Board did not provide a valid explanation for departing from its standard remedy in dues-checkoff cases. In particular, the Board's reliance-based explanation was improper, as it was unreasonable for the Employers to rely on Board precedent that had never been applied in a reasoned manner in the absence of a union security clause, and the Board's other explanations were similarly erroneous. Second, by ordering prospective-only relief against defunct entities, the Board\n   effectively ordered no relief at all and therefore did not \"effectuate the policies of [the NLRA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20160\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Accordingly, we grant the Union's petition, vacate the Board's order, and remand for the Board to award standard make-whole relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Employers maintained collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") with the Union until 1994. The CBAs did not contain union security clauses-clauses that condition employment upon union membership-as these clauses are prohibited in Nevada, a \"right-to-work\" state.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20613.250\">\n    Nev.

The CBAs did, however, require the Employers to deduct union dues from the paychecks of employees who had authorized such deductions. After the final CBA expired in May 1994, the Employers continued to honor these \"dues-checkoff\" authorizations until June 1995. At that time, the Employers unilaterally terminated the Union's dues-checkoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Union filed unfair labor practice charges against the Employers in August 1995, and the General Counsel for the NLRB subsequently issued consolidated complaints. The Union alleged that the Employers' cessation of dues-checkoff violated the \"unilateral change\" doctrine articulated in\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n    369 U.S. 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n    8 L.Ed.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962). Under that doctrine, \"an employer's unilateral change in conditions of employment under negotiation is ... a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5) [of the NLRA], for it is a circumvention of the duty to negotiate which frustrates the objectives of \u00a7 8(a)(5) much as does a flat refusal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n    at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") dismissed the complaints and the Board affirmed, with two members dissenting.\n   <em>\n    Hacienda Hotel, Inc.

We explained that, where \"dues-checkoff provisions do not implement union security ... but instead exist as a free-standing, independent convenience to willingly participating employees, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel\n   </em>\n   loses its force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833518\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/865/#p876\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833518\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/865/#p876\">\n    at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The four-member majority recognized that make-whole relief is the standard remedy in dues-checkoff cases but declined to award such relief in light of the Employers' reliance on the rule stated in\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel\n   </em>\n   . The Board also noted that make-whole relief would require an award of compound interest and that there was \"no reason to believe that [the Employers] will not continue to abide by Board law.\" Dissenting, Member Hirozawa argued that the majority in effect sought to block the retroactive effect of this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    LJEB III\n   </em>\n   and that its remedy did not effectuate the policies of the NLRA.

The Employers ceased operating when they and their hotels were sold to Archon in 1995. The same year, Archon sold the hotels to unrelated businesses; one hotel, the Hacienda, was demolished in 1996, while the other, the Sahara, was gutted, massively renovated, and opened as a different hotel between 2011 and 2014.

As a result, employers who had unilaterally ceased dues-checkoff in reasonable reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel\n   </em>\n   in cases pending at the time of\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Lutheran\n   </em>\n   were never subjected to a remedial order because they necessarily had not violated the NLRA. Such employers did not and could not include the Employers in this case because we had already determined that, in the absence of a union security clause, their unilateral cessation of dues-checkoff was not governed by\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel\n   </em>\n   and their reliance on that decision was unreasonable. They accordingly had violated the NLRA and we ordered the Board \"to determine\n   what relief is warranted.\"\n   <em>\n    LJEB III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833518\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/865/#p876\">\n    657 F.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   When subsequently deciding this case, the Board noted that its reasons for awarding prospective-only relief were consistent with the reasons it provided in\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Lutheran\n   </em>\n   for overruling\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel\n   </em>\n   with prospective-only effect. There would be nothing inappropriate with such an observation, but for the fact that the Board's main consideration in both cases was the employers' reliance-which, as we have explained, was unreasonable in the absence of a union security clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After the Board invoked\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Lutheran\n   </em>\n   , it concluded that, \"[n]evertheless, [\n   <em>\n    LJEB III\n   </em>\n   ] ... makes it necessary to fashion a remedy.\" The Board then proceeded to fashion a remedy that, in effect, amounted to no relief at all. In doing so, the Board engaged in a \"patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [NLRA].\"\n   <em>\n    Va.

This argument is without merit. The Union filed a brief before the Board requesting make-whole relief; at that time, the Union was under no obligation to challenge the prospective-only relief that had not yet been ordered by the Board. The Union then restated its request for make-whole relief in its motion for reconsideration, and argued that the cease-and-desist and notice orders were meaningless for reasons that are equally applicable to the order to bargain and the order to rescind. Finally, when denying that motion, the Board concluded that its entire remedial order was not \"meaningless and moot.\" Thus, the Union challenged the Board's entire remedial order with \"sufficient specificity\" to preserve its arguments on appeal.\n    <em>\n     NLRB v.
