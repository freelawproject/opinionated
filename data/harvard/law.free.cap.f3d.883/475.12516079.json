They named as defendants the Virginia State Board of Elections, some members of the Board in their official capacities, and the Attorney General of Virginia (collectively, \"the Commonwealth\" or \"Virginia\"). A three-judge district court\n   was convened under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202284\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to determine the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after commencement of the action, eight U.S. Congressmen from Virginia, who neither resided in nor represented the Third District, were granted permission to intervene as defendants to defend the Third District based on their claim that granting relief to the plaintiffs would upset existing congressional district boundaries and constituent relationships and engender confusion among voters. After trial, the court concluded that the Third District was indeed a racial gerrymander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth determined not to appeal, but the Intervening Congressmen did.

Senior District Judge Robert Payne dissented, concluding that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Independent Federation of Flight Attendants v.

Because we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   is controlling, we vacate the district court's March 3, 2017 order awarding attorneys fees and costs and remand to the district court for reconsideration of the plaintiffs' petitions for fees in light of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With its enactment of H.B. 251 on January 25, 2012, Virginia redrew its congressional district lines, as it was required to do in response to the 2010 decennial census. Three voters commenced this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the Commonwealth,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging as unconstitutional the boundaries of the Third Congressional District, which lies in southwest Virginia and extends from Richmond to Norfolk, including Petersburg. They claimed that under H.B. 251, African Americans were \"packed\" into the district\n   to remove their votes from neighboring districts and that the decision to do so was \"driven primarily by race,\" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. For relief, they sought a declaration that the Third District was unconstitutional and an injunction enjoining the Commonwealth from holding elections under the existing map. They also urged the court to take any actions necessary to draw new, constitutionally valid congressional districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after this action was commenced, eight Congressmen representing various congressional districts in Virginia, but not the Third District, filed a motion to intervene as defendants, claiming that they had an interest in the existing 2012 map and that the plaintiffs' request that the map be redrawn \"would not only upset existing district boundaries and constituent relationships but also engender confusion among the voting public.\" The district court granted their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a bench trial, the district court found that the Third District was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Page v.

Va. 2014). In its order, dated October 7, 2014, the court directed that the 2014 congressional elections \"proceed as scheduled\" under the existing 2012 map given the imminence of those elections, but it enjoined the Commonwealth from holding future elections until a new redistricting plan was adopted. It referred the matter to the Virginia General Assembly to adopt a new redistricting plan \"as expeditiously as possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Given the factual findings made by the district court, the Commonwealth decided not to appeal the district court's October 7, 2014 order, concluding that the Supreme Court would not likely reverse the decision under the demanding \"clear error\" standard of review. The Intervening Congressmen, however, did appeal, invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Supreme Court vacated the district court's order and remanded the case \"for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v.

Va. June 5, 2015). The court's order gave the Virginia General Assembly until September 1, 2015, to adopt a redistricting plan. Again, the Commonwealth decided not to appeal, but the Intervening Congressmen did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While that second appeal was pending, the September 1 deadline passed, and the district court proceeded to address a remedial redistricting plan, soliciting proposed plans from the parties and any interested nonparties. It also appointed a special master to assist it in reviewing the plans and designing a new map. The Intervening Congressmen filed motions to stay this process pending their appeal to the Supreme Court, but both the district court and the Supreme Court denied them. By order dated January 7, 2016, the district court selected for implementation a remedial plan proposed by the special master.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court expressed doubt that the Intervening Congressmen had standing to challenge the district court's June 5, 2015 order because none of them resided in or represented the Third District. It directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue. In response, three of the ten Intervening Congressmen claimed that they had standing, and the Commonwealth agreed as to at least one of them. The Commonwealth, nonetheless, requested that the Court affirm the district court's order on the merits. In a unanimous decision, however, the Supreme Court determined that none of the Intervening Congressmen had standing and dismissed the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Personhuballah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597262\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1732/#p1736\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the district court's original order of October 7, 2014, that found the Third District unconstitutional, the plaintiffs filed two petitions seeking attorneys fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010310\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and the district court granted the petitions, awarding the plaintiffs $779,189.39 in fees and costs and assessing the award against the Commonwealth. The court, however, stayed enforcement of the award pending completion of the litigation. After the district court entered its second order dated June 5, 2015, again holding the Third District unconstitutional, the plaintiffs filed a third petition for fees incurred litigating in the Supreme Court and on remand. The district court denied that petition without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to renew it pending the outcome of the Intervening Congressmen's second appeal to the Supreme Court. Finally, after the Supreme Court dismissed the second appeal, the plaintiffs filed a fourth petition for fees, renewing their prior petition and seeking fees incurred during the second appeal to the Supreme Court and in connection with the development of a remedial redistricting plan. Ruling on all of the plaintiffs' fee petitions in the aggregate, the district court determined, by order dated March 3, 2017, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a total award of $1,346,571.74 in fees and costs, including the initial award of $779,189.39. Of the total $1.35 million award, the court, in a 2-1 decision, assessed $479,887.67 against the Intervening Congressmen, rejecting their argument that\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   precluded such an award against them. The majority found that \"much of\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   's reasoning [was] simply inapplicable to the case at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Personhuballah v.

Va. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   From the district court's order awarding attorneys fees and costs, the Intervening Congressmen filed this appeal, contending that the district court misinterpreted\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   and that the assessment of roughly $480,000 in fees and costs against them must be reversed. While the plaintiffs contend that the district court ruled correctly, they argue conditionally that if the assessment of fees against the Intervening Congressmen is reversed, the total award of $1.35 million should be assessed against the Commonwealth. Understandably, the Commonwealth objects to the plaintiffs' suggestion, arguing that it should not be held responsible for any fees incurred by reason of the Intervening Congressmen's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After awarding plaintiffs, as prevailing parties, their fees and costs of roughly $1.35 million under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010310\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), the district court assessed the Intervening Congressmen with payment of roughly $480,000 of that amount. The Intervening Congressmen contend that the district court erred because, under\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   , they are not responsible to the plaintiffs for any\n   portion of their attorneys fees inasmuch as the Intervening Congressmen were not alleged to be wrongdoers and the plaintiffs could not have obtained from them the relief requested in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    491 U.S. at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Intervening Congressmen direct attention to the categorical rule adopted by\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   that a district court should award \"attorney's fees against losing intervenors only where the intervenors' action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs contend:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [R]esolution of this appeal may be of keen concern to [the Intervening Congressmen] and the [Commonwealth], but it is of little concern to [the plaintiffs]. Regardless of the disposition of this appeal, the Panel awarded [the plaintiffs] a total award of $1,346,571.74. If [the Intervening Congressmen] are not held responsible for a portion of that total award, then [the plaintiffs] are entitled to a full recovery against the [Commonwealth]-who chose not to appeal the overall fee award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nonetheless, the plaintiffs argue further that the Intervening Congressmen \"had cast themselves as the functional equivalent of a defendant, dramatically run up [the plaintiffs'] fees, and done so not in pursuit of any cognizable legal interest ... but to stand in the schoolhouse door in a futile attempt to block the remedy of a bald racial gerrymander.\" They conclude that the Intervening Congressmen, by reason of their action, \"were not 'innocent' in the relevant sense\" and therefore fell outside the general rule established in\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Commonwealth contends that the dispute is between the Intervening Congressmen and the plaintiffs \"over which of them is responsible for Plaintiffs' fees incurred after [the Commonwealth] stopped defending [the Third District]. The outcome of that dispute does not affect [the Commonwealth's] liability for the fees previously awarded against [it], a judgment that [the Commonwealth] did not appeal and that [the Commonwealth has] already paid and satisfied.\" Thus, it argues that if\n   <em>\n    Zipes is\n   </em>\n   applicable, then the plaintiffs themselves must bear the fees and costs that they incurred in litigating against the Intervening Congressmen. \"And if\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply, then [the Intervening Congressmen] must bear Plaintiffs' fees and costs. In neither case would [the Commonwealth] bear any increased liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The principal dispute in this appeal thus turns on whether\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   prohibits an attorneys fees award under \u00a7 1988(b) and \u00a7 10310(e) against intervening defendants in the circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the traditional American rule, the prevailing party in a suit is not entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs from the losing party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alyeska Pipeline Serv.

The district court in essence collapsed the status and purpose of the Congressmen as intervenors with the status of the Commonwealth as defendant, overlooking (1) that the U.S. Congressmen did not enact the unconstitutional state law; (2) that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Equal Protection Clause could not provide the plaintiffs relief against the Intervening Congressmen for creating an unconstitutional congressional district; and (3) that the Intervening Congressmen intervened to protect their own distinct interests in constituent relationships. In this manner, the court failed to recognize that the Intervening Congressmen could not incur liability simply because they intervened and defended the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning in particular to the district court's reasoning, the court stated that the Intervening Congressmen \"had the ability to grant Plaintiffs' relief\n   <em>\n    on the merits\n   </em>\n   by simply dropping [their] defense,\"\n   <em>\n    Personhuballah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267899\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/929/#p939\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original), and that \"[w]hen they failed to do so, 'blame,' as\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   defined it, could only lie with [the Intervening Congressmen],\n   <em>\n    who fully and willingly defended the law\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 941 (emphasis added). This is a curious proposition-that by defending a practice or a law, intervenors thereby become wrongdoers responsible for that practice or law. More importantly, this clearly misses the point of\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   , which applied its categorical rule to intervenors who were \"blameless\" under Title VII-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , intervenors who had not been found to have committed wrongdoing under the relevant statute. The Intervening Congressmen in this case were indeed blameless, as they were never accused of enacting or enforcing an unconstitutional law, nor were they found to have violated \u00a7 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause, under which the plaintiffs brought their action against the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In every lawsuit in which there is a prevailing Title VII plaintiff there will also be a losing defendant who has committed a legal wrong.

Continuing this argument in another form, the district court reasoned that because the Intervening Congressmen advanced the same arguments and sought to obtain the same results as the Commonwealth, they were \"functionally\" defendants who could therefore not seek the benefit of the\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   holding.

With this proposition that the Intervening Congressmen were representatives of the \"will of the Commonwealth,\" the district court proceeded to step around the clear principle that U.S. Congressmen, who neither enact nor enforce a state law, cannot be held liable for a law's defect merely because they defend it.

In\n   <em>\n    Rum Creek\n   </em>\n   , we stated, \"Under the Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   , we are required to hold that\n   <em>\n    the intervention-related fees and expenses\n   </em>\n   in question here are not recoverable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by a prevailing plaintiff against a losing defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 178 (emphasis added). Specifically at issue in\n   <em>\n    Rum Creek\n   </em>\n   were fees incurred by the plaintiff in opposing the\n   <em>\n    entry\n   </em>\n   of the intervenor-defendants into the action. But we see no reason not to apply that holding also to the intervention-related fees incurred\n   <em>\n    in actually litigating\n   </em>\n   against the intervenors' positions. Indeed, the language in\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   supports this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    491 U.S. at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, under its categorical rule, the defendant will \"be liable for all of the fees expended by the plaintiff in litigating the claim\n   <em>\n    against him\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the defendant only (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    at 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219177\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/754/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Blackmun, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that the majority \"tacitly assumes that the defendant's fee liability goes no further\" than fees incurred litigating\n   <em>\n    against him\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth cannot be held liable for attorneys fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in litigating against the entry of the Intervening Congressmen or against the Intervening Congressmen's positions.
