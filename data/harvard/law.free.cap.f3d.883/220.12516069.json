Paul Reddam (collectively \"Defendants\") over a loan agreement that he contends is usurious and unconscionable. The agreement includes (1) a provision requiring that all disputes be resolved through arbitration conducted by a representative of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (\"CRST\") and (2) a clause that delegates questions about the arbitration provision's enforceability to the arbitrator. Defendants moved to compel arbitration, which the District Court denied. Because the parties' agreement directs arbitration to an illusory forum, and the forum selection clause is not severable, the entire agreement to arbitrate, including the delegation clause, is unenforceable, and we will therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, New Jersey resident John MacDonald saw an advertisement for loans from Western Sky. He electronically executed a Western Sky Consumer Loan Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") and obtained a $5,000 loan. He was charged a $75 origination fee and a 116.73% annual interest rate over the seven-year term of the loan, resulting in a $35,994.28 finance charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Loan Agreement stated that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   is subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. By executing this Loan Agreement, you, the borrower, hereby\n   acknowledge and consent to be bound to the terms of this Loan Agreement, consent to the sole subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court, and that no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this Loan Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 80. In addition, the Agreement included the following choice of law clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Governing Law.\n   </strong>\n   This Agreement is governed by the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States of America and the laws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. We do not have a presence in South Dakota or any other states of the United States. Neither this Agreement nor Lender is subject to the laws of any state of the United States of America. By executing this Agreement, you hereby expressly agree that this Agreement is executed and performed solely within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, a sovereign Native American Tribal Nation. You also expressly agree that this Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance only with the provisions of the laws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and that no United States state or federal law applies to this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   J.A. 85. The Loan Agreement also included several arbitration provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Agreement to Arbitrate.\n   </strong>\n   You agree that any Dispute, except as provided below, will be resolved by Arbitration, which shall be conducted by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Nation by an authorized representative in accordance with its consumer dispute rules and the terms of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Arbitration Defined.\n   </strong>\n   Arbitration is a means of having an independent third party resolve a Dispute. A \"Dispute\" is any controversy or claim between you and Western Sky or the holder or servicer of the Note. The term Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present, or future, including events that occurred prior to the opening of this Account) based on any legal or equitable theory (tort, contract, or otherwise), and regardless of the type of relief sought (i.e. money, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief). A Dispute includes ... any issue concerning the validity, enforceability, or scope of this loan or the Arbitration agreement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Choice of Arbitrator.\n   </strong>\n   Any party to a dispute ... may send the other party written notice ... of their intent to arbitrate and setting forth the subject of the dispute along with the relief requested, even if a lawsuit has been filed. Regardless of who demands arbitration, you shall have the right to select any of the following arbitration organizations to administer the arbitration: the American Arbitration Association ... JAMS [Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services] ... or an arbitration organization agreed upon by you and the other parties to the Dispute. The arbitration will be governed by the chosen arbitration organization's rules and procedures applicable to consumer disputes, to the extent that those rules and procedures do not contradict either the law of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe or the express terms of this Agreement to Arbitrate....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicable Law and Judicial Review.\n   </strong>\n   THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE INDIAN COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND SHALL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Nation and the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator must apply the terms of this Arbitration agreement, including without limitation the waiver of class-wide Arbitration. The arbitrator will make written findings and the arbitrator's award may be filed in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court, which has jurisdiction in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If any of this Arbitration Provision is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   J.A. 86-89 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   MacDonald subsequently received notice that Western Sky Financial sold the loan to WS Funding and that CashCall and Delbert would service the loan. MacDonald submitted monthly payments to WS Funding, CashCall, or Delbert, and as of April 2016, he had paid Defendants a total of $15,493.00 on his $5,000 loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   MacDonald sued Defendants on behalf of himself and a putative class of those similarly situated,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging violations of the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act and New Jersey usury, consumer finance, and consumer fraud laws. The Complaint asserted that Western Sky and Defendants' have a long history of unlawful and deceptive lending practices and that federal circuit courts have characterized the arbitration provisions in the loan agreements as \"a sham and an illusion.\" J.A. 56 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34). MacDonald requested a declaration voiding the arbitration, choice of law, and class waiver clauses, and sought restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants moved to compel arbitration and, alternatively, to dismiss the Complaint. The District Court declined to compel arbitration because the Loan Agreement's express disavowal of federal and state law rendered the arbitration agreement invalid as an unenforceable prospective waiver of statutory rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants appeal the District Court's denial of Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Our review of the District Court's order denying the motion to compel arbitration is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirleis v.

Similarly, his brief opposing Defendants' motion to compel arbitration states that \"the delegation clause suffers from the same defect as the arbitration provision,\" and includes a section discussing this challenge.

We need not address the prospective waiver argument because we conclude that the arbitral forum provided for in the Loan Agreement is nonexistent.

This language requires the Tribe's involvement in the arbitration, but as our sister circuit courts have noted, such a tribal arbitral forum does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inetianbor v.

Indeed, Defendants have not contested that CRST arbitration is unavailable. Thus, we conclude, like our sister circuits, that the CRST arbitral forum is nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants nonetheless argue that an arbitral forum is available because the Choice of Arbitrator provision permits arbitration before AAA or JAMS without relying on a CRST representative or CRST consumer dispute rules. To evaluate this argument, we must interpret the Choice of Arbitrator clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As a threshold matter, we must determine what substantive law governs our interpretation.

Construing the Choice of Arbitrator provision to give parties the right to have AAA or JAMS only to administer the arbitration, subject to the Loan Agreement's requirement that a CRST representative conduct the arbitration, gives both clauses effect. To construe the Choice of Arbitrator provision to allow arbitration by someone other than a CRST representative would be irreconcilable with the forum selection clause's requirement that a CRST representative conduct the arbitration.
