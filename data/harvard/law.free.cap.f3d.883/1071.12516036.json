The defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied the motion on all claims except for the negligence and cruel and unusual punishment claims. The officers appeal the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 10, 2013, police responded to an apartment complex in Conway, Arkansas following a report of a stabbing victim hiding inside a closet and a robbery in progress inside the apartment. Officer Andrew Burningham was first to arrive on scene. He approached Raines, who was standing outside on the sidewalk by the apartment building with a knife in his hand. Officer Burningham ordered Raines to drop the knife and then he drew his handgun. Raines began saying \"fine, fine, fine\" and raised the knife to just above his shoulder level, waving it back and forth. Approximately 20 seconds later, Officers Steven Culliford and James Burroughs arrived at the scene. They drew their handguns and repeatedly directed Raines to \"Drop the knife!\" Additional officers arrived on scene and formed a semi-circle around Raines with their guns drawn. Raines continued waving the knife and shifting his weight from foot to foot on the sidewalk. Officers Culliford and Burroughs told Raines that he would be shot if he came towards them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Officer Rachel Hanson arrived on the scene, she pointed her handgun at Raines and instructed him to \"Drop the knife!\" She then re-holstered her weapon, drew her taser, and moved towards Raines. Detective Jason Cameron, with his gun drawn, positioned himself directly behind Officer Hanson in order to provide protection and \"cover\" to Officer Hanson. The taser video camera confirmed that at some point during Officer Hanson's approach towards Raines, Officers Burningham, Culliford, and Burroughs began firing their weapons at Raines. Detective Cameron did not fire his weapon. In total, officers fired twenty-one shots. Raines was struck four times-in the left arm, left face, left chest, and mid-back. As a result of the encounter, Raines is paralyzed from the waist down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officers Burningham, Burroughs, and Culliford moved for summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure claim, arguing that their use of deadly force against Raines was legally justified. In support of their argument that Raines made an aggressive movement towards Officer Hanson while holding the knife, the officers relied on deposition testimony from those at the scene as well as two videos, one taken from a police vehicle dashboard camera and one taken from the taser video camera. Raines contended that the videos contradict the officers' version of events and that there remained a question as to whether Raines posed a threat when he was shot by the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After studying the videos and considering the other evidence presented by the\n   parties, the district court held that Raines raised a genuine dispute as to whether the officers had probable cause to suspect that Raines posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to others. Accordingly, the district court denied summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
