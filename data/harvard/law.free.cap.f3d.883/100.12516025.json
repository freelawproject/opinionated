We recite them only as necessary to address the legal question under consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the summer of 2010, Donald Zarda, a gay man, worked as a sky-diving instructor at Altitude Express. As part of his job, he regularly participated in tandem skydives, strapped hip-to-hip and shoulder-to-shoulder with clients. In an environment where close physical proximity was common, Zarda's co-workers routinely referenced sexual orientation or made sexual jokes around clients, and Zarda sometimes told female clients about his sexual orientation to assuage any concern they might have about being strapped to a man for a tandem skydive. That June, Zarda told a female client with whom he was preparing for a tandem skydive that he was gay \"and ha[d] an ex-husband to prove it.\" J.A. 400 \u00b6 23. Although he later said this disclosure was intended simply to preempt any discomfort the client may have felt in being strapped to the body of an unfamiliar man, the client alleged that Zarda inappropriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior. After the jump was successfully completed, the client told her boyfriend about Zarda's alleged behavior and reference to his sexual orientation; the boyfriend in turn told Zarda's boss, who fired shortly Zarda thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Zarda denied inappropriately touching the client and insisted he was fired solely because of his reference to his sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   One month later, Zarda filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC concerning his termination. Zarda claimed that \"in addition to being discriminated against because of [his] sexual orientation, [he] was also discriminated against because of [his] gender.\" Special Appendix (\"S.A.\") 3. In particular, he claimed that \"[a]ll of the men at [his workplace] made light of the intimate nature of being strapped to a member of the opposite sex,\" but that he was fired because he \"honestly referred to [his] sexual orientation and did not conform to the straight male macho stereotype.\" S.A. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In September 2010, Zarda brought a lawsuit in federal court alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , sex stereotyping in violation of Title VII and sexual orientation discrimination in violation of New York law. Defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that Zarda's Title VII claim should be dismissed because, although \"Plaintiff testifie[d] repeatedly that he believe[d] the reason he was terminated [was] because of his sexual orientation ... [,] under Title VII, a gender stereotype cannot be predicated on sexual orientation.\" Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 109 at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Simonton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11151193\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/33/#p35\">\n    232 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   35 ). In March 2014, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the Title VII claim. As relevant here, the district court concluded that, although there was sufficient evidence to permit plaintiff to proceed with his claim for sexual orientation discrimination under New York law, plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of gender stereotyping discrimination under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While Zarda's remaining claims were still pending, the EEOC decided\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   , holding that \"allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204397641\">\n    2015 WL 4397641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10. The Commission identified three ways to illustrate what it described as the \"inescapable link between allegations of sexual orientation discrimination and sex discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. First, sexual orientation discrimination, such as suspending a lesbian employee for displaying a photo of her female spouse on her desk while not suspending a man for displaying a photo of his female spouse, \"is sex discrimination because it necessarily entails treating an employee less favorably because of the employee's sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, it is \"associational discrimination\" because \"an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is alleging that his or her employer took his or her sex into account by treating him or her differently for associating with a person of the same sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

Sexual Orientation Discrimination as a Subset of Sex Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We now conclude that sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination. Looking first to the text of Title VII, the most natural reading of the statute's prohibition on discrimination \"because of ... sex\" is that it extends to sexual orientation discrimination because sex is necessarily a factor in sexual orientation. This statutory reading is reinforced by considering the question from the perspective of sex stereotyping because sexual orientation discrimination is predicated on assumptions about how persons of a certain sex can or should be, which is an impermissible basis for adverse employment actions. In addition, looking at the question from the perspective of associational discrimination, sexual orientation discrimination-which is motivated by an\n   employer's opposition to romantic association between particular sexes-is discrimination based on the employee's own sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sexual Orientation as a Function of Sex\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    a. \"Because of ... sex\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We begin by considering the nature of sexual orientation discrimination. The term \"sexual orientation\" refers to \"[a] person's predisposition or inclination toward sexual activity or behavior with other males or females\" and is commonly categorized as \"heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.\"\n   <em>\n    See Sexual Orientation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). To take one example, \"homosexuality\" is \"characterized by sexual desire for a person of the same sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Homosexual\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ; see also Heterosexual\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Of, relating to, or characterized by sexual desire for a person of the opposite sex.\");\n   <em>\n    Bisexual\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Of, relating to, or characterized by sexual desire for both males and females.\"). To operationalize this definition and identify the sexual orientation of a particular person, we need to know the sex of the person and that of the people to whom he or she is attracted.\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , 853 F.3d at 358 (Flaum,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring) (\"One cannot consider a person's homosexuality without also accounting for their sex: doing so would render 'same' [sex] ... meaningless.\"). Because one cannot fully define a person's sexual orientation without identifying his or her sex, sexual orientation is a function of sex. Indeed sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted. Logically, because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[D]iscriminating against [an] employee because they are homosexual constitutes discriminating against an employee because of (A) the employee's sex,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (B) their sexual attraction to individuals of the\n   <em>\n    same sex\n   </em>\n   .\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Choosing not to acknowledge the sex-dependent nature of sexual orientation, certain\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   contend that employers discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation can do so without reference to sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this assertion, they point to\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court observed that one way to discern the motivation behind an employment decision is to consider whether, \"if we asked the employer at the moment of the decision what its reasons were and if we received a truthful response, one of those reasons would be\" the applicant or employee's sex.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    490 U.S. at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on this language, these\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   argue that a \"truthful\" response to an inquiry about why an employee was fired would be \"I fired him because he is gay,\" not \"I fired him because he is a man.\" But this semantic sleight of hand is not a defense; it is a distraction. The employer's failure to reference gender directly does not change the fact that a \"gay\" employee is simply a man who is attracted to men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For purposes of Title VII, firing a man because he is attracted to men is a decision motivated, at least in part, by sex. More broadly, were this Court to credit\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's argument, employers would be able to rebut a discrimination claim by merely characterizing their action using alternative terminology. Title VII instructs courts to examine employers' motives, not merely their choice of words.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m). As a result, firing an employee because he is \"gay\" is a form of sex discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The argument has also been made that it is not \"even remotely plausible that in 1964, when Title VII was adopted, a reasonable person competent in the English language would have understood that a law banning employment discrimination 'because of sex' also banned discrimination because of sexual orientation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , 853 F.3d at 362 (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., dissenting). Even if that were so, the same could also be said of multiple forms of discrimination that are indisputably prohibited by Title VII, as the Supreme Court and lower courts have determined. Consider, for example, sexual harassment and hostile work environment claims, both of which were initially believed to fall outside the scope of Title VII's prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In 1974, a district court dismissed a female employee's claim for sexual harassment reasoning that \"[t]he substance of [her] complaint [was] that she was discriminated against, not because she was a woman, but because she refused to engage in a sexual affair with her supervisor.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

To illustrate its application to sexual orientation, consider the facts of the recent Seventh Circuit case addressing a Title VII claim brought by Kimberly Hively, a lesbian professor who alleged that she was denied a promotion because of her sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , 853 F.3d at 341 (majority).

Under this scenario, the Seventh Circuit concluded that, as alleged, Hively would not have been denied a promotion but for her sex, and therefore sexual orientation is a function of sex. From this conclusion, it follows that sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   drawing from the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , argues that this is an improper comparison. According to this argument, rather than \"hold[ing] everything constant except the plaintiff's sex\" the\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   majority's comparison changed \"two variables-the plaintiff's sex and sexual orientation.\" 853 F.3d at 366 (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting). In other words, the Seventh Circuit compared a lesbian woman with a heterosexual man. As an initial matter, this observation helpfully illustrates that sexual orientation is a function of sex. In the comparison, changing Hively's sex changed her sexual orientation. Case in point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But the real issue raised by the government's critique is the proper application of the comparative test. In the government's view, the appropriate comparison is not between a woman attracted to women and a man attracted to women; it's between a woman and a man, both of whom are attracted to people of the same sex. Determining which of these framings is correct requires understanding the purpose and operation of the comparative test. Although the Supreme Court has not elaborated on the role that the test plays in Title VII jurisprudence, based on how the Supreme Court has employed the test, we understand that its purpose is to determine when a trait other than sex is, in fact, a proxy for (or a function of) sex. To determine whether a trait is such a proxy, the test compares a female and a male\n   employee who both exhibit the trait at issue. In the comparison, the trait is the control, sex is the independent variable, and employee treatment is the dependent variable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To understand how the test works in practice, consider\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   . There, the Supreme Court evaluated the Los Angeles Department of Water's requirement that female employees make larger pension contributions than their male colleagues.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    435 U.S. at 704-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This requirement was based on mortality data indicating that female employees outlived male employees by several years and the employer insisted that \"the different contributions exacted from men and women were based on the factor of longevity rather than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying \"the simple test of whether the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which\n   <em>\n    but for\n   </em>\n   that person's sex would be different,\" the Court compared a woman and a man, both of whose pension contributions were based on life expectancy, and asked whether they were required to make different contributions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Importantly, because life expectancy is a sex-dependent trait, changing the sex of the employee (the independent variable) necessarily affected the employee's life expectancy and thereby changed how they were impacted by the pension policy (the dependent variable). After identifying this correlation, the Court concluded that life expectancy was simply a proxy for sex and therefore the pension policy constituted discrimination \"because of ... sex.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We can also look to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse.\n   </em>\n   Although that case did not quote\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   's \"but for\" language, it involved a similar inquiry: in determining whether discrimination based on particular traits was rooted in sex stereotypes, the Supreme Court asked whether a female accountant would have been denied a promotion based on her aggressiveness and failure to wear jewelry and makeup \"if she had been a man.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    490 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Otherwise said, the Supreme Court compared a man and a woman who exhibited the plaintiff's traits and asked whether they would have experienced different employment outcomes. Notably, being aggressive and not wearing jewelry or makeup is consistent with gender stereotypes for men. Therefore, by changing the plaintiff's gender, the Supreme Court also changed the plaintiff's gender non-conformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The government's proposed approach to\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , which would compare a woman attracted to people of the same sex with a man attracted to people of the same sex, adopts the wrong framing. To understand why this is incorrect, consider the mismatch between the facts in the government's comparison and the allegation at issue: Hively did not allege that her employer discriminated against women with same-sex attraction but not men with same-sex attraction. If she had, that would be classic sex discrimination against a subset of women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lead Dissent at 152 n.20. Instead, Hively claimed that her employer discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. To address that allegation, the proper question is whether sex is a \"motivating factor\" in sexual orientation discrimination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m), or, said more simply, whether sexual orientation is a function of sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, contrary\n   to the government's suggestion, this question cannot be answered by comparing two people with the same sexual orientation. That would be equivalent to comparing the gender non-conforming female plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse\n   </em>\n   to a gender non-conforming man; such a comparison would not illustrate whether a particular stereotype is sex dependent but only whether the employer discriminates against gender non-conformity in only one gender. Instead, just as\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse\n   </em>\n   compared a gender non-conforming woman to a gender conforming man, both of whom were aggressive and did not wear makeup or jewelry, the\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   court properly determined that sexual orientation is sex dependent by comparing a woman and a man with two different sexual orientations, both of whom were attracted to women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The government further counters that the comparative test produces false positives in instances where it is permissible to impose different terms of employment on men and women because \"the sexes are not similarly situated.\" Gov.

The comparative test addresses the second prong of that test; it reveals whether an employment practice is \"because of ... sex\" by asking whether the trait at issue (life expectancy, sexual orientation, etc.) is a function of sex. In contrast, courts that have addressed challenges to the sex-specific employment practices identified by the government have readily acknowledged that the policies are based on sex and instead focused their analysis on the first prong: whether the policies impose \"disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232972\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/17/#p22\">\n    510 U.S. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232972\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/17/#p22\">\n    114 S.Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jespersen v.

This male-on-male harassment is well-outside the bounds of what is traditionally conceptualized as sexism. Similarly, as we have discussed, in\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   the Court invalidated a pension scheme that required female employees to contribute more than their male counterparts because women generally live longer than men.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    435 U.S. at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/702/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, the Court reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that some people might not describe this policy as sexist.

In\n   <em>\n    Texas Department of Housing &amp; Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered whether disparate-impact claims were cognizable under the FHA by looking to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a 1988 amendment to the statute. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The Court found it relevant that \"all nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question\" by 1988 \"had concluded [that] the [FHA] encompassed disparate-impact claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n    at 2519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When concluding that Congress had implicitly ratified these holdings, the Court considered (1) the amendment's legislative history, which confirmed that \"Congress was aware of this unanimous precedent,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and (2) the fact that the precedent was directly relevant to the amendment, which \"included three exemptions from liability that assume the existence of disparate-impact claims,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n    at 2520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The statutory history of Title VII is markedly different. When we look at the 1991 amendment, we see no indication in the legislative history that Congress was aware of the circuit precedents identified by the government and, turning to the substance of the amendment, we have no reason to believe that the new provisions it enacted were in any way premised on or made assumptions about whether sexual orientation was protected by Title VII. It is also noteworthy that, when the statute was amended in 1991, only three of the thirteen courts of appeals had considered whether Title VII prohibited sexual orientation discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528613\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/69/#p70\">\n    876 F.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    DeSantis v.

Mindful of this important context, this is not an instance where we can conclude that Congress was aware of, much less relied upon, the handful of Title VII cases discussing sexual orientation. Indeed, the inference suggested by the government is particularly suspect given that the text of the 1991 amendment emphasized that it was \"respond[ing] to Supreme Court decisions by\n   <em>\n    expanding\n   </em>\n   the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\" Civil Rights Act of 1991 \u00a7\u00a7 2(2), 3(2), 105 Stat. at 1071 (emphasis added). For these reasons, we do not consider the 1991 amendment to have ratified the interpretation of Title VII as excluding sexual orientation discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Next, certain\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   argue that by not enacting legislation expressly prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace Congress has implicitly ratified decisions holding that sexual orientation was not covered by Title VII. According to the government's\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief, almost every Congress since 1974 has considered\n   such legislation but none of these bills became law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This theory of ratification by silence is in direct tension with the Supreme Court's admonition that \"subsequent legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier Congress,\" particularly when \"it concerns, as it does here, a proposal that does not become law.\"\n   <em>\n    Pension Benefit Guar.

Under\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   , building on\n   <em>\n    Loving\n   </em>\n   , it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of an employee's association with persons of another race.

As explained above, sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination because sexual orientation is\n   <em>\n    defined\n   </em>\n   by one's sex in relation to the sex of those to whom one is attracted, making it impossible for an employer to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without taking sex into account. Sexual orientation discrimination is also based on assumptions or stereotypes about how members of a particular gender should be, including to whom they should be attracted. Finally, sexual orientation discrimination is associational discrimination because an adverse employment action that is motivated by the employer's opposition to association between members of particular sexes discriminates against an employee on the basis of sex. Each of these three perspectives is sufficient to support this Court's conclusion and together they amply demonstrate that sexual orientation\n   discrimination is a form of sex discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Although sexual orientation discrimination is \"assuredly not the principal evil that Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII,\" \"statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.\"\n   <em>\n    Oncale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p79\">\n    523 U.S. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p79\">\n    118 S.Ct. 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court held that there was sufficient evidence of sexual orientation discrimination to survive summary judgment on Zarda's state law claims.

Op. at 112. Not really. \"Sex,\" which is used in series with \"race\" and \"religion,\" is one of the words least likely to fluctuate in meaning. I do not think I am breaking new ground in saying that the word \"sex\" as a personal characteristic refers to the male and female of the species. Nor can there be doubt that, when Title VII was drafted in 1964, \"sex\" drew the distinction between men and women. \"A fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Perrin v.

Thus the opinion reasons: \"[l]ogically, because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected.\" Maj. Op. at 113. It is undeniable that sexual orientation is a \"function of sex\" in the (unhelpful) sense that it cannot be defined or understood without reference to sex. But surely that is because it has to do with sex-as so many things do.\n   <em>\n    Everything\n   </em>\n   that cannot be understood without reference to sex does not amount to sex itself as a term in Title VII. So it seems to me that all of these arguments are circular as well as unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The opinion of the Court relies in part on a comparator test, asking whether the employee would have been treated differently \"but for\" the employee's sex. But the comparator test is an evidentiary technique, not a tool for textual interpretation. \"[T]he ultimate issue\" for a court to decide in a Title VII case \"is the reason for the individual plaintiff's treatment, not the relative treatment of different groups within the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Back v. Hastings On Hudson Union Free Sch.

The opinion of the Court builds on the concept of homosexuality as a subset of sex, and this analysis thus merges in a fuzzy way with the definitional analysis. But when the comparator test is used for textual interpretation, it carries in train ramifications that are sweeping and unpredictable: think fitness tests for different characteristics of men and women, not to mention restrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The opinion of the Court relies on the line of cases that bars discrimination based on sexual stereotype: the manifestation of it or the failure to conform to it. There are at least three reasons I am unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Anti-discrimination law should be explicable in terms of evident fairness and justice, whereas the analysis employed in the opinion of the Court is certain to be baffling to the populace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Opinion posits that heterosexuality is just another sexual convention, bias, or stereotype-like pants and skirts, or hairdos. This is the most arresting notion in the opinion of the Court. Stereotypes are generalizations that are usually unfair or defective. Heterosexuality and homosexuality are both traits that are innate and true, not stereotypes of anything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   If this case did involve discrimination on the basis of sexual stereotype, it would have been remanded to the District Court on that basis, as was done in\n   <em>\n    Christiansen v. Omnicom Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277155\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/195/#p202\">\n    852 F.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017) (per curiam). The reason it could not be remanded on that basis is that the record does not associate Mr. Zarda with any sexual stereotyping. The case arises from his verbal disclosure of his sexual orientation during his employment as a skydiving instructor, and that is virtually all we know about him. It should not be surprising that a person of any particular sexual orientation would earn a living jumping out of airplanes; but Mr. Zarda cannot fairly be described as evoking somebody's sexual stereotype of homosexual men. So this case does not present the (settled) issue of sexual stereotype, which I think is the very reason we had to go in banc in order to decide this case. As was made clear as recently as March 2017, \"being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, standing alone, does not constitute nonconformity with a gender stereotype that can give rise to a cognizable gender stereotyping claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277155\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/195/#p202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277155\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/195/#p202\">\n    at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Jos\u00e9 A.

It appears to reflect,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , many Americans' evolving regard for and social acceptance of gay and lesbian persons. We are now called upon to address questions dealing directly with sex, sexual behavior, and sexual taboos, a discussion fraught with moral, religious, political, psychological, and other highly charged issues. For those reasons (among others), I think it is in the best interests of us all to tread carefully; to say no more than we must; to decide no more than is necessary to resolve this appeal. This is not for fear of offending, but for fear of the possible consequences of being mistaken in one unnecessary aspect or another of our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In my view, the law of this Circuit governing what is referred to in the majority opinion as \"associational discrimination\"-discrimination against a person because of his or her association with another-is unsettled.

Rather, inasmuch as, in my view, this appeal can be decided on the simpler and less fraught theory of associational discrimination, I think it best to stop there without then considering other possible bases for our judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Raymond J. Lohier, Jr., Circuit Judge, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   I agree with the majority opinion that there is no reasonable way to disentangle sex from sexual orientation in interpreting the plain meaning of the words \"because of ... sex.\" The first term clearly subsumes the second, just as race subsumes ethnicity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 53:5-6 (Government conceding that \"ethnicity can be viewed as a subset of race\"). From this central holding, the majority opinion explores the comparative approach, the stereotyping rationale, and the associational discrimination rationale to help determine \"when a trait other than sex is ... a proxy for (or function of) sex.\" Maj. Op. at 116. But in my view, these rationales merely reflect nonexclusive \"evidentiary technique[s],\" Jacobs,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , Concurring Op. at 134, frameworks, or ways to determine whether sex is a motivating factor in a given case, rather than interpretive tools that apply necessarily across all Title VII cases. Zarda himself has described these three rationales as \"evidentiary theories\" or \"routes.\" Oral Arg. Tr. at 4:17-18. On this understanding, I join the majority opinion as to Parts II.A and II.B.1.a, which reflect the textualist's approach, and join the remaining parts of the opinion only insofar as they can be said to apply to Zarda's particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   A word about the dissents. My dissenting colleagues focus on what they variously describe as the \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" of the words \"because of ... sex,\" Lynch,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , Dissenting Op. at 144 n.8; Livingston,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , Dissenting Op. at 167, or the \"public meaning of [those] words adopted by Congress in light of the social problem it was addressing when it chose those words,\" Lynch,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , Dissenting Op. at 162. There are at least two problems with this position. First, as the majority opinion points out, cabining the\n   words in this way makes little or no sense of\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Oncale\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   or, for that matter,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Price Waterhouse\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 113-14. Second, their hunt for the \"contemporary\" \"public\" meaning of the statute in this case seems to me little more than a roundabout search for legislative history. Judge Lynch's laudable call (either as a way to divine congressional intent or as an interpretive check on the plain text approach) to consider what the legislature would have decided if the issue had occurred to the legislators at the time of enactment is, unfortunately, no longer an interpretive option of first resort. Time and time again, the Supreme Court has told us that the cart of legislative history is pulled by the plain text, not the other way around. The text here pulls in one direction, namely, that sex includes sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Gerard E. Lynch, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge Livingston joins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Speaking solely as a citizen, I would be delighted to awake one morning and learn that Congress had just passed legislation adding sexual orientation to the list of grounds of employment discrimination prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I am confident that one day-and I hope that day comes soon-I will have that pleasure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   I would be equally pleased to awake to learn that Congress had secretly passed such legislation more than a half century ago-until I actually woke up and realized that I must have been still asleep and dreaming. Because we all know that Congress did no such thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Of course, today's majority does not contend that Congress literally prohibited sexual orientation discrimination in 1964. It is worth remembering the historical context of that time to understand why any such contention would be indefensible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Civil Rights Act as a whole was primarily a product of the movement for equality for African-Americans. It grew out of the demands of that movement, and was opposed by segregationist white members of Congress who opposed racial equality. Although the bill, even before it included a prohibition against sex discrimination, went beyond race to prohibit discrimination based on religion and national origin, there is no question that it would not have been under consideration at all but for the national effort to reckon to some degree with America's heritage of race-based slavery and government-enforced segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   It is perhaps difficult for people not then alive to understand that before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law, an employer could post a sign saying \"Help Wanted; No Negroes Need Apply\" without violating any federal law-and many employers did. Even the original House bill, introduced with the support of President Kennedy's Administration in 1963, did not prohibit racial discrimination by private employers. Language prohibiting employment discrimination by private employers on the grounds of \"race, color, religion or national origin\" was added later by a House subcommittee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francis J. Vaas,\n   <em>\n    Title VII: Legislative History\n   </em>\n   , 7 B.C. Indus. &amp; Comm. L.

The movements in the United States for gender and racial equality have not always marched in tandem-although there was some overlap between abolitionists and supporters of women's suffrage, suffragists often relied on the racially offensive argument that it was outrageous that white women could not vote when black men could.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But by the 1960s, many feminist advocates consciously adopted arguments parallel to those of the civil rights movement, and there was growing recognition that the two causes were linked in fundamental ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Women's rights groups had been arguing for laws prohibiting sex discrimination since at least World War II, and had been gaining recognition for the agenda of the women's rights movement in other arenas.

To the extent that civil rights organizations did begin to engage with gay rights during the early 1960s, they did so through the lens of sexual liberty, rather than equality, grouping the prohibition of laws against same-sex relations with prohibitions of birth control, abortion, and adultery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even by the mid-1960s, the ACLU was identified by\n   <em>\n    Newsweek\n   </em>\n   as the only group \"apart from the homophile organizations\" that opposed laws criminalizing homosexual acts.

As late as 1968, four years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the passage of Title VII, the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations proposed a \"Homosexual Bill of Rights\" that demanded five fundamental rights: that private consensual sex between\n   adults not be a crime; that solicitation of sex acts not be prosecuted except on a complaint by someone other than an undercover officer; that sexual orientation not be a factor in granting security clearances, visas, or citizenship; that homosexuality not be a barrier to service in the military; and that sexual orientation not affect eligibility for employment\n   <em>\n    with federal, state, or local governments\n   </em>\n   . Licata,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 177 (emphasis added). Those proposals, which pointedly did not include a ban on private sector employment discrimination against gays, evidently had little traction with many Americans at the time. The first state to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation even in the public sector was Pennsylvania, by executive order of the governor, in 1975-more than a decade after the Civil Rights Act had become law. James W. Button et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Politics of Gay Rights at the Local and State Level\n   </em>\n   , in\n   <em>\n    The Politics of Gay Rights\n   </em>\n   269, 272 (Craig A. Rimmerman et al. eds., 2000). It was not until 1982 that Wisconsin became the first state to ban both public and private sector discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Linda A. Mooney et al.,\n   <em>\n    Understanding Social Problems\n   </em>\n   467 (6th ed. 2009). Massachusetts followed in 1989. Button et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 273. Notably, as discussed more fully below, these states did so by explicit legislative action adding \"sexual orientation\" to pre-existing anti-discrimination laws that already prohibited discrimination based on sex; they did not purport to \"recognize\" that sexual orientation discrimination was merely an aspect of already-prohibited discrimination based on sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In light of that history, it is perhaps needless to say that there was no discussion of sexual orientation discrimination in the debates on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. If some sexist legislators considered the inclusion of sex discrimination in the bill something of a joke, or perhaps a poison pill to make civil rights legislation even more controversial, evidently no one thought that adding sexual orientation to the list of forbidden categories was worth using even in that way. Nor did those who opposed the sex provision in Title VII include the possibility that prohibiting sex discrimination would also prevent sexual orientation discrimination in their parade of supposed horribles. When Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, floor manager for the Civil Rights Bill in the House, rose to oppose Representative Smith's proposed amendment, he expressed concern that it would lead to such supposed travesties as the elimination of \"protective\" employment laws regulating working conditions for women, drafting women for military service, and revisions of rape and alimony laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   110 Cong. Rec. 2,577 (1964). He did not reference the prohibition of sexual orientation discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The idea was nowhere on the horizon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   I do not cite this sorry history of opposition to equality for African-Americans, women, and gay women and men, and of the biases prevailing a half-century ago, to argue that the private intentions and motivations of the members of Congress can trump the plain language or clear implications of a legislative enactment. (Still less, of course, do I endorse the views of those who opposed racial equality, ridiculed women's rights, and persecuted people for their sexual orientation.) Although Chief Judge Katzmann has observed elsewhere that judicial warnings about relying on legislative history as an interpretive aid have been overstated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Robert A. Katzmann,\n   <em>\n    Judging Statutes\n   </em>\n   35-39 (2014), I agree with him, and with my other colleagues in the majority, that the implications of legislation flatly prohibiting sex discrimination in employment, duly enacted by Congress and signed by the President, cannot be cabined by citing the private prejudices or blind spots of those members of Congress who voted for it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The above history makes it obvious to me, however, that the majority misconceives the fundamental\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   meaning of the language of the Civil Rights Act. The problem sought to be remedied by adding \"sex\" to the prohibited bases of employment discrimination was the pervasive discrimination against women in the employment market, and the chosen remedy was to prohibit discrimination that adversely affected members of one sex or the other. By prohibiting discrimination against people based on their sex, it did not, and does not, prohibit discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   To start, the history of the overlapping movements for equality for blacks, women, and gays, and the differing pace of their progress, as outlined in the previous section, tells us something important about what the language of Title VII must have meant to any reasonable member of Congress, and indeed to any literate American, when it was passed-what Judge Sykes has called the \"original\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   meaning\" of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll. of Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362 (7th Cir. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ) (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., dissenting) (emphasis added). That history tells us a great deal about why the legislators who constructed and voted for the Act used the specific language that they did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The words used in legislation are used for a reason. Legislation is adopted in response to perceived social problems, and legislators adopt the language that they do to address a social evil or accomplish a desirable goal. The words of the statute take meaning from that purpose, and the principles it adopts must be read in light of the problem it was enacted to address. The words may indeed cut deeper than the legislators who voted for the statute fully understood or intended: as relevant here, a law aimed at producing gender equality in the workplace may require or prohibit employment\n   practices that the legislators who voted for it did not yet understand as obstacles to gender equality. Nevertheless, it remains a law aimed at\n   <em>\n    gender\n   </em>\n   inequality, and not at other forms of discrimination that were understood at the time, and continue to be understood, as a different kind of prejudice, shared not only by some of those who opposed the rights of women and African-Americans, but also by some who believed in equal rights for women and people of color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The history I have cited is not \"legislative history\" narrowly conceived. It cannot be disparaged as a matter of attempts by legislators or their aides to influence future judicial interpretation-in the direction of results they could not convince a majority to support in the overt language of a statute-by announcing to largely empty chambers, or inserting into obscure corners of committee reports, explanations of the intended or unintended legal implications of a bill. Nor am I seeking to infer the unexpressed wishes of all or a majority of the hundreds of legislators who voted for a bill without addressing a particular question of interpretation. Rather, I am concerned with what principles Congress committed the country to by enacting the words it chose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   I contend that these principles can be illuminated by an understanding of the central public meaning of the language used in the statute at the time of its enactment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   If the specifically\n   <em>\n    legislative\n   </em>\n   history of the \"sex amendment\" is relatively sparse in light of its adoption as a floor amendment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 128 n.31, the broader\n   <em>\n    political and social\n   </em>\n   history of the prohibition\n   of sex discrimination in employment is plain for all to read. The history of the 20th century is, among other things, a history of increasing equality of men and women. Recent events remind us of how spotty that equality remains, and how inequality persists even with respect to the basic right of women to physical security and control of their own bodies. But the trend is clear, and it is particularly emphatic in the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   That history makes it equally clear that the prohibition of discrimination \"based on sex\" was intended to secure the rights of women to equal protection in employment. Put simply, the addition of \"sex\" to a bill to prohibit employers from \"discriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, ... or national origin,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), was intended to eliminate workplace inequalities that held women back from advancing in the economy, just as the original bill aimed to protect African-Americans and other racial, national, and religious minorities from similar discrimination. The language of the Act itself would have been so understood not only by members of Congress, but by any politically engaged citizen deciding whether to urge his or her representatives to vote for it. As Judge Sykes noted in her dissent in the Seventh Circuit's encounter with the same issue we face today, citing a 1960s dictionary, \"In common, ordinary usage in 1964-and now, for that matter-the word 'sex' means biologically\n   <em>\n    male\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    female\n   </em>\n   ; it does not also refer to sexual orientation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d at 362-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., dissenting) (emphasis in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the verge of the adoption of historic legislation to address bigotry against African-Americans on the basis of race, women in effect stood up and said \"us, too,\" and Congress agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The majority cites judicial interpretations of Title VII as prohibiting sexual harassment, and allowing hostile work environment claims, in an effort to argue that the expansion they are making simply follows in this line. Maj. Op. at 114, 115. But the fact that a prohibition on discrimination against members of one sex may have unanticipated consequences when courts are asked to consider carefully whether a given practice does, in fact, discriminate against members of one sex in the workplace does not support extending Title VII by judicial construction to protect an entirely different category of people. It is true that what\n   <em>\n    counts\n   </em>\n   as discrimination against members of one sex may not have been fully fleshed out in the minds of supporters of the legislation, but it is easy enough to illustrate how the language of a provision enacted to accomplish the goal of equal treatment of the sexes compels results that may not have been specifically intended by its enacters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   To begin with, just as laws prohibiting racial discrimination, adopted principally to address some of the festering national wrongs done to African-Americans, protect members of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   races, including then-majority\n   white European-Americans, the prohibition of sex discrimination by its plain language protects men as well as women, whether or not anyone who voted on the bill specifically considered whether and under what circumstances men could be victims of gender-based discrimination. That is not an expansion of Title VII, but is a conclusion mandated by its text: Congress deliberately chose to protect women and minorities not by prohibiting discrimination against \"African-Americans\" or \"Jews\" or \"women,\" but by neutrally prohibiting discrimination against any individual \"based on race, ... religion, [or] sex.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). That choice of words is clearly intentional, and represents a commitment to a principle of equal treatment of races, religions, and sexes that is important, even if the primary intended beneficiaries of the legislation-those most in need of its protection-are members of the races, religions, and gender that have suffered the most from\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   equality in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Other interpretations of the statute that may not have occurred to members of the overwhelmingly male Congress that adopted it seem equally straightforward. Perhaps it did not occur to some of those male members of Congress that sexual harassment of women in the workplace was a form of employment discrimination, or that Title VII was inconsistent with a \"Mad Men\" culture in the office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But although a few judges were slow to recognize this point,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

The Supreme Court recognized that point, in exactly those terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   The phrase \"terms, conditions or privileges of employment\" in Title VII is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination. ...

Just as Congress adopted broader language than discrimination \"against women,\" it adopted narrower language than \"discrimination based on personal characteristics or classifications unrelated to job performance.\" Title VII does not adopt a broad principle of equal protection in the workplace; rather, its language singles out for prohibition discrimination based on particular categories and classifications that have been used to perpetuate injustice-but not all such categories and classifications. That is not a matter of abstract justice, but of political reality. Those groups that had succeeded by 1964 in persuading a majority of the members of Congress that unfair treatment of them ought to be prohibited were included; those who had not yet achieved that political objective were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Thus, if Representative Smith's amendment had been defeated, Title VII would still be a landmark prohibition of the kinds of race-, religion-, and national origin-based employment discrimination that had historically disadvantaged blacks, Jews, Catholics, or Mexican-Americans. But it would not have protected women, and a subsequent shift in popular support for such protection would not have changed that fact, without legislative action. Similarly,\n   the statute did not protect those discriminated against, similarly unfairly, on the basis of age or disability; that required later legislation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . ; Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   None of this, of course, is remotely to suggest that employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is somehow not invidious and wrong. But not everything that is offensive or immoral or economically inefficient is illegal, and if the view that a practice is offensive or immoral or economically inefficient does not command sufficiently broad and deep political support to produce legislation prohibiting it, that practice will remain legal. In the context of private-sector employment, racial discrimination was just as indefensible before 1964 as it is today, but it was not illegal. Discrimination against women, as President Kennedy's commission understood, was just as unfair, and just as harmful to our economy, before Title VII prohibited it as it is now, but if Congress had not adopted Representative Smith's amendment, it would have remained legal. Employment discrimination against older workers, and against qualified individuals with disabilities, imposed unfair burdens on those categories of individuals in 1964, yet it remained legal after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law, because Congress did not at that time choose to prohibit such discrimination. Congress is permitted to choose what types of social problems to attack and by which means. The majority says that \"we have stated that 'Title VII should be interpreted broadly to achieve equal employment opportunity,' \" Maj. Op. at 111, quoting\n   <em>\n    Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Huntington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546645\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/926/#p935\">\n    844 F.2d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (2d Cir. 1988), but of course that dictum\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeared in the context of a discussion of racial discrimination. Congress, in fact, did not legislate in 1964 \"broadly to achieve equal employment opportunity\" for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Americans, but instead opted to prohibit only certain categories of unfair discrimination. It did not then prohibit, and alas has not since prohibited, discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The majority's linguistic argument does not change the fact that the prohibition of employment discrimination \"because of ... sex\" does not protect gays and lesbians. Simply put, discrimination based on sexual orientation is not the same thing as discrimination based on sex. As Judge Sykes explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   [t]o a fluent speaker of the English language-then and now-the ordinary meaning of the word \"sex\" does not fairly include the concept of \"sexual orientation.\" The two terms are never used interchangeably, and the latter is not subsumed within the former; there is no overlap in meaning. ... The words plainly describe different traits, and the separate and distinct meaning of each term is easily grasped. More specifically to the point here, discrimination \"because of sex\" is not reasonably understood to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, a different immutable characteristic. Classifying people by sexual orientation is different than classifying them by sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., dissenting) (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Of course, the majority does not really dispute this common-sense proposition. It does not say that \"sex discrimination\" in the ordinary meaning of the term is literally the same thing as \"sexual orientation discrimination.\" Rather, the majority argues that discrimination based on sex encompasses discrimination against gay people because discrimination based on sex encompasses any distinction between the sexes that an employer might make for any reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The argument essentially reads \"discriminate\" to mean pretty much the same thing as \"distinguish.\" And indeed, there are recognized English uses of \"discriminate,\" particularly when followed with \"between\" or \"from,\" that imply nothing invidious, but merely mean \"to perceive, observe or note [a] difference,\" or \"[t]o make or recognize a distinction.\" The Oxford English Dictionary Online, http://www.oed.com (search for \"Discriminate,\" verb, definitions 2a and 2b). For example, a person with perfect pitch is capable of discriminating a C from a C-sharp. But in the language of civil rights, a different and stronger meaning applies, that references\n   <em>\n    invidious\n   </em>\n   distinctions: \"To treat a person or group in an unjust or prejudicial manner, esp[ecially] on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.; frequently with\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (definition 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   And that is indeed the sense in which Title VII uses the word: the statute prohibits such practices as \"fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire or to discharge\" persons on account of their race or sex or other protected characteristic, or \"otherwise to discriminate\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   any individual\" with respect to employment terms. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In other words, it is an oversimplification to treat the statute as prohibiting any distinction\n   <em>\n    between\n   </em>\n   men and women in the workplace, still less any distinction that so much as requires the employer to\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   an employee's sex in order to be applied,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 112-13; the law prohibits discriminating\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   members of one sex or the other in the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   That point may have little bite in the context of racial discrimination. The different \"races\" are defined legally and socially, and not by actual biological or genetic differences-both Hitler's Nuremberg laws and American laws imposing slavery and segregation had to define, arbitrarily, how much ancestry of a particular type consigned persons to a disfavored category, since there is no scientific or genetic basis for distinguishing a \"Jew\" or a \"member of the colored race\" from anyone else. And since no biological factor can support any job qualification based on race, courts have taken the view that to distinguish\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   , for the most part, to discriminate against. But in the area of sex discrimination, where the groups to be treated equally do have potentially relevant biological differences, not every distinction between men and women in the workplace constitutes discrimination against one gender or the other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   distinctions that were prohibited, however, in either case, are those that operate to the disadvantage of (principally) the disfavored race or sex. That is the social problem that the statute aimed to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Opponents of Title VII, and later of the Equal Rights Amendment (\"ERA\"), were fond of conjuring what they thought of as unthinkable or absurd consequences of gender equality. Some of those proved not so unthinkable or absurd at all. Workplace \"protective\" legislation that applied only to women soon fell by the wayside,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201604.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (stating that protective laws for women \"conflict with and are superseded by [T]itle VII\"), despite Representative Cellar's fears, without adverse consequences.

It is certainly arguable that some forms of separate dress codes further stereotypes harmful to workplace equality for women; requiring female employees to wear \"Hooters\"-style outfits but male employees doing the same work to wear suit and tie would not stand scrutiny. But what of a pool facility that requires different styles of bathing suit for male and female lifeguards? Judge Cabranes's concurrence would seem to prohibit that practice, but I believe, and I expect Judge Cabranes would agree, that a pool that required both male and female lifeguards to wear a uniform consisting only of trunks would violate Title VII, while one that prescribed trunks for men and a bathing suit covering the breasts for women would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   More controversial distinctions, such as different fitness requirements for men and women applying for jobs involving physical strength, have also been upheld.

Here, while only three Courts of Appeals may have ruled on the issue by 1991, over twenty-five amendments had been proposed to add sexual orientation to Title VII between 1964 and 1991. All had been rejected. In fact, two amendments were proposed in 1991, one in the House and one in the Senate, Civil Rights Amendments Act of 1991, S. 574, 102d Congress; Civil Rights Amendments Act of 1991, H.R. 1430, 102d Congress, and neither of those amendments found its way into the omnibus bill that overruled other judicial interpretations of the Civil Rights Act. Moreover, in addition to the three Courts of Appeals that had ruled on the issue, the EEOC-the primary agency charged by Congress with interpreting and enforcing Title VII-had also held, by 1991, that sexual orientation discrimination fell \"outside the purview of Title VII.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.

As with the social\n   <em>\n    pre-\n   </em>\n   history of Title VII, these later developments are not referenced in a dubious effort to infer the specific intentions of the members of Congress who voted for the Smith amendment in 1964, nor are they referenced to infer the specific intent of each Congress that was faced with proposed sexual orientation amendments. The point, rather, is that race, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination have been consistently perceived in the political world, and by the American population as a whole, as different practices presenting different social and political issues. At different times over the last few generations, the recognition of each as a problem to be remedied by legislation has been controversial, with the movements to define each form of discrimination as illegal developing at a different pace and for different reasons, and being opposed in each case by different coalitions for different reasons. To recognize this fact is to understand that discrimination against persons based on sex has had, in law and in politics, a meaning that is separate from that of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In short, Title VII's prohibition of employment discrimination against individuals\n   on the basis of their sex is aimed at employment practices that differentially disadvantage men vis-\u00e0-vis women or women vis-\u00e0-vis men. That is what the language of the statute means to an ordinary \"fluent speaker of the English language,\"\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., dissenting), that is the social practice that Congress chose to legislate against, and in light of that understanding, certain laws and practices that distinguish between men and women have been found to violate Title VII, and certain others have not. Discrimination against persons whose sexual orientation is homosexual rather than heterosexual, however offensive such discrimination may be to me and to many others, is not discrimination that treats men and women differently. The simplistic argument that discrimination against gay men and women is sex discrimination because targeting persons sexually attracted to others of the same sex requires\n   <em>\n    noticing\n   </em>\n   the gender of the person in question is not a fair reading of the text of the statute, and has nothing to do with the type of unfairness in employment that Congress legislated against in adding \"sex\" to the list of prohibited categories of discrimination in Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The majority opinion goes on to identify two other arguments in support of its holding: (1) that sexual orientation discrimination is actually \"gender stereotyping\" that constitutes discrimination against individuals based on their sex, and (2) that such discrimination constitutes prohibited \"associational discrimination\" analogous to discriminating against employees who are married to members of a different race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   These arguments have the merit of attempting to link discrimination based on sexual orientation to the social problem of gender discrimination at which Title VII is aimed. But just as the \"differential treatment\" argument attempts to shoehorn sexual orientation discrimination into the statute's verbal template of discrimination based on sex, these arguments attempt a similar (also unsuccessful) maneuver with lines of case law. While certain Supreme Court cases identify clear-cut examples of sex or race discrimination that may have a superficial similarity to the practice at issue here, the majority mistakes that similarity for a substantive one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Perhaps the most appealing of the majority's approaches is its effort to treat sexual orientation discrimination as an instance of sexual stereotyping. The argument proceeds from the premises that \"sex stereotyping violates Title VII,\" Maj. Op. at 120, and that \"same-sex orientation 'represents the ultimate case of failure to conform' to gender stereotypes,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 121, quoting\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and concludes that an employer who discriminates against gay people is therefore \"sex stereotyping\" and thus violating Title VII. But like the other arguments adopted by the majority, this approach rests more on verbal facility than on social reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In unpacking the majority's syllogism, it is first necessary to address what we mean by \"sex stereotyping\" that \"violates Title VII.\" Invidious stereotyping of members of racial, gender, national, or religious groups is at the heart of much employment discrimination. Most employers do not entertain, let alone admit to, older forms of racialist or other discriminatory ideologies that hold that members of certain groups are inherently or genetically inferior and undeserving of equal treatment. Much more common are assumptions, not always even conscious, that associate certain negative traits with particular groups. A perception that women, for example, are not\n   suited to executive positions, or are less adept at the mathematical and practical skills demanded of engineers, can be a significant hindrance to women seeking such positions, even when a particular woman is demonstrably qualified, or indeed even where empirical data show that on average women perform as well as or better than men on the relevant tasks. Refusing to hire or promote someone because of that sort of gender (or racial, or ethnic, or religious) stereotyping is not a separate form of sex (or race, or ethnic, or religious) discrimination, but is precisely discrimination in hiring or promotion based on sex (or race, or ethnicity, or religion). It treats applicants or employees not as individuals but as members of a class that is disfavored for purposes of the employment decision by reason of a trait stereotypically assigned to members of that group as a whole. For the most part, then, the kind of stereotyping that leads to discriminatory employment decisions that violate Title VII is the assignment of traits that are negatively associated with job performance (dishonesty, laziness, greed, submissiveness) to members of a particular protected class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Clearly, sexual orientation discrimination is not an example of that kind of sex stereotyping; an employer who disfavors a male job applicant whom he believes to be gay does not do so because the employer believes that most men are gay and therefore unsuitable. Rather, he does so because he believes that most\n   <em>\n    gay\n   </em>\n   people (whether male or female) have some quality that makes them undesirable for the position, and that because this applicant is gay, he must also possess that trait. Although that is certainly stereotyping, and invidiously so, it does not stereotype a group protected by Title VII, and is therefore not (yet) illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   But as the majority correctly points out, that is not the only way in which stereotyping can be an obstacle to protected classes of people in the workplace. The stereotyping discussed above involves beliefs about how members of a particular protected category\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   , but there are also stereotypes (or more simply, beliefs) about how members of that group\n   <em>\n    should be\n   </em>\n   . In the case of sex discrimination in particular, stereotypes about how women ought to look or behave can create a double bind. For example, a woman who is perceived through the lens of a certain \"feminine\" stereotype may be assumed to be insufficiently assertive for certain positions by contrast to men who, viewed through the lens of a \"masculine\" stereotype, are presumed more likely to excel in situations that demand assertiveness. At the same time, the employer may fault a woman who behaves as assertively as a male comparator for being\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   aggressive, thereby failing to comply with societal expectations of femininity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   That is the situation that a plurality of the Supreme Court identified in\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    490 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), the key case the majority relies on for its \"sex stereotyping\" argument. As that opinion pointed out, \"[a]n employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible catch 22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they do not. Title VII lifts women out of this bind.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 251,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605428\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/228/#p242\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The two horns of the dilemma described in\n   <em>\n    Price Waterhouse\n   </em>\n   have slightly different, yet equally problematic, sexist foundations: a female employee or applicant may be prejudiced by a negative assumption that women\n   <em>\n    aren't\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    can't be\n   </em>\n   sufficiently dominant for a position that requires leadership or strength or aggression, but when a woman unquestionably\n   does show the putatively desired traits, she is held back because of the different but related notion that women\n   <em>\n    shouldn't be\n   </em>\n   aggressive or dominant. The latter is not an assumption about how\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   women\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   , it is a normative belief about how\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   women\n   <em>\n    should be\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   I fully accept the conclusion that that kind of discrimination is prohibited, and that it imposes different conditions of employment on men and on women. Not only does such discrimination require women to behave differently in the workplace than men, but it also actively deters women from engaging in kinds of behavior that are required for advancement to certain positions, and thus effectively bars them from such advancement. The key element here is that one sex is systematically disadvantaged in a particular workplace. In that circumstance, sexual stereotyping is sex discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   But as Judge Sykes points out in her\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   dissent, the homophobic employer is not deploying a stereotype about men or about women to the disadvantage of either sex. Such an employer is expressing disapproval of the behavior or identity of a class of people that includes both men and women.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/\">\n    853 F.3d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That disapproval does not stem from a desire to discriminate against either sex, nor does it result from any sex-specific stereotype, nor does it differentially harm either men or women vis-\u00e0-vis the other sex. Rather, it results from a distinct type of objection to anyone, of whatever gender, who is identified as homosexual. The belief on which it rests is not a belief about what men or women ought to be or do; it is a belief about what\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   people ought to be or do-to be heterosexual, and to have sexual attraction to or relations with only members of the opposite sex. That does not make workplace discrimination based on this belief better or worse than other kinds of discrimination, but it does make it something different from sex discrimination, and therefore something that is not prohibited by Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The \"associational discrimination\" theory is no more persuasive. That theory rests on cases involving race discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many courts have found that Title VII prohibits discrimination in cases in which, as in our case of\n   <em>\n    Holcomb v. Iona College\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737463\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/130/#p139\">\n    521 F.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2008), a white plaintiff alleged that he was fired because he was married to a person of a different race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   It would require absolute blindness to the history of racial discrimination in this country not to understand what is at stake in such cases, and why such allegations unmistakably state a claim of discrimination against an individual employee on the basis of race. Anti-miscegenation laws constituted a bulwark of the structure of institutional racism that is the paradigm of invidious discrimination in this country. African-Americans were condemned first to slavery, and then to second-class citizenship and virtual apartheid, on the basis of an ideology that regarded them as inferior. Such an ideology is incompatible with fraternization,\n   let alone marriage and reproduction, between African-Americans and whites. A prohibition on \"race-mixing\" was thus grounded in bigotry against a particular race and was an integral part of preserving the rigid hierarchical distinction that denominated members of the black race as inferior to whites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Thus, as the Supreme Court noted in striking down Virginia's law prohibiting marriage between a white person and a person of color, the Supreme Court of Virginia had upheld the statute because Virginia defined its \"legitimate\" purposes as \" 'preserv[ing] the racial integrity of [the state's] citizens,' and [ ] prevent[ing] 'the corruption of blood,' 'a mongrel breed of citizens,' and 'the obliteration of racial pride,' \" purposes the Court correctly identified and rejected as \"obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White Supremacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Loving v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/\">\n    388 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167184\" index=\"405\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/1/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), quoting\n   <em>\n    Naim v.

The racist hostility to \"race-mixing\" extended well beyond a prohibition against interracial marriage. The beatings of \"freedom riders\" attempting to integrate interstate bus lines in the South in the early 1960s, inflicted on white as well as black participants in the protests, demonstrated that racial bigotry against African-Americans manifested itself in direct attacks not only on African-Americans, but also on whites who associated with African-Americans as equals. The entire system of \"separate but equal\" segregation in both state-owned and private facilities and places of public accommodation was designed, as Charles Black made plain in a classic deconstruction of the legal fiction of \"separate but equal,\" to confine black people to \"a position of inferiority.\" Charles Black,\n   <em>\n    The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Yale%20L.J.%20421\">\n    69 Yale L.J. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (1960). Thus, the associational discrimination reflected in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Loving\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   was a product of bigotry against a single race by another. That discrimination is expressly prohibited in employment by Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Workplace equality for racial minorities is thus blatantly incompatible with a practice that ostracizes, demeans, or inflicts adverse conditions on white employees for marrying, dating, or otherwise associating with, people of color. The prohibition of that kind of discrimination is not simply a matter of noting that, in order to effectuate it, the employer must identify the races of the employee and the person(s) with whom he or she associates. Just as sexual harassment against female employees presents a serious obstacle to the full and equal participation of women in the workplace, discrimination against members of a favored race who so much as associate with persons of another race reflects a deep-seated bigotry against the disfavored race(s) that Title VII undertakes to banish from the workplace. The principle was well stated by the Sixth Circuit in a case cited by the majority,\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

There is no allegation in this case, nor could there plausibly be, that the defendant discriminated against Zarda because it had something against\n   <em>\n    men\n   </em>\n   , and therefore discriminated not only against men, but also against anyone, male or female, who associated with them. I have no trouble assuming that the principle of\n   <em>\n    Holcomb\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   applies beyond the category of race discrimination: an employer who fired or refused to promote an Anglo-American, Christian employee because she associated with Latinos or Jews would presumably run afoul of that principle just as much as one whose animus ran against black Americans. Such an employer would clearly be discriminating against the employee on the basis of her friends' ethnicity or religion-in the formulation from the\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   opinion, that employer would be victimizing an employee out of \"discriminatory animus toward protected third persons with whom the [employee] associate[d].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3330848\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/502/#p512\">\n    556 F.3d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   It is more difficult to imagine realistic hypotheticals in which an employer discriminated against anyone who so much as associated with men or with women, though I suppose academic examples of such behavior could be conjured. But whatever such a case might look like, discrimination against gay people is not it. Discrimination against gay men, for example, plainly is not rooted in animus toward \"protected third persons with whom [they] associate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3330848\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/502/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3330848\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/502/#p512\">\n    556 F.3d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An employer who practices such discrimination is hostile to gay men, not to men in general; the animus runs not, as in the race and religion cases discussed above, against a \"protected group\" to which the employee's associates belong, but against an (alas)\n   <em>\n    unprotected\n   </em>\n   group to which they belong: other gay men.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The majority tries to rebut this straightforward distinction in various ways. First, it notes-but declines to rely on-academic \"research suggesting that sexual orientation discrimination has deep misogynistic roots.\" Maj. Op. at 126. It is certainly plausible to me that the \"deep roots\" of hostility to homosexuals are in some way related to the same sorts of beliefs about the proper roles of men and women in family life that underlie at least some employment discrimination against women.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Andrew Koppelman,\n   <em>\n    Why Discrimination Against Lesbians and Gay Men Is Sex Discrimination\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%20197\">\n    69 N.Y.U.

It may also be that the \"roots\" of all forms of discrimination against people who are different in some way from a socially defined dominant group can be found in similar psychological\n   processes of discomfort with change or difference, or with \"authoritarian personality traits\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   -or that there are other links among different forms of prejudice. And it can plausibly be argued that homosexual men have historically been derided because they were seen as abdicating their masculinity, and therefore the advantage they have over women.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Joseph H. Pleck,\n   <em>\n    Men's\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Power with Women, Other Men, and Society: A Men's Movement Analysis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   The American Man 417, 424 (Elizabeth H. Pleck &amp; Joseph H. Pleck eds., 1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   But the majority is right not to go searching for such roots, whatever they might be, because legislation is not typically concerned, and Title VII manifestly is not concerned, with defining and eliminating the \"deep roots\" of biased attitudes. Congress legislates against concrete behavior that represents a perceived social problem. Title VII does not prohibit \"misogyny\" or \"sexism,\" nor does it undertake to revise individuals' ideas (religious or secular) about how families are best structured. Rather, it prohibits overt acts: discrimination in hiring, promotion, and the terms and conditions of employment based on sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, states, like those in our Circuit, that have prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation do not seek to eradicate disapproval of homosexual practices (whether rooted in religious belief or misogyny or some other theory, or caused by some conditioned or other visceral reaction). People may believe what they like, but they may not discriminate in employment against those whose characteristics or behaviors place them within the ambit of a protected category. Unlike those states, though, Congress has not enacted such a prohibition, and the fact that some of us believe that sexual orientation discrimination is unfair for much the same reasons that we disapprove of sex discrimination does not change that reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Second, the majority suggests that my analysis of associational discrimination is \"squarely foreclosed by\" cases like\n   <em>\n    Oncale\n   </em>\n   . Maj. Op. at 127. It is not. As noted above, I do not maintain that Title VII prohibits only those practices that its framers might have been principally concerned with, or only what was \"traditionally,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., seen as sex discrimination. To reiterate: sexual harassment plays a large role in hindering women's entry into, and advancement in, the workplace, and thus it is no surprise that courts have interpreted Title VII to prohibit it. And because Title VII protects both men and women from such practices, it does not matter whether the victim is male or female. Sexual harassment in the workplace quite literally imposes conditions of employment on one sex that are not imposed on the other, and it does not matter whether the employer who perpetrates such discriminatory disadvantage is male or female, or of the same or different sex than the employee. The victim of discrimination in such situations is selected by his or her sex, and the disadvantage is\n   imposed on him or her by reason of his or her membership in the protected class. It is not a question of what is \"traditionally conceptualized as sexism.\" Maj. Op. at 127. It is a question of the public meaning of the words adopted by Congress in light of the social problem it was addressing when it chose those words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   In the end, perhaps all of these arguments, on both sides, boil down to a disagreement about how discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be conceptualized. Whether based on linguistic arguments or associational theories or notions of stereotyping, the majority's arguments attempt to draw theoretical links between one kind of discrimination and another: to find ways to reconceptualize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as discrimination on the basis of sex. It is hard to believe that there would be much appetite for this kind of recharacterization if the law expressly prohibited sexual orientation discrimination, or that any opponent of sexual orientation discrimination would oppose the addition of sexual orientation to the list of protected characteristics in Title VII on the ground that to do so would be redundant or would express a misunderstanding of the nature of discrimination against men and women who are gay. I believe that the vast majority of people in our society-both those who are hostile to homosexuals and those who deplore such hostility-understand bias against or disapproval of those who are sexually attracted to persons of their own sex as a distinct type of prejudice, and not as merely a form of discrimination against either men or women on the basis of sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The majority asserts that discrimination against gay people is nothing more than a subspecies of discrimination against one or the other gender. Discrimination against gay men and lesbians is wrong, however, because it denies the dignity and equality of gay men and lesbians, and not because, in a purely formal sense, it can be said to treat men differently from women. It is understandable that those who seek to achieve legal protection for gay people victimized by discrimination search for innovative arguments to classify workplace bias against gays as a form of discrimination that is already prohibited by federal law. But the arguments advanced by the majority ignore the evident meaning of the language of Title VII, the social realities that distinguish between the kinds of biases that the statute sought to exclude from the workplace from those it did not, and the distinctive nature of anti-gay prejudice. Accordingly, much as I might wish it were otherwise, I must conclude that those arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The law with respect to the rights of gay people has advanced considerably since 1964. Much of that development has been by state legislation. As noted above, for example, twenty-two states now prohibit, by explicit legislative pronouncement, employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 21. But other advances have come by means of Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution. Perhaps the most striking advance, from the vantage of the early 1960s, has been the legalization of same-sex marriage as a matter of constitutional law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Nothing that I have said in this opinion should be interpreted as expressing any disagreement with the line of cases running from\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

The Supreme Court's decisions in this area are based on the Constitution of the United States, rather than a specific statute, and the role of the courts in interpreting the Constitution is distinctively different from their role in interpreting acts of Congress. There are several reasons for this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   First, the entire point of the Constitution is to delimit the powers that have been granted by the people to their government. Our Constitution creates a republican form of government, in which the democratically elected representatives of the majority of the people are granted the power to set policy. But the powers of those representatives are constrained by a written text, which prevents a popular majority-both in the federal Congress and, since the Civil War Amendments, in state legislatures-from violating certain fundamental rights. As every law student reads in his or her first-year constitutional law class, \"[t]he powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

In interpreting statutes, courts must not merely show deference or restraint; their obligation is to do their best to understand, in a socially and politically realistic way, what decisions the democratic branches of government have embodied in the language they voted for (and what they have not), and to interpret statutes accordingly in deciding cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Second, the rights conferred by the Constitution are written in broad language.

Examples are easily cited: The Constitution does not contain a list of specific punishments that are too cruel to be imposed; it prohibits, in general language, \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" U.S. Const. amend.

It does not enact a code of police procedure that explains exactly what kinds of searches the police may conduct, under what particular circumstances; it prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Rather, legislators are entitled to pick and choose which problems to address, and how far to go in addressing them.

The majestic guarantee of equal\n   protection in the Fourteenth Amendment is a very different kind of pronouncement than the prohibition, in Title VII, of specific kinds of discrimination, by a specified subset of employers, based on clearly defined categories.

The choice of broad language reflects the framers' goal: they did not choose to prohibit \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" rather than listing prohibited punishments, simply to save space, on the assumption that future courts could consult extra-constitutional sources to identify what particular penalties they had in mind; they did so in order to enshrine a general principle, leaving its instantiation and elaboration to future interpreters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Those enduring principles would not, could not, endure if they were incapable of adaptation-at times via judicial interpretation-to new social circumstances, as well as new understandings of old problems. That idea is not new. In 1910, the Supreme Court wrote, in the context of the Eighth Amendment, that \"[t]ime works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle, to be vital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of constitutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Weems v.

More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , the Court noted that \"in interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has recognized that new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality within our most fundamental institutions that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.\" 135 S.Ct. at 2603.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Legislation, on the other hand, is not intended to last forever. It must be consistent with constitutional principles, and ideally it will be inspired by a principled concept of ordered liberty. But it nevertheless remains the domain of practical political compromise. Congress and the state legislatures are in frequent session, and are capable-notwithstanding criticisms of \"gridlock\" and praise of \"checks and balances\"-of acting to repeal, extend, or modify prior enactments. In interpreting the Constitution, courts speak to the ages; in interpreting legislation, federal courts speak to-and essentially for-Congress, which can always correct our mistakes, or revise legislation in light of changing political and social realities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Finally, the Constitution, as noted above, is designed, with very limited exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   to govern the government. The\n   commands of equal protection and respect for liberties that can only be denied by due process of law tell us how a government must behave when it regulates the people who created it. Legislation, however, generally governs the people themselves, in their relation with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The question of how the government, acting at the behest of a possibly temporary political majority, is permitted to treat the people it governs, is a different question, and is answered by reference to different principles, than the question of what obligations should be imposed on private citizens. The former question must ultimately be answered by courts under the principles adopted in the Constitution. The latter is entrusted primarily to the legislative process. Courts interpreting statutes are not in the business of imposing on private actors new rules that have not been embodied in legislative decision. It is for that reason that segregation in public facilities was struck down by constitutional command, long before segregation of private facilities was prohibited by federal legislation adopted by Congress. Whether or not the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments have something to say about whether\n   <em>\n    the state and federal governments\n   </em>\n   may discriminate in employment against gay Americans-a question that is not before us, and about which I express no view-it is the prerogative of Congress or a state legislature to decide whether private employers may do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   In its\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   submission, the EEOC quite reasonably asks whether it is just that a gay employee can be married on Sunday, and fired on Monday-discriminated against at his or her job for exercising a right that is protected by the Constitution. Brief of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would answer that it is not just. But at the same time, I recognize that the law does not prohibit every injustice. The Constitution protects the liberty of gay people to marry against deprivation by their government, but it does not promise freedom from discrimination by their fellow citizens. That is hardly a novel proposition: absent Title VII, the same injustice could have been inflicted on the\n   <em>\n    Loving\n   </em>\n   s themselves. The Constitution protected them against\n   <em>\n    governmental\n   </em>\n   discrimination, but (except for specific vestiges of slavery prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment) only an act of Congress can prohibit one individual from discriminating against another in housing, public accommodations, and employment. It is well to remember that whether to prohibit race and sex discrimination was a controversial political question in 1964. Imposing an obligation on private employers to treat women and minorities fairly required political organizing and a political fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   At the end of the day, to paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall, in interpreting statutes we must never forget that it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a Constitution we are expounding.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M'Culloch v.

When interpreting an act of Congress, we need to respect the choices made by Congress about which social problems to address, and how to address them. In 1964, Congress-belatedly-prohibited employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion, ethnicity, and national origin. Many states have similarly recognized the injustice of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   In doing so, they have called such discrimination by its right name, and taken a firm and explicit stand against it. I hope that one day soon Congress will join them, and adopt that principle on a national basis. But it has not done so yet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully, and regretfully, dissent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Debra Ann Livingston, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   I dissent for substantially the reasons set forth in Sections I, II, and III of Judge Lynch's opinion, and I join in those sections.

Op. at 112-13, 114 n.10, 119, 119-20, et passim, and is therefore included among the prohibited grounds of workplace discrimination listed in Title VII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The majority's efforts founder on the simple question of how a reasonable reader, competent in the language and its use, would have understood Title VII's text when it was written-on the question of its public meaning at the time of enactment. The majority acknowledges the argument \"that it is not 'even remotely plausible that in 1964, when Title VII was adopted, a reasonable person competent in the English language would have understood that a law banning employment discrimination 'because of sex' also banned discrimination because of sexual orientation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114 (citation omitted). It does not contest the point, however, but seeks merely to justify its departure from ordinary, contemporary meaning by claiming that \"[e]ven if that [is] so,\" its approach no more departs from the ordinary meaning of words in their contemporary context than supposedly occurred when sexual harassment and hostile work environment claims were first recognized by courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-15.

As the text above makes plain, I do not contend that Title VII is limited by what members of Congress who voted for it privately believed or intended to prohibit, or might have hoped it would or would not do. The question here is what \"discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's ... sex,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), as contrasted to \"discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's ... sexual orientation,\" meant (and continues to mean) to ordinary speakers of English. Legislation cannot sensibly be interpreted by stringing together dictionary synonyms of each word and proclaiming that, if the right example of the meaning of each is selected, the \"plain meaning\" of the statute leads to a particular result. No theory of interpretation, including textualism itself, is premised on such an approach. (No less a textualist than Justice Scalia recognized the point: \"Adhering to the\n    <em>\n     fair meaning\n    </em>\n    of the text ... does not limit one to the hyperliteral meaning of each word in the text.\" Antonin Scalia and Bryan A.

During the debate over the addition of \"sex\" to Title VII, it was similarly argued that if sex was not added to the prohibited categories of discrimination, white women would have fewer protections than black men. As Representative Martha Griffiths, an early supporter of the amendment, warned during congressional hearings, \"A vote against this amendment today by a white man is a vote against his wife, or his widow, or his daughter, or his sister.\" Gillian Thomas\n    <em>\n     , Because of Sex\n    </em>\n    2 (2016).
