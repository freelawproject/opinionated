The question is whether the common-carrier exemption is activity-based, meaning that a common carrier is exempt from FTC jurisdiction only with respect to its common-carrier activities, or status-based, such that an entity engaged in common-carrier activities is entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We affirm the district court's denial of AT&amp;T's motion to dismiss. Looking to the FTC Act's text, the meaning of \"common carrier\" according to the courts around the time the statute was passed in 1914, decades of judicial interpretation, the expertise of the FTC and Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), and legislative history, we conclude that the exemption is activity-based. The phrase \"common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce\" thus provides immunity from FTC regulation only to the extent that a common carrier is engaging in common-carrier services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This statutory interpretation also accords with common sense. The FTC is the\n   leading federal consumer protection agency and, for many decades, has been the chief federal agency on privacy policy and enforcement. Permitting the FTC to oversee unfair and deceptive non-common-carriage practices of telecommunications companies has practical ramifications. New technologies have spawned new regulatory challenges. A phone company is no longer just a phone company. The transformation of information services and the ubiquity of digital technology mean that telecommunications operators have expanded into website operation, video distribution, news and entertainment production, interactive entertainment services and devices, home security and more. Reaffirming FTC jurisdiction over activities that fall outside of common-carrier services avoids regulatory gaps and provides consistency and predictability in regulatory enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2007, AT&amp;T Mobility LLC (\"AT&amp;T\") was the exclusive provider of mobile data services for the Apple iPhone. AT&amp;T initially offered iPhone customers a service plan with \"unlimited\" mobile data for a flat monthly fee. In 2010, however, AT&amp;T stopped offering unlimited mobile data plans to new smartphone customers. Instead, AT&amp;T offered \"tiered\" mobile data plans. Under the new tiered plans, a customer who exceeded a specified data allowance would be charged for any additional data at a rate set by AT&amp;T. Legacy customers who previously signed up for unlimited data, however, were grandfathered and allowed to keep their existing service plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2011, AT&amp;T began reducing the data speed for its unlimited mobile data plan customers-a practice commonly known as \"data throttling.\" For example, if a customer with an unlimited mobile data plan exceeded a certain usage limit, AT&amp;T would substantially reduce the speed at which the customer's device would receive data for the balance of the customer's billing cycle. Customers experienced reduced speed when they exceeded the preset limit, regardless of actual network congestion. AT&amp;T did not apply the data-throttling practice to customers on tiered plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the FTC, AT&amp;T made limited disclosures about its data-throttling practice. Although AT&amp;T did alert some customers about the practice via text message, a monthly bill, or e-mail, it did not inform unlimited data customers of the degree to which their data speed would be reduced. AT&amp;T's wireless customer agreements for unlimited data customers did not reveal that the use of more than a specified amount of data would trigger a slowdown. Nor did AT&amp;T disclose that speed reductions were intentional rather than the result of network congestion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on these practices, the FTC brought suit against AT&amp;T under Section 5 of the FTC Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FTC alleged that AT&amp;T's data-throttling program was unfair and deceptive because the company advertised \"unlimited mobile data,\" but in fact imposed restrictions on data speed for customers who exceeded a preset limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   AT&amp;T moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that it was exempt from FTC regulation under Section 5 because it is a \"common carrier[ ] subject to the Acts to regulate commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In AT&amp;T's view, the common-carrier exemption may be invoked so long as an entity has the \"status\" of a common carrier. That is, if an entity qualifies as a common carrier, all of its activities are immune from regulation under Section 5, regardless of whether the entity provides\n   both common-carriage and non-common-carriage services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, the FTC claimed that AT&amp;T was exempt from jurisdiction only \"to the extent that it provides a common carrier service.\" In the FTC's view, the common-carrier exemption applies only to the extent that an entity actually engages in common-carrier activities. Under this \"activity-based\" interpretation, an entity's non-common-carriage activities are subject to FTC regulation. At the time the FTC filed suit, mobile data provision was not a \"common carrier service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While AT&amp;T's motion to dismiss was pending, the FCC issued an order changing its classification of mobile data, such that it would be treated as a common-carriage service rather than a non-common-carriage service, but \"only on a prospective basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet\n   </em>\n   , 30 F.C.C. Rcd. 5601, 5734 n.792 (2015) (the \"Reclassification Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response to this regulatory change, AT&amp;T took the position that it was a common carrier under any construction of Section 5, and that the FTC was no longer empowered to pursue its claims, either past or present, against the company. The FTC countered that the lawsuit remained live against AT&amp;T's pre-Reclassification Order data-throttling practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court denied AT&amp;T's motion to dismiss. In concluding that AT&amp;T was not exempt from FTC oversight, the court examined judicial opinions contemporaneous with the Act's passage. The court found that around 1914, \"[a]n entity was deemed a common carrier when it had the status of [a] common carrier\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   was actually engaging in common carriage services.\" Other factors supported this historical interpretation. The district court read the FTC Act broadly and its exemptions narrowly because the FTC Act is a remedial statute. The court also analyzed the legislative history, afforded the FTC's interpretation some deference under\n   <em>\n    Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/\">\n    323 U.S. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/\">\n    65 S.Ct. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/\">\n    89 L.Ed. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944), and observed that exempting AT&amp;T from FTC jurisdiction would \"result in significant regulatory gaps.\" The district court also determined that the Reclassification Order did not compel dismissal because it \"appl[ies] only on a prospective basis.\" Upon AT&amp;T's motion, the district court certified for immediate appeal the order denying dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We granted AT&amp;T's unopposed petition for interlocutory review, and a panel of our court reversed.\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

AT&amp;T moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), framing the issue as whether the district court possessed \"subject-matter jurisdiction over the FTC's complaint, notwithstanding the fact that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) deprives the FTC of regulatory jurisdiction over 'common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AT&amp;T's characterization of its motion is incorrect.

This approach is particularly appropriate here because the language of the exemption-\"except ... common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce\"-remains unchanged since 1914.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Critical to our interpretation, a consistent line of cases demonstrates that \"common carrier\" had a well-understood meaning by 1914. Forty years before the FTC Act, the Supreme Court observed that an entity could be considered a common carrier for some purposes but not others: \"A common carrier may, undoubtedly, become a private carrier, or a bailee for hire, when, as a matter of accommodation or special engagement, he undertakes to carry something which it is not his business to carry.\"\n   <em>\n    N.

In other words, being a common carrier entity was not a unitary status for regulatory purposes. A business with common-carrier status acted in its capacity as a common carrier only when it performed activities that were \"embraced within the scope of its chartered powers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"62498,62446\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed/21/627/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   AT&amp;T points to the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Lockwood\n   </em>\n   that the \"nature of [an entity's] business renders [it] a common carrier\" to argue that the common-carrier exemption is status-based.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 376. But if anything, the Court's reference to the \"nature\" of the common carrier's business is more compatible with an activity-based interpretation. Were the exemption status-based, the Court would have had no need to refer to the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of the common carrier's business activities at all, but could have stopped its analysis after concluding that the entity had the \"status\" of a common carrier for any purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Similarly, after passage of the ICA, common carriers were subject to the ICC's jurisdiction only to the extent that they were engaging in common-carrier activities. For example, in\n   <em>\n    ICC v. Goodrich Transit Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court highlighted\n   the division between common-carrier and non-common-carrier pursuits by the same company.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668585\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/224/194/#p204\">\n    224 U.S. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668585\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/224/194/#p204\">\n    32 S.Ct. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668585\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/224/194/#p204\">\n    56 L.Ed. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1912).

For example, a railroad could also engage in purely private transportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20U.S.%2017\">\n    84 U.S. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f a carrier of produce, running a truck boat between New York City and Norfolk, should be requested to carry a keg of specie,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or a load of expensive furniture, which he could justly refuse to take, such agreement might be made in reference to his taking and carrying the same as the parties chose to make ....\").

AGENCY INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON-CARRIER EXEMPTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Consistent with the longstanding judicial interpretation of the exemption, the FCC and the FTC both urge us to adopt an activity-based interpretation of the term \"common carrier.\" As the FCC states in its amicus brief, \"the agencies have historically understood the FTC to have jurisdiction over non-common-carrier services of entities that also engage in common carriage\n   services within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   According to the FCC, \"the Communications Act and the FTC Act fit hand-in-glove to ensure there is no gap in the federal regulation of telecommunications companies, while also conferring the FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over common-carrier services.\" That regulatory harmony results from the cross-reference between the FTC Act and the Communications Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45(a)(2). As the FCC explains, the Communications Act \"authorizes comprehensive common-carriage regulation of telecommunications providers only when they are engaged in common carrier activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20153\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (51), 332(c)(1). And because \"the provisions of the Communications Act cross-referenced by the FTC Act's common-carrier exception are activity-based, not status-based,\" the common-carrier exemption \"is activity-based as well.\" By contrast, a novel, status-based interpretation could \"open a potentially substantial regulatory gap and greatly disrupt the federal regulatory scheme.\" In the FCC's view, the activity-based approach is therefore \"the only plausible interpretation of the common carrier exemption\" in Section 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Despite the cross-reference between the statutes, there may be some overlap between the agencies' jurisdiction when the FCC's regulations of common carriers affect the non-common-carrier activities of those entities. In a 2015 Memorandum of Understanding, the two agencies \"express[ed] their belief that the scope of the common carrier exemption in the FTC Act does not preclude the FTC from addressing non-common carrier activities engaged in by common carriers.\"\n   <em>\n    FCC-FTC Consumer Protection Memorandum of Understanding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207261839\">\n    2015 WL 7261839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Nov. 16, 2015).
