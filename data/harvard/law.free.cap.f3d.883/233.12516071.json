Reg. at 45,162. The Government did not make the report part of the record for the Court's review, and it conceded during oral argument that the validity of the Proclamation rises or falls on the rationale presented within its four corners. Oral Arg. 32:30-33:00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As part of the review, the Secretary of Homeland Security reportedly created a \"baseline for the kinds of information required from foreign governments to support the United States Government's ability to confirm the identity of individuals seeking entry into the United States\" or other benefits under the immigration laws and \"to assess whether they are a security or public-safety threat.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 45,162. Three categories of baseline criteria were used to determine the quality of a country's information sharing and are listed in \u00a7 1 of the Proclamation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,162 -63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The first category involves \"identity-management information,\" which the Proclamation states is \"needed to determine whether individuals seeking benefits under the immigration laws are who they claim to be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,162. Criteria in this category \"include whether the country issues electronic passports embedded with data to enable confirmation of identity, reports lost and stolen passports to appropriate entities, and makes available upon request identity-related information not included in its passports.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second category involves \"national security and public-safety information,\" which the Proclamation states is needed to determine whether \"persons who seek entry to this country pose national security or public-safety risks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Criteria include \"whether the country makes available, directly or indirectly, known or suspected terrorist and criminal-history information upon request, whether the country provides passport and national-identity document exemplars, and whether the country impedes the United States Government's receipt of information about passengers and crew traveling to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The third category involves a \"national security and public-safety assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,162 -63. This category consists of various national security risk indicators, including \"whether the country is a known or potential terrorist safe haven, whether it is a participant in the Visa Waiver Program ... that meets all of its requirements, and whether it regularly fails to receive its nationals subject to final orders of removal from the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Applying these baseline criteria, the Department of Homeland Security identified sixteen countries as \"inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,163. Thirty-one additional countries were classified as \"at risk\" of becoming inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then followed a fifty-day engagement period during which all countries, including those not identified as \"inadequate\" or \"at-risk,\" were encouraged to improve their information-sharing practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ultimately, the Secretary of Homeland Security recommended eight countries for\n   entry restrictions, recommendations that President Trump adopted in full. The Secretary determined that Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen continued to be \"inadequate\" and recommended that nationals from these countries be subjected to entry restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Somalia did meet the baseline criteria but was nonetheless added to the list of countries subject to entry restrictions under the Proclamation because its \"government's inability to effectively and consistently cooperate, combined with the terrorist threat that emanates from its territory, present special circumstances that warrant restrictions and limitations on the entry of its nationals into the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,164 -65, 45,167. Iraq did not meet the baseline criteria but was exempted from entry suspensions in light of \"the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected government of Iraq, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,163. Instead, Iraqi nationals will face \"additional scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Proclamation does not indicate whether any other countries that also failed the baseline were nonetheless not recommended for entry restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Proclamation imposes different restrictions on immigrants and nonimmigrants from the eight countries, but all restrictions are indefinite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,164, 45,169. The Proclamation suspends immigration from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; it exempts Venezuela, which failed the baseline criteria, but includes Somalia, which passed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,165 -67. The Proclamation also restricts some or all categories of nonimmigrants from all countries except Somalia, whose nationals will instead undergo additional scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, it bars the issuance of all nonimmigrant visas to Syrian and North Korean nationals; of all nonimmigrant visas except F, M, and J visas to Iranian nationals; and of B-1, B-2, and B-1/B-2 visas to Libyan, Yemeni, and Chadian nationals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But because the Government has \"alternative sources for obtaining information to verify the citizenship and identity of nationals from Venezuela,\" the Proclamation only suspends B-1, B-2, and B-1/B-2 visas for \"government officials ... who are responsible for the identified inadequacies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Proclamation only applies to foreign nationals who are outside the United States on the effective date and \"do not have a valid visa\" or \"qualify for a visa or other valid travel document.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,167. The Proclamation does allow for waivers, but they are discretionary and require the foreign national to prove that denying entry would cause \"undue hardship,\" that entry would \"not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States,\" and that entry \"would be in the national interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,168.

This evidence includes President Trump's disparaging comments and tweets regarding Muslims; his repeated proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States; his subsequent explanation that he would effectuate this \"Muslim\" ban by targeting \"territories\" instead of Muslims directly; the issuance of EO-1 and EO-2, addressed only to majority-Muslim nations; and finally the issuance of the Proclamation, which not only closely tracks EO-1 and EO-2, but which President Trump and his advisors described as having the same goal as EO-1 and EO-2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IRAP I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276595\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/554/\">\n    857 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   591 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 168, 756, 779, 791, 794, 808-12, 815-17, 820.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The President's own words-publicly stating a constitutionally impermissible reason for the Proclamation-distinguish this case from those in which courts have found that the Government had satisfied\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's\"bona fide\" prong.

Rather, only a week after taking office, President Trump issued EO-1, which banned the entry of citizens of six Muslim majority countries, provided exemptions for Christians, and lacked any asserted evidence indicating a genuine national security purpose. The very next day, January 28, 2017, Rudy Giuliani, an advisor to President Trump, explained that EO-1's\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   was to discriminate against Muslims. J.A. 808-10, 815-16. A reasonable observer could certainly conclude that in banning entry into the United States of\n   180 million Muslims, approximately 10% of the world Muslim population, EO-1 was crafted to deliver, as Giuliani said, on President Trump's promise to \"ban Muslim immigration to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 809, 820. This is particularly so given that every federal judge who considered the matter enjoined EO-1, finding that it likely violated the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Shortly after issuance of these injunctions of EO-1, President Trump issued EO-2, which he and his advisors characterized as being substantially similar to EO-1. The President described EO-2 as \"a watered down version of the first order.\" J.A. 779. Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller similarly explained that the changes to EO-2 were \"mostly minor technical differences,\" and promised that they would result in \"the same basic policy outcomes for the country.\" J.A. 756. Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that \"[t]he principles of the [second] executive order remain the same.\" J.A. 168.

J.A. 791. On June 5, 2017, President Trump stated that the \"Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court-&amp; seek much tougher version!\" and that \"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to [the Supreme Court].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276595\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/554/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statements issued via Twitter). The very next day, then-White House Press Secretary Spicer explained that President Trump's tweets are \"official statements by the president of the United States.\" J.A. 794, 1521. Only nine days before issuing the Proclamation, President Trump tweeted, \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\" J.A. 832.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The President also continued to express what any reasonable observer could view as general anti-Muslim bias. In an August 17, 2017, tweet, the President endorsed an apocryphal story involving General Pershing and a purported massacre of Muslims with bullets dipped in a pig's blood, advising people to \"[s]tudy what General Pershing ... did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\" J.A. 806. On November 29, 2017, President Trump retweeted three disturbing anti-Muslim videos entitled: \"Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!\" \"Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!\" and \"Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\" J.A. 1497-99. The three videos were originally tweeted by an extremist political party whose mission is to oppose \"all alien and destructive politic or religious doctrines, including ... Islam.\" J.A. 1508. When asked about the three videos, President Trump's deputy press secretary Raj Shah responded by saying that the \"President has been talking about these security issues for years now, from the campaign trail to the White House\" and \"the President has addressed these issues with the travel order that he issued earlier this year and the companion proclamation.\" J.A. 1502-03. The Government does not-and, indeed, cannot-dispute that the President made these statements. Instead, it argues that the \"statements that occurred after the issuance of EO-2 do not reflect any religious animus\" but reflect \"the compelling secular goal of protecting national security from an amply-documented present threat.\" First Br. 52. We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Rather, an objective observer could conclude that the President's repeated statements convey the primary purpose of the Proclamation-to exclude Muslims from the United States. In fact, it is hard to imagine how an objective observer could come to any other conclusion when the President's own deputy press secretary made this connection express: he explained that President Trump tweets extremist anti-Muslim videos as part of his broader concerns about \"security,\" which he has \"addressed ... with ... the proclamation.\" J.A. 1502-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Government correctly points out that the President's past actions cannot \"forever taint\" his future actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCreary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p860\">\n    545 U.S. at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p860\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; First Br. 18.

To be sure, the Proclamation does differ in some respects from the previous Executive Orders. For example, the Proclamation bans citizens from two non-majority Muslim countries, North Korea and Venezuela. Although the Proclamation affects only very few persons from those countries as opposed to the many tens of thousands from the other Muslim-majority countries, the Government asserts that \"[t]he inclusion of those [two] non-Muslim-majority countries in the Proclamation underscores [a] religion-neutral purpose.\" First Br. 50. Again, we disagree. In\n   <em>\n    McCreary\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found that despite the court-ordered addition of secular texts to a twice-challenged display of the Ten Commandments in state courthouses, \"[n]o reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Counties had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p860\">\n    545 U.S. at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p860\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a reasonable observer could hardly \"swallow the claim\" that the addition of North Korea and Venezuela to the twice-enjoined travel ban was anything more than an attempt to \"cast off\" the \"unmistakable\" religious objective of the earlier executive orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Nor does the \"months-long\" \"multi-agency review,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   First Br. 43, 47, on which the Proclamation assertedly rests, establish that its primary purpose is secular. Although in its briefs the Government repeatedly invoked this review, the Government chose not to make the review publicly available and so provided a reasonable observer no basis to rely on the review. Perhaps in recognition of this, at oral argument before us the Government expressly disavowed any claim that the\n   review could save the Proclamation. Instead, the Government conceded that the Proclamation rises and falls on its own four corners. Oral Arg. at 32:27-33:00. Even if we considered the review, we could not conclude that it demonstrates that the Proclamation has a secular purpose. This is because the criteria allegedly used in the review to identify problematic countries lie at odds with the list of countries actually included in the Proclamation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Like the district court, we do not note \"the apparent disconnect between the identified problem[s]\" in the review and \"the broad, nationality-based travel ban to evaluate the merits\" of the Proclamation as a policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IRAP v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 626-27.

For Congress to delegate the sweeping power that the Proclamation claims, it must do so clearly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.D.A. v.

And, in delegating broad powers, Congress must not give the President \"totally unrestricted freedom of choice,\" as doing so may run afoul of the nondelegation doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zemel v.

But the President does not, within the confines of the Constitution,\n   decide major questions that are within the legislative function. Indeed, conferral of unrestrained discretion on the President can be particularly dangerous for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   First, the President is not subject to the procedures that constrain legislative and administrative decision-making. Congress, given its bicameral structure, provides a different kind of safeguard against government overreach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Federalist No. 70 (Alexander Hamilton) (explaining that Congress is \"best adapted to deliberation and wisdom, and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests\"). The legislative process is then less prone to \"the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.\" The Federalist No. 62;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v.

The Constitution is best preserved by reliance on standards tested over time and insulated from the pressures of the moment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Second, rescinding the President's discretion, once granted, is not a simple task. It almost certainly requires a veto-proof supermajority-even though a simple majority of Congress may have delegated the authority. Therefore, courts should not readily assume that a co-equal branch of government has ceded control over questions of monumental significance. Rather, Congress must effectuate broad delegations with statements of commensurate clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Sections 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1) do not contain that requisite clarity. As the Supreme Court has held, \"oftentimes the 'meaning-or ambiguity-of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2489 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"630\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p160\">\n    529 U.S. at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"631\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p160\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The two provisions may appear to confer broad discretion when read in isolation but not when read in context or when compared to other statutory provisions that confer discretion on the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But such language is noticeably absent. The INA, including \u00a7 1182, and other statutes are replete with examples of far broader delegations of discretion. Section 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), for instance, commits an immigration waiver decision to the \"sole discretion\" and \"satisfaction\" of the Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"635\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C)(iii), 1182(a)(10)(C)(ii)(III), 1182(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II), 1182(d)(3)(B)(i). Congress has also used similar language to delegate broad discretion to the President in other contexts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"636\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20485\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1), (g)(1) (\"at the sole discretion of the President\"); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631a(c) (\"within the sole discretion of the President\"). Thus, Congress demonstrably knows how to confer maximum discretion but has not done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   For those reasons, I conclude that \u00a7 1182(f) and \u00a7 1185(a)(1) do not clearly confer the broad authority that the Government claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Having determined that the grant of authority under \u00a7 1182(f) and \u00a7 1185(a)(1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   is not as broad as the Government claims, the next question is the actual scope of the powers they delegate-and whether the Proclamation falls within that scope.

Even assuming the President never expands the Proclamation, he has already \"block[ed] over 150 million people from entering the United States on the basis of their nationality.\"\n   <em>\n    IRAP v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 593.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The vast discretion that the INA supposedly delegates to the President and the vast scope of that delegation thus raise nondelegation concerns to their zenith. The Proclamation invokes such broad authority to drastically affect private rights and affairs that it approximates lawmaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"668\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/\">\n    462 U.S. at 952-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"669\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Drawing a line between legislative and executive functions can be difficult; the demarcation between the legislature and the executive is necessarily dynamic and can only be truly resolved by the interplay between the branches. But this case presents an easy question because actions akin to the Proclamation have historically been legislative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Three examples illustrate this point. First, classifying foreign nationals and categorically regulating their entry are legislative acts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fiallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"670\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p792\">\n    430 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   795 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"671\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p792\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[L]imits and classifications as to who shall be admitted are traditional and necessary elements of legislation in this area.\");\n   <em>\n    Nishimura Ekiu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557151\" index=\"672\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/142/651/#p659\">\n    142 U.S. at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557151\" index=\"673\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/142/651/#p659\">\n    12 S.Ct. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ongress has often passed acts forbidding the immigration of particular classes of foreigners.\"). Indeed, Congress has enacted and since repealed statutes that ban foreigners based on nationality. The most analogous examples are the Chinese Exclusion Act and nationality-based quota system. The\n   Chinese Exclusion Act barred for ten years (and later indefinitely) the entry of Chinese migrants to this nation based on the judgment that their presence would be detrimental to \"the good order\" of the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act, Pub. L.

Although the last remnants of these laws were repealed in 1965, the Proclamation mirrors their likeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Second, the Government's interpretation of \u00a7 1182(f) and \u00a7 1185(a)(1) authorizes the President to prevent significant portions of the INA from having any effect, indefinitely, unless contrary legislation is enacted-an action that bears similarities to the unconstitutional line item veto. As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the 1965 amendments to the INA prohibit a nationality-based immigration policy and provide for individualized visa-eligibility determinations for family members.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"676\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 1152(a). Those provisions would be subject to suspension by the President at will. Unlike individual visa waivers, for example, the Proclamation creates rules of future and general application and decides for whom the INA shall not apply. The potential permanence of proclamations, combined with the effective suspension of an enacted statute, approximates the line item veto that the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional executive lawmaking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clinton v.

There, the Supreme Court held that the President could not, by invoking his commander-in-chief powers, resolve labor disputes through seizure of property because Congress was vested with the power to do so and had previously rejected similar legislation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"680\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p587\">\n    343 U.S. at 586-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"681\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p587\">\n    72 S.Ct. 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the President similarly attempts to reorganize domestic affairs by employing nationality discrimination, a method already rejected by Congress. The\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   Court also rejected the Government's argument that actions with such\n   significant effects on the domestic sphere could be justified by an amalgam of the President's powers to faithfully execute the laws: \"In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"682\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In sum, the President claims the authority to indefinitely set his own immigration and travel policies with respect to every foreign nation and class of immigrants, under any circumstances, exigent or not, that he sees fit. Such authority is dangerously similar to lawmaking and intrudes on Congress's plenary power over immigration. While courts rarely strike down laws on nondelegation grounds, courts \"vindicate the constitutional principle against delegation of legislative authority\" by \"narrowly construing grants of policymaking power.\" Cass R.

For the reasons below, I conclude that the Proclamation, with the exception of Venezuela, does not fill any gaps left by Congress and that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail in showing that it exceeds the authority granted by \u00a7 1182(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The structure of \u00a7 1182 reveals limitations on the President's discretion.

Only two executive actions have imposed broad bans, and both occurred in response to foreign affairs crises. Even then, both fell well-short of banning all immigrants. President Carter authorized the revocation and denial of Iranian visas after the Iranian government took U.S. embassy officials hostage, but exempted (1) asylum seekers, (2) Iranians closely related to an American, and (3) Iranians in need of immediate medical attention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, President\n   Reagan barred Cuban nationals after Cuba breached its immigration agreement but exempted the immediate relatives of Americans.

Given that the President can act much more rapidly in responding to foreign crises, congressional delegation of discretion under those circumstances is necessary to serve important sovereign interests.

Indeed, history shows that \u00a7 1182(f) grew to encompass exigent circumstances as those gaps manifested over the past century. After World War II, Congress expressly authorized the President to impose, during declared national emergencies, additional entry requirements beyond what Congress had otherwise prescribed. Immigration &amp; Nationality Act of 1952 \u00a7 215(a), 66 Stat. at 190 (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"730\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201185\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). However, in 1978, Congress deleted the language authorizing the President to impose additional entry requirements during a war or other national emergency. Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 95-426, \u00a7 707,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"731\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%20963\">\n    92 Stat. 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992-93 (1978). Having apparently lost the statutory authority to restrict entry during national emergencies under \u00a7 1185(a), Presidents, beginning with President Reagan in 1981, started invoking \u00a7 1182(f) for that purpose instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manuel,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (chronicling all categories of aliens excluded under \u00a7 1182(f) ). Therefore, from the outset, \u00a7 1182(f) has filled particular gaps, specifically those created by Congress in its 1978 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   In sum, judicial precedent disfavors dramatic expansions of authority delegated under old statutes. Even if \u00a7 1182(f) authorizes additional entry restrictions beyond those specified by Congress, courts should confine that delegated authority, as did the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Dulles\n   </em>\n   , to two categories: (1) foreign nationals whose personal conduct or characteristics make their entry harmful to national interests for reasons unanticipated by Congress and (2) foreign nationals barred in response to a demonstrated exigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161402\" index=\"732\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/116/#p129\">\n    357 U.S. at 128, 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161402\" index=\"733\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/116/#p129\">\n    78 S.Ct. 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Util.

Because Congress has already legislated in response to the Proclamation's stated purposes, the President, in the absence of exigent circumstances, has\n   exceeded his residual power in this case, except as to restrictions on Venezuelan officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the first gap consists of individuals whose personal conduct or circumstance renders their entry harmful to U.S. interests for reasons unanticipated by Congress. The restrictions against Venezuela are the only ones that fall within this category. The Proclamation does not exclude Venezuelan nationals\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   but instead sanctions individuals \"who are responsible for the identified inadequacies,\" such as officials who refuse to receive deportees. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45,166. Like the overwhelming majority of past exclusionary orders, these restrictions fit comfortably within the practice of excluding persons on the basis of their individual conduct or circumstance. But the blanket nationality ban on the remaining countries cannot fit within this category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The second gap consists of individuals and classes of individuals barred in response to exigent circumstances. In this case, there is no apparent exigency justifying immediate, categorical exclusion of foreign nationals from the Designated Countries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Proclamation cannot be responding to an exigency because it does not identify any new event or factual circumstance that Congress has not already considered via legislation. Indeed, the Proclamation represents the administration's attempt to second-guess Congress's judgment by expressly reviewing the same criteria that Congress already identified and examined. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45,163 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"734\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201187\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Under \u00a7 1187, Congress set forth electronic passport and other information-sharing criteria that, when met, exempts foreign nationals from certain documentation requirements. When countries fail to meet these criteria, their citizens are not excluded by the statute-they are merely denied the convenience of entering the United States without a visa. The President, quite simply, attempts to convert what Congress designated as qualifications for special privileges into general criteria for entry. Absent some new circumstance unanticipated by Congress or a demonstrated exigency, the broad and unrestrained power that the Government asserts under the Proclamation is unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   In sum, the President attempts to do more than what Congress has specifically authorized, in response to scenarios that Congress has already foreseen and addressed, without complying with the detailed framework and priorities that Congress has prescribed, in the absence of exigent circumstances justifying expansive executive authority. It makes little sense for Congress to delineate clear circumstances and processes for excluding individuals but then delegate, ambiguously, to the President the power to exclude people\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   without the same procedural rigor unless there is an exigent need for immediate action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

Since the current ban exceeds the bounds of the residual categories\n   refined by history and necessity, I decline to expand a long-existing statute and instead conclude that the Proclamation was issued without congressional authorization under \u00a7 1182(f), except as to Venezuela.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   I now examine whether the Proclamation is authorized by \u00a7 1185(a)(1). Section 1185(a)(1) makes it \"unlawful\" \"for any alien to depart from or enter ... the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nondelegation concerns are even greater under \u00a7 1185(a)(1) because of its broader application to departure, as well as entry. For the reasons below, I conclude that \u00a7 1185(a)(1) does not come close to sustaining the Proclamation. Read in context, it prohibits entry and departure without a passport or other documentation and authorizes reasonable requirements pertaining to travel documentation and other related travel procedures. A nationality requirement is beyond its scope because travelers cannot reasonably comply with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   As with \u00a7 1182(f), the discretion \u00a7 1185(a)(1) grants is informed by its statutory context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2489. Section 1185(a)(1) is a general provision, whereas subsections (2)-(7) specifically prohibit fraud, tampering, and other misuse of travel documents and applications. Other subsections within \u00a7 1185 also pertain to possession of travel documents. Read in context, \u00a7 1185(a)(1) is at best a residual provision that enables the President to issue reasonable rules pertaining to travel documents and related administrative processes-similar to its adjacent subsections. A provision regulating fraudulent acts and other tampering with travel procedures clearly does not confer the discretion to shut down travel\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39341\" index=\"738\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/218/#p228\">\n    512 U.S. at 231-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39341\" index=\"739\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/218/#p228\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring that delegation of authority to fundamentally alter statutory scheme be clearly expressed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   124 Cong.

In 1952, \u00a7 1185 was titled \"Travel Control of Aliens and Citizens in Time of War or National Emergency.\" Immigration &amp; Nationality Act of 1952 \u00a7 215. In 1978, Congress specifically amended \u00a7 1185 by renaming it, \"Travel Documentation of Aliens and Citizens.\" Foreign Relations Authorization Act \u00a7 707(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   As the change in title would suggest, Congress made several changes in 1978 that narrowed the type of restrictions that the President could impose but expanded it temporally to encompass peacetime. The 1952 version of \u00a7 1185(a)(1) had provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   When the United States is at war or during the existence of any national emergency proclaimed by the President ... and the President shall find that the interests of the United States require that restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those provided otherwise than by this section be imposed upon the\n   departure of persons from and their entry into the United States, and shall make public proclamation thereof, it shall, until otherwise ordered by the President or the Congress, be unlawful-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   (1) for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Immigration &amp; Nationality Act of 1952 \u00a7 215. The 1978 amendment removed several requirements that cabined when the President could act, including requirements that he use \u00a7 1185 only during the existence of war or national emergency in the national interest and pursuant to a public proclamation. Foreign Relations Authorization Act \u00a7 707. But, at the same time, Congress stripped the President of authority to impose \"restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those provided ... by this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39341\" index=\"740\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/218/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These changes create the inference that Congress broadened the temporal application of \u00a7 1185 to non-exigent circumstances while at the same time narrowing the President's authority to impose additional restrictions on entry and departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Section 1185(a)(1) also is not as broad as the Government claims because it applies to foreign nationals both inside and outside the United States.

Despite the Government's efforts to distinguish denial of entry and visa eligibility from visa issuance, the Proclamation operates by categorically denying the issuance of visas. The Proclamation repeatedly refers to visa issuance, and agencies now implement its mandate by categorically denying visas.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , 82 Fed.

Simply stated, the Government cannot evade \u00a7 1152(a)(1) simply by characterizing the ban as affecting \"entry\" or \"eligibility.\" The relevant inquiry is whether the administration is refusing to issue visas based on nationality, and the answer is indisputably in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   That Presidents Carter and Reagan have previously imposed entry restrictions on Iran and Cuba respectively does not suggest a contrary interpretation. Presidents Carter and Reagan did not impose blanket restrictions on all immigrants from Iran and Cuba-they exempted, among others, close family members, who were the central focus of the 1965 amendments to the INA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, to the extent that those two instances are sufficient to establish historical practice and congressional acquiescence, they imply only a narrow exception to \u00a7 1152(a)(1) that allows national bans under extraordinary circumstances. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , both Presidents were responding to discrete, foreign affairs exigencies that Congress had not yet considered. Congress's arguable acquiescence under those circumstances does not authorize\n   the Proclamation, which does not respond to any exigency or even new development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Thus, I conclude that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Proclamation operates in contravention of \u00a7 1152(a)(1) 's prohibition against nationality discrimination in the issuance of visas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Absent statutory authorization, there remains the possibility that the President could have enacted the ban using his Article II powers alone.

Accordingly, this category applies to executive action that has been expressly or impliedly prohibited by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Because the Proclamation consists of several subparts that impose different restrictions on different countries, the\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   framework must be applied at a more granular level than simply evaluating the nature of the Proclamation as a whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421263\" index=\"770\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/1/#p16\">\n    22 U.S. at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, restrictions targeting Venezuelan government officials are in the realm of\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category one because the President properly exercised his authority under \u00a7 1182(f). These restrictions therefore raise no constitutional concerns. The remaining restrictions, however, exceed the President's gap-filling authority under the INA; therefore, the question is whether those restrictions fall within\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category two or three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Because the Proclamation and the INA distinguish between immigrants and nonimmigrants, this analysis must do so as well. As to foreign nationals from the Designated Countries (minus Venezuela) seeking family reunification or other immigrant visas, the Proclamation violates the express will of Congress and therefore falls squarely within\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category three. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1152(a)(1) prohibits nationality discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas. Other provisions of the INA also not only authorize but prioritize family reunification. The President's order, by creating unequal barriers to entry based on nationality and by failing to exempt family members of Americans, directly contravenes Congress's immigration priorities and foreign policy judgment. Under\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category three, courts cannot uphold the President's unilateral action unless Congress has no power in the immigration arena-which is emphatically not the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 409-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"771\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p394\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nishimura Ekiu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557151\" index=\"772\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/142/651/#p659\">\n    142 U.S. at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557151\" index=\"773\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/142/651/#p659\">\n    12 S.Ct. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ogden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421263\" index=\"774\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/1/#p16\">\n    22 U.S. at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   As to foreign nationals from the seven remaining countries seeking nonimmigrant visas, the Proclamation violates the implied will of Congress and likewise falls within category three. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1182(a) and \u00a7 1187(a) set forth Congress's specific policy responses to individuals who pose certain risks or who come from countries that fail the Proclamation's baseline criteria. Those are the exclusive responses permitted by Congress absent unanticipated circumstances justifying departure. Since \u00a7 1182(f) is a limited gap-filling provision, the INA implicitly confines the circumstances under which that power may be invoked. Since the Proclamation's restrictions on nonimmigrant visas do not fill any gap unaddressed by Congress, they are within\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category three and are of dubious constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Indeed, even if the Proclamation's exclusion of nonimmigrants were to fall under\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   category two, it is not clear that the Proclamation's restrictions are within the President's Article II powers. No President has ever asserted such unilateral power. Past nationality-related restrictions have invariably relied on statutory authority-even as they affected far fewer nations and fewer individuals and involved a foreign-relations exigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manuel,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Presidents Carter and Reagan, for instance, acted in response to foreign affairs that triggered the height of their treaty and diplomat powers. There simply is no precedent for enacting a ban of this size and scope, against this many countries, without either seeking legislative approval or clearly invoking a core Article II power. Indeed, \u00a7 1182 and several\n   statutes authorizing exclusions during war or emergency would be entirely redundant if the President already had inherent powers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Immigration &amp; Nationality Act of 1952 \u00a7 215; Pub.

In other words, no one has identified a single case adopting what would be an astonishing view of inherent executive power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Youngstown\n   </em>\n   , the President cannot aggrandize his office and absorb powers that the Constitution has vested in Congress simply by applying a foreign-relations gloss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"787\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p587\">\n    343 U.S. at 586-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"788\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p587\">\n    72 S.Ct. 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that resolution of labor disputes \"is a job for the Nation's lawmakers\" notwithstanding impact on war). While the Proclamation undoubtedly has some foreign affairs consequences, significant costs also redound on ordinary Americans and their families. The power to dramatically reorganize domestic affairs in this way, particularly in the absence of war or national emergency, resides with Congress. Indeed, Congress's power cannot be said to be plenary if the President could, at any time, create and enforce his own priorities. Were the President to wield unilateral and inherent authority on questions that the judiciary is ill-suited to second-guess, he would wield the sole power to create, interpret, and implement the law as he sees fit. Even Congress may not be able to constrain that inherent Article II power-a result that undermines centuries of established precedent. This cannot be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   I therefore decline to decide whether the President could enact the Proclamation without statutory authorization because that claim is not squarely raised on the Proclamation's face. Instead, I construe the Proclamation's invocation of the INA to mean that the President thought legislative authority was necessary to enact the ban. Because the Proclamation exceeded\n   the delegated powers on which it relies, I conclude that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Proclamation, in large part, is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   For all of these reasons, I conclude that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success in their statutory claims. In enacting the Proclamation, the President has exceeded the scope of his authority under \u00a7 1182(f) and \u00a7 1185(a)(1) and violated \u00a7 1152(a). Because the President lacks authority under the INA to issue a nationality-based restriction absent exigency, I conclude that the Proclamation should be enjoined as to \u00a7 2(a)-(e) and (g)-(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the injunction should not extend to \u00a7 2(f) (Venezuela) because the travel restrictions on the Venezuelan government officials are lawful under the INA.

As drafted, the Proclamation permits the President to ban entry of these millions of aliens on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, the government urges us to place the most benign construction on the President's present exercise of authority, and effectively asks us to assume that the President will amend the ban when his concerns are addressed by the identified countries. Yet that is not the task before us. We do not look at the narrowest possible view of what action the President may choose to take under the Proclamation, or assume that he will not exercise all the power he has claimed in that document.

Reg. at 45,169. However, this periodic review process does not transform the indefinite ban of more than 150 million nationals into merely a temporary interruption of the INA's carefully crafted statutory scheme. Rather, the language of the Proclamation permits the ban on entry of the designated nationals to remain permanently in force, effectively rewriting the INA in material respects. Accordingly, I conclude that the Proclamation is inconsistent with the plain language of Section 1182(f), in which Congress granted the President authority to \"suspend\" entry of aliens for a \"period\" of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Separately, I consider the authority of the President under Section 1182(f) to suspend the entry of \"any class of aliens.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"905\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). On a superficial level, the group of more than 150 million foreign nationals may be said to qualify as a \"class of aliens,\" based on the definition of \"class\" as \"[a] group of people, things, qualities, or activities that have common characteristics or attributes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 304 (10th ed. 2014). However, we must consider the term further in the context of the full statutory provision and of the INA as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Section 1182(f) appears within a statutory section that contains a robust, detailed list of \"[c]lasses of aliens\" which Congress deemed ineligible for admission to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"906\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Notably, each of these classes of inadmissible aliens targets individuals who themselves have engaged in a specified activity, or who have a limitation or condition that renders their admission harmful to the interests of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"907\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (communicable diseases);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"908\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B) (terrorist activities);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"909\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(A) (public charges).

The Proclamation, however, restricts affiliated nationals grouped in classes of\n   <em>\n    countries,\n   </em>\n   depending\n   on each country's conditions relating to the criteria of identity-management, information-sharing, and terrorist activity. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45,165-45,167. By focusing on country conditions, the Proclamation, on an indefinite basis, substitutes its own classification system in place of Congress' considered judgment as reflected in the INA's carefully delineated statutory framework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, if we were to adopt the government's construction of Section 1182(f), the President effectively could rewrite the INA's \"extensive and complex\" restrictions on alien admissibility,\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 395,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"910\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p394\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , substituting national origin on a permanent basis for the limits designed by Congress and thereby transforming many provisions of the INA into mere suggestions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   My analysis might be different had Congress manifested a clear intent in Section 1182(f) to give the President the authority to override other provisions in the INA.

The absence of similar language in Section 1182(f) indicates that Congress did not intend for the President to have authority to issue an alien ban that permits him to implement a permanent amendment of the INA's carefully crafted statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   My conclusion that the President exceeded the scope of his authority under Section 1182(f) is not altered by the government's reliance on the only two prior orders issued by presidents barring entry of individuals based on national origin. The first was issued by President Jimmy Carter, and the second was issued by President Ronald Reagan. Of primary importance, neither of these orders was challenged as exceeding the scope of the President's authority under Section 1182(f). Further, both orders are readily distinguishable from the present Proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   President Carter's order, issued in 1979, authorized executive branch officials to prescribe limits on rules governing the entry of Iranian nationals holding nonimmigrant visas during the Iran Hostage Crisis.

Although this order identified aliens by nationality and did not contain an expiration date, the order made clear that the terms would expire when the Attorney General and the Secretary of State determined that normal migration procedures with Cuba were restored. This language, unlike the language of the Proclamation, manifested a temporary duration for the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   These two prior orders also were far narrower in their terms than the unlimited interpretation of Section 1182(f) the government offers to support the Proclamation. Moreover, not one of the prior 43 proclamations issued under Section 1182(f) banned entry by nationals of more than one country at the same time based on their nationality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kate M. Manuel, Cong. Research Serv., R 44743, Executive Authority to Exclude Aliens: In Brief 6-10 (2017). And, 42 of these 43 orders issued prior to the present Proclamation excluded aliens who\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   engaged in or were involved in conduct harmful to the national security or some other interest of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Ultimately, however, whatever scope these past executive actions may have had is not dispositive of the issue before us. Under any articulation of limits contemplated by Congress in enacting Section 1182(f), this Proclamation exceeds the President's authority under the INA by effectively rewriting for an unlimited duration the INA's criteria for admissibility of aliens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   I also conclude that the President failed to make the necessary findings to support his invocation of authority under Section 1182(f). Section 1182(f) requires that the President \"find[ ]\" that entry of the aliens in question \"\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"917\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, Congress deliberately used the word \"find[ ]\" as opposed to \"deem\" or \"believe,\" a decision that implies that the President is required to \"base his [decision] on some fact\" not on mere \"opinion\" or \"guesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265601\" index=\"918\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/662/#p673\">\n    878 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   692-93 (citing 87 Cong. Rec. 5051 (1941) (statements of Rep. Jonkman and Rep. Jenkins)). Accordingly, an executive \"finding\" that supports the exercise of authority under Section 1182(f) must not be merely conclusory in nature, void of any substantive content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   The principal reason cited in the Proclamation for banning nearly every national of seven of the eight countries is that those countries lack adequate \"identity-management and information-sharing protocols and practices\" to provide the United States \"sufficient information to assess the risks\" that their nationals pose. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45,164. The Proclamation also states a diplomatic purpose to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing practices, and other\n   general \"foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   The Proclamation, however, makes no finding that any nationals from the specified countries,\n   <em>\n    by virtue of their nationality\n   </em>\n   , pose a risk to the United States. The Proclamation merely exclaims that the\n   <em>\n    countries\n   </em>\n   ' faulty protocols create a security risk for the United States. Nowhere in the Proclamation does the President claim that these\n   <em>\n    individuals\n   </em>\n   pose a detriment to the United States' interests because they are nationals of these particular countries. Further, with the exception of Venezuela,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 45,166, the Proclamation lacks any finding that these nationals are responsible for the unstable conditions in their respective countries. Essentially, the Proclamation suffers from the same deficiency as its predecessor: the Proclamation fails to find that the entry of these particular nationals would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   Nevertheless, the government seeks to justify the ban on the ground that it will serve as a bargaining chip to help elicit greater cooperation from the Designated Countries. This rationale, however, likewise fails to provide an analytical link to the banned nationals. The ability of the Proclamation to wield diplomatic pressure on the target countries is unrelated to the nationals'\n   <em>\n    entry\n   </em>\n   into the United States. That the Proclamation may further diplomatic goals has no association with whether the designated nationals' entry would be detrimental or injurious to the United States in some way. If any such connection between the stated diplomatic purpose and the identified nationals' entry does exist, it is nowhere to be found within the Proclamation's text. Accordingly, I conclude that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Proclamation fails to make a finding of detriment to the national interest sufficient to invoke Section 1182(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Finally, I consider the effect of the INA's anti-discrimination provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"919\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), on the President's authority to issue the Proclamation.

And I further concur in Chief Judge Gregory's and Judge Keenan's determinations that Plaintiffs have standing to raise their statutory claims and that those claims are otherwise justiciable. I write separately because I do not believe that resolving this case on constitutional grounds alone adequately serves all of the interests we must vindicate. In particular, the Proclamation's indefinite suspension on entry-which the majority correctly determines was \"driven by anti-Muslim bias,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 264-exceeds the authority Congress delegated to the President in the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \"Immigration Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1090\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , because it denies entry to a class of aliens based on invidious discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   Neither the dissenting opinion nor the Government has taken the position that the Immigration Act-or the Constitution, for that matter-permits the President to deny entry to a class of individuals defined by their race, sex, national origin, or religion solely on the basis of animus against that race, sex, nationality, or religion. On the contrary, during oral argument, the Government conceded that a presidential proclamation banning entry of aliens on the basis of invidious discrimination would exceed the President's authority under the Immigration Act and the Constitution. Oral Arg. Rec. 11:35-12:20 (conceding that the President lacks authority under the Immigration Act to ban men from entering the United States because \"under constitutional law you can't use forbidden traits as a proxy, you have to target the actual conduct that you are worried about\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   And the President never has disputed that his Proclamation banning entry of nationals of predominantly Muslim countries implements his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Again to the contrary, notwithstanding numerous efforts by his subordinates and attorneys to characterize the Proclamation as responding to legitimate national security risks posed by terrorists and countries that fail to maintain or share adequate information regarding their nationals, the President and his advisors repeatedly and consistently represented to the public that the Proclamation relies on national origin as a proxy for discriminating based on anti-Muslim animus.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 135, 168, 779, 791, 808-10, 815-20, 1497-1500, 1502-03. Indeed, the President repeatedly distanced himself from the non-discriminatory policy rationales of his subordinates upon which the Proclamation and the Government relies. J.A. 791, 832. Accordingly, this Court must decide\n   whether to accept\n   <em>\n    the President\n   </em>\n   's consistent characterization of\n   <em>\n    his Proclamation\n   </em>\n   as intended to invidiously discriminate against Muslims-and therefore hold that the Proclamation violates the law-or reject or ignore\n   <em>\n    the President\n   </em>\n   's explanation of\n   <em>\n    his Proclamation\n   </em>\n   -and therefore uphold the Proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   As my colleagues' opinions recognize, resolving that question implicates difficult questions regarding the carefully constructed constitutional allocation of powers within and among the three coordinate branches-and the degree of judicial deference that allocation of powers contemplates-as well as the judiciary's long-recognized obligation to give effect to the individual and collective rights set forth in the Constitution. Any decision the judiciary renders on the lawfulness of the President's Proclamation necessarily will display some lack of deference to the executive branch: If we uphold the Proclamation, as the dissent would have us do, we will be refusing to respect\n   <em>\n    the President's own stated purpose\n   </em>\n   in promulgating the Proclamation and\n   <em>\n    his position as the unitary head of the executive branch\n   </em>\n   , in favor of policy conclusions reached by his unelected subordinates-policy rationales with which the President has repeatedly expressed disagreement. By contrast, if we strike down the Proclamation, we will be refusing to give effect to the considered judgment of those subordinates-who are better positioned to address questions of national security than the judiciary-that the Proclamation advances legitimate, non-discriminatory interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Additionally, any decision the judiciary renders will implicate the due respect we must show to Congress. In particular, if we accept the President's repeated characterizations of his Proclamation as serving his goal of banning Muslims and simultaneously conclude that the Proclamation complies with the Immigration Act, we would necessarily conclude that Congress authorized the President to engage in invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or religion. Likewise, if we accept the Government's argument that the Immigration Act confers on the President unfettered discretion to deny entry to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   class of aliens-including classes defined solely on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or religion-then we would necessarily conclude that the President can nullify Congress's \"finely reticulated regulatory scheme governing the admission of foreign nationals.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawai'i v.

In particular, if we conclude that the Proclamation's indefinite ban on entry violates the Establishment Clause without addressing Plaintiffs' claim that the ban exceeds the President's authority under the Immigration Act, we will leave the impression that Congress may have authorized the President to encroach on deeply engrained constitutional rights by invidiously discriminating against a disfavored religious group-precisely what the due respect we must show to Congress's constitutional judgment forbids.

H.R. Rep. No. 100-882, at 19 (1988). By enacting specific provisions regarding the inadmissibility of aliens who are or have been engaged in terrorist activity, Congress sought to make clear that \"the definitions of 'terrorist activity' and 'engages in terrorist activity' must be applied on a case by case basis\" and that \"simple membership in any organization ... is not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   an absolute bar to admission to the United States\"-whether under the President's general authority to bar entry or otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. If Congress has deemed it unlawful for the President to absolutely bar the entry of aliens who\n   <em>\n    are members of an organization\n   </em>\n   that includes some members who engage in terrorism, it defies logic that Congress delegated to the President in Section 1182(f) the far broader power to absolutely bar the entry of aliens who\n   <em>\n    happen to have been born in a particular country\n   </em>\n   , within the borders of which some individuals have engaged in terrorism.

In particular, Congress identified specific criteria, which the Proclamation expressly incorporates, relating to countries' data-management and information-sharing practices-such as usage of electronic passports, reporting of lost or stolen passports, and sharing of information on whether a prospective entrant poses a threat to national security-that the executive branch should consider in determining whether a country's nationals should be allowed to enter the United States without a visa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1187(c).

As evidenced by Section 1152(a)(1), disregarding national origin in selecting which immigrants to admit to the United States remains a core principle of United States immigration policy. Far from evidencing \"any clear indication\" that Congress intended the President to have the authority to exercise his Section 1182(f) powers based on invidious discrimination, the \"object and policy\" of the Immigration Act suggest that Congress\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   intend to grant the President unbridled authority to engage in invidious discrimination when deciding whether and to what extent to suspend alien entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   The Government points to a number of orders promulgated by Presidents pursuant to their authority under Section 1182(f) as evidence that that statutory provision authorizes the President to engage in national-origin-based discrimination. But the previous orders the Government cites materially differ from the Proclamation, in that they did not suspend the entry of classes of aliens based on national origin alone, let alone use national origin as a proxy to suspend the entry of a class of aliens based on another invidiously discriminatory basis, such as religion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proclamation 8693 (July 24, 2011) (suspending the entry of aliens subject to travel bans issued by the United Nations Security Council's resolution barring member nations from permitting the entry of individuals who threaten peace in various nations); Proclamation 8342 (Jan. 22, 2009) (suspending the entry of senior government officials \"who have impeded their governments' antitrafficking efforts, have failed to implement their governments' antitrafficking laws and policies, or who otherwise bear responsibility for their governments' failures to take steps recognized internationally as appropriate to combat trafficking in persons\"); Proclamation 6958 (Nov. 22, 1996) (suspending the entry of \"members of the Government of Sudan, officials of that Government, and members of the Sudanese armed forces\" based on the Sudanese government's harboring of individuals who attempted to assassinate the Egyptian President in Ethiopia, in violation of Ethiopian sovereignty); Executive Order No. 12,807 (May 24, 1992) (suspending the entry of \"undocumented aliens [entering the United States] by sea\" during the mass exodus of Haitian nationals fleeing a military coup, often in dangerous and overcrowded sea vessels); Proclamation 5887 (Oct. 22, 1988) (suspending the entry of \"officers and employees\" of the Nicaraguan government as nonimmigrants to the United States based on the Nicaraguan government's \"unjustified expulsion\" of American diplomats and \"long-standing ... suppression of free expression and press and support of subversive activities throughout Central America\"); Proclamation 5829 (June 10, 1988) (suspending the entry of \"Panamanian nationals ... who formulate or implement the policies of Manuel Antonio Noriega and Manuel Solis Palma\" due to those officials' act of \"preventing the legitimate government ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   from restoring order and democracy\" to Panama).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   Of the proclamations and executive orders cited by the Government, President Reagan's suspension on the entry of Cuban nationals as immigrants comes closest to a nationality-based suspension on alien entry.

But that executive action was not challenged as a violation of either Section 1182(f) or Section 1152(a)(1), and therefore the judiciary never had the opportunity to address whether the order complied with those provisions or the Constitution.

Accordingly, the Proclamation's ban on entry-which this Court finds was borne of the President's animus against Muslims and his intent to rely on national origin as a proxy to give effect to that animus-exceeds the authority Congress conferred on the President in the Immigration Act.

In particular, Chief Judge Gregory would hold that, \" \u00a7 1182(f) is a gap-filling provision that empowers the President to exclude (1) foreign nationals whose individual conduct or affiliation makes their entry harmful to national interests for reasons unanticipated by Congress and (2) foreign nationals in response to a foreign-affairs or national-security exigency.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 296. Chief Judge Gregory's conclusion as to the full scope of the authority conferred on the President by the Immigration Act to deny entry to classes of aliens may prove correct. But I decline to join his opinion's statutory analysis because we need not define the full scope of the President's authority under the Immigration Act to resolve Plaintiffs' statutory claim. Rather, it is sufficient that we find that whatever authority the Immigration Act delegates to the President to deny entry to classes of aliens, that authority does not encompass invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   Additionally, in rendering his conclusion as to the full scope of authority conferred on the President by Section 1182(f), Chief Judge Gregory's opinion addresses complex and unresolved constitutional questions regarding the allocation of authority over immigration regulation between Congress and the President, the scope of Congress's authority to delegate its powers, and the President's inherent power to control\n   and protect our borders.

The majority opinion relies on those statements not to \"second-guess U.S. foreign policy,\"\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 353, but to determine\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   foreign policy the President intended his Proclamation to serve: the purpose on the face of the Proclamation of minimizing national security risks posed by countries that fail to maintain and share adequate information regarding their nationals-a policy from which the President repeatedly sought to distance himself, J.A. 791, 832-\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the President's repeatedly stated purpose of banning Muslims. Only after using the President's statements to ascertain his foreign policy purpose behind the Proclamation's suspension on entry-to invidiously discriminate against Muslims-did this Court invalidate that policy. Importantly, the Government concedes that denying entry to a class of aliens based on invidious discrimination does not comply with the Constitution, Oral Arg. Rec. 11:35-12:20, meaning that to the extent this Court \"second-guesses\" the President's foreign policy determination set forth in the Proclamation, it does so in accordance with the Government's own understanding of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   By seeking to determine the President's true purpose behind the Proclamation's ban on entry, the majority opinion arguably more effectively respects the President's policy judgments because it seeks to determine and evaluate the President's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   policy determination, not the policy rationale of the President's unelected subordinates and attorneys, with which the\n   President has repeatedly expressed disagreement. To be sure, this Court ultimately concludes that the President's actual purpose behind the Proclamation's suspension on entry contravenes the Constitution-a legal conclusion with which the Government appears to agree. Oral Arg. Rec. 11:35-12:20. But we do so by considering the policy the President\n   <em>\n    actually sought to advance\n   </em>\n   , not by considering policy rationales with which the President has expressed disagreement. In doing so, we afford the President the respect to which he is entitled as the unitary executive he is-the constitutional officer with sole and final authority to establish executive branch foreign policy and to deny entry to classes of aliens under Section 1182(f), in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Failing to ascertain and address\n   <em>\n    the President's actual purpose\n   </em>\n   in promulgating his Proclamation-as Judge Niemeyer proposes we do-would raise other constitutional problems.

Voters would be confused as to whether the Proclamation advances the President's promise to ban entry of Muslims, as the President has proclaimed, or is intended to prevent entry of aliens from countries that fail to maintain or share adequate information regarding their nationals, as the Government and the Proclamation claims. Voters, therefore, would not know which policy to hold the President accountable for at the polls. Concerns over the blurring lines of political accountability are particularly salient here because the President has repeatedly-and publicly-distanced himself from the foreign policy rationale that the Government and Judge Niemeyer would rely on to uphold the Proclamation. J.A. 791, 832.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   Rather than addressing the President's actual purpose in promulgating his Proclamation, Judge Niemeyer appeals to facts that do not exist and then draws upon those facts to argue that the majority opinion undertakes a forbidden intrusion on our constitutional structure. In particular, Judge Niemeyer claims that \"if the United States were to enter into a state of war with a foreign nation or were attacked by foreigners, their preferred construction would wreak havoc by precluding entry restrictions that would be necessary in such a time of crisis.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 370. But those are not the facts of this case. Congress has not declared war against any of the countries subject to the ban on entry. Nor have any of those countries attacked the United States. Accordingly, the scope of the President's authority under Section 1182(f) or the Constitution to exclude foreigners in a time of war or in response to an attack is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   Under the undisputed facts of this case, Judge Niemeyer's separate opinion fashions a legal barrier to the consideration of evidence establishing the President's goal of invidiously discriminating against Muslims. Put differently, Judge Niemeyer relies on a novel evidentiary rule to \"reconstruct\" the facts of this case so as to elide the difficult facts the majority correctly confronts. To that end, applying his own evidentiary rule, Judge Niemeyer nowhere addresses, for example, statements by the drafter of the first iteration of the travel ban, which explained that the President's purpose behind banning nationals from the predominantly Muslim countries-nearly all of which are subject to the Proclamation's indefinite suspension on entry-was to discriminate against Muslims. J.A. 808-10,\n   815-16. Judge Niemeyer nowhere addresses the President's repeated statements expressing disagreement with the policy rationales upon which the Government and his separate opinion rely.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 791. Judge Niemeyer nowhere addresses the numerous anti-Muslim statements made by the President before\n   <em>\n    and after\n   </em>\n   he took office, many of which the President directly tied to the travel ban.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 135, 311, 806, 814-20. And Judge Niemeyer nowhere addresses the President's retweeting of anti-Muslim videos created by an extremist political party that opposes Islam, and the Administration's express connection of those retweets to the Proclamation's ban on entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 1497-99, 1502-03, 1508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   Thus, to avoid the result that inexorably follows from the legal rule that he concedes-that Section 1182(f) does not authorize the President to engage in invidious discrimination-and the application of that rule to the undisputed facts-that the President promulgated the Proclamation to advance his goal of banning Muslims-Judge Niemeyer creates a novel rule of evidence that permits the disregarding of undisputed facts. This \"result-oriented\" approach-under which the judiciary picks and chooses among facts and law to achieve a desired outcome, rather than confronts the facts and law as presented by the case-bears the hallmarks of what is widely decried as judicial activism.\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

But, as explained above, my conclusion that Section 1182(f) does not authorize invidious discrimination flows from both (1) Section 1182(f) 's express requirement that the President find that admission of any class of excluded aliens would be \"detrimental to the interests of the United States\" and (2) the numerous specific bases for denying entry to aliens set forth by Congress in Section 1182, none of which authorize denying entry to classes of aliens based on invidious discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.C.1. And even if the statutory language of Section 1182 did not support my construction, the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions read \"implicit limitation[s]\" into immigration statutes to avoid constitutional concerns.\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , 533 U.S. at 689,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"1395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p689\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Witkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160151\" index=\"1396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/194/#p199\">\n    353 U.S. at 199, 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160151\" index=\"1397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/194/#p199\">\n    77 S.Ct. 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Niemeyer does not address, much less distinguish, these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   Judge Niemeyer also suggests that holding that Section 1182(f) does not authorize the President to engage in invidious discrimination would impermissibly\n   \"create constitutionally based rights in aliens excludable under \u00a7 1182(f)... when they never heretofore had such rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 372. Again, Judge Niemeyer misstates the approach I take in construing Section 1182(f). Contrary to his characterization, I recognize that aliens \"can claim few, if any, rights under the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.B. I nonetheless conclude that interpreting Section 1182(f) as authorizing invidious discrimination raises serious constitutional concerns because \"when the President exercises [his authority to exclude aliens] based solely on animus against a particular race, sex, nationality, or religion, there is a grave risk-indeed, likelihood-that\n   <em>\n    the constitutional harm will redound to individuals who can claim constitutional rights\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). These rights include not being barred from marrying the partner of one's choice based solely on the partner's race, nationality, or religion, and not having one's race or religion be the subject of state-sanctioned discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   My interpretation of Section 1182(f), therefore, is grounded in the rights of citizens and lawful residents, not aliens, as Judge Niemeyer claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   At bottom, the approach taken by Judge Niemeyer is the same approach embraced by the Government to avoid the outcome that flows from application of the undisputed law to the President's undisputed statements of discriminatory intent. Just as the Government would have us ignore the President's very words demonstrating his goal of invidiously discriminating against Muslims, Judge Niemeyer would have us ignore as irrelevant the undisputed legal conclusion that Section 1182(f) does not authorize invidious discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   The Government seeks the normative result of what \"ought to be\" rather than what \"is.\" by displacing the President's undisputed policy goal with the policy judgments of his unelected subordinates. Likewise, following the evidentiary approach outlined by Judge Niemeyer creatively interjects the onus of national security so as to avoid confronting the more difficult question that arises from the undisputed facts establishing that invidious discrimination against Muslims lies at the heart of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   In conclusion, invidious \"discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life.

Indeed, viewing the Proclamation in its most favorable light, that is the precisely the rationale underlying the indefinite suspension on entry. Setting aside the question of whether that\n   <em>\n    factual finding\n   </em>\n   is true, or even reasonable-which is, at best, highly debatable given the 150 million people in the predominantly Muslim countries subject to the suspension on entry and the 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide-that is precisely the inference that the Framers of the Constitution and the Reconstruction Amendments concluded\n   was impermissible as a matter of\n   <em>\n    constitutional law\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n    at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n    65 S.Ct. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Murphy, J., dissenting). In particular, classifying individuals based solely on their race, sex, nationality, or religion-and then relying on those classifications to discriminate against a particular race, sex, nationality, or religion-necessarily results in placing special burdens on individuals who lack any moral responsibility, a result the Framers deemed antithetical to core democratic principles and destabilizing to our Republic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Significantly, the Government does not dispute that proposition, conceding that the President would violate the Constitution if he banned entry of men-notwithstanding that as a matter of statistical fact men disproportionately commit acts of terrorism-because \"under constitutional law you can't use forbidden traits [like gender] as a proxy, you have to target\n   <em>\n    the actual conduct you are worried about\n   </em>\n   .\" Oral Arg.

Our constitutional structure forbids such intrusion by the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   The President, acting on authority granted him by enactments of Congress and by Article II of the Constitution, issued Proclamation No. 9645 on September 24, 2017. The Proclamation imposed restrictions on the entry of aliens from eight countries that, following a comprehensive, global review, were found to have inadequate practices for providing information to U.S. immigration officials and to present a heightened risk of terrorism. The absence of such restrictions, the President determined, \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   The district court, looking behind the text of the Proclamation, concluded that the restrictions on entry were likely to be unenforceable because they were motivated by religious animus, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, and because they contravened a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") prohibiting nationality-based discrimination in the \"issuance of ... immigrant visa[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Accordingly, the court entered a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the Proclamation, subject to exceptions. It also \"decline[d] to stay [its] ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   Following the government's appeal to this court, the government filed a motion for an emergency stay of the injunction pending appeal, but a majority of our court failed to act on the motion. The Supreme Court, however, issued a stay pending review by this court and ultimately by it, by order dated December 4, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   Without any adjustment of position based on the Supreme Court's issuance of the stay, the majority again marches straightway to its desired result. In concluding that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause, the majority simply reiterates the reasoning of the district court and its own reasoning from its decision on Executive Order 13,780, dated March 6, 2017, deeming irrelevant the significant differences between that order and the Proclamation, as well as the Supreme Court's vacatur of that decision. Without accepting the Proclamation's stated interest in national security, which the Proclamation explains in detail, the majority concludes that, based on comments made by the President during the presidential campaign and afterwards, the Proclamation cannot be enforced because it is a pretext for religious discrimination. In addition, the separate opinions supporting the majority's judgment construe the applicable INA provisions to have limitations not contained in the statutory text and then hold that the Proclamation violated those limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   The opinions of the district court and those supporting the majority's judgment are demonstrably wrong in virtually every material respect. They fail to recognize and address more than a century of jurisprudence explaining the deference federal courts owe to the political branches with respect to decisions to grant or deny foreign nationals entry into this country; they ignore and again fail to address the plain language of the Administrative Procedure Act on which the plaintiffs rely to allege a cause of action that it does not provide; they misconstrue the INA, effectively rewriting it to accord with their own policy choices and then concluding that the President violated the statute as so revised; they apply a novel legal rule that provides for the use of campaign-trail statements to recast later official acts of the President; and they utterly subvert longstanding Supreme Court precedents on the Establishment Clause.

Procl. \u00a7 1(c). That baseline, which was developed by DHS in consultation with intelligence and foreign-affairs officials from other executive-branch Departments, included three categories of criteria germane to \"support[ing] the United States Government's ability to confirm the identity of individuals seeking entry ... and ... assess[ing] whether they are a security or public-safety threat\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-505\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Identity-management information\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-506\">\n   The United States expects foreign governments to provide the information needed to determine whether individuals seeking benefits under the immigration laws are who they claim to be. The identity-management information category focuses on the integrity of documents required for travel to the United States. The criteria assessed in this category include whether the country issues electronic passports embedded with data to enable confirmation of identity, reports lost and stolen passports to appropriate entities, and makes available upon request identity-related information not included in its passports.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-507\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) National security and public-safety information.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-508\">\n   The United States expects foreign governments to provide information about whether persons who seek entry to this country pose national security or public-safety risks. The criteria assessed in this category include whether the country makes available, directly or indirectly, known or suspected terrorist and criminal-history information upon request, whether the country provides passport and national-identity document exemplars, and whether the country impedes the United States Government's receipt of information about passengers and crew traveling to the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-509\">\n   <em>\n    (iii) National security and public-safety risk assessment.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-510\">\n   The national security and public-safety risk assessment category focuses on national security risk indicators. The criteria assessed in this category include whether the country is a known or potential terrorist safe haven, whether it is a participant in the Visa Waiver Program established under section 217 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187, that meets all of its requirements, and whether it regularly fails to receive its nationals subject to final orders of removal from the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   The Proclamation then described how DHS had \"collected data on the performance of all foreign governments\" relative to the baseline, Procl. \u00a7 1(d), and evaluated those data to determine that 16 countries were \"inadequate\" with respect to their identity-management protocols, information-sharing practices, and security-risk factors and that another 31 countries were \"at risk\" of becoming inadequate,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1(e). It also explained how the State Department thereafter followed up on DHS's evaluation by \"conduct[ing] a 50-day engagement period to encourage all foreign governments, not just the 47 identified as either 'inadequate' or 'at risk,' to improve their performance with respect to the baseline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1(f). As a result of that engagement, many foreign governments improved their performance significantly. For example, 29 provided DHS with exemplars of their travel documents, and 11 agreed to share information on known or suspected terrorists.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614736,12614737,12614738,12614742,12614743\" index=\"1484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   As the Proclamation noted, following the engagement period, DHS concluded that the governments of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen\n   remained \"inadequate\" so as to warrant restrictions on the ability of their nationals to enter the United States. Procl. \u00a7 1(g). Iraq was likewise deemed \"inadequate,\" but DHS concluded that entry restrictions with respect to Iraqi nationals were not warranted because, among other reasons, of the Iraqi government's \"close cooperative relationship\" with the United States and the significant presence of American military forces there.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . DHS recommended instead that Iraqi nationals seeking entry be subject to \"additional scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614736,12614737,12614738,12614742,12614743\" index=\"1485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Separately, DHS determined that although the government of Somalia \"generally satisfie[d] the information-sharing requirements of the baseline,\" its inability to cooperate with the United States in certain respects and the terrorist threats within its territory \"present[ed] special circumstances\" justifying the imposition of entry restrictions on its nationals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614736,12614737,12614738,12614742,12614743\" index=\"1486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(i). DHS thus submitted another formal report to the President on September 15, 2017, which recommended that he limit the entry into the United States of foreign nationals from eight countries-Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614736,12614737,12614738,12614742,12614743\" index=\"1487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/275/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1(h)-(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   The Proclamation stated that the President evaluated DHS's recommendations with the aid of various members of his Cabinet and White House staff, including the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Procl. \u00a7 1(h), and ultimately decided to impose certain restrictions on the entry of individuals from the eight countries,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12614736,12614737,12614738,12614742,12614743\" index=\"1488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/275/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(h)-(i). In doing so, the President expressly invoked \"the authority vested in [him] by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,\" including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and 1185(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Preamble. The Proclamation stated that, in the President's judgment, the restrictions were necessary to \"prevent the entry of those foreign nationals about whom the [Government] lacks sufficient information\"; to \"elicit improved identity-management and information-sharing protocols and practices from foreign governments\"; and to otherwise \"advance [the] foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives\" of the Nation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(h)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   The restrictions, as set forth in Section 2 of the Proclamation, vary by country based on the findings made as to that country. Three countries-Iran, North Korea, and Syria-were found inadequate under the DHS baseline, and the entry of all of their nationals, either as immigrants or nonimmigrants, was suspended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Procl. \u00a7 2(b)(ii), (d)(ii), (e)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three other countries-Chad, Libya, and Yemen-were found to be inadequate with respect to the DHS baseline but were nonetheless considered to be \"valuable counterterrorism partner[s],\" and therefore the Proclamation\n   suspended only \"[t]he entry into the United States of [their] nationals ... as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on business (B-1), tourist (B-2), and business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2(a)(ii), (c)(ii), (g)(ii). Because Somalia generally satisfied the requirements of the DHS baseline but was found to have identity-management deficiencies and to be a terrorist safe haven,\n   <em>\n    see id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2(h)(i), the Proclamation suspended immigrant entry for its nationals and provided for \"additional scrutiny\" of those seeking to enter as nonimmigrants,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(h)(ii). Finally, for Venezuela, the Proclamation adopted more \"focus[ed]\" entry restrictions-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , suspending the entry of certain government officials (and their family members) on nonimmigrant business and tourist visas-that respond to the country's refusal to fully cooperate on immigration issues while accounting for the fact that the United States is nevertheless capable of independently verifying the identity of Venezuelan entrants through other sources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   The Proclamation's restrictions were made applicable only to foreign nationals of the eight countries who were outside the United States and who did not have a valid visa or comparable travel document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Procl. \u00a7 3(a);\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 3(b) (enumerating exceptions to the Proclamation's entry restrictions).

Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   Shortly after the Proclamation issued and before the effective date of many of its provisions, 23 individuals and 7 organizations challenged it in three civil actions (later consolidated), seeking injunctive relief, including preliminary injunctive relief. They named as defendants President Trump, several Cabinet officers and other high-ranking officials, DHS, the Department of State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   The individual plaintiffs are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have one or more relatives who are nationals of one of the eight countries subject to the Proclamation's entry restrictions. These plaintiffs seek to have their relatives, who are currently abroad, enter the country on a U.S. visa. Although they and their relatives are at varying stages in the visa issuance process, many have not received a valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   Four of the organizational plaintiffs-the Middle East Studies Association of North America (\"MESA\"), the Yemeni-American Merchants Association (\"YAMA\"), Iranian Alliances Across Borders (\"IAAB\"), and the Iranian Students' Foundation (\"ISF\")-primarily organize events for their constituencies or otherwise advocate on their behalf. MESA represents more than 2,400 students and faculty around the world who focus on Middle Eastern studies; YAMA protects its members from harassment and assists them with immigration issues; IAAB organizes youth camps and conferences for individuals who are part of the Iranian diaspora; and ISF, an affiliate of IAAB, convenes events for approximately 30 Iranian-American students at the University of Maryland. The three remaining organizational plaintiffs-the International Refugee Assistance Project (\"IRAP\"), HIAS, Inc., and the Arab-American Association of New York (\"AAANY\")-primarily provide legal services to clients. IRAP provides legal services to displaced persons; HIAS serves refugees by, among other things, assisting them with resettlement; and AAANY provides legal and other services to the Arab-American and Arab immigrant community in New York City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   The district court, on the request of the plaintiffs, ordered expedited briefing and argument on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and on October 17, 2017, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion in substantial part, entering a nationwide preliminary injunction based upon a 91-page opinion. The court, concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that the Proclamation violated the INA and the Establishment Clause, enjoined enforcement of the Proclamation's entry restrictions as to foreign nationals-except those from North Korea and Venezuela-who have \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   In its opinion, the district court rejected the government's arguments that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue and that a decision of the political branches to exclude aliens is generally not subject to judicial review. Regarding the latter point, the court explained that because the plaintiffs had not challenged \"individual visa decisions by consular officers, but the overarching travel ban policy imposed by the Proclamation,\" the rule of nonreviewability did not apply. Accordingly, it proceeded to address the merits of the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   As to the INA, the court determined that, while the plaintiffs had failed to show that the Proclamation exceeded the scope of authority granted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), which empowers the President to suspend the \"entry\" of aliens \"as immigrants or nonimmigrants\" for \"such period[s] as he shall deem necessary,\" they nonetheless showed that they were likely to succeed on their claim that the Proclamation violated the INA's prohibition on nationality-based discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). The court acknowledged that denying entry to aliens based on their nationality might be permissible in certain circumstances, \"such as during a specific urgent national crisis or public health emergency,\" but it concluded that, because the Proclamation's entry restrictions were \"effectively ... permanent,\" they were \"the equivalent of a ban on issuing immigrant visas based on\n   nationality\" and thus violated \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   As to the plaintiffs' Establishment Clause claims, the district court agreed that its analysis was controlled by\n   <em>\n    Kleindienst v.

While the district court acknowledged that the Proclamation had at least one facially legitimate purpose-\"to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people\"-it held that the plaintiffs had made a \"particularized showing of bad faith\" on the part of the President and thus it was entitled to \"look behind\" the Proclamation's stated rationale and conduct a \"traditional constitutional analysis\" of the plaintiffs' claims under the Establishment Clause. To conduct this analysis, the court relied principally on the President's statements from campaign rallies and on Twitter, concluding that the Proclamation stood in the \"shadow\" of the Administration's two previous executive orders, which had been held by it and other lower courts as likely violating the Establishment Clause, and that nothing in the Proclamation or the interagency process leading up to its promulgation had sufficiently \"cured\" the \"taint\" of those earlier orders. At bottom, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to show that the primary purpose of the Proclamation was to express \"animus\" towards Muslims and that therefore it likely violated the Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   From the district court's entry of the preliminary injunction, the government filed this appeal.

There, the Court considered a suit by a U.S. citizen who alleged that the government violated the Due Process Clause by denying her husband's visa application without adequate explanation, providing only a citation to the statutory provision under which the visa was denied. Justice Kennedy, writing for himself and Justice Alito to provide the fourth and fifth votes in favor of the government,\n   stated that \"[t]he reasoning and the holding in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   control here\" and that\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's reasoning \"has particular force in the area of national security.\"\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2140 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). He concluded that \"respect for the political branches' broad power over the creation and administration of the immigration system\" meant that, because the government had provided Din with a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for its action, Din had no viable constitutional claim.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   The holding of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   ineluctably requires that we reject the district court's construct of it. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   , Congress delegated broad power to the executive branch to regulate the entry of foreign nationals.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(28)(D)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   1182 (d)(3)(A) (1970)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The plaintiffs in each case challenged the Executive's exercise of that discretion, claiming violations of their individual First Amendment rights. Thus, just as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   rejected the plaintiffs' challenge because, even assuming a constitutional violation lurked beneath the surface of the Executive's implementation of its statutory authority, the reasons the Executive had provided were \"facially legitimate and bona fide,\" so must we reject this similar challenge today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   The plaintiffs provide no coherent basis for their assertion that their claims can escape the force of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   . They do argue that\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's holding does not apply to claims under the Establishment Clause, but they are unable to point to any case in which the Supreme Court has ever suggested the existence of such a limitation. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   expressly stated that legitimate First Amendment claims could not override the political branches' authority to exclude aliens, and, of course, the Establishment Clause is a component of the First Amendment. Absent any case supporting plaintiffs' position, we are not now at liberty-nor was the district court-to craft out of whole cloth exceptions to controlling Supreme Court precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   Not to be deterred, the district court reconstructed\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's clear holding, asserting that \"if there is a particularized showing of bad faith, a court should then 'look behind' the action to evaluate its justification.\" Thus, rather than determining\n   <em>\n    from the face of the Proclamation\n   </em>\n   whether the reasons given for the entry restrictions were legitimate and bona fide, which would preclude a \"look behind\" it for extrinsic evidence of bad faith, the court looked behind it\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   to conclude that the Proclamation was not bona fide. With this twist of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   , the court then reviewed candidate Trump's campaign statements, as well as his later statements and tweets, and concluded that the primary purpose of Executive Order 13,780 and Proclamation 9645 was \"to effect the equivalent of a Muslim ban,\" justifying the plaintiffs' allegation that the \"Proclamation is not bona fide.\" The court stated that even though the Proclamation is on its face legitimate and provides reasons rooted in national security, because the plaintiffs have \"plausibly alleged\" bad faith, it was no longer bound to defer to the Proclamation's stated purpose. It thus casually dismissed the controlling principles of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. And the majority opinion adopts the district court's approach in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   If the district court's understanding, as well as the majority's, were shared by the Supreme Court, the results in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fiallo\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   would have been different, because in each of those cases, the plaintiffs alleged bad faith with at least as much particularity as do the plaintiffs here. In\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   , the allegations were such that Justice Marshall, writing in dissent, observed\n   that \"[e]ven the briefest peek behind the Attorney General's reason for refusing a waiver in this case would reveal that it is a sham.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"1562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    408 U.S. at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"1563\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Marshall, J., dissenting). In\n   <em>\n    Fiallo\n   </em>\n   , Justice Marshall, again writing in dissent, pointed to the fact that the statute in question relied on \"invidious classifications.\" 430 U.S. at 810,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"1564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p792\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Marshall, J., dissenting). And in\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs argued that the consular decision should be reviewed because it fell within the \"limited circumstances where the government provides no reason, or where the reason on its face is illegitimate.\" Brief for Respondent at 31,\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"1565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2139\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 13-1402),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20179409\">\n    2015 WL 179409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the opinions supporting the majority's judgment do the same, even to a greater extent, blurring the role of the Executive in the context of foreign policy and its role in executing domestic law. Ignoring these realities of our constitutional structure, these opinions elevate the judgment of Article III courts over that of the President, violating deeply seated separation of powers principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   B.

As the court in\n   <em>\n    Saavedra Bruno\n   </em>\n   explained, \u00a7 702(1) 's recognition of \"other limitations\" on the scope of APA review reflects Congress's intent to maintain longstanding prudential limits confining the judiciary to its proper role in our constitutional system, such as the political question doctrine and related areas of the \"law of unreviewability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633617,3671868\" index=\"1587\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/1153/\">\n    197 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). And at the time Congress enacted \u00a7 702(1), the Supreme Court had for 70 years adhered to its position that the exclusion of aliens abroad is a fundamental act of sovereignty committed to the political branches. Thus, rather than abrogating that position, the APA affirmatively adopted it as an internal limitation on the scope of review of agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-560\">\n   The district court attempted to bypass this unreviewability doctrine by limiting it to \"individual visa decisions by consular officers,\" as opposed to a \"broader policy on alien entry,\" like the one applied in the Proclamation. But in doing so, as noted above, the court failed to recognize that the nonreviewability of visa determinations by consular officers stems from the antecedent principle articulated time and again in the Supreme Court's immigration cases: that determining who may enter the Nation's borders-and who may not-bears directly on our national sovereignty, is an inherently political judgment, and has accordingly been entrusted by the Constitution to the political branches. Moreover, the effect of the district court's conclusion would be untenable. A court would accord absolute deference to decisions of consular officers-subordinate officials who implement executive and legislative authorities, but are far removed from their source-while permitting judges to interfere with the decisions of Congress and the President regarding the same subject. This would upend the settled understanding of the separation of powers, and with it over 100 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-561\">\n   III. INA Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-562\">\n   On the merits, the plaintiffs contend that the Proclamation exceeds the scope of authority granted by \u00a7\u00a7 1182(f) and 1185(a) or otherwise violates them. They also contend that the Proclamation's restrictions on the\n   <em>\n    entry\n   </em>\n   of nationals from eight countries violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1588\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), which prohibits discrimination because of, among other things, nationality\n   <em>\n    in the issuance of immigrant visas\n   </em>\n   . They argue that the Proclamation effectively eviscerates \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) 's prohibition against discrimination by using the authority conferred by \u00a7\u00a7 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1) to bar the entry of aliens using the visa system, based on their nationality. According to the plaintiffs, the Proclamation thus \"overrides congressional judgments\" imbedded in the INA, especially regarding visa issuance. In a similar vein, they contend that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) constricts the authority granted under \u00a7 1182(f) and that, to the extent that the two provisions conflict, \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) controls, as they maintain, because it was the later and more specific enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-563\">\n   Explaining the repeated use by past Presidents of \u00a7\u00a7 1182(f) and 1185(a) to ban a particular country's nationals from entry into the United States, whether possessing visas or not-for example, President Carter's orders authorizing the imposition of entry restrictions on Iranian nationals, Exec.

Oral Argument at 1:34:53 (\"I don't think any nationality bans are valid\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1:35:42 (\"There's a way to read [the Reagan and Carter orders as] in harmony [with \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) ], [but] I actually do believe\n   that \u00a7 1152(a)... prohibits nationality discrimination\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-564\">\n   The district court concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Proclamation violated \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A), construing that provision as a limitation on the President's power to suspend alien entry, but that they would not likely succeed on their claims based on \u00a7 1182(f), even though it concluded that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) constricts the President's authority under \u00a7 1182(f). The court stated that it would be \"meaningless\" for a foreign national to receive a visa only to subsequently be deemed inadmissible and noted further that the entry of immigrants and the issuance of visas \"usually go hand-in-hand.\" The court also found it problematic that the Proclamation had no \"specified end date and no requirement of renewal,\" asserting that nationality-based denials of entry of \"limited duration\" would be less likely to discriminate in violation of \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A). The court acknowledged, however, that a President could \"arguably\" deny the entry of all nationals from a particular country under \u00a7 1182(f) -even with the effect of precluding immigrant visas based on nationality-if the authority is exercised \"during a specific urgent national crisis or public health emergency.\" It gave as an example President Reagan's 1986 decision to bar the entry of Cuban nationals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-565\">\n   The government contends that the district court erred in reading \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) to override the President's distinct authority under \u00a7\u00a7 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1), \"especially in light of the statutory deference afforded to the President, contrary historical practice, and serious constitutional concerns raised by that interpretation.\" It argues that, as a matter of statutory construction, the two provisions can be read to function harmoniously when one recognizes that \u00a7 1182(f) authorizes barring the\n   <em>\n    entry\n   </em>\n   of aliens based on nationality, whereas \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) bars nationality discrimination\n   <em>\n    in the issuance of immigrant visas\n   </em>\n   -two distinct concepts. It points out that, under the structure of the INA, even persons having visas can still be barred from entry into the United States, as all entering aliens must satisfy the requirements\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   for a visa\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   for entry. Moreover, it notes that in enacting \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A), Congress intended to eliminate the country-quota system as to those aliens otherwise eligible for visas, \"not to modify the eligibility criteria for admission or to limit pre-existing provisions ... addressing entry,\" such as \u00a7 1182(f). Opening Brief at 36 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 89-745, at 12 (1965) (\"Under this [new] system, selection\n   <em>\n    from among those eligible to be immigrants\n   </em>\n   ... will be based upon the existence of a close family relationship to U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens and not on the existing basis of birthplace or ancestry\") (emphasis added) and S. Rep. No. 89-748, at 13 (1965) (similar) ). Finally, the government points to the use of \u00a7\u00a7 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1) by past Presidents to exclude nationals from particular countries, such as President Carter's 1979 and 1980 Executive Orders restricting Iranians and President Reagan's 1985 Proclamation barring Cubans, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-566\">\n   I conclude, as to the plaintiffs' \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) claim, that the district court's interpretation of the INA should be rejected as it creates conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) and 1182(f) when none had previously existed. A more complete reading of the INA demonstrates that the two provisions can be construed to give full effect to both without conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-567\">\n   Under the INA, to obtain admission to the United States, a foreign national must normally possess a valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1592\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201181\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   1182(a)(7), 1203. Procuring either type of visa typically entails an in-person interview and requires a favorable determination by consular officers from the Department of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7\u00a7 1201(a)(1), 1202(h), 1204;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1593\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.62\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But holding a valid visa does not guarantee a right of entry into this country. Rather, the INA requires that a visa holder traveling to the United States must\n   <em>\n    also be deemed admissible\n   </em>\n   upon arriving at a port of entry. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-568\">\n   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien,\n   <em>\n    to whom a visa ... has been issued\n   </em>\n   , to be\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   [to] the United States, if, upon arrival at a port of entry in the United States, he is found to be\n   <em>\n    inadmissible\n   </em>\n   under this chapter, or any other provision of law. The substance of this subsection shall appear upon every visa application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-569\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1594\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (emphasis added). Thus delineating the concepts of\n   <em>\n    admissibility\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    visa issuance\n   </em>\n   , the INA provides discrete application and criteria for each.\n   <em>\n    Every\n   </em>\n   alien must be admissible to come lawfully within the borders of the United States, and admissibility is a requirement\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   of the requirements for obtaining a visa. Moreover, any restriction on admissibility applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   immigrants and nonimmigrants, whereas the requirements for obtaining a visa must be satisfied through the process specific to applying for either an immigrant or a nonimmigrant visa. By its plain terms, \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) applies\n   <em>\n    solely to immigrant visa issuance\n   </em>\n   , and it does not include the word \"entry\" or \"admissibility.\" Conversely, \u00a7 1182(f) gives the President authority to \"suspend\n   <em>\n    the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). As a consequence, if an alien is not admissible under \u00a7 1182 -including \u00a7 1182(f) by reason of a President's proclamation-the provisions on obtaining a visa, including \u00a7 1152(a), never come into play. To read the restrictions in \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) as constraining the authority conferred on the President by \u00a7 1182(f) would fail to recognize the separate and distinct roles of the two provisions, with the effect that the President would be prohibited from suspending entry of a specified class of aliens-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    those from a particular country\n   </em>\n   -contrary to the clear text of \u00a7 1182(f).

The opinions in support of the majority's judgment do the same. For instance, Chief Judge Gregory concludes that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A)\"controls and limits whatever authority the President has under \u00a7 1182(f)\" and therefore that the Proclamation violates \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) because it \"operates by categorically denying the issuance of\n   <em>\n    visas\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 304 (emphasis added). Judge Keenan states similarly, construing the provisions as being \"intertwined\" such that they are in tension with one another and then concluding that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A)\"governs\" as it is \"the later-enacted and more specific provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 318.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-571\">\n   Moreover, to rationalize its desired result, the district court, as well as the opinions supporting the majority's judgment, had to construe the text of \u00a7 1182(f) in a manner that contorted its unambiguous\n   language. For instance, the district court concluded that the language of \u00a7 1182(f) requires that the President impose a \"specified end date,\" a conclusion that Judge Keenan also reaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 313. Yet, the statutory language does not support such a construction; it provides that the Proclamation may be issued \"for such period as [the President] shall deem necessary.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1601\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). In this case, the Proclamation defines that \"period\" unambiguously, linking the duration of the restrictions on the eight countries to their governments' satisfaction of the conditions found and requiring that a review be conducted of those conditions every 180 days, with the clear inference that should they satisfy the conditions, the restrictions would be lifted. That is the \"period\" that the President \"deem[ed] necessary.\" If the President were to impose a bar of nationals from a country in a state of war with the United States, the \"period\" implied would be until that state of war ended, which hardly could allow for a \"specified end date,\" as required by the district court's and Judge Keenan's construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-572\">\n   The district court also found it necessary to create\n   <em>\n    an exception\n   </em>\n   to its interpretation that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) constricts the authority conferred by \u00a7 1182(f) in order to accommodate the conceded reality that the President has the power to exclude aliens based on nationality \"during a specific urgent national crisis or public health emergency.\" Recognizing as legitimate the repeated exercise of that authority by past Presidents, the court attempted to harmonize its construction that \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) constricts \u00a7 1182(f) by adding the \"crisis\" exception. Chief Judge Gregory does the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 305 (suggesting the possibility of \"a narrow exception to \u00a7 1152(a)(1) that allows national bans under extraordinary circumstances\");\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 296 (acknowledging in his interpretation of \u00a7 1182(f) the President's authority to exclude nationals during an \"exigency\"). Alternatively, however, he seeks to distinguish the prior proclamations and executive orders that excluded nationals of particular countries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 304-05. These efforts amount to a clumsy attempt to avoid the plain statutory language that authorized those orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-573\">\n   On a larger scale, neither the plaintiffs nor the opinions supporting the majority's judgment seriously address the overriding constitutional problem raised by their construction of \u00a7\u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) and 1182(f). As a clear example, if the United States were to enter into a state of war with a foreign nation or were attacked by foreigners, their preferred construction would wreak havoc by precluding entry restrictions that would be necessary in such a time of crisis. Their interpretation ignores the constitutional separation-of-powers problem raised by this simple example and thus unwittingly highlights the deference that courts must give to the political branches in foreign relations and immigration matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-574\">\n   In a further effort to rationalize their desired outcome, the opinions supporting the majority's judgment also interpose new requirements and limitations into \u00a7 1182(f) itself, leading to their conclusion that the President violated the new requirements and limitations. This mode of analysis is unprecedented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-575\">\n   For instance, Chief Judge Gregory concludes that he must adopt a narrower construction of \u00a7 1182(f) than is written to save it from a serious risk of invalidation because of its \"breathtaking delegation to the President of virtually unconstrained power.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 291. He thus limits the scope of \u00a7 1182(f) to authorize only the exclusion of \"(1) foreign nationals whose individual conduct or affiliation makes their entry harmful to national interests\n   for reasons unanticipated by Congress and (2) foreign nationals in response to a foreign-affairs or national-security exigency.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 296;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 299-300. Without his created limitations, as he asserts, \u00a7 1182(f) would have the unconstitutional effect of allowing the President \"to dramatically reorganize the domestic affairs of broad swathes of Americans.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 291. And while he recognizes that Congress itself has such power, he does not accept that Congress could intend to give the President the authority that it did in \u00a7 1182(f) or that the President shares in that power through Article II of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knauff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3946507\" index=\"1602\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/537/#p543\">\n    338 U.S. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3946507\" index=\"1603\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/537/#p543\">\n    70 S.Ct. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty\" that \"stems not alone from legislative power\n   <em>\n    but is inherent in the executive power\n   </em>\n   to control the foreign affairs of the nation\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Fiallo\n   </em>\n   , 430 U.S. at 792,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127943\" index=\"1604\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/787/#p792\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he power to expel or exclude aliens [is] a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised\n   <em>\n    by the government's political departments\n   </em>\n   largely immune from judicial control\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-576\">\n   Chief Judge Gregory also expands his newfound limitation-that \u00a7 1182(f) only authorizes the President to restrict entry of aliens by nationality in response to an exigency-adding that the exigency must be \"\n   <em>\n    demonstrated\n   </em>\n   \" by the President.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 299-300 (emphasis added). Then, second-guessing the President's explanations based on national security risks, as stated in the Proclamation, he concludes that there was \"no apparent exigency justifying immediate, categorical exclusion of foreign nationals ... because [the Proclamation] does not identify any new event or factual circumstance that Congress has not already considered via legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 300. In effect, Chief Judge Gregory rejects the Proclamation's stated reasons for imposing entry restrictions, concluding that the President did not comply with \u00a7 1182(f), not because the President did not make findings or give reasons, but because Judge Gregory does not share in the President's view of what findings or reasons justified imposing restrictions on alien entry. Nothing in \u00a7 1182(f), however, supports this second-guessing of the President's foreign policy determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-577\">\n   Judge Keenan similarly reads new requirements and limitations into \u00a7 1182(f). Unwilling to give the statutory language its due, she limits \u00a7 1182(f) 's authority to exclude \"aliens or classes of aliens\" to a more restricted authority to exclude aliens based only on the \"class members'\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   circumstances or actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 314 (emphasis added). She rejects, in particular, the broader authority to exclude\n   <em>\n    a class of aliens that might be defined as coming from a particular country\n   </em>\n   where the \"country's conditions relating to the criteria of identity-management, information-sharing, and terrorist activity\" were inadequate, as was done in the Proclamation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, she does not recognize that her interpretation precludes even the exclusion of nationals from a country at war with the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-578\">\n   Judge Keenan also reads into \u00a7 1182(f) the limitation that the \"findings\" required by that provision cannot include the fact that nationals from a particular country pose a greater risk based on the country's \"faulty [security] protocols,\" reasoning that such a finding would fail to assess the risk of \"\n   <em>\n    individuals.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 316-17. Faced with prior presidential proclamations and executive orders that did indeed exclude nationals as a class, she attempts to distinguish them by noting, for instance, that they were limited to the defined period of the then-pending crisis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 315-16. But that explanation does not address the exclusion by previous Presidents of\n   <em>\n    nationals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    not individuals\n   </em>\n   based on their individual circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   Judge Wynn's reconstruction of \u00a7 1182(f) has even wider implications and is yet less relevant to the issues before us. He concludes that the Proclamation violates \u00a7 1182(f) because it is \"driven by anti-Muslim bias,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 322 (internal quotation marks omitted), and because Congress never authorized such \"invidious discrimination\" in \u00a7 1182(f),\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 334-35. While it is surely correct that Congress did not authorize \"invidious discrimination\" in conferring authority on the President in \u00a7 1182(f), it did authorize him to \"suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens ... or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1605\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Judge Wynn's argument is not a statutory one but a straw man that he created based on language\n   <em>\n    not in the statute\n   </em>\n   ; he finds that the Proclamation violates a requirement that is nowhere to be found in \u00a7 1182(f). It appears that he is attempting, through \u00a7 1182(f), to create constitutionally based rights in aliens excludable under \u00a7 1182(f) -to be free from \"invidious discrimination\"-when they never heretofore had such rights. But because \u00a7 1182(f) does not address \"invidious discrimination,\" any claim based on such discrimination must be located elsewhere, not in \u00a7 1182(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-580\">\n   In sum, the district court, Chief Judge Gregory, Judge Keenan, and Judge Wynn disagree with Congress's delegation of authority to the President; they disagree with the Proclamation's exercise of such authority; they find more palatable their \"narrower construction\" to yield a more limited delegation; and, to give effect to their preferred construction and ultimately their preferred result, they rewrite the statute to insert limitations. Doing that is not a legitimate judicial role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-581\">\n   IV. Establishment Clause Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   In pursuing their freestanding Establishment Clause claim before the district court, the plaintiffs relied on this court's prior decision enjoining enforcement of Executive Order 13,780 -even though that decision was vacated by the Supreme Court-to assert that \"the Proclamation is an attempt to implement the [President's] promised Muslim ban.\" They urged the district court to \"look behind\" the Proclamation, which is concededly neutral on its face, and to rely on the same statements of candidate Trump that provided the basis for the majority's earlier decision. The district court ruled as the plaintiffs urged, and the plaintiffs now contend that the district court correctly found that the purpose of the Proclamation is to express anti-Muslim animus and it thus violates the Establishment Clause, which \"command[s] ... that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\" Opening Brief at 53 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

The district court summarized its view of the standard by stating that the plaintiffs need only make a particularized showing\n   <em>\n    from external evidence\n   </em>\n   of bad faith, regardless of what the Proclamation provides. Applying that standard, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs, by relying on the President's campaign-trail statements and other similar evidence, plausibly alleged that the Proclamation's stated reason was \"not bona fide.\" The court then proceeded to apply what it deemed to be traditional Establishment Clause jurisprudence, emphasizing that \"purpose matters\" when assessing the validity of government action\n   under the Establishment Clause (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCreary Cty., Ky. v.

But even as the Court recognized that the\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs had presented a legitimate First Amendment claim, it concluded that the claim was unreviewable because the government's stated reason for excluding Mandel was valid on its face.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"1612\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    408 U.S. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"1613\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It thus pronounced the rule that governs here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-586\">\n   We hold that when the Executive exercises [congressionally delegated power to exclude aliens] negatively on the basis of a\n   <em>\n    facially\n   </em>\n   legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). The Court's reasoning was thus based on a\n   <em>\n    facial\n   </em>\n   assessment of the reasons given by the government and the conclusion that those reasons were facially legitimate and bona fide. Of importance to this case, the\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   Court did not \"look behind\" the facial reason based on what the plaintiffs alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   The only reason that the district court gave in this case for looking behind the Proclamation was the external evidence presented by the plaintiffs. Rather than\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   assessing the face of the Proclamation to determine whether its reasons were facially legitimate and bona fide, the district court bypassed that assessment to consider external evidence at the outset. In short, it stood the\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   standard on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   Moreover, the district court never explained why the Proclamation's stated reasons of national security, based on the investigation of some 200 countries by executive agencies, were not legitimate and bona fide. None of the facts or conditions recited as reasons for the issuance of the Proclamation have been challenged as untrue or illegitimate. It is thus readily apparent that, without looking behind the Proclamation, there is simply no basis to argue or conclude that it had anything to do with religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   serious error committed by the district court is just as plain. In \"look[ing] behind\" the Proclamation to campaign statements and other similar statements, the district court applied a new and totally unprecedented rule of evidence that is fraught with danger and impracticality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   Apart from violating established rules for interpreting unambiguous legal texts-whether statutes, regulations, executive orders, proclamations, or, indeed, contracts-reliance on campaign statements and similar evidence to impose a new\n   meaning on unambiguous language is completely strange to judicial analysis. In the Establishment Clause context, moreover, the Supreme Court has warned against \"judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter's heart of hearts.\"\n   <em>\n    McCreary\n   </em>\n   , 545 U.S at 862,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210003\" index=\"1614\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/844/#p860\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And consistent with that warning, the Court has never, \"in evaluating the legality of executive action, deferred to comments made by such officials to the media.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v.

The Court's reluctance to consider statements made in the course of campaigning derives from good sense and a recognition of the pitfalls that would accompany such an inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   Because of their nature, campaign statements and other similar statements, including tweets, are unbounded resources by which to find intent of various kinds. They are often short-hand for larger ideas; they are explained, modified, retracted, and amplified as they are repeated and as new circumstances and arguments arise. And they are often susceptible to multiple interpretations, depending on the outlook of the recipient. A court applying this new rule would thus have free reign to select whichever expression of an official's developing ideas best supports its desired conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   Moreover, opening the door to the use of campaign-trail statements and similar musings or tweets to inform the text of later executive orders has no rational limit. If a court, dredging through the myriad remarks of an officeholder, fails to find material to produce the desired outcome, what stops it from probing deeper to find statements from a previous campaign, or from a previous business conference, or from college?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   And how would use of such statements take into account intervening acts, events, and influences? When a candidate wins the election to the presidency, he takes an oath of office to abide by the Constitution and the laws of the Nation. And he appoints officers of the government and retains advisors, usually specialized in their field. Is there not the possibility that a candidate might have different intentions than a President in office? And after taking office, a President faces external events that may prompt new approaches altogether. How would a court assess the effect of these intervening events on presidential intent without conducting \"judicial psychoanalysis\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   At bottom, the danger of this new rule is that it will enable a court to justify its decision to strike down any executive action with which it disagrees. It need only find one statement that contradicts the official reasons given for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that the official reasons were a pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-596\">\n   Moreover, the unbounded nature of the new rule will leave the President and his administration in an untenable position for future action. It is undeniable that President Trump will continue to need to engage in foreign policy regarding majority-Muslim nations, including those designated in the Proclamation. Yet, the district court's opinion presupposes that the Proclamation is tainted by prior campaign-trail statements and prior executive orders, clearly indicating that future actions might also be subject to the same challenges made today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-597\">\n   Finally, the new rule would by itself chill political speech directed at voters seeking to make their election decision. It is hard to imagine a greater or more direct burden on campaign speech than the knowledge that any statement made might be used later to support the inference of some nefarious intent when official actions are inevitably subjected to legal challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-598\">\n   As its\n   <em>\n    third\n   </em>\n   serious error, the district court held, on the merits, that the plaintiffs were likely to show that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause's requirement of religious neutrality because it was issued primarily for the President's subjective purpose of targeting Muslims. To be sure, when legitimately applying Establishment Clause jurisprudence, courts consider whether government action is indeed motivated by a secular, rather than a religious, purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lemon v.

This leap was made without citation to legal authority. Rather, the district court simply recited that the plaintiffs' alleged prolonged separation from family\n   members constituted \"personal contact with the Proclamation's alleged Establishment Clause violation,\" and then proceeded without preamble to its analysis of the claim of stigmatization injury as if the two were one and the same.\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-631\">\n   As cursory as the district court's \"prolonged separation\" holding is, the majority opinion is even weaker.

Because the major questions doctrine (1) is far less widely accepted and applied than the constitutional avoidance canons; (2) has never been applied in immigration cases; and (3) lacks judicially accepted standards-notwithstanding its potential to provide the judiciary broad license to encroach on decisions traditionally reserved to the political branches-I believe that the constitutional avoidance canons, rather than the major questions doctrine, provide the proper interpretative basis for analyzing the Proclamation's compliance with Section 1182(f).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-706\">\n    Congress's and the President's constitutional power to control immigration-and authority to delegate that control-fundamentally differs in a time of war.\n    <em>\n     Korematsu\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1804\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n     323 U.S. at 224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1230203\" index=\"1805\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/214/#p240\">\n     65 S.Ct. 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (\"[T]he validity of action under the war power must be judged wholly in the context of war.
