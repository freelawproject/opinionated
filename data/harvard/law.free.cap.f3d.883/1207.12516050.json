Adkins argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the federal, rather than state, definition of \"knowingly.\" Because any error was harmless, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   Adkins's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adkins also appeals his 210-month sentence, arguing that his prior convictions do not constitute crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Because we find that Adkins's burglary and false imprisonment convictions qualify as crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2's residual clause, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   Adkins's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While incarcerated at the Halawa Correctional Facility in Hawaii, Adkins and five other members of the United Samoan Organization (USOs) prison gang beat B.L., a member of a rival gang, for owing a drug debt to the USOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 10, 2014, a jury found Adkins guilty of a Violent Crime in Aid of Racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1959(a)(3), (2). As the basis for the VICAR offense, Count 4 of the Indictment specifically alleged that Adkins knowingly committed an assault on B.L. \"in violation of [s]ection 707-710 of the Penal Code of the State of Hawaii.\" Adkins submitted a Proposed Jury Instruction No. 4 setting forth the material elements of a section 707-710 violation, including the definitions of \"serious bodily injury\" and \"knowingly\" in the Hawaii Penal Code. The Hawaii Penal Code definition in Adkins's proposed instruction was: \"A person acts 'knowingly' with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\" The proposed definition also contained a self-defense instruction. In contrast, the government proposed a federal definition of \"knowingly\" that did not contain a self-defense instruction: \"The word 'knowingly' means that the act was done\n   voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident.\" Over Adkins's objections, the court adopted the government's broader, federal definition of \"knowingly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before sentencing, the government requested that Adkins be designated a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. At that time, Adkins had three prior convictions: a 1997 conviction for Unlawful Imprisonment in the First Degree under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 702-721 and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 707-732, both arising from the same incident; and a 2003 conviction for Burglary in the First Degree under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 708-810.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Adkins filed a Motion to Continue Sentencing, pending the outcome of\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ultimately struck down the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") as unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since \u00a7 4B1.2 contains an identically worded residual clause to the one found in the ACCA, the parties agreed that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   by extension applies to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court thus did not conduct a residual clause analysis for any of Adkins's convictions in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and the parties' agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court held that Hawaii's Burglary in the First Degree met the federal generic definition of burglary and Hawaii's Sexual Assault in the Third Degree matched the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor, making both convictions crimes of violence. The district court did not reach whether Hawaii's False Imprisonment in the First Degree was a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the district court ruled that Adkins had at least two prior convictions that were crimes of violence, he was subject to a 12-level increase (20 to 32) in his offense level calculations. The advisory guideline imprisonment range for an offense level of 20 is 70 to 87 months. An offense level 32 has a range of 210 to 262 months. The district court sentenced Adkins to 210 months. Adkins timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v.

However, courts, in certain circumstances, should instruct on the state definition or otherwise risk prejudice to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

'[a]ffirming such a conviction would be seriously problematic because the defendant's actions, as found by the jury, might not constitute murder.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092635\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/285/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092635\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/285/#p303\">\n    at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carrillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183899\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/177/#p185\">\n    229 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   184 ) (alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We agree with the Second Circuit. Adkins was deprived of a self-defense instruction found within the Hawaii state definition, but not the federal definition. \"Confusion and unfairness\" most certainly arises when a jury lacks an instruction that contains this specific defense, and \"an appellate court would have no way of knowing what the jury found the defendant's state of mind to be.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183899\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/177/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the district court erred when it instructed the jury on the federal definition that lacked a self-defense instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Regardless, the error is harmless because \"it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found [Adkins] guilty absent the error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The record supports that Adkins, without provocation, attacked B.L. with five other men. B.L. was sitting down and watching television when Adkins and the other men attacked. Thus, we find that under the state definition of \"knowingly\", Adkins was \"aware that it [was] practically certain that his conduct\" would result in harm to B.L. and a rational jury would not find that an unprovoked attack with five other men was done in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Sentencing Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Sentencing Commission's Deletion Of The Residual Clause In The Career Offender Guideline is Not Retroactive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A defendant may only be deemed \"a career offender\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) if the defendant \"has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). When Adkins received his sentence, \u00a7 4B1.2(a) defined a \"crime of violence\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (a) The term \"crime of violence\" means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While this appeal was pending, the Sentencing Commission deleted the residual clause: \"or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 798 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2016). Adkins had the misfortune of being sentenced prior to this change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We may, however, apply a Sentencing Guideline amendment retroactively on appeal only if it clarifies existing law,\n   rather than substantively changes the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n    376 F.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010-11 (9th Cir. 2004). We determine whether an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines is clarifying by applying three non-exclusive factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"There is no bright-line test for distinguishing between clarifying and substantive amendments.\"). The three factors are: \"(1) whether the amendment is included on the list of retroactive amendments found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) ; (2) whether the Commission itself characterized the amendment as a clarification; and (3) whether the amendment resolves a circuit conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n    at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We hold that all three factors counsel against retroactivity in this appeal. First, the Sentencing Commission has not used its delegated authority to make Amendment 798 retroactive, as the Commission has done for a list of other amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). The Commission considered authorizing retroactive application, but stated that doing so would be \"complex and time intensive.\" U.S. Sentencing Comm'n, Public Meeting (Jan. 8, 2016) (statement of Comm'n Chair, Chief Judge Patti B. Saris). Second, the Commission did not characterize striking the residual clause as a \"clarifying\" amendment. U.S.S.G. App. C, amend 798 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2016). Rather, it described the change as \"a matter of policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the Commission did not specify that it was resolving a circuit split in making the change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Commission's decision to remove a category of offenses from the Career Offender Guidelines was not made with the \"express purpose of resolving a conflict among the circuits that resulted from reasonable though differing interpretations of the Guideline[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221942\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1201/#p1205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Commission did not, for example, clarify that the Sixth Circuit correctly applied a Guideline to a set of facts while the Eleventh Circuit erred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221942\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1201/#p1205\">\n    598 F.3d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the Commission entirely eliminated a clause from a Guideline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The second and third factors do not weigh in favor of retroactivity even though the Commission stated that the residual clause in the Career Offender Guidelines \"implicates many of the same concerns cited by the Supreme Court in [\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ].\" U.S.S.G. App. C, amend 798 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Court struck down as unconstitutionally vague an identical provision in the ACCA, in part, because of arbitrary and inconsistent application among federal courts.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing residual clause under ACCA \"created numerous splits among the lower federal courts, where it ... proved nearly impossible to apply consistently\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But the second and third factors examine whether the Commission meant to clarify\n   <em>\n    existing law\n   </em>\n   , not whether-as occurred here-the Commission made a substantive change in order to create a new law that is now clearer on its face and in application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377044,9191454\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1002/\">\n    376 F.3d at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Commission also stated that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   \"has given rise to significant litigation regarding the guideline definition of 'crime of violence,' \" and so struck the clause to \"alleviate some of the ongoing litigation and uncertainty resulting from the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision.\" U.S.S.G. App. C, amend 798 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2016). Since enactment of the amendment, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   settled that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, applying retroactively the deletion of the residual clause no longer resolves any uncertainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While not part of our analysis under the\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   -line of cases, we note that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

In\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   changed the\n   <em>\n    substantive reach\n   </em>\n   of the Armed Career Criminal Act, [by] altering the range of conduct or the class of persons that the [Act] punishes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
