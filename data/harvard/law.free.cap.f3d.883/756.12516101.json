Both courts sentenced him to serve periods\n   of incarceration, with the federal sentence to run consecutively to the state sentence. While serving his state sentence, he was twice erroneously turned over to federal authorities, first from August through November of 2009 and then again from December 2009 through February 2010. Once his state sentence was complete and the Marshals Service took him into federal custody, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) concluded that Johnson's federal sentence commenced in June 2011, when the federal government for the first time gained primary jurisdiction over him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Johnson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging that determination. He argues that his federal sentence actually commenced on one of the instances when the state prematurely transferred him to the federal authorities. As a result, Johnson contends that he should receive credit against his federal sentence for the period starting on the date he was erroneously turned over to federal authorities and including all his time in state prison after he was returned to state custody. Because the state credited the time the federal authorities erroneously held Johnson against his state sentence, Johnson effectively seeks double-credit against both his state and federal sentences for the period between August 2009 and June 2011. We disagree and hold that because these erroneous transfers did not manifest the state's consent to terminate its primary jurisdiction over Johnson, he was not in federal custody for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203585\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and therefore the federal sentence did not commence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Sheriff's Department in Harris County, Texas, arrested Aubry Johnson in February 2007 for fraudulently using identifying information and for violating his probation for a prior robbery conviction. In June 2007, a state court sentenced Johnson to a six-year term of imprisonment for aggravated robbery as a result of the probation violation. After sentencing, the court committed Johnson to the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to serve his sentence. In August 2007, the TDCJ transferred Johnson to Fort Bend County, where a state court sentenced Johnson to a twelve-month concurrent sentence of imprisonment for fraudulent use of identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While Johnson was in state custody, the United States indicted him on federal charges for aiding and abetting device fraud and identity theft. The federal court issued writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum for Johnson on May 10, 2007, June 29, 2007, and August 29, 2007, so that he could attend federal court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon conviction for the federal charges, the district court sentenced Johnson to an 88-month term of imprisonment, to run consecutively to his state sentence for aggravated robbery. The Marshals Service filed a federal detainer with the state\n   authorities, requesting that the state hold Johnson so that federal authorities could assume custody of him when he satisfied his state sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The two errors central to this appeal occurred in late 2009. While Johnson was still serving his state sentence in the Texas prison system, the TDCJ transferred Johnson to the custody of the Dallas County Sheriff's Department to answer for additional state charges that were ultimately dismissed. Rather than return Johnson to the TDCJ, however, the Dallas County Sheriff's Department mistakenly transferred Johnson to the Marshals Service on August 7, 2009, pursuant to the federal detainer. When the error was discovered, the Marshals Service returned Johnson to the Dallas County Sheriff's Department on November 3. A short while later, on December 9, 2009, the Dallas County Sheriff's Department informed the Marshals Service that Johnson had completed his state sentence and that the department intended to release Johnson unless the Marshals Service took custody of him. On December 14, the Dallas County Sheriff's Department transferred Johnson to the Marshals Service. This was also a mistake. Johnson remained with the federal authorities until February 12, 2010, when the Marshals Service returned him to the TDCJ. Johnson received credit toward his state sentence for the periods during which the Marshals Service erroneously had physical custody of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Texas paroled Johnson on February 23, 2011. Because the Marshals Service had filed a federal detainer with the state, the state authorities held Johnson for federal pick-up, but due to an oversight the Marshals Service failed to retrieve him, and so Johnson was released the same day. Several months later, on June 6, 2011, Johnson visited his parole officer, at which time the Marshals Service apprehended him and turned him over to the BOP to serve his federal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The BOP determined that Johnson's federal sentence commenced on June 6, 2011, when the Marshals Service took Johnson into federal custody. Nevertheless, Johnson received credit against his federal sentence for the period during which he was released from all custody, between February 23, 2011 (when he was paroled from state custody) through June 5, 2011, when the Marshals Service apprehended him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson objected to this calculation; he argued that his federal sentence commenced on one of the occasions when the state erroneously transferred him to the Marshals Service, either on August 7, 2009, or December 14, 2009. Therefore, Johnson contends, he is entitled to credit against his federal sentence for the time period between August 2009 and June 2011, even though the state already gave him credit for this same time period. After unsuccessfully pursuing administrative\n   remedies, Johnson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the district court denied.

In order to determine whether Johnson's federal sentence commenced when the state mistakenly transferred him to the federal government, we begin by interpreting \u00a7 3585(a) in its historical context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although \"custody\" can mean mere physical possession or control of a person, it may also refer to lawful authority over a person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 441 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \"constructive custody\" as \"[c]ustody of a person (such as a parolee or probationer) whose freedom is controlled by legal authority but who is not under direct physical control\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 559 (2002) (\"[C]ontrol of a thing or person with such actual or constructive possession as fulfills the purpose of the law or duty requiring it.\"). Courts have long interpreted \"custody\" in the context of \u00a7 3585 and its predecessors as referring to the federal government's control over a prisoner when it has both physical custody and primary jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The concept of primary jurisdiction was established by the Supreme Court nearly a century ago, when it acknowledged the need for comity between state and federal authorities with respect to managing defendants who are subject to both state and federal criminal prosecutions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ponzi v.

Courts interpreted \u00a7 709a in light of\n   <em>\n    Ponzi\n   </em>\n   and the concept of primary jurisdiction, concluding that a state's transfer of a defendant to the federal government does not trigger the commencement of the federal sentence unless the federal government obtains primary jurisdiction over the defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Zerbst v. McPike\n   </em>\n   , for instance, Louisiana state authorities had primary jurisdiction over a defendant, but transferred him to the federal government for the duration of a federal prosecution.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"994298\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/97/253/#p254\">\n    97 F.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254 (5th Cir. 1938). When the federal sentencing was complete, the prisoner was returned to the state, which took him back to state jail and tried and sentenced him for a state crime.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After the defendant served his state sentence, he argued that his federal sentence began running when he was taken to the state jail following his federal sentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"994298\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/97/253/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument.

Further, the state's subsequent acts confirmed this presumption was correct. These acts included \"(1) the subsequent use of an ad prosequendum writ to regain custody, (2) a sentencing order expressly providing that the state sentence should be served concurrently with a future federal sentence, and (3) a state-lodged detainer requesting [the defendant's] return to the state prison system upon completion of his federal sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Binford v.

Such an approach is contrary to the principles of comity expressed in\n   <em>\n    Ponzi\n   </em>\n   , which establish that the sovereign which is first to arrest a defendant obtains primary jurisdiction over him as against other sovereigns, and any transfer must be with that sovereign's consent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1479220\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/258/254/#p259\">\n    258 U.S. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1479220\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/258/254/#p259\">\n    42 S.Ct. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We would interfere with the comity necessary for managing defendants who are subject to criminal prosecution\n   and sentences by both state and federal sovereigns by adopting a rule that prevents sovereigns from rectifying a mistaken transfer or by holding as a matter of law that the state surrendered its primary jurisdiction when it merely made a mistake. For instance, a rule that a state's mistaken transfer of a prisoner triggers the commencement of a federal sentence might motivate federal authorities to retain such a prisoner against the wishes of the state, so as to ensure that the prisoner serves the full sentence imposed by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, the dissent's concern that prisoners will not be fully credited for time served is misplaced. Dissent at 771-72. In this case, for instance, Johnson received credit against his state sentence for time erroneously spent in federal custody.

The parties do not dispute that Texas was the first sovereign to obtain jurisdiction over Johnson when the state arrested him in February 2007, and Texas therefore had initial primary jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548563\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/1361/#p1365\">\n    923 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1365 (citing\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   , 610 F.2d at 684-85 ). Because Johnson's consecutive federal sentence could not commence under \u00a7 3585(a) until the federal government obtained primary jurisdiction over him, we must decide whether and when Texas relinquished its primary jurisdiction to the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Johnson argues that the record establishes that Texas relinquished its primary jurisdiction in 2009 when the Dallas County Sheriff's Department twice transferred him to the federal government and represented on one occasion that his the state sentence was complete. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   , Johnson's transfer to federal control was not pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum or a written request for temporary custody from the federal government. Thus, in Johnson's view the federal government had legal custody over him upon his erroneous transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We disagree. As explained above, the crucial question is whether, in view of the record as a whole, the state intended to relinquish its primary jurisdiction over Johnson on August 7, 2009, or December 14, 2009, when it transferred him to the Marshals Service. Here, Johnson does not dispute that the Sheriff's Department made a mistake. Highlighting this fact, the Marshals Service's returned Johnson to state authorities when the error was discovered, and Texas took him back. By acknowledging and correcting the error, the state and federal sovereigns made clear that they had not reached an agreement to transfer primary jurisdiction over Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zerbst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"994298\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/97/253/#p254\">\n    97 F.2d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The prior right acquired by first arrest continues unchanged until the arresting government has completed the exercise of its powers, and a waiver\n   <em>\n    extends no further than it is intended\n   </em>\n   to extend.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Johnson argues that we should follow\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   and hold that the state intended to relinquish primary jurisdiction because the state did not transfer him to the federal government pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum or a written request for temporary custody. Again we disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   , the absence of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was only one relevant factor, and \"the further acts of the two sovereigns\" confirmed the court's conclusion that the state and federal sovereigns had reached an agreement for a transfer of primary jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424902\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/301/1175/\">\n    301 F.3d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   , there is no indication (1) that either sovereign believed that Texas would have to \"borrow\" Johnson by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum in order to get physical custody, (2) that Texas consented to Johnson's serving his state sentence concurrently with his federal sentence, or (3) that Texas lodged a detainer with the federal authorities acknowledging the federal government's priority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1181.

From the time of arrest through the time Texas paroled Johnson, the state did not manifest an intent to surrender its priority in favor of the federal government. The Sheriff Department's transfers of Johnson to the federal government in August and December of 2009 were merely mistakes.

Thus, the state maintains its primary jurisdiction over the prisoner for purposes of sentencing. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the court specifically held that, because the defendant was released on bond pending sentencing in federal court, the state obtained jurisdiction over him when they arrested him on a murder charge.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381245\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/440/\">\n    164 F.3d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There may also be circumstances under which the court has to determine whether a sovereign who relinquished a prisoner to another without requiring a writ may nevertheless have reached agreement with the second sovereign that it would maintain primary jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Weekes v. Fleming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424902\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/301/1175/\">\n    301 F.3d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1181 (10th Cir. 2002) (concluding that Idaho, who first had primary jurisdiction, consented to a relinquishment of custody to the United States because the United States was allowed to take possession of the prisoner without a writ, and there was other evidence of the parties' consent to such an arrangement). Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Swope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1018588\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/91/260/#p262\">\n    91 F.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (9th Cir. 1937), this court acknowledged the possibility of sovereigns making various arrangements in regard to sentencing, including staggering them, but found no evidence of such an agreement in that case. In making a determination of this type, one would look to the administrative and judicial officers charged with making such decisions, not subordinate officials, such as Marshals or sheriffs. But there is nothing to suggest in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and the line of cases dealing with prisoners \"on loan\" to another sovereign, as concluded by the majority, that consent is always dispositive of whether primary jurisdiction is relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is based on who has custody or control of the \"body\" of the prisoner. In deciding that the federal court, which first had primary jurisdiction, had relinquished it by placing the defendant on bond, the court stated in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Strand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the state in this case, not the federal government maintained physical control of Taylor. The sovereign who lacks possession of the body permits another to proceed against the accused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381245\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/440/\">\n    164 F.3d at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   instructs that just as the federal court relinquished primary jurisdiction in that case because it no longer had custody of the body, the state twice relinquished primary jurisdiction over Johnson in this case on the two occasions\n   when the Dallas County Sheriff's Department relinquished control of him to the U.S. Marshal Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The law establishing that the temporary relinquishment of a prisoner pursuant to a writ does not alter primary jurisdiction itself suggests that the consent theory on which the majority relies in this case is not well-founded. By consent, they do not mean just consent to the turnover of the prisoner, but that the turnover was not through their mistake or accident. Suppose that, through accident or mistake, a state prisoner is turned over by a state with primary jurisdiction to federal authorities for sentencing without a writ and that the federal prisoner is sent to a federal prison facility thereafter to commence his sentence. I do not believe the majority would argue, or the case law supports, the conclusion that the state would have maintained jurisdiction under these circumstances. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , it was because the prisoner was delivered to federal court pursuant to a \"valid writ\" that the state court was able to maintain primary jurisdiction over the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 444. There was no inquiry about the intent of the judge who had responsibility for deciding the issue of whether he should release the defendant on bond. Indeed, the judge's intent was deemed irrelevant to the inquiry as evidenced by the fact that on appeal in that case, the court found his pronouncement upon imposition of sentence, that defendant was \"now in federal custody\", to be of no significance.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 445-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But beyond concluding that a sovereign's intent to transfer must be determined by consideration of the record as a whole, the majority goes further by concluding, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1018588\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/91/260/#p262\">\n    91 F.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that sovereigns are not bound by subordinate officials such as sheriffs and U.S. Marshals. Yet\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was a much different case than this one. That case involved circumstances where a defendant was convicted and sentenced in federal court and immediately commenced his sentence in the custody of the U.S. Marshal, who was instructed to transfer him to a federal penitentiary.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 261. The Marshal did not. Some time thereafter, he transferred the defendant to state custody to commence his state sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Upon completion of the service of his time in state custody, he was being held for the commencement of his federal sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We held that he properly commenced his federal sentence in the custody of the Marshal. Consequently, the Marshal's delivery of the prisoner to state authorities, contrary to his instructions that he deliver him to the federal penitentiary, did not toll the running of his federal sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 262. There was no question that the federal court had primary jurisdiction and that the defendant commenced his sentence in federal custody. As such, the court acknowledged that it was not called upon to determine whether or not there was an agreement between sovereigns that the defendant would serve a staggered sentence. Under the circumstances of that case, the federal authorities were bound to give credit to the prisoner despite the ministerial error of the Marshal. However, this determination was not based on whether the state obtained primary jurisdiction, but on the federal common law doctrine that once a defendant's sentence has begun, it should be continued uninterrupted, unless interrupted by fault of the prisoner.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . As a result, the court concluded that he was entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in a state institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I do not think that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , or the case law in general, supports the notion that federal courts, in determining whether jurisdiction has been relinquished by a sovereign, must always engage in a prolix exercise of combing through the state statute\n   to determine which officials have the proper authority to commit the sovereign and whether the sovereign has potentially relinquished its authority. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the Sheriff in this case was engaging in fraud, subterfuge, or trickery, or that the Marshal obtained possession of the prisoner through such means. Furthermore, I think the majority's position regarding the need for consent from a properly-authorized state representative ignores the practical reality that, in many states, the power to release a prisoner, or take some other affirmative act that might indicate a relinquishment of priority, is exercised by subordinate officials, such as sheriffs. There is nothing in this case to suggest that the Dallas County Sheriff's Department was not empowered to make decisions regarding whether to release or retain prisoners who were legitimately entrusted to its custody and control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, I am left with a serious concern that this decision will result in the denial of relief in even the most egregious cases where significant prejudice to a prisoner could result from an erroneous transfer. The majority's position in this case unnecessarily adds to uncertainty regarding the rights and protections of prisoners subject to the jurisdiction of both state and federal sovereigns. I also do not think that the majority's reliance on a U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS , PROGRAM STATEMENT NO . 5160.05: DESIGNATION OF STATE INSTITUTION FOR SERVICE OF FEDERAL SENTENCE 1 (2003) (\"Program Statement\") is well-founded. It states, in relevant part, \"when it has been determined [that] an inmate was committed improperly to federal custody and primary jurisdiction resides with a state sovereign (i.e., the inmate was under the jurisdiction of the federal sentencing court on the basis of a writ of habeas ad prosequendum), [the BOP] will make every effort to return the inmate to state custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 11. The Program Statement further provides that, \"[a] return to the state means that the federal sentence should be considered as not having commenced since the transfer to the Bureau was in error and the prisoner should have been returned to the state. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Acknowledging that this Policy Statement refers only to erroneous federal custody involving writs, the majority nevertheless concludes that \"the BOP's policy with regard to such writs recognizes that a federal sentence does not commence merely because a prisoner is in the federal government's physical custody.\" Maj. Op. 15. However, as discussed previously, I do not think that the authority regarding prisoners being \"on loan\" by one sovereign to another through a writ has any applicability to the very different circumstances of this case. Consequently, I find the majority's reliance on the Program Statement to be unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I conclude that the federal government acquired primary jurisdiction over Johnson on the two occasions when the Sheriff turned him over to the Marshal and that he should be given credit for the time spent in the custody of the Marshal. This result is supported by cases in this Circuit and others, which teach that physical custody of the body of the prisoner determines which sovereign has primary jurisdiction in the absence of the prisoner being in the custody of a sovereign pursuant to a writ or an agreement of the sovereigns to the contrary. On the two occasions when the prisoner was released into the possession of the Marshal it was not pursuant to\n   a writ. There was also no agreement between the sovereigns at that time that primary jurisdiction would remain with the state. It was not until later that the federal authorities, recognizing that Johnson had been released to them by mistake, consented to the state again having primary jurisdiction. During the time that Johnson was in the custody of the Marshal, the federal government had primary jurisdiction over him and he should be given credit toward his federal sentence for that time. Even if I were to conclude, consistent with the majority, that the state maintained primary jurisdiction over Johnson when he was delivered by the Sheriff to the Marshal, I would still find that he had commenced his sentence and should be given credit for the time served in the custody of the Marshal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Admittedly, courts have varied regarding whether to give federal credit to a prisoner mistakenly taken into federal custody by federal authorities when the state had, and never relinquished, primary jurisdiction. Some courts have read the doctrine of primary jurisdiction into the definition of \"received into custody,\" concluding that a federal prisoner who is mistakenly delivered to a federal penal institution to begin his sentence is not received in custody for the purpose of commencing his federal sentence. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Binford\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a prisoner, who appeared before the federal court pursuant to a writ and was mistakenly delivered to a federal facility after sentencing in federal court, was not entitled to the time he spent at the federal facility before being returned to the state because the state court had primary jurisdiction. Reading the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as a gloss on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203585\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the court concluded that \"his sentence never began until he was finally received into federal custody for the purpose of serving his sentence, after completing his state sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Other courts, while acknowledging the importance of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in determining which sovereign has priority in regard to the service of its sentence, have not viewed the doctrine as altering the plain meaning of the words \"received in custody\" in \u00a7 3585(a), and have allowed credit for the time spent in federal detention. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Free v. Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110827\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/550/\">\n    333 F.3d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2003), the court implicitly reached this conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   , a prisoner had been brought before the federal court on a writ from a state court, sentenced, and mistakenly sent to a federal facility, rather than back to the state, to begin his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 551. After serving six months at the federal facility, the error was discovered and he was sent back to the state to commence his sentence there.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Bureau of Prisons determined that the defendant's federal sentence did not start to run until he completed his state sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintained that his federal sentence should be deemed to have commenced on the date he was first transferred to a federal facility.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 552-53. Further, he claimed that since his federal sentence had commenced before his state sentence, he should be given credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in state custody.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, who determined that Free's federal sentence commenced when he was initially taken into custody because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203585\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) states that, \"a term of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 552. The court, however, did not grant the defendant credit toward his federal conviction for the time he spent in state custody.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . While denying credit to the defendant for the time he spent in state custody, the court noted in respect to the\n   time he originally spent in federal custody that, \"[a]lthough the BOP originally did not give Free credit for these six months, he rightfully and successfully challenged that decision ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 555 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boston v.

The doctrine of primary jurisdiction was developed as a rule of comity between sovereigns to assist them in determining which had priority in terms of whose sentence would be served first when a defendant had charges pending before more than one sovereign. It was not developed to determine when a federal sentence commences.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203585\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) defines when a federal sentence commences, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A sentence to a term of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation to, or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at, the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I submit that, when Johnson was taken into custody by the Marshal upon delivery by the Sheriff on the two occasions involved in this case, it was clearly for the purpose of commencing his federal sentence. The fact that the comity contemplated by the sovereigns failed to work on a particular occasion because of a mistake should not affect Johnson's right to have his sentence commenced under the terms required by the plain meaning of the words set forth in the statute. The sovereign in this case, the federal government, was not deprived of its authority or jurisdiction to act by the primary jurisdiction doctrine, a doctrine of comity only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Having concluded that Johnson should be given credit for the time he actually spent in federal custody, I do not think he is entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in state custody. There is some federal common law authority for the proposition that once a prisoner begins the commencement of his federal sentence, that sentence must continue uninterrupted until completed.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1018588\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/91/260/#p262\">\n    91 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260 ;\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424902\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/301/1175/\">\n    301 F.3d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Johnson was entitled to have his sentence commence on either of the days he was turned over to the Marshal, and if that doctrine were applicable here, he would be entitled to federal credit for the time he spent in state custody after his federal sentence had commenced. However, \"[t]raditionally, the doctrine for credit for time at liberty has only been applied where a convicted person has served some part of his sentence and then been erroneously released.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773077\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/861/#p865\">\n    837 F.2d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (9th Cir. 1988). The court did find the doctrine to be applicable in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , awarding credit toward his federal sentence to the defendant for time spent in state custody after he began his sentence in federal custody and was transferred to state custody before completing his federal sentence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1018588\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/91/260/#p262\">\n    91 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260 ;\n   <em>\n    Weekes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424902\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/301/1175/\">\n    301 F.3d at 1181-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (also concluding that where federal sentence was interrupted by service of state sentence that defendant should receive credit toward federal sentence for time spent in state custody). However, it does not seem to have been regularly applied to a situation such as in this case where Johnson was mistakenly given the opportunity to begin his federal sentence first. Generally, courts have not applied this doctrine in situations where the state\n   had primary jurisdiction and the defendant erroneously began his federal sentence before serving his state sentence and the sovereigns have agreed as a matter of comity that primary jurisdiction should be restored to the first sovereign. Further, courts recently addressing the issue have concluded, in light of this common law doctrine's main purpose, that it has been, or should be, considerably narrowed. For example, while acknowledging the common law rule that a prisoner is entitled to credit where his prison sentence is interrupted through no fault of his own, the court in\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   stated, \"[t]he limited function of this rule is clear. Its sole purpose is to prevent the government from abusing its coercive power to imprison a person by artificially extending the duration of his sentence through releases and re-incarcerations.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110827\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/550/\">\n    333 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching its decision, the court relied on the Seventh Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Dunne v. Keohane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524942\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/335/\">\n    14 F.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1994). In\n   <em>\n    Dunne\n   </em>\n   , the court stated, \"[t]he common law rule has not been successfully invoked for many years, but we are not disposed to question its continued vitality in its core area of application, when the government is trying to delay the expiration of the defendant's sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 336-37. That court further stated, \"[e]ven if reclassification from federal prisoner to state boarder, with no release into the free community might be thought to violate the rule if it resulted in postponing the date at which the prisoner's last sentence must expire, there was no postponement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 337. Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the defendant's sentence was not elongated as a result of his serving the first six months of his federal sentence prior to serving his state sentence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110827\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/550/\">\n    333 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I would reach the same result in regard to the prisoner in this case, give him credit for the time he served in federal custody, but I would find that he is not entitled to credit for the time he spent in state custody. As the court indicated in\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The rule against piecemeal incarceration precludes the government from artificially extending the expiration date of a prison sentence; the rule does not, however, justify or mandate that a prisoner receive a 'get out of jail early' card ... even when the prisoner is not at fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110827\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/550/\">\n    333 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   , the prisoner's sentence in this case was not elongated as a result of the transfer from federal to state custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, I address another concern of the majority: allowing Johnson credit for the time he spent in the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service under the circumstances of this case would be in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203585\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) because he would be receiving credit against both his state and federal sentences. Section 3585(b) permits the Bureau of Prisons to give credit to a defendant \"for certain periods spent in official detention only if the time 'has not been credited against another sentence.' \" However, that section deals with credit for time a defendant has been detained prior to being taken into custody to commence his sentence. It does not address credit for time spent in custody after commencement of a sentence. Furthermore, it is the prerogative of the state, as sovereign, to determine whether it would give Johnson credit for time served in federal custody. In any case, having already concluded that Johnson is not entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in state custody, the dispositive issue here is whether Johnson is entitled to credit toward his federal sentence for the time he mistakenly spent in federal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For all of these reasons, I would REVERSE the decision of the district court and grant Johnson's request for a writ requiring that the Bureau of Prisons give him credit toward his federal sentence for\n   the periods of time from August 7 through November 3, 2009, and December 14, 2009 through February 12, 2010, finding that he had begun his sentence in the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service during those periods. I would find that Johnson is not eligible for credit toward his federal sentence for time served in state custody.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The court explained in\n    <em>\n     Strand v.
