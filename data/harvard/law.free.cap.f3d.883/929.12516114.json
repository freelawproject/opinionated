We repeat here only what is necessary for the present decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   More than two decades ago, LPSC filed a complaint under \u00a7 206(a), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(a), challenging Entergy's allocation of capacity costs among its various operating companies. At the time, Entergy did so on the basis of the companies' total usage at the time of peak demand, regardless of whether the load was \"firm\" (entitling the customer to service at any time) or \"interruptible\" (subject to Entergy's curtailment at any time of insufficient capacity). When Entergy had set these rates, the system was \"awash in capacity\" and projected firm load would have required no more capacity. As a result, charging interruptible load for capacity costs was of comparatively little importance in terms of signaling to customers whether to use firm or interruptible service, or to Entergy whether to invest in more capacity. Over time, however, Entergy's capacity became inadequate to handle all demand; it changed its planning criteria so that, in deciding whether to add capacity, it no longer counted interruptible load.\n   <em>\n    Louisiana I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670552,11546830\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/892/\">\n    184 F.3d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commission initially rejected LPSC's complaint,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C168\">\n    76 FERC \u00b6 61,168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C282\">\n    80 FERC \u00b6 61,282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), but we reversed in\n   <em>\n    Louisiana I\n   </em>\n   . The Commission had in 1981 adopted the principle that costs should be allocated to customers according to the principle of cost causation; we rejected the Commission's explanations for failing to adhere to that principle. As we explained, interruptible customers do not cause the utility to incur capacity costs; by definition, the utility can curtail such service when load exceeds capacity. Charging them for capacity costs thus creates an uneconomic disincentive to the use of interruptible service; customers are dissuaded\n   from using interruptible service even where the utility's costs of providing that service fall well below the potential benefit to the customer. By the same token, to the extent that such a cost allocation relieves\n   <em>\n    firm\n   </em>\n   customers of the burden of covering capacity costs that they do cause the utility to incur, it provides an inadequate disincentive to the choice of such service and signals to the utility more need for adding capacity than really exists.\n   <em>\n    Louisiana I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670552,11546830\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/892/\">\n    184 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   896-97 ; JAMES C.

It ordered the cost allocation changed for the future, but denied LPSC's request for refunds, which \u00a7 206(b), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(b), gave it authority to order for a 15-month period starting at a date set by the Commission at the outset of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Opinion No. 468\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C228\">\n    106 FERC \u00b6 61,228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , PP 60-77, 82-89 (2004),\n   <em>\n    rehearing denied,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opinion 468-A,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C080\">\n    111 FERC \u00b6 61,080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , PP 10-22 (2005). Because Louisiana customers relied on interruptible service in a higher proportion than other Entergy customers, they gained from the ordered future change in cost allocation, and would have gained more from any refund. In a series of orders, the Commission took a considerable variety of positions on refunds, culminating in denial in the orders reviewed in\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   and in the present\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   's conclusion determines our task here.

In such instances (putting aside some filed rate violations), the utility has received no net over-recovery.

First, it would be difficult for the utility to recover its costs fully. The sums that one set of customers lost through allocation of excessive costs will usually be matched by unduly low rates to another set, from whom it would be difficult or inequitable to extract recompense. Second, customer firms that had made operational decisions in reliance on one set of rates would be unable to \"undo\" those transactions retroactively in light of the new, corrected rates; a refund would, at least in part, pull the economic rug out from under those transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present case, LPSC's briefs do not respond to these Commission decisions. Pressed on the point at oral argument, counsel for LPSC offered two purported distinctions. First, counsel observed correctly that several of the cases were under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d. But since \u00a7 205 also provides that the Commission \"may\" require a refund where it finds a rate to have been unjust and unreasonable,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 824d(e), it is unclear why the Commission should disregard its \u00a7 205 cases in the \u00a7 206 context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, counsel noted that many of the cases invoked by the Commission did not involve a holding company, such as Entergy. Counsel failed to explain, however, why that should affect the Commission's general principle as to refunds in rate design cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After oral argument, LPSC directed us to its attempt to distinguish these cases in the run-up to\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   . See Petitioner's Br. at 52-54,\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314465,4285034\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1297/\">\n    772 F.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). But even if these arguments had been renewed before us, we would find them unavailing. In its previous briefing, LPSC emphasized that the cited cases involved situations in which utilities would likely suffer a loss of revenue and an under-recovery of costs. That of course is quite true, as our summary of the cases and the Commission's reasoning make clear. LPSC then argued that the cases did not support the Commission's denial of refunds here.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . That was true in the 2014 case, but is no longer true, because the Commission has-reasonably-changed its position on the feasibility of recoupment by Entergy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the decision under review in 2014, the Commission had-without explanation-disclaimed any reliance on a risk of under-recovery. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=142%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C211\">\n    142 FERC \u00b6 61,211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 63 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314465,4285034\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1297/\">\n    772 F.3d at 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted that many of the cases in which the Commission had refused to order refunds involved at least \"the possibility of under-recovery,\"\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314465,4285034\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1297/\">\n    772 F.3d at 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but, because of the Commission's\n   disclaimer, we found those cases inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commission has now reversed its prior disclaimer and affirmatively explained why there is at least a risk of under-recovery. See\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C120\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , PP 31-32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Commission explained that Entergy sought to recover from retail customers surcharges to pay for certain other refunds previously ordered in this proceeding,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at P 32 ; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C241\">\n    120 FERC \u00b6 61,241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 9 (2007), but the Arkansas Commission rebuffed Entergy, asserting that the surcharges would violate the filed rate doctrine and constitute retroactive ratemaking,\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C120\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 32. As the Commission concedes, the ultimate outcome of the Arkansas Commission proceedings is uncertain (if Entergy prevails, the Arkansas Commission's order will be reversed), but the Commission identifies definite evidence of at least a non-trivial risk of under-recovery-one factor that counsels against the issuance of refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, the Commission offered a convincing answer to our query about the absence of evidence of \"particular decisions\" made in reliance on the old rate structure. First, since the object of sound cost allocation is to influence customer behavior by making those who \"cause\" the incurrence of costs to bear those costs and adjust their consumption accordingly (so that costs will be incurred only up to the point that is justified by customer benefit, evidenced by the customer's willingness to pay), we may fairly infer that their purchase decisions reflected that principle. While we were concerned in 2014 that \"some amount of reliance is likely to be present every time the Commission considers ordering refunds,\"\n   <em>\n    Louisiana III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314465,4285034\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1297/\">\n    772 F.3d at 1305-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it becomes apparent from the cases cited at footnote 58 of the\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   that that is exactly the Commission's point: its general tendency to deny refunds in cost allocation cases stems from the high correlation between such reliance and that type of case. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Black Oak Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C040\">\n    136 FERC \u00b6 61,040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , PP 25-28 (2011);\n   <em>\n    Occidental Chem.

(Of course in cases where there has been over-recovery, the customers will also have rested their decisions on the prices previously applied, but the only customers affected will be ones getting refunds from the utility, and they will obviously not complain despite their inability to alter prior decisions.) Second, LPSC itself, in objecting to Entergy's prior cost allocation system, invoked the desirability of correcting customers' incentives for the purpose of changing their behavior.\n   <em>\n    Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C221\">\n    156 FERC \u00b6 61,221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 62 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C120\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , PP 34-35. That these past economic decisions cannot be revisited also justifies denying refunds here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, under the facts of this case, the Commission noted an additional equity militating against refunds: the disjunction between the beneficiaries of the old regime and those who would have to pay surcharges to ensure that each operating company fully recouped costs retroactively allocated to it.\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C120\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 31. In part this referred to whatever customers might be said to have replaced the earlier era's wholesale customers, which then accounted for about\n   15% of Entergy Arkansas's load but have now almost entirely ceased to buy from Entergy Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Further, given the passage of time, surcharges would fall on current Entergy Arkansas customers for benefits enjoyed by \"past customers, or a prior generation of customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Rehearing Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C221\">\n    156 FERC \u00b6 61,221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 67 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Order on Remand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C120\">\n    155 FERC \u00b6 61,120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , P 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   LPSC argues that the Commission was largely responsible for the lag between LPSC's original complaint and the Commission's most recent orders, and that the turnover in customers can therefore be at least in part laid at the Commission's door. Maybe so. But that would make it no more equitable to now force consumers who neither were at fault nor received any benefit to \"pay back\" consumers who were disadvantaged by the prior rate regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We note that the parties engaged in considerable argument as to the possible effect of \u00a7 206(c), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(c). It provides that in a proceeding \"involving two or more electric utility companies of a registered holding company,\" refunds may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be awarded if they will be paid for \"through an increase in the costs to be paid by other electric utility companies of such registered holding company,\" unless the Commission can determine that \"the registered holding company would not experience any reduction in revenues which results from an inability\" of such electric utility companies of the same holding company \"to recover such increase in costs.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(c)(2). To the extent applicable, of course, the section would require the Commission to deny refunds if it could not conclude that the holding company will not suffer any reduction in revenues. But that is just what the Commission has independently chosen to do under \u00a7 206(b): it denied refunds in part because it could not conclude Entergy would be able to offset any refunds. Because we find that choice reasonable, we need not address the parties' debate over \u00a7 206(c)'s applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The petition for review is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Commission's conclusion that there is a risk of under-recovery rests in part on its interpretation of\n    <em>\n     City of Anaheim v.
