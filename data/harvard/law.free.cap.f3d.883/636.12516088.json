Robbie Ohlendorf and Sandra Adams signed dues checkoff authorizations with their employer in 2013. When they tried to revoke them three years later, they did not follow the protocol for revoking their consent, and the union insisted that they do so. Ohlendorf and Adams sued the union in response. Their putative class action lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief on the ground that the union violated the Act and its duty of fair representation. The district court dismissed the complaint as a matter of law. Because this criminal law does not create a private right of action and because the union did not act arbitrarily or in bad faith, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ohlendorf and Adams worked for Oleson's Food Stores in Michigan. The collective bargaining agreement between Oleson's and Local 876 of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union allowed Oleson's to deduct union dues from their employees' paychecks if the employee signed an authorization form. The form provided that the checkoff authorization would be irrevocable for one year or until the termination date of the agreement, whichever occurred sooner, and thereafter for yearly periods unless revoked by certified mail during a 15-day window each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ohlendorf and Adams joined the union in 2013 and signed the authorization forms. Three years later, they resigned their membership and tried to revoke their permission. But they sent their written revocations by regular mail, not certified mail, and did so outside of the 15-day period for revoking authorization. The union refused to accept the revocations for that year. The company thus continued to deduct union dues from their wages, and the union continued to accept the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ohlendorf and Adams filed a class action against the union, claiming it violated the Labor Management Relations Act by imposing conditions on their ability to revoke their authorizations and violated its duty of fair representation by enforcing those conditions. They sought damages and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed the complaint as a matter of law, prompting this appeal. While the appeal was pending, Adams successfully revoked her authorization and Ohlendorf quit working at Oleson's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Article III of the United States Constitution empowers the federal courts to hear only cases or controversies, U.S. Const. art.

They asked the district court to enjoin the union from enforcing the window-period and certified-mail requirements. But Ohlendorf no longer works for Oleson's and Adams recently revoked her authorization. An injunction on this score thus would not do them any good. While that forward-looking claim is moot, the employees' backward-looking request for damages-the money they paid to the union after the union refused to honor their attempts to revoke-lives on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act makes it a crime for an employer to willfully give money to a labor union,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and for a labor union to willfully accept money from an employer,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 186(b). The prohibition contains several exemptions. Pertinent here, the Act exempts \"money deducted from the wages of employees in payment of membership dues in a labor organization\" if \"the employer has received from each employee, on whose account such deductions are made, a written assignment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 186(c)(4). Under the exception, written assignments \"shall not be irrevocable for a period of more than one year, or beyond the termination date of the applicable collective agreement, whichever occurs sooner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Attorney General has authority to enforce this criminal statute. But he has not done so with respect to these allegations. Nor have Ohlendorf and Adams filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the union or their employer has committed an unfair labor practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   What we have instead is a civil lawsuit filed by Ohlendorf and Adams in federal district court to enforce this criminal statute. That is not an everyday event in the federal courts. Before individuals may file such a lawsuit, they must identify a statutory cause of action that allows them to do so.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Nothing in \u00a7 302 says that private parties may enforce the law.

Why else allow jurisdiction to restrain violations of the law? Two answers. One: The statute creates jurisdiction for the courts to restrain violations of \u00a7 302 at the request of the Attorney General. Having entrusted the Attorney General to protect the public from criminal violations of \u00a7 302, Congress gave the federal courts authority to hear such actions and to permit federal courts (at the behest of the Attorney General) to enjoin violations of this criminal labor law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Two: Section 302(e) provides the courts with jurisdiction to enjoin violations of \u00a7 302 in lawsuits brought under express private rights of action, as a needed exception to the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia\n   Act's ban on labor-dispute injunctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2052\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2052\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 101-115. Consider a couple examples. Suppose that a union files a \u00a7 301 lawsuit (for breach of a collective bargaining agreement) seeking to enforce a provision of a collective bargaining agreement that violates \u00a7 302. In that situation, \u00a7 302(e) gives the court the power to enjoin the union from enforcing the collective bargaining agreement notwithstanding the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v.

Or suppose that an arbitrator finds that an employer breached a provision of a collective bargaining agreement and awards damages to the union. The company might challenge the arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by arguing that the provision of the collective bargaining agreement violates \u00a7 302 and therefore cannot be enforced.

The employees claim that the union's enforcement of the window-period and certified-mail requirements satisfies that standard. One feature of the union's conduct, we must acknowledge, is head scratching. Ohlendorf sent his revocation to the union on June 6, 2016, while Adams sent hers on July 14, 2016. Under their authorization forms, Ohlendorf had between July 2-17, 2016 to revoke his authorization, and Adams had between April 14-29, 2017. We can appreciate why the union might refuse to credit a late revocation. But it makes much less sense to refuse to credit a revocation sent in too early: Why refuse to credit the revocation for the next open period?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Be that as it may, we cannot say that the employees have shown arbitrariness or bad faith. \"[A] union's actions are arbitrary only if, in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's actions, the union's behavior is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational.\"\n   <em>\n    Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v.

The problem with the employees' claim is that they agreed to the window-period and certified-mail requirements when they signed the authorization form. Even if the requirements may seem burdensome, no one forced the employees to sign the checkoff authorizations. Having agreed to the two requirements, they are not in a position to say that the union acted arbitrarily in enforcing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For like reasons, the union's decision to enforce the requirements does not qualify as bad faith. To demonstrate bad faith, a plaintiff must show that the union acted with an improper intent, purpose, or motive encompassing fraud, dishonesty, and other intentionally misleading conduct.\n   <em>\n    Merritt v.

The employees have not met that standard. They do not allege that the union's decision to enforce the requirements was misleading or a product of fraud or dishonesty.
