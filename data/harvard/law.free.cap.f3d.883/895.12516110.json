It has been in operation since 1929 and is currently owned and operated by the Canadian Transit Company, which is wholly owned by the Detroit International Bridge Company (collectively \"the Company\"). The Company decided to build a new span (\"the Twin Span\") in order to allow maintenance of the aging structure of the old span. This appeal involves the Company's effort to have declared invalid a Crossing Agreement entered into in 2012 by Michigan State officials and the Government of Canada to build another bridge, within two miles of the Ambassador Bridge. The Company appeals the dismissal of four counts of its complaint and the grant of summary judgment on one count, raising statutory challenges and one constitutional objection.

Finding no such error, we conclude the district court properly granted summary judgment on Count 7 of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Secretary invited the Governor to explain whether Michigan State officials had legal authority to execute the Crossing\n   Agreement, and received a letter from a Counsel to the Governor attaching a letter from a Deputy State Attorney General. Both letters represented that the Governor, the Michigan Department of Transportation, and the Michigan Strategic Fund did not require legislative approval to enter into the Crossing Agreement, and that the Crossing Agreement was valid under Michigan state law, including the Urban Cooperation Act. The Secretary relied on these letters in responding to public comments and that response was attached to the Record of Decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Cmts., ROD, App. A. The Company objects that the letters contain only conclusory statements and states that the Secretary should have relied instead on letters from State legislators casting doubt on the authority of the Michigan officials to enter the Crossing Agreement. These objections do not, for purposes of Section 3, diminish the adequacy of the Secretary's inquiry or the correctness of the legal advice received, much less show that the Secretary was arbitrary and capricious in relying on the legal advice from the Office of the State Attorney General and Counsel to the Governor. The Secretary explained that the Michigan Attorney General \"speaks authoritatively on Michigan law[,]\" Resp. to Cmts., ROD, App. A at 4, and the Company does not show that relying on that legal advice was a clear error in judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Notably, this is not a case in which the Michigan Supreme Court had spoken on the state-law question to the contrary or where there was evidence that the Crossing Agreement was facially invalid.

Additionally, the Company fails to show that the Crossing Agreement is plainly invalid under Michigan law. For instance, the Company maintains that the Crossing Agreement violates the Urban Cooperation Act of 1967, which provides that Michigan agencies can exercise only powers they share in common with other agencies or possess independently,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20124.504\">\n    Mich.

Moreover, Michigan State legislative records indicate the legislature's concern was that Michigan not bear the costs of the new bridge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Mich.%20Pub.%20Acts%2059\">\n    2013 Mich.

The Company emphasizes that the 1972 Report of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs states that the IBA legislation \"should not be construed to adversely affect the rights of those operating bridges previously authorized by the Congress to repair, replace, or enlarge existing bridges,\" H.R. REP. NO. 92-1303 at 3-4 (Aug. 3, 1972), understanding this to mean that its \"perpetual right to operate the Ambassador Bridge includes the right to build the Twin Span,\" Applt's Br. 59. The Company also emphasizes that between 1998 and 2008, Congress appropriated \"hundreds of millions of dollars for the Ambassador Bridge Gateway Project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Am.

Approving the new bridge, the Company maintains, makes it economically impossible to build the Twin Span and thereby thwarts the will of Congress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Stat.%20535\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Approval of the Crossing Agreement does not violate any rights Congress conferred on the Company and its predecessors in ownership of the Ambassador Bridge by the 1921 Act and subsequent appropriation acts for the Twin Span. The district court therefore properly dismissed Counts 2 and 3 of the complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Although Congress has authorized the private maintenance and operation of the Ambassador Bridge and funded aspects of the Twin Span project from federal funds, its enactments do not vest in the Company public rights beyond those that Congress specified.

The Court affirmed denial of the requested injunction, reasoning that in authorizing the company to operate its bridge, the Massachusetts legislature had not specified a right to exclusivity and \"[i]n grants by the public, nothing passes by implication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 421-423, 553 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

But it has pointed to nothing to show that Congress intended the Ambassador Bridge to be perpetually profitable for its owners.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   Applt's Br. 61. Failing to find an explicit statement in statutory text, the Company turns to legislative history. Even assuming such\n   history could support a claim to an exclusive franchise, the Company overreads that history. For instance, the 1972 House Committee Report stated that the IBA should not \"adversely affect\" bridge owners' rights to \"repair, replace, or enlarge existing bridges,\" H.R. REP. NO. 92-1303 at 3-4 (Aug. 3, 1972), but neither implies an exclusive right to span the Detroit River nor mentions any right to maintain and operate the Ambassador Bridge profitably. Similarly, the 2002 House Committee Report stated that the funds appropriated by Congress should be used to \"protect plans\" for the Twin Span, not to protect profitable operation of the Ambassador Bridge, much less to do so in perpetuity. H.R. REP. NO. 107-722 at 101 (2002). Even if Congress could be deemed to have assumed its actions would help to ensure maintenance of a viable river crossing, the Company has not shown Congress granted it an express right to operate the Ambassador Bridge profitably, and such a right cannot be implied from the statutory text or legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n   The Company challenges the dismissal of its non-delegation claim, Count 1, regarding the delegation in Section 3 of the IBA to the Secretary of State, on the ground that Congress provided no intelligible principle to apply.
