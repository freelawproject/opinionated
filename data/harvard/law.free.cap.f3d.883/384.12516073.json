Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, Elliott asserts that the district court erroneously denied her motion to remand based on ASIC's alleged untimely filing for notice of removal, arguing that the period for filing commences when a statutory agent is served. She also asserts that diversity jurisdiction does not exist because the case should be properly treated as a \"direct action\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Last, Elliott argues that the district court erroneously granted ASIC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 16, 2013, Elliott was in an automobile accident with Michael Jones. Elliott suffered serious, painful, and permanent bodily injuries as a result of the accident. At the time of the accident, Elliott's vehicle was insured by ASIC. Her policy included underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage of $100,000, less any amount she recovered under another policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones had liability coverage up to $30,000 with State Farm Insurance Company (\"State Farm\"). Elliott submitted a settlement demand package to State Farm, alleging $234,847 in total damages and alleging that Jones's negligence caused the accident. State Farm paid her the policy limit of $30,000. Elliott submitted the same claim to ASIC with a settlement demand to recover the $70,000 limit in UIM benefits remaining under her policy. ASIC declined to make any offer to settle the claim. In response, Elliott advised ASIC that she was \"compelled to institute litigation to recover amounts due\" under her UIM policy. J.A. 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 8, 2014, Elliott initiated a lawsuit to recover damages against Jones (\"\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Jones\n   </em>\n   \") in Superior Court in Durham County, North Carolina, and ASIC exercised its statutory right as a\n   UIM carrier to defend the\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Jones\n   </em>\n   lawsuit as an unnamed party. The lawsuit was referred to arbitration, in accordance with Elliott's insurance policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and an arbitration hearing was held on February 2, 2016. Elliott alleges that ASIC made \"token offers\" to settle at some point between the filing of the lawsuit and the arbitration hearing, and that these offers were \"substantially less than the amount of UIM coverage ultimately recovered ....\" J.A. 19. Elliott rejected these offers. On February 9, 2016, an arbitration award was rendered in Elliott's favor in the amount of $90,000 plus prejudgment interests and costs. On March 1, 2016, in accordance with the arbitration award, the Superior Court entered a judgment in\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Jones\n   </em>\n   for Elliott in the amount of $68,010.17, after deducting the $30,000 which State Farm had already paid. ASIC subsequently paid the full amount of this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Elliott then instituted this action against ASIC in Superior Court in Durham County, North Carolina, alleging that ASIC's handling of her UIM claim-specifically, forcing her to initiate arbitration in order for ASIC to settle the claim-constituted an unfair claims settlement practice in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2058-63-15\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 58-63-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11), and thus, as a matter of law, an unfair and deceptive trade practice in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She further asserts that she is entitled to recover damages from ASIC for this violation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-16\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Elliott served the summons and complaint on the Commissioner of Insurance of North Carolina (the \"Commissioner\"), ASIC's statutorily required agent for service of process; the Commissioner accepted service via certified mail on August 12, 2016. On August 24, 2016, ASIC received the summons and complaint from the Commissioner. On September 23, 2016, ASIC removed the action to the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. ASIC filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Elliott filed a motion to remand on the basis of both untimely filing for removal and lack of diversity jurisdiction. The district court subsequently denied Elliott's motion to remand and granted ASIC's motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Elliott raises three distinct arguments. First, she asserts that the district court erred in denying her motion to remand because she claims that ASIC's filing for removal was untimely. At issue is when the filing period commences if the defendant's statutory agent for service of process is served instead of the defendant. Second, Elliott asserts that the district court erred in determining that the parties were diverse and argues that federal jurisdiction does not exist. Here, she argues that this action by an insured against her insurance company is a \"direct action\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), and thus that ASIC should be deemed to be a resident of the state in which she is a resident, which would destroy complete diversity and eliminate the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court. Finally, she asserts that the district court erred in granting ASIC's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon\n   which relief can be granted. We reject each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first address Elliott's assertion that the district court erroneously denied her motion to remand after incorrectly determining that ASIC timely filed notice of removal. Elliott argues that ASIC's period for filing for removal began when she served the Commissioner because the Commissioner was not simply ASIC's statutory agent and that, even if he were, the removal period begins when a statutory agent is served rather than when the defendant actually receives the complaint. Elliott's claims have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo, including a district court's denial of a motion to remand.\n   <em>\n    Mayes v.

Doubts about the propriety of removal should be resolved in favor of remanding the case to state court and in doing so, removal statutes must be strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    Barbour v. Int'l Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204353\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/599/#p605\">\n    640 F.3d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before addressing the question of when the period for filing commences when a statutory agent is served, we must consider whether ASIC's agent for service of process was a statutory agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A \"statutory agent\" is \"[a]n agent designated by law to receive litigation documents and other legal notices for a nonresident corporation.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). An \"agency by operation of law\" is \"[a]n agency that arises under circumstances specified by law without mutual consent between the principal and the agent having been manifested.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204353\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/599/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, a \"process agent\" or \"registered agent\" is defined as \"a person authorized to accept service of process on behalf of another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In order to do business in North Carolina, North Carolina law requires that all foreign or alien insurance companies, including ASIC, file an instrument appointing the Commissioner of Insurance of North Carolina as the company's agent for service of process.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2058-16-5\">\n    N.C.

Stat. \u00a7 58-16-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In complying with this statutory requirement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ASIC's Board of Directors adopted a resolution nominating the Commissioner as its agent to accept service of process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elliott contends that ASIC's resolution appointing the Commissioner as its agent for service of process demonstrates\n   that ASIC authorized the Commissioner in this role such that the Commissioner is a registered agent rather than a statutory agent. This argument is unavailing, as the statute plainly requires this appointment. It is also irrelevant that ASIC's resolution states that it \"expressly agree[s] that any and all lawful processes against it which may be served upon said Insurance Commissioner, or his successor, shall be deemed valid personal service upon said company and shall be the same force and validity as if served upon said company,\" J.A. 85, because the statute required the same,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2058-16-5\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 58-16-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"service upon the Commissioner is sufficient service upon the company\"). Thus, the record does not indicate that ASIC provided the Commissioner with any agency or authority to act on its behalf in any way other than what was required under North Carolina law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because North Carolina law requires ASIC to appoint and authorize the Commissioner as its agent for service of process as a condition of writing insurance in the state, and because this was the only authority ASIC provided the Commissioner, we conclude that the Commissioner was merely ASIC's statutory agent for service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having concluded that the Commissioner is a statutory agent, we now consider whether the filing period commences when the statutory agent is served, as Elliott argues, or when the defendant receives the complaint, as ASIC argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The relevant removal statute provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within 30 days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In this case, Elliott formally served ASIC by serving the Commissioner, ASIC's statutory agent for service of process, simultaneously with the summons and complaint via certified mail. The Commissioner accepted the service on August 12, 2016. ASIC actually received the summons and complaint from the Commissioner on August 24, 2016. ASIC filed its notice of removal on September 23, 2016. Thus, ASIC removed the action more than thirty days from service on the Commissioner, but less than thirty days from when ASIC actually received the complaint from the Commissioner. Elliott argues that the 30-day time frame for filing notice of removal began when she served the Commissioner, and that ASIC therefore missed the removal deadline laid out in \u00a7 1446(b). Consequently, she argues, the district court should have remanded the case back to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The general rule, as established by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Murphy Brothers\n   </em>\n   , is that the time for counting the days for filing notice of removal under \u00a7 1446(b) starts when the defendant is formally served with the summons and complaint making the defendant an official party to the action and requiring the defendant to appear.\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p347\">\n    526 U.S. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347-48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p347\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p347\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (holding that defendant's informal receipt of the complaint did not start the time for filing). However, the parties do not cite and we have not found published authority in this circuit or any other addressing\n   whether the 30-day period for filing notice of removal in \u00a7 1446(b) is triggered by service on a statutory agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We have, however, had occasion to address this question in an unpublished opinion. In\n   <em>\n    Gordon v. Hartford Fire Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , as here, the defendant filed notice of removal within 30 days of actually receiving the complaint, but not within 30 days of service on its statutory agent for service of process.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Fed.%20Appx.%20476\">\n    105 Fed.Appx. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480 (4th Cir. 2004). Rejecting the plaintiff's contention that the case should have been remanded for untimely filing for notice of removal, we stated that \"the overwhelming majority of district courts to consider the question have held that '[w]hen service is effected on a statutory agent, rather than on an agent appointed by the defendant, the time to remove the action to federal court does not start to run until the defendant actually has received a copy of the complaint.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Fed.%20Appx.%20476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lilly v.

The defendant must file the notice of removal within thirty days of service.\"). However, Elliott does not cite and we cannot find a single controlling case involving service on a statutory agent that supports her view. Additionally, we find her argument about the plain meaning of the statute unavailing, as the statute itself says nothing about service on a statutory agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1446(b) (defendant must file for removal \"within 30 days after the\n   <em>\n    receipt by the defendant\n   </em>\n   , through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although we believe a straightforward reading of the statute supports holding that the 30-day period for submitting notice of removal in \u00a7 1446(b) is not triggered by service on a statutory agent, our understanding of the congressional intent of this statute also informs our analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

Under the original version of the statute, however, disparities in time limits still existed between the states because states defined \"commencement of the action\" differently. In some states, the period for filing for removal could expire before the defendant obtained the complaint or before the complaint was ever filed. For example, in New York, a plaintiff could commence an action by service of the summons, without ever serving or filing a complaint, allowing the time limit for filing notice of removal to expire before the complaint was even filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shoemaker v.

Specifically, Elliott contends that ASIC violated \u00a7 58-63-15(11) when it \"did not attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement of [her] claims in which liability had become reasonably clear,\" J.A. 19 (quoting \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(f) ); when it \"compelled [her] to institute litigation to recover amounts due under the UIM provisions of her ... insurance policy\" by first refusing to offer any amount of UIM payment and then making \"token offers\" preceding arbitration that were \"substantially less than the amount of UIM coverage ultimately recovered,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20S.E.2d%20269\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(g) ); and when it \"attempted to settle [her] claim for an amount of UIM coverage less than the amount ... a reasonable person would have believed Elliott was entitled to recover,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (quoting \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(h) ). ASIC argues that Elliott failed to plausibly state a claim under either statute because state law does not mandate settlement of a UIM claim before liability is established and because, here, liability was established in arbitration and ASIC paid the arbitration award once entered. Additionally, ASIC argues that there can be no violation of \u00a7 75-1.1 because Elliott has failed to allege any injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   UIM coverage is only triggered in certain circumstances.

Therefore, under state law, a plaintiff is legally entitled to recover under a UIM policy only once a judgment is issued against the underinsured motorist determining liability and damages owed to the plaintiff. ASIC was thus not required to settle Elliott's UIM claim until after it was determined that Elliott was legally entitled to recover from Jones-i.e., until after judgment was entered in\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Jones\n   </em>\n   . With this in mind, we address Elliott's specific arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Elliott asserts that ASIC's conduct violates Section 58-63-15(11)(f), (g), and (h). Section 58-63-15(11)(f) prohibits \"[n]ot attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims\n   <em>\n    in which liability has become reasonably clear\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added). We conclude that Elliott did not plausibly state a claim upon which relief can be granted based on this subsection because liability did not become reasonably clear until after a judgment was entered in\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , and, consequently, ASIC had no obligation to settle Elliott's claim before this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 58-63-15(11)(g) prohibits \"[c]ompelling [the] insured to institute litigation to recover\n   <em>\n    amounts due under an insurance policy\n   </em>\n   by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in actions brought by such insured ....\" (emphasis added). Elliott contends ASIC violated this subsection by first refusing to offer any settlement under the UIM policy, and then making \"token offers\" preceding arbitration. As with her claim under \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(f), however, we conclude that Elliott did not plausibly state a claim upon which relief can be granted based on this subsection because no amount was due to Elliott until liability had been determined, and, consequently, ASIC's alleged failure to make higher settlement offers prior to that time does not violate the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 58-63-15(11)(h) prohibits \"[a]ttempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable man would have believed he was entitled ....\" In her complaint, Elliott alleges that ASIC violated this subsection by attempting to settle the claim for less than the amount of UIM coverage provided by her policy. In her brief to this Court, she explains that it \"can be reasonably inferred\" that the amount she ultimately recovered is \" 'the amount to which a reasonable man would have believed [she] was entitled' to recover,\" and that initially making no offer and later making \"token offers\" consequently violated \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(h). Reply Br. 23 (quoting \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(h) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This argument has no merit, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Elliott. First, Elliott has not alleged any facts indicating that a reasonable person would have believed she was entitled to either the maximum coverage provided under the policy, or the amount ultimately recovered,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the fact or\n   amount of liability had been determined. The mere fact of having UIM coverage does not entitle the insured to recover at all, or to recover the maximum amount of coverage. This is particularly true when the fact of liability has not been conclusively determined and, thus, a reasonable person should not believe they are entitled to a settlement offer for such an amount. Additionally, it cannot be that an insurance company per se engages in an unfair or deceptive trade practice simply because the settlement offers made are less than the final judgment rendered-especially when, as here, the amount to which Elliott was entitled was first determined in arbitration, after all settlement offers had been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204338352\">\n    2010 WL 4338352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (\"North Carolina law establishes the amount of the claim as that which could be recovered from the [ ] motorist in tort, and this had not been established at the time of defendant's settlement offers.\" (first citing\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20S.E.2d%20829\">\n    204 S.E.2d at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , then citing\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20S.E.2d%20455\">\n    374 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   456 ) ).
