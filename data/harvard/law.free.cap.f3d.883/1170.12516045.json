The district court dismissed Elmakhzoumi's petition for failure to state a claim because Elmakhzoumi had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was therefore ineligible for naturalization. Elmakhzoumi argues that the district court erred in holding that his conviction for sodomy where the victim was unable to consent, in violation of California Penal Code (\"CPC\") \u00a7 286(i), is an aggravated felony as a rape offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A).

On June 3, 2005, the California Superior Court convicted Elmakhzoumi of sodomy where the victim cannot consent, in violation of CPC \u00a7 286(i). On July 25, 2012, the United States Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against Elmakhzoumi, alleging that he was removable\n   because his sodomy conviction was a \"crime of violence\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F). The immigration judge terminated those proceedings, ruling that Elmakhzoumi's conviction was not a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 11, 2014, Elmakhzoumi applied to naturalize as a United States citizen. USCIS denied his application on the ground that he could not meet the requirement for naturalization of having good moral character because his sodomy conviction was a rape offense and therefore an aggravated felony within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Elmakhzoumi petitioned the district court for de novo review. The court dismissed the petition for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, holding that a violation of CPC \u00a7 286(i) falls within the generic definition of \"rape\" for purposes of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), as stated in\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199460\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1057/\">\n    217 F.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Elmakhzoumi appeals, arguing that non-consensual sodomy, as described by CPC \u00a7 286(i), is not rape within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A), and therefore is not an aggravated felony.

A person who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43), cannot meet this requirement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(8), and thus is permanently ineligible for naturalization. Under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), the crime of \"rape\" is an aggravated felony. To determine whether a violation of CPC \u00a7 286(i) falls within the INA's definition of \"rape,\" courts \"must define the term rape by 'employing the ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning' of that word and then determine whether or not the conduct prohibited by [the statute] falls within that common, everyday definition.\"\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199460\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1057/\">\n    217 F.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   California defines \"sodomy\" as \"sexual conduct consisting of contact between the penis of one person and the anus of another person. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime of sodomy.\" CPC \u00a7 286(a). Elmakhzoumi was convicted of sodomy under circumstances where \"the victim is prevented from resisting by an intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused.\" CPC \u00a7 286(i). In\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   , we defined \"rape,\" as used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A), to \"include the act of engaging in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with a person whose ability to resist has been substantially impaired by drugs or other intoxicants.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199460\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1057/\">\n    217 F.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court applied that definition and ruled that it \"applie[d] in full to the statutory definition of [Elmakhzoumi]'s crimes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Elmakhzoumi argues that the\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   definition does not apply to CPC \u00a7 286(i) because the underlying conviction in that case was for a violation of CPC \u00a7 261(a)(3), which proscribes nonconsensual acts of \"sexual intercourse.\" Because California law distinguishes between \"an act of sexual intercourse\" in its rape statute,\n   CPC \u00a7 261, and \"sodomy\" in its sodomy statute, CPC \u00a7 286, Elmakhzoumi argues, the definition of \"rape\" in\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   applies only to statutes involving \"an act of sexual intercourse.\" Non-consensual sodomy, he asserts, does not fall within the generic definition of \"rape\" because it is not an act of sexual intercourse. Elmakhzoumi further argues that courts should look instead to federal rape statutes for a generic definition of \"rape.\" But we have explicitly rejected the use of federal statutes to determine the generic definition of \"rape\" under the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199460\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1057/\">\n    217 F.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he definition of rape under federal law simply has no bearing on whether [Petitioner]'s state conviction constitutes an 'aggravated felony' for purposes of establishing his deportability.\"). Moreover, the definition of \"rape\" articulated in\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   includes all conduct prohibited by CPC \u00a7 286(i) and therefore applies to Elmakhzoumi's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The generic definition of \"sexual intercourse\" includes acts of sodomy. The fact that California has enacted separate statutory provisions for \"rape,\" prohibiting non-consensual vaginal intercourse, and \"sodomy,\" prohibiting nonconsensual anal intercourse, is irrelevant so long as the entirety of the conduct covered by each statute falls within the generic definition. In\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   , we looked to Black's Law Dictionary to find the \"ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning\" of the term \"rape.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199460\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1057/\">\n    217 F.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That same resource defines \"intercourse\" as not limited to vaginal intercourse, but inclusive of any \"[p]hysical sexual contact, esp[ecially] involving the penetration of the vagina by the penis.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). California law defines \"sodomy\" as physical sexual contact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPC \u00a7 286(a) (\"sexual conduct\" that involves \"[a]ny sexual penetration\"). Further, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") recently issued\n   <em>\n    In re Keeley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20146\">\n    27 I. &amp; N. Dec. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147-52 (B.I.A. 2017), which includes a comprehensive overview of the ordinary and contemporary definition of \"rape\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A) as it existed when the term was used in the immigration code in 1996. After an exhaustive survey of state rape and sexual assault laws, the BIA concluded that the generic definition of \"rape\" includes, at a minimum, \"acts of vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the generic definition of \"rape\" articulated in\n   <em>\n    Castro-Baez\n   </em>\n   includes non-consensual acts of anal intercourse, violations of CPC \u00a7 286(i) qualify as rape offenses under the INA.
