Because the award is not \"mutual, final, and definite\" as required by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), we reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 1, 1987, the predecessors of Sprint and Norfolk Southern entered into a License Agreement. Under the Agreement, Norfolk Southern granted Sprint the right to use certain of Norfolk Southern's railroad rights of way for Sprint's fiber optic telecommunications system for an initial term of 25 years. The License Agreement expired on June 30, 2012, but Sprint exercised its right to renew it for an additional 25-year period. This appeal stems from the parties' disagreement over the amount Sprint must pay Norfolk Southern to continue to use the railroad rights of way during the new 25-year term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 2.2.2 of the Agreement outlines the agreed procedure for establishing this payment amount. It provides that, if the parties disagree on the amount, Sprint will select an appraiser to submit an estimate of the amount due. If Norfolk Southern rejects that estimate, it will hire its own appraiser, who will in turn submit his or her estimate. Section 2.2.2 further provides that if the two appraisers cannot agree on the amount due, they will select a third appraiser to broker a compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the parties' respective appraisers disagreed as to the amount due, they followed these procedures and appointed Charles Argianas as the third appraiser. Argianas, unclear as to how he should proceed in his role as the third appraiser, asked the parties for guidance. The joint response from Sprint and Norfolk Southern instructed Argianas to seek a compromise with one (or both) of the other appraisers. Only if he was unable to do so should he perform his own appraisal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 11, 2014, after consulting with the parties' appraisers, Argianas emailed the parties a document titled \"Majority Decision for Settlement Purposes Subject to Extraordinary Appraisal Assumptions.\" This Majority Decision sets forth the compromise Argianas had reached with Norfolk Southern's appraiser. The Majority Decision lists a dollar amount ($6,100,000) and refers to Article 2.2.2 of the Agreement. It explains that Argianas and Norfolk Southern's appraiser had assented to this Majority Decision but that Argianas \"reserve[d] his assent without prejudice or time limitation subject to the following extraordinary appraisal assumptions: 1) Norfolk Southern in fact has marketable title of the occupancy corridor; and 2) [Norfolk Southern's appraiser's] ATF value is reasonable, which it appears to be.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority Decision further states that \"[i]f either of these extraordinary assumptions are found to not be true, Argianas ... reserves the right to withdraw\n   his assent.\" Norfolk Southern accepted the payment amount contained in the Majority Decision and promptly billed Sprint for that amount. Sprint found the amount unacceptable and refused to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rather than resolving the matter, the Majority Decision led to further disputes that played out in parallel tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sprint filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") pursuant to Section 20.5 of the Agreement, which provides that certain disputes related to the Agreement will be settled through AAA arbitration. In its demand for AAA arbitration, Sprint claimed Norfolk Southern had \"unilaterally terminated\" the Section 2.2.2 process before that process had run its course such that no final determination had been issued as to the amount Sprint owed. Sprint asked the AAA panel to determine the amount Sprint owed-even though the parties had already spent significant time and effort attempting to resolve that same question pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 2.2.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern brought this action against Sprint in the federal district court, seeking enforcement of the Majority Decision as a final and binding arbitration award. Because Section 2.2.2 of the Agreement provided the procedures for establishing the payment amount, Norfolk Southern maintained that the arbitration provision contained in Section 20.5 did not apply. Accordingly, Norfolk Southern asked the district court to enter a judgment against Sprint for breach of contract, declare the Majority Decision final and binding, and stay the AAA arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thus, at this stage, the dispute between the parties had three essential components. First, the parties disputed whether the Majority Decision constituted a final and binding arbitration award and whether Sprint had breached its contractual obligations by refusing to pay the amount established by the Majority Decision. Second, they disagreed as to the appropriate forum for resolving this dispute. Sprint argued that, pursuant to Section 20.5 of the License Agreement, disputes related to the Majority Decision must be settled through AAA arbitration; Norfolk Southern maintained that Section 20.5 did not apply to claims raised by Sprint and that the parties should proceed in district court. Finally, the parties disagreed as to who should decide whether the parties should proceed in district court or in AAA arbitration proceedings. Sprint asserted that the AAA arbitrators convened under Section 20.5 must decide that question while Norfolk Southern contended the district court must provide the answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the procedural question-who should decide whether Section 20.5 applies to the dispute-Sprint appeared to have won the day in the district court. On August 21, 2015, without explanation, the district court stayed the litigation initiated by Norfolk Southern so that the AAA arbitration demanded by Sprint could proceed. However, the panel of AAA arbitrators then issued a decision favorable to Norfolk Southern. In particular, the AAA panel found that the Majority Decision constituted a final and binding arbitration award, which Sprint could challenge in court under\n   narrow grounds provided in the FAA-and not in subsequent AAA arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the AAA panel issued its decision, Norfolk Southern moved to confirm the Majority Decision in district court pursuant to the FAA, and Sprint moved to vacate it. Given the AAA panel's conclusion that the Majority Decision was an arbitration award, Norfolk Southern claimed the only question for the district court was whether the award passed muster under the deferential standard of review outlined in the FAA. It appears that Sprint agreed, because, although it attacked the award on other FAA grounds, it never urged the court to hold that the Majority Decision was not an arbitration award. The district court granted Norfolk Southern's motion to confirm the Majority Decision and denied Sprint's motion to vacate it. Sprint then noted this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the parties focus their dispute on whether the district court erred in concluding the Majority Decision was a \"final\" arbitration award under the FAA. Neither party claims that the Majority Decision is not an FAA arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A district court may vacate an arbitration award only if the arbitrators \"exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).

Argianas \"reserve[d] his assent\" to the award \"subject to\" two \"extraordinary appraisal assumptions\"-that Norfolk Southern had marketable title and that the ATF value used by Norfolk Southern's appraiser was reasonable. To be sure, an arbitration award can be \"final\" even if based on assumptions. For instance, the award might have been \"final\" if Argianas had merely assumed Norfolk Southern held marketable title and then proceeded on the basis of that assumption. However, critically, in the text of the award itself, Argianas reserved his assent \"without prejudice or time limitation\" if either of these two \"assumptions\" ever proved to be incorrect. That is, Argianas made clear that he might withdraw his assent-thus dissolving the compromise and the arbitration award itself-at some point in the future. Argianas did not merely base his assent on certain assumptions, but rather\n   <em>\n    reserved the right to withdraw\n   </em>\n   his assent if his assumptions proved to be incorrect. This outcome cannot be squared with any conception of \"finality.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gas Aggregation Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9336157\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/1060/#p1069\">\n    319 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting an award is not \"final\" if conditioned on the outcome of future court proceedings);\n   <em>\n    Sunshine Mining Co. v.

Accordingly, the interpretation of Argianas, one of the two appraisers who signed the Majority Decision, as to the scope of issues submitted deserves deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514204\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/276/#p278\">\n    973 F.2d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The arbitrator's interpretation of the scope of the issue submitted is entitled to deference and must be upheld so long as it is rationally derived from the parties' submission.\"). This deference seems particularly appropriate given that neither of the other appraisers appears to have suggested that Argianas's assumptions involved issues not within the scope of his authority. Here, Argianas could have simply concluded that title issues and ATF values were outside the scope of issues he was to consider. Instead, he linked his assent to the Majority Decision to those two issues by reserving the right to withdraw that assent should his assumptions about those two issues prove untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, we cannot conclude the Majority Decision constituted a \"final\" award under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We briefly address two other issues raised by Sprint that might arise in future proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, Sprint claims the district court also erred in confirming the Majority Decision, because it contains an ambiguity rendering it unenforceable. According to Sprint, the Majority Decision's failure to provide clearly that the $6,100,000 amount constitutes an annual payment renders it unenforceable. A court may vacate an award if it is so unclear or ambiguous that the court cannot engage in meaningful review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raymond James Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219210\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/183/#p191\">\n    596 F.3d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (4th Cir. 2010). For example, an award may be ambiguous if it is subject to two opposing and equally valid interpretations. That is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The text of the Majority Decision does not explicitly clarify this issue-which certainly would have been preferable-but in context, it is plain that the $6,100,000 amount refers to an annual payment. Other sections of the License Agreement refer to annual payments. The appraisers selected by Norfolk Southern and Sprint, respectively, both proposed dollar amounts that would be paid annually. If the $6,100,000 amount were interpreted as the total amount due over the 25-year renewal period, the resulting annual payments would be a fraction of what the appraisers for both parties proposed. Only if the $6,100,000 represents an annual payment does it fall between the proposals from the two other appraisers and thus provide a basis for the compromise outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Sprint claims that we must vacate the Majority Decision, because Argianas based his decision on an improper reason. According to Sprint, although Argianas believed that the payment amount offered by Sprint's appraiser was more accurate than that offered by Norfolk Southern's appraiser, Argianas nonetheless reached a compromise with Norfolk Southern's appraiser, because Argianas doubted the approach endorsed by Sprint's appraiser would withstand judicial scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A court may vacate an arbitration award \"if 'the arbitrator acts outside the scope of his contractually delegated authority' [by] issuing an award that 'simply reflects his own notions of economic justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Oxford Health Plans LLC v.

That did not occur here. The Majority Decision addresses the rental renewal rate and bases its conclusions on an interpretation of Section 2.2.2.
