Carlton &amp; Harris argues that the district court erred in declining to defer to a 2006 Rule promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") interpreting certain provisions of the TCPA.

PDR Network is a company that \"delivers health knowledge products and services\" to healthcare providers. J.A. 33. Among other things, PDR Network publishes the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   , a widely-used compendium of prescribing information for various prescription drugs.

It argued that the fax offering the free e-book could not be considered an unsolicited advertisement as a matter of law because it did not offer anything for sale. In response, Carlton &amp; Harris pointed to a 2006 FCC Rule interpreting the term \"unsolicited advertisement.\" Pursuant to its statutory authority to \"prescribe regulations to implement the requirements\" of the TCPA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the FCC promulgated a rule providing that \"facsimile messages that promote goods or services even at no cost ... are unsolicited advertisements under the TCPA's definition.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991; Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2025%2C967\">\n    71 Fed. Reg. 25,967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25,973 (May 3, 2006) (the \"2006 FCC Rule\"). Carlton &amp; Harris argued that the fax it received was an unsolicited advertisement as defined in the 2006 FCC Rule because it promoted a good at no cost. Moreover, Carlton &amp; Harris argued that the district court was obligated to follow the 2006 FCC Rule pursuant to the Hobbs Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court disagreed. The court held that the Hobbs Act did not compel the court to defer to \"the FCC's interpretation of an unambiguous statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlton &amp; Harris Chiropractic, Inc. v.

W. Va. Sept. 30, 2016). The district court considered the TCPA's own definition of \"unsolicited advertisement\" \"clear and easy to apply,\" and thus held that it was not required to follow the 2006 FCC Rule and \"decline[d] to defer\" to it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205799301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

The district court further held that even under the 2006 FCC Rule, PDR Network's fax was still not an advertisement because the rule requires an advertisement to have a \"commercial aim,\" and no such aim existed here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the district court concluded that Carlton &amp; Harris had not stated a valid claim under the TCPA and granted PDR Network's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The question presented is whether and when a fax that offers a free good or service constitutes an advertisement under the TCPA. To resolve it, we must answer two more: first, must a district court defer to an FCC interpretation of the TCPA? And if so, what is the meaning of \"unsolicited advertisement\" under the 2006 FCC Rule? We address these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The TCPA defines \"unsolicited advertisement\" to include \"any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person's prior express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). In a typical case of statutory interpretation where an agency rule is involved, the familiar\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework requires a court to first ask whether the underlying statute is ambiguous (\"step one\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    467 U.S. at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Cty., Md. v.

Thus, it declined to defer to the FCC interpretation. We conclude, however, that the Hobbs Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , precluded the district court from even reaching the step-one question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Hobbs Act, also known as the Administrative Orders Review Act, provides a mechanism for judicial review of certain administrative orders, including \"all final orders of the Federal Communications Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202342\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A party aggrieved by such an order may challenge it by filing a petition in the court of appeals for the judicial circuit where the petitioner resides or has its principal office, or in the Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Similarly, \"free\" publications are often part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property, goods, or services. For instance, while the publication itself may be offered at no cost to the facsimile recipient, the products promoted within the publication are often commercially available. Based on this, it is reasonable to presume that such messages describe the \"quality of any property, goods, or services.\" Therefore, facsimile communications regarding such free goods and services, if not purely \"transactional,\" would require the sender to obtain the recipient's permission beforehand, in the absence of an EBR [established business relationship].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The rule also distinguishes messages promoting free goods or services, which are unsolicited advertisements, from communications \"that contain only information, such as industry news articles, legislative updates, or employee benefit information,\" which are not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874007\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/271/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandusky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230704\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/218/\">\n    788 F.3d at 223-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The district court concluded that even under the 2006 FCC Rule, PDR Network's fax was not an advertisement because the rule includes only faxes with a \"commercial aim.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlton &amp; Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205799301\">\n    2016 WL 5799301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. The district court attempted to \"harmonize[ ] the FCC interpretation with the plain meaning of the TCPA\" and concluded that a \"blanket ban on any fax that offers a free good or service without any commercial aspect either directly or indirectly obviates the eminently rational purpose to the FCC's guidance and strips essential meaning from the TCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We disagree. There is no need to \"harmonize\" a rule whose meaning is plain. And the district court's interpretation doesn't follow from the rule's plain text. A close reading of the rule reveals a different result. The first sentence of the relevant portion is clear and unambiguous. Setting aside the list of examples (which, set off by the words \"such as,\" is meant to illustrate rather than exhaust), it reads: \"[F]acsimile messages that promote goods or services\n   even at no cost ... are unsolicited advertisements under the TCPA's definition.\" 2006 FCC Rule.

Offers that are purportedly \"free\" often have commercial strings attached, either as pretext or as part of an overall marketing campaign.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this reason, the FCC chose to interpret the term \"advertisement\" broadly to include any offer of a free good or service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the plain meaning rule, stating that if the language of a statute or regulation has a plain and ordinary meaning, courts need look no further and should apply the regulation as it is written.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874007\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/271/#p276\">\n    678 F.3d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Textron, Inc. v.

A per se rule advances the purpose of the underlying statute by protecting consumers from junk faxes. The rule also helps would-be violators avoid inadvertent liability by eliminating the need for a case-by-case determination of whether a fax is indeed a free offer, or merely a pretext for something more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The district court expressed concern that this interpretation of the 2006 FCC Rule would undermine the text and purpose of the TCPA, which \"seeks to curtail faxes with a commercial nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlton &amp; Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205799301\">\n    2016 WL 5799301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Relying on the meaning of the words \"commercial\" and \"promote,\" the court reasoned that the rule cannot mean that all faxes offering free goods and services are advertisements, because that would \"read 'commercial' out of the TCPA's definition of 'unsolicited advertisement'-a clear abdication of elementary statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205799301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court is correct that Congress enacted the TCPA to combat an \"explosive growth in unsolicited facsimile advertising, or 'junk fax.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. 102-317. But requiring a fax to propose a specific commercial transaction on its face takes too narrow a view of the concepts of commercial activity and promotion, and ignores the reality of many modern business models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This case illustrates why the FCC may have decided to implement so broad a rule. At this point in the litigation, Carlton &amp; Harris has not taken any discovery, and few details of PDR Network's business model have emerged. We do know that PDR Network receives money from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are listed in the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   . And nothing in the record suggests that PDR Network is a charity that distributes free e-books without hope of financial gain. Although PDR Network does not charge healthcare providers money for its e-book, it's certainly plausible that the amount of money it receives turns on how many copies of the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   it distributes. The free distribution of the e-book, then, may not impose a financial cost on healthcare providers, but PDR Network may nevertheless stand to profit when a provider accepts a free copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, giving away products in the hope of future financial gain is a commonplace marketing tactic. PDR Network purports to offer other services to healthcare providers, and it may offer the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   for free in the hopes of establishing relationships with healthcare providers that will lead to future sales of other goods or services. All told, we think it entirely plausible that PDR Network distributes the free e-books to further its own economic interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our musings aside, the FCC through its Congressional mandate to administer and implement the TCPA has declined to require\n   such a fact-based inquiry. PDR Network sent Carlton &amp; Harris a fax that offered a free good, namely, the\n   <em>\n    Physicians' Desk Reference\n   </em>\n   e-book.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the fax was an advertisement under the plain meaning of the 2006 FCC Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To sum up, this case asks us to determine the meaning of the word \"advertisement.\" In doing so, we do not start with a blank slate.

And that rule, in turn, tells us what \"advertisement\" means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Hobbs Act requires a district court to follow FCC interpretations of the TCPA, and under the 2006 FCC Rule, PDR Network's fax offering a free good was indeed an advertisement.

Therefore, Appellant contends, and the majority agrees, that by engaging in a\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis, the district court inappropriately determined the validity of the 2006 FCC Rule.

Therefore, the district court did not exceed its jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under the Hobbs Act, the federal courts of appeals \"ha[ve] exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of ... all final orders of the [FCC].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202342\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the word is also commonly understood to not necessarily implicate a profit seeking motive. The New Oxford American Dictionary further defines \"advertise\" as to \"notify (someone) of something\" and to \"make (a quality or fact) known.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874007\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/271/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, while the New Oxford American Dictionary defines \"commercial\" as \"making or intended to make a profit,\" the TCPA's definition of \"unsolicited advertisement\" is unclear as to whether \"commercial\" modifies \"quality.\"\n   <em>\n    Commercial\n   </em>\n   , New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The plain language of the statute suggests two competing interpretations: one that requires a commercial aim and one that does not. It follows that a commercial aim\n   <em>\n    would not be\n   </em>\n   required if one accepts the common usage of \"advertise\" and believes \"commercial\" is divorced from \"quality.\" Under this interpretation, a fax that simply points out the quality of a good would qualify as an unsolicited advertisement. But, it also follows that a commercial objective\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   required if one accepts the \"promote sales or attendance\" definition of \"advertise\" and believes \"commercial\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   modifies \"quality.\" As a result, the TCPA is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I thus move on to step two of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis.
