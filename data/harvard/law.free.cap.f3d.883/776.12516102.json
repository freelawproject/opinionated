When Steven Bassett used his credit card at an ABM parking garage, he received a receipt displaying the card's full expiration date-a violation of the requirement that businesses redact certain credit card information on printed receipts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g). Bassett sued but alleged only a statutory violation and a potential for exposure to actual injury. Like the district court, we conclude that Bassett failed to allege a concrete injury sufficient to give him standing. In doing so, we join the Second and Seventh Circuits in affirming dismissal under identical circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crupar-Weinmann v.

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (\"FACTA\"), Pub. L.

The statute provides that \"[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with [that requirement] with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer\" for statutory damages of between $100 and $1,000 per violation or \"any actual damages sustained by the consumer,\" costs and attorney's fees, and potential punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20Stat.%201952\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the passage of FACTA, consumers filed a spate of lawsuits against merchants who printed receipts showing credit card expiration dates. In response, Congress enacted the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act (the \"Clarification Act\"), Pub. L. No. 110-241,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%201565\">\n    122 Stat. 1565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).

Bassett filed a putative class action lawsuit against ABM Services, Inc.; ABM Onsite Services - West; and ABM Industries, Inc. (collectively \"ABM\") alleging willful violations of the FCRA. Bassett's claimed injury was \"exposure ... to identity theft and credit/debit fraud,\" because he was at \"imminent risk\" that his \"property would be stolen and/or misused by identity thieves.\" He did not allege that a second receipt existed, that his receipt was lost or stolen, or that he was the victim of identity theft. Rather, he claimed that \"the risk of harm created in printing the expiration date on the receipt\" was a \"sufficiently concrete\" injury to confer Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court granted ABM's motion to dismiss the complaint because Bassett failed to allege a sufficiently concrete injury. In dismissing the case with prejudice, the court concluded that Bassett alleged nothing more than a \"possible risk of [identity] theft.\" Citing the Supreme Court's watershed decision on standing,\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Because Robins alleged that \"Spokeo violated\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   statutory rights, not just the statutory rights of other people,\" and Robins's \"personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective,\" we concluded that Robins's \"alleged violations of [his] statutory rights [were] sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Robins v.

A plaintiff must show that a concrete injury \"actually exist[s]\"; in other words, it is \"real, and not abstract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1548 (internal quotation marks omitted). Intangible harms and a \"risk of real harm\" can be sufficiently concrete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1549-50. But \"a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm,\" cannot \"satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1549. Importantly, the Court noted that \"[a] violation of one of the FCRA's procedural requirements may result in no harm\"-for example, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1550.

Nor has the violation created any appreciable risk of harm. After all, Meyers discovered the violation immediately and nobody else ever saw the non-compliant receipt. In these circumstances, it is hard to imagine how the expiration date's presence could\n   have increased the risk that Meyers'[s] identity would be compromised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173065\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/724/\">\n    843 F.3d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also observed that in the Clarification Act, Congress was \"quite concerned\" about abusive FCRA lawsuits where a consumer does not suffer actual harm, and \"specifically declared that failure to truncate a card's expiration date, without more, does not heighten the risk of identity theft.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173065\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/724/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173065\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/724/\">\n    at 727-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bassett's theory of injury is not supported by historical practice.

At maximum, Bassett asserts, the FCRA creates a \"substantive right,\" the invasion of which is an injury that confers standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichenberger v. ESPN, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266316\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/979/#p982\">\n    876 F.3d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 982-84 (9th Cir. 2017). At minimum, the law establishes a procedural right, the violation of which creates a material risk of harm sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1113\">\n    867 F.3d at 1114-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither theory is persuasive in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Bassett's argument that Congress \"created a substantive right that is invaded by a statutory violation\" is unconvincing because it depends entirely on the framing of the right. One could fairly characterize the \"right\" granted to Bassett by the FCRA (from most abstract to most specific) as \"the right to be free from identity theft,\" \"the right to be free from disclosure to others of his full credit card information,\" or \"the right to be free from receiving a receipt showing his credit card expiration date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only the last \"right\" was violated in this case. Such a framing-dependent exercise is arbitrary, and thus bears minimally on whether Bassett suffered a concrete injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent the FCRA arguably creates a \"substantive right,\" it rests on nondisclosure of a consumer's private financial information to identity thieves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bateman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790475\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/708/#p718\">\n    623 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the FCRA's card number redaction requirements as \"an effort to combat identity theft\").
