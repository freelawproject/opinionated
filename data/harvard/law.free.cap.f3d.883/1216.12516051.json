To at least partially offset the cost of providing such transportation, California has an established reimbursement rate for those companies voluntarily enrolled as providers with the state's Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) when they transport Medi-Cal patients. The relevant\n   reimbursement rate is set by California's Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) pursuant to state statutes and regulations that have been approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Program on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the heart of this case is the Plaintiffs' complaint that private ambulance companies receive only 20 cents in reimbursement for every dollar that they spend to transport Medi-Cal patients, a shortfall that they contend violates their constitutional rights. After discovery, DHCS moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted on all counts. The court held that the Plaintiffs had failed to produce sufficient evidence to sustain any of their claims.

Preliminary matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the outset, we will briefly address two procedural issues raised by the Plaintiffs on appeal. First, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by entering judgment for DHCS on purely legal grounds instead of sifting through what the Plaintiffs contend are contrary factual assertions. The Plaintiffs, however, apparently misapprehend the nature of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That Rule \"mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish existence of an element to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This litigation languished in the federal district court for five years, and not one,\n   but\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   discovery deadlines elapsed before the court rendered judgment on DHCS's motion. If, as the court found and as DHCS argues on appeal, the record lacks evidence upon which the Plaintiffs can sustain their claims, then the court properly entered judgment for DHCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, the Plaintiffs object to DHCS's submission of several public records in conjunction with its motion for summary judgment. But the district court's opinion does not refer to any of those records, and most of them are readily accessible on government websites. The exceptions are the California Court of Appeal's unpublished opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sierra Medical Services Alliance v. Douglas\n   </em>\n   and the exhibits from the parties' Joint Appendix in that case. There is no basis for the Plaintiffs to credibly claim that they were unfamiliar with the latter two items, however, because three of the Plaintiffs were themselves parties to the state-court case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Claims not raised below\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We also note that the Plaintiffs raise two substantive claims on appeal that do not appear in their amended complaint, which means that the district court had no opportunity to render judgment on those claims. One of these is the Plaintiffs' renewal of the Supremacy Clause claim that they quite intentionally excluded from their operative, first amended complaint. As stated in their motion to amend, the Plaintiffs amended their initial complaint based on the \"belie[f] that their Constitutional claims were stronger than their section (a)(3)(A)/Supremacy Clause claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plaintiffs waived a Supremacy Clause claim by omitting it from the operative complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lacey v. Maricopa County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518590\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/896/#p928\">\n    693 F.3d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that \"claims [that are] voluntarily dismissed\" are \"waived if not repled\" in an amended complaint\"). And even if the Plaintiffs could renew their Supremacy Clause claim, the Supreme Court's relatively recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

To the contrary, however, the Plaintiffs do reference the mandatory-care provision, albeit obliquely, in their amended complaint by alleging that they\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   are required by law to respond to all emergency calls and provide emergency treatment and transportation to every Medi-Cal client that requests emergency assistance.

And DHCS has offered a perfectly reasonable justification for a supplemental-reimbursement program that favors public over private providers: payments to public providers count toward the state's share of Medicaid dollars, whereas payments to private providers do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20433.51\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b). Steering more Medi-Cal spending toward public providers is therefore in the state's fiscal interest. Accordingly, the supplemental-reimbursement program survives rational-basis review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

On appeal, the Plaintiffs argue for the first time that the supplemental reimbursements available to public providers discriminate against out-of-state private providers, which they never pleaded in their amended complaint. And even if their amended complaint had alleged that the supplemental-reimbursement program violates the Dormant Commerce Clause, the relevant comparison would be between in-state and out-of-state\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   providers. Because none of the Plaintiffs are out-of-state public providers, they have no standing to challenge the supplemental reimbursements on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warth v.
