Damian Phillips, Byron's brother, seeks to intervene, contending that the money is his life savings and has nothing to do with drugs. The district court granted the Government summary judgment, holding that Damian lacked standing to intervene. We affirm. Although claimants in civil forfeiture cases need only show a colorable interest in the property to have standing, the undisputed record evidence here establishes that Damian lacks such an interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 4, 2014, detectives with the Durham County Sheriff's Office received reports of a marijuana odor emanating from a section of storage units at Brassfield Self Storage, located in Durham, North Carolina. After narrowing down the source of the odor with the help of a drug-sniffing dog, officers obtained a search warrant for a storage unit leased to Byron Phillips. Inside the unit, officers discovered a duffle bag with $200,000 in twelve vacuum-sealed plastic bags, though they did not find any marijuana. A drug-sniffing dog later alerted to the cash, indicating an odor of narcotics. Byron had previously been convicted of maintaining a vehicle or dwelling for controlled substances, and, in a separate incident, felony possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Damian Phillips filed a verified claim stating that the currency found in the storage unit belonged to him, not his brother, Byron, and that the currency \"was not [us]ed or intended to be used in exchange for controlled substances or to traffic in controlled substances.\" In support, Byron submitted a declaration stating that he had allowed his brother to store Damian's life savings of $200,000 in the storage unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During discovery, Damian asserted that he had accumulated the $200,000 between 2003 and 2013 by saving his earned income, a workers' compensation settlement, and unemployment benefits. He explained that he played professional football in the NFL and Arena Football League in 2003, worked as a counselor from 2004 to 2010, worked for a city parks and recreation program from 2004 to 2006, and received the settlement in 2008 and unemployment benefits from 2010 to 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Damian's tax returns show that his adjusted gross income was $20,257 in 2003, $15,118 in 2004, $8,820 in 2006, $43,577 in 2007, $60,434 in 2008, $32,912 in 2009, and $10,168 in 2014. The IRS had no record of tax returns filed in 2005 or from 2010 to 2013. Phillips also produced a copy of a $40,095.45 settlement check. And he stated that he received $216 per week in unemployment benefits from November 2010 to November 2011, equivalent to $11,232 for a full year. The gross income reported in tax returns, the settlement, and the unemployment benefits add up to $242,613.45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Damian admitted that in 2006 and 2010, car dealerships repossessed his vehicles, and that in November 2012, he and his wife were four months ($8,400) behind in their rent payments. In addition, his wife filed for bankruptcy on August 27, 2012. Damian also provided estimates of his monthly expenses from 2003 through 2014, ranging from $750 (in months when he allegedly lived with family members and paid no rent) to $4,552 (in the year 2013). The car payments and monthly expenses that Phillips reported he had incurred\n   from 2003 through March 2014 totaled approximately $250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government moved for summary judgment, contending that Damian had not submitted sufficient evidence to establish Article III standing. The district court granted the motion, holding that he lacked standing and that the Government was entitled to forfeiture of the $200,000 found in the storage unit. Damian timely appealed. We review de novo the district court's decision to dismiss for lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

As other courts have recognized, demanding more than \"some evidence\" of ownership in such cases would be inappropriate in part because of \"how challenging it can be to document ownership of property seized by law enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    $17,900\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276582\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1085/#p1090\">\n    859 F.3d at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, for example, the Government contends that the currency is linked to the \"exchange [of] a controlled substance.\" Damian contends to the contrary, namely, that the cash is his life savings, not drug money. Requiring him to prove that assertion by demonstrating something more than a colorable interest could impermissibly shift the merits burden to him-essentially requiring\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   to prove that the money is\n   <em>\n    unconnected\n   </em>\n   to drug activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   forfeiture cases-in which we have held that, to have statutory standing, a third party must demonstrate \"dominion and control\" over the forfeited property-in no way conflict with our holding today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bryson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095721\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/284/#p291\">\n    406 F.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291 (4th Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These statutory requirements apply only in criminal forfeiture cases, not in civil forfeiture cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Furthermore, the requirement in \u00a7 853(n)(6) that a claimant provide more evidence of ownership in criminal forfeiture cases does not present the same risk of shifting the merits burden away from the Government. This is so because \u00a7 853(n) allows a claimant to intervene in a criminal forfeiture proceeding only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the court has already resolved the merits and ordered forfeiture. By contrast, in civil forfeiture cases, a claimant with standing\n   may intervene earlier to contest the forfeiture on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that a claimant challenging a civil forfeiture must have a colorable interest in that property, which he or she must support with some evidence beyond a mere assertion of ownership to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having articulated what claimants must show to establish standing in a civil forfeiture case, we turn to whether Damian Phillips has met that requirement here.

Though we need not rely on this additional evidence, it confirms that Phillips cannot be the owner of the $200,000 found in the storage unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To resist this conclusion, Damian relies heavily on his \"consistent, unwavering assertion of ownership\" in the $200,000.

That assertion, no matter how unwavering, does not suffice to show the colorable interest needed to establish standing, for the colorable interest test requires some evidence\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   a mere assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Damian also suggests that the years in which the IRS had no tax returns from him constitute \"blanks\" in the evidence that must be construed in his favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. at 10:10-10:25. In Damian's view, this court must presume that he had legitimate income in years for which no evidence of income exists. Damian is mistaken. We construe\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   in the light most favorable to the non-movant; we do not similarly construe an absence of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Were it otherwise, parties opposing summary judgment would be best advised to submit no evidence at all, assured that the court would fill the void with imaginary evidence that favors them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, Damian did not merely fail to provide some evidence to show a colorable interest in the property; the undisputed evidence affirmatively proves the contrary. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court that Damian lacked standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    One older case held that ownership \"by one who does not exercise dominion and control over the property is insufficient to establish standing.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. 5000 Palmetto Drive\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1138217\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/928/373/#p375\">\n     928 F.2d 373\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 375 (11th Cir. 1991). In another even older case, the Eighth Circuit suggested that ownership might require \"attendant characteristics of dominion and control.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. One 1945 Douglas C-54 (DC-4) Aircraft\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22629\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/604/27/#p28\">\n     604 F.2d 27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 28 (8th Cir. 1979). However, the court did not resolve the question of standing in that case, instead remanding for the district court to do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22629\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/604/27/#p28\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22629\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/604/27/#p28\">\n     at 28-29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And the Eighth Circuit has since clarified that the burden of establishing standing in civil forfeiture cases \"is not rigorous,\" because a \"claimant need only show a\n    <em>\n     colorable interest\n    </em>\n    in the property.\"\n    <em>\n     One Lincoln Navigator 1998\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139288\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1011/#p1013\">\n     328 F.3d at 1013\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Damian also argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the question of standing. But he cites no authority suggesting that a district court ever\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    hold such a hearing; the cases he points to merely indicate that a district court\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    do so. Moreover, because Damian did not request such a hearing below, he cannot raise that argument for the first time on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Under Seal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065140\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/276/#p285\">\n     749 F.3d 276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 285 (4th Cir. 2014).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
