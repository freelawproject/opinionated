This sweeping piece of legislation was a response to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, in which millions of Americans lost their homes. This appeal requires us to determine whether in light of Dodd-Frank, the National Bank Act (\"NBA\") preempts California's state escrow interest law, California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   California's escrow interest law, enacted in 1976, requires financial institutions to pay borrowers at least two percent annual interest on the funds held in the borrowers' escrow accounts. This type of account is often set up in conjunction with a mortgage, either as a condition set by the lender or at the request of the borrower. Its purpose is to ensure payment of obligations such as property taxes and insurance. These accounts often carry a significant positive balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Donald Lusnak, on behalf of a putative class, filed suit against Bank of America, which does not pay borrowers any interest on the positive balance in their accounts. The district court dismissed the suit on the ground that the NBA preempted California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse. Although Dodd-Frank significantly altered the regulatory framework governing financial institutions, with respect to NBA preemption, it merely codified the existing standard established in\n   <em>\n    Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744134\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/25/\">\n    517 U.S. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744134\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/25/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744134\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/25/\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2008, Lusnak purchased a home in Palmdale, California with a mortgage from Countrywide Financial. Soon thereafter, Bank of America purchased Countrywide Financial and assumed control over\n   Lusnak's mortgage. In March 2009, Lusnak refinanced his mortgage, and in January 2011, he and Bank of America agreed to modify certain terms. The 2009 agreement and 2011 modification contain the relevant terms governing Lusnak's mortgage. The agreements provide that Lusnak's mortgage \"shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located.\" The parties agree that the terms of Lusnak's mortgage require Bank of America to pay interest on escrow funds if required by federal law or state law that is not preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a condition for obtaining a mortgage, Lusnak was required to open a mortgage escrow account into which he pays $250 per month. Lusnak alleges that Bank of America is able to enrich itself by earning returns on funds in his account. Bank of America acknowledges that it does not comply with state escrow interest laws and that Wells Fargo-its chief competitor and the largest mortgage banker in America-does. But it contends that no federal or \"applicable\" state law requires it to pay interest on Lusnak's escrow account funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 12, 2014, Lusnak filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and a proposed class of similarly situated Bank of America customers. Pursuant to the \"unlawful\" prong of California's UCL, Lusnak alleged that Bank of America violated both state law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202954.8\">\n    Cal.

Lusnak also brings a breach of contract claim, alleging that Bank of America's failure to pay interest violated his mortgage agreement. Bank of America promptly moved to dismiss on the ground that California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a) is preempted by the NBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Lusnak v.

In so concluding, the district court determined that section 1639d(g)(3) of Dodd-Frank did not impact the preemption analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The central question here is whether the NBA preempts California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a). Section 2954.8(a) requires \"[e]very financial institution\" to pay \"at least 2 percent simple interest per annum\" on escrow account funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The portion of\n   Dodd-Frank to which the parties draw this court's attention, section 1639d(g)(3), which amends the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) Applicability of payment of interest\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If prescribed by applicable State or Federal law, each creditor shall pay interest to the consumer on the amount held in any impound, trust, or escrow account that is subject to this section in the manner as prescribed by that applicable State or Federal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d(g)(3). According to Lusnak, this section's plain language-requiring creditors to pay interest on escrow fund accounts like his if \"prescribed by applicable\" state law-made clear that Congress perceived no conflict between state laws like California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a) and the powers of national banks. Therefore, Congress clearly did not intend for these state laws to be preempted by the NBA. Bank of America counters that such state laws are preempted because they prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of its banking powers, and a preempted law cannot be an \"applicable\" law under section 1639d(g)(3). We begin by examining the relevant preemption framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Reading section 34.4(a) in isolation, Bank of America argues that state escrow interest laws necessarily prevent or significantly impair its real estate lending authority. However, the OCC's amendments specifically altered the language of section 34.4(b) to clarify that state laws \"that [are] made applicable by Federal law\" (which would include Dodd-Frank's TILA amendments) \"are not inconsistent with the real estate lending powers of national banks ... to the extent consistent with [\n   <em>\n    Barnett Bank\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.4\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9) (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   All of Bank of America's cited cases are inapposite.\n   <em>\n    Flagg v.

Using the UCL as a procedural vehicle, Lusnak alleges that Bank of America violated both state law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202954.8\">\n    Cal.

Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184134\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/1123/#p1130\">\n    765 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (9th Cir. 2014) (\"In prohibiting 'any unlawful' business practice, the UCL 'borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.' \"). Lusnak also brings a state-law breach of contract claim, alleging that Bank of America's failure to pay interest violated his mortgage agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Bank of America-failing to distinguish between Lusnak's state and federal theories-argues that his UCL claim cannot proceed because his escrow account was created before section 1639d's effective date of January 21, 2013. 124 Stat. at 2136. We agree that Lusnak cannot rely on section 1639d in prosecuting his UCL claim. Section 1639d mandates that creditors establish escrow accounts in connection with certain mortgages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d(a) - (b). Specifically, section 1639d(a) states that \"a creditor, in connection with the consummation of a consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the principal dwelling of the consumer ...\n   <em>\n    shall establish, before the consummation of such transaction\n   </em>\n   , an escrow or impound account ...\n   <em>\n    as provided in, and in accordance with, this section\n   </em>\n   .\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d(a) (emphasis added). The use of prospective language, specifically \"shall establish, before the consummation of such transaction,\" indicates that Congress intended the detailed requirements in section 1639d to apply to accounts established pursuant to that section after it took effect in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, section 1639d(g)(3) requires creditors to pay interest under \"applicable\" state law on funds in federally mandated escrow accounts that are \"subject to this section.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d(g)(3). Lusnak's escrow account was not a federally mandated account \"subject to\" section 1639d at the time it was created because it was established before that section took effect in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494999\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/204/#p208\">\n    488 U.S. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494999\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/204/#p208\">\n    109 S.Ct. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494999\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/204/#p208\">\n    102 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (\"[C]ongressional enactments ... will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, these conclusions do not preclude Lusnak from obtaining relief under the UCL. Because California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8(a) is not preempted, Bank of America was required to follow that law, and Lusnak may proceed on his UCL claim on the theory that Bank of America violated the UCL by failing to comply with section 2954.8(a). The parties argue over when exactly Bank of America's obligation to comply with section 2954.8(a) might have begun. Given that the\n   <em>\n    Barnett Bank\n   </em>\n   standard applied both pre- and post-Dodd Frank, the preemption analysis is the same in both time periods. Therefore, because section 2954.8(a) was not preempted when Bank of America assumed control over Lusnak's pre-existing escrow account, Bank of America's obligation to pay interest on any funds in Lusnak's escrow account was triggered from that point forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Lusnak may also proceed on his breach of contract claim. Lusnak's mortgage\n   documents require Bank of America to pay escrow interest if \"Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds.\" The mortgage defines \"Applicable Law\" as \"all controlling applicable federal, state and local statutes, regulations, ordinances and administrative rules and orders (that have the effect of law) as well as all applicable final, non-appealable judicial opinions.\" Accordingly, on the allegations in the complaint, a jury could find that the \"Applicable Law\" provision of the contract also requires that Bank of America pay interest on funds in Lusnak's escrow account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
