We conclude that certain of Keates's and A.K.'s claims against the defendants who allegedly participated in the interference with familial association withstand the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The operative complaint includes the following factual allegations. In May 2013, A.K. was thirteen years old and had been experiencing depression for four to six months, and \"[o]n occasion, she had suicidal ideations.\" Ellen Keates is the mother of A.K. On May 20, 2013, Keates took A.K. to Christ Cares Clinic where A.K. told an employee that she was sad and had contemplated suicide in the past, but stated that she was not currently experiencing suicidal ideation. The clinic employee referred A.K. to the emergency room at Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH), where A.K. was seen by a triage nurse and a doctor who ordered a psychological consultation and evaluation by a social worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Notes from the triage nurse at PCH stated that A.K. expressed feeling sad and depressed, admitted to having suicidal ideation, \"but denied having a plan to carry it out.\" Several hours later, Randy Call, a PCH employee, and Julie Kaplan, a PCH social worker, told Keates that A.K. could go home if Keates provided a safety plan for A.K. Keates offered several options, including having A.K. stay home with her twelve-year old brother, having A.K. stay with a neighbor, or dropping A.K. off at the public library. Call and Kaplan rejected these options. Keates explained that she was self-employed and staying at home would cost her some business, but Keates nevertheless said she would stay home with A.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Call and Kaplan then informed Keates that the decision had been made to prevent A.K. from going home with Keates, and that she was required to go to a mental hospital for inpatient treatment. Keates stated that she lacked health insurance to pay for inpatient treatment. When Call, Kaplan, or another hospital staff person asked Keates for her contact information, Keates said she was \"unwilling to give PCH agents information that could lead [her] to being billed for an unnecessary, and increasingly costly, stay at PCH.\" Keates \"furiously expressed her concern\" to hospital staff that \"PCH was going to hold A.K. hostage until PCH received information to bill [her].\" Nevertheless, while talking to Call and Kaplan, Keates did provide her name, phone number and other contact information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point after Keates had refused to provide contact information for billing, \"someone\" from PCH called CPS to report that \"A.K. was suffering\n   <em>\n    severe\n   </em>\n   depression and had attempted a suicide by strangulation on May 20, 2013.\" PCH staff told CPS that \"inpatient care was necessary\"-although they had previously told Keates it was merely recommended-and that Keates \"was not able to enact a safety\n   plan.\" Kaplan subsequently wrote a report stating that \"[b]ecause mother refused to provide any identifying information, other than [patient's] name, CPS report was made during assessment for fear that mother would take [patient] and leave.\" Randy Call spoke to or was referred to CPS employees Joanna Lensche and Steve Rountree. CPS employees Michael Koile, Kim Pender, and Gillian Vanesse were also involved early in the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the end of the discussion among Keates and PCH staff, Kaplan told Keates that A.K. would be reassessed in the morning and that Keates should go home and call PCH for the results of the second assessment the next day. Keates went home, but when she called the next morning, May 21, she was told \"there would be no second assessment and that CPS had told PCH that Ms. Keates was not to have any contact with A.K. and was not to come back to PCH.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the morning of May 21, Koile, a CPS case worker, interviewed A.K. without Keates present and without Keates's consent. A.K. reported that her only complaint about her mother was that she \"yells, screams, and cusses.\" A.K. also told Koile that she had suicidal ideation in the past but had not attempted suicide on May 20; the doctor at Christ Cares Clinic had misunderstood her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later on May 21, around 11:45 A.M., Koile issued a temporary custody notice (TCN) allowing him to take A.K. away from Keates and put her into CPS custody. In preparing and issuing this order, Koile collaborated with his colleagues, Joanna Lensche and Steve Rountree, and had the advice, consent and approval of his supervisor, Kim Pender. Keates was not at the hospital at the time Koile issued the TCN. A CPS case worker, Karen Howard, later wrote a letter to Keates stating that CPS took custody of A.K. because Keates did not have health insurance and was unwilling to share her contact information with PCH. Koile told PCH that Keates was \"prohibited from visiting A.K. during the remainder of A.K.'s stay at PCH.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.K. was discharged from PCH on May 21, 2013. She was strapped to a gurney and delivered by ambulance to Aurora Behavioral Health System (ABHS) in Tempe, Arizona. During intake at ABHS, Koile told the intake nurse that A.K. had tried to commit suicide on May 20, 2013. But A.K. told the intake nurse that she \"did not have, at that time, any [suicidal ideation ]\" and while \"she had some [suicidal ideation ] over the course of the previous several months,\" she had no plan to commit suicide. She stated that \"she was depressed but she did not feel like she needed to be here\" and told the intake nurse that the doctor at Christ Cares Clinic \"misunderstood her in that A.K. had thoughts of choking herself in the past, but that was a while ago and she did not feel like that now.\" The intake nurse at ABHS found A.K.'s suicide risk to be low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.K. remained at ABHS despite the intake nurse's conclusion that she was low risk. A.K. expressed her desire to go home and her anger at not being able to have any contact with her mother. Nevertheless, Koile directed ABHS not to allow Keates to have contact with A.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 22, 2013, Koile interviewed Keates, who told him that A.K. did not attempt suicide on May 20. The next day, Koile informed ABHS that he had concluded that Keates was unable to care for A.K. and that a dependency petition would be filed. The Arizona Department of Economic Security filed a dependency petition on behalf of CPS on May 24, 2013. The petition stated that A.K. attempted suicide on May 20, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Koile told Keates that A.K. would be required to receive \"intensive outpatient treatment at ABHS\" and that if Keates\n   \"could not make financial arrangements for that care, A.K. was not going home.\" On May 29, 2013, A.K. was discharged from ABHS, which again assessed her as having a low risk for suicide. ABHS told Keates that A.K. did not need intensive outpatient treatment, and that it \"rarely ever provides such treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After she was discharged from ABHS, A.K. was placed in a foster home. She did not receive intensive outpatient treatment or her prescribed psychotropic drugs. She was placed in a shelter when her foster mother went on vacation and was later placed in a group home. The group home initially failed to transport A.K. to high school, where she had been accepted into the honors program, and only later provided transportation pursuant to a court order. After spending nearly four months outside of her mother's custody, A.K. returned home on September 12, 2013. The dependency petition was dismissed on November 26, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Keates, on behalf of herself and A.K., filed this action in state court, and the defendants removed the case to federal court. Keates filed the operative complaint, which alleged that the defendants had violated Keates's and A.K.'s constitutional rights to familial association under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments and the right to be free from deliberately falsified evidence in dependency proceedings, among other claims. The complaint also alleged various state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court dismissed Keates's constitutional claims with prejudice on the ground that all defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court concluded that Koile did not violate Keates's and A.K.'s constitutional rights to familial association because Koile had reasonable cause to believe that A.K. was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury, and the scope of the intrusion was reasonably necessary to avert that injury. Further, the district court held that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to establish that Koile presented deliberately fabricated evidence to the juvenile court. It remanded the remaining state claims to state court. Keates and A.K. timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss and issues of qualified immunity de novo.\n   <em>\n    Price v.

Based on the allegations of the complaint, however, these requirements were not met. Although Koile could have given weight to the call from \"someone\" at PCH on May 20 stating that A.K. had tried to commit suicide, the allegations in the complaint establish that Koile did not undertake a reasonable investigation as to whether A.K. was in imminent danger due to her mother's presence. According to the complaint, Koile did not corroborate the PCH call to CPS or obtain other medical opinions on whether A.K. was at risk. Because both Keates and A.K. repeatedly informed Koile that A.K. was not actively suicidal, a reasonable official in Koile's position would have known that further investigation was necessary. Moreover, after Koile issued a TCN and transferred A.K. to ABHS, the intake nurse at ABHS determined that A.K. was \"low-risk\" for suicide, further undercutting any reasonable belief that A.K. was in imminent danger.

Koile argues that he acted reasonably because he was told by \"qualified medical providers\" at PCH that A.K. was actively suicidal and needed inpatient treatment. According to Koile, this information, along with allegations in the complaint that the care provider at Christ Cares Clinic referred A.K. to the emergency room, that Keates refused to provide contact information because she believed that the hospital was attempting to hold A.K. hostage until it obtained information for billing, and that CPS was concerned that A.K.'s mother would remove A.K. from care if CPS did not act immediately, shows that Koile was reasonable in taking immediate action to protect A.K. and to insure that she got the care that heath care professionals said that she needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We disagree, because Koile's arguments are not supported by the complaint. Most important, nothing in the complaint indicates that qualified medical professionals at PCH advised CPS that A.K. was actively suicidal; it states only that \"someone from PCH\" called CPS with that information and with the recommendation that inpatient care was necessary. The complaint alleges that Keates and A.K. arrived at PCH Emergency voluntarily on the advice of Christ Cares Clinic, and does not allege that the clinic warned PCH that A.K. was in imminent danger. Nor does the complaint contain facts establishing that a reasonable officer in Koile's situation would have been concerned that Keates might take A.K. home against medical advice. The complaint alleges that Keates did provide Call and Kaplan with her contact information, and that Keates left A.K. in the hospital overnight and merely called in the next morning. Further, there is no allegation in the complaint that Koile was aware of Kaplan's report that PCH was concerned that \"mother would take [patient] and leave.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, based solely on the facts alleged in the complaint construed in favor of Keates and A.K., a reasonable official in Koile's position would know the available information did not establish reasonable cause to believe that A.K. was in imminent danger of attempting to commit suicide, or that it was necessary to separate her from her mother, transfer her to ABHS, and continue to detain her after medical professionals at ABHS concluded she was a low suicide risk. Therefore, we conclude that the operative complaint alleges facts that allow us \"to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The complaint makes a single factual allegation supporting this claim, namely that the dependency petition used to obtain a court order \"falsely stated that A.K. attempted suicide on May 20, 2013 even though A.K. specifically told Mr. Koile, PCH employees, or agents, and ABHS employees, or agents, that she\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   attempt a suicide on May 20, 2013 and\n   at any time in the recent past.\" The complaint does not, however, provide a basis for concluding that Koile's inclusion of the statement that A.K. attempted suicide was a deliberate falsehood. The complaint states that \"someone\" at PCH reported to CPS that \"A.K. was suffering\n   <em>\n    severe\n   </em>\n   depression and had attempted a suicide by strangulation on May 20, 2013,\" and a reasonable officer in Koile's position could have given more weight to this information from the hospital than to the denials from Keates and A.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is a closer question whether the statement in the dependency petition that A.K. attempted suicide was made with reckless disregard for the truth. By the time the dependency petition was filed on May 24, Koile should have been aware of ABHS's diagnosis on May 21 that A.K. was at low risk for suicide and he would have had time to investigate the PCH report about A.K.'s suicide attempt. Nevertheless, ABHS's prediction of A.K.'s suicide risk in the future does not directly contradict the statement from \"someone\" at PCH that A.K. had attempted suicide on May 20.

Although a single officer threw the device into the apartment, we held that the other officers involved in the operation were \"integral participants\" because: (1) they stood armed behind the individual deploying the flash-bang; (2) \"the use of the flash-bang was part of the search operation in which every officer participated in some meaningful way\"; and (3) \"every officer was aware of the decision to use the flash-bang, did not object to it, and participated in the search operation knowing the flash-bang was to be deployed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The complaint alleges that Lensche and Rountree, who were employees of CPS, spoke to Randy Call, a PCH employee who informed Keates that A.K. was not allowed to leave, and that Lensche and Rountree \"collaborated in the issuance of the TCN.\" These allegations, though sparse, indicate that Lensche and Rountree were aware of A.K.'s situation at PCH and participated in a meaningful way in a collective decision to issue a TCN. The TCN was central to the alleged constitutional violation, as it was the basis for Koile's seizure and removal of A.K. to ABHS. Accordingly, we conclude that this is sufficient-though just barely-to make a plausible allegation that Lensche and Rountree were integral participants in violating Keates's and A.K.'s constitutional rights. Therefore, the district court erred in finding that the operative complaint failed to state a claim against Lensche and Rountree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The complaint's allegations against Howard, Vanesse, Gomez, and Jenkins are insufficient, however, to show integral participation. For example, the complaint alleges that PCH employees spoke to CPS supervisor Gillian Vanesse on the morning of May 21, and that she was otherwise \"involved early in the investigation.\" There is no allegation, however, that Vanesse \"collaborated in the issuance of the TCN.\" The complaint also alleges that social worker Karen Howard sent a letter to Keates in September 2013, stating that CPS took custody of A.K. because Keates lacked insurance and did not willingly share her contact information with PCH. This occurred months after CPS initially took custody of A.K., however, and the complaint does not allege any participation by Howard before then. Nor does the complaint make any specific allegations regarding Gomez or Jenkins. Because the complaint does not offer any plausible allegation that any of these CPS employees participated in the decision to interfere with Keates's and A.K.'s constitutional rights, the district court did not err in dismissing the claims against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the complaint alleges that Carter was an \"official policymaker\" for CPS and \"was responsible for [implementation] of those policies in a manner that violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\" Further, the complaint alleges that \"all or some of the unconstitutional actions or conduct ... are the direct result of the unconstitutional policies, procedures and practices promulgated by Defendant Carter.\" The complaint does not allege that Carter knew of or was directly involved in the decisions leading to CPS taking custody of A.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to \u00a7 1983 suits, \"a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    556 U.S. at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even if a supervisory official is not directly involved in the allegedly unconstitutional conduct, \"[a] supervisor can be liable in his individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates; for his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivation; or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1208 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.
