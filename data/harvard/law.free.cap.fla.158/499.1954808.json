Both counsel say that the discrepancies were not observed by either counsel until they were preparing the briefs on this appeal and were not brought to the attention of the Chancellor. '</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The record also shows that the Chancellor declined to require Escambia County to be made a party defendant in the suit. We think Escambia County is probably not a necessary party but, as defendant relies on a lease from Escambia County as a defense to his right to hold a part, or parts, of the involved land, we think the county would be a proper-party-defendant so that it may be heard as to the validity, force and effect of its alleged lease if it be advised to defend the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">For the reasons stated, the decree is reversed and the cause remanded to the court below with directions that it be returned to the rolls for such further action and proceedings, as may-properly follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-6\">THOMAS, C.
