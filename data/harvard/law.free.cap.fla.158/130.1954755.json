City of Miami, 84 Fla. 107, 100 So. 147, the city was held liable for the reckless driving of a fire truck in going to a fire and held that the \u201cpolice power\u201d must not be so recklessly exercised as to unreasonably impair private rights, but that the operation of a fire truck was now governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In City of Tallahassee v. Kaufman, 87 Fla. 119, 100 So. 150, the city was held liable for the operation of a fire truck in such a condition as to make it a hazard to pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In City of West Palm Beach v. Grimmett et al., 102 Fla. 680, 136 So. 320, 137 So. 385, recovery against the city was allowed when a policeman recklessly and carelessly ran over the plaintiff when she was walking on a sidewalk of the city. A question before the court was the immunity of the city by reason of the policeman being engaged in the discharge of governmental functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u2022 In Wolfe v. City of Miami, 103 Fla. 774, 134 So. 539, 137 So. 892, a prisoner of the city was sent for food for use by other prisoners and the question of agency was left to be determined by the jury. If to arrest the prisoner is governmental it would appear that to feed him would likewise be governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In City of Tampa v. Easton, 145 Fla. 188, 198 So. 753, the city was held liable for a tort committed by means of its automobile when operated on the streets with its knowledge and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">In City of Miami v. McCorkle, 145 Fla. 109, 199 So. 575, the city was held liable for reckless operation of a fire truck and cites the Kaufman and Maxwell cases, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In Barth v. City of Miami, 146 Fla. 542, 1 So. (2nd) 574, the city was held liable for negligent operation of its fire truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">From these opinions it appears that the court has at times held that a city would not be liable for tort committed by means of an automobile in the discharge of governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>functions and proceeded to classify the operation involved as proprietary or corporate and not governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">It also appears at times that a city is liable for torts committed by means of its motor vehicles when operated in discharging a governmental function as in the Grimmett and Wolfe cases, supra. In the Kaufman, supra, case the court seemed to indicate an abandonment of any distinction between proprietary and governmental functions when the delict was by means of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">To hold cities liable for the negligent operation of their cars in instances such as this would provide adequate compensation to the innocent victim and at the same time spread the loss. Also it may be sounder justice. Sometime our attempted classifications may have in fact failed to classify.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Appellant claims the damages awarded were excessive. Allowing for the best of guardianship management of the minor\u2019s funds, it is apparent that the plaintiff has not been more than compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Appellant attempts to impeach the verdict by its motion for new trial by reason of a statement by a juryman the day after verdict was rendered relating to insurance which the city might have carried. We consider the impeachment inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-10\">CHAPMAN, C. J., BROWN and THOMAS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
