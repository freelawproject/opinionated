Section 83.27 Fla. Statutes, provides for review of judgments by appeal after motion for new trial has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">We hold that the provisions of Section 83.27, supra, do not authorize appeal from orders granting new trial. Certio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>rari will not lie to review such orders because they do not constitute a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Judgment was entered on October 30th in the County Judge\u2019s Court. Two days later Respondents filed motion for new trial. The filing of the motion tolled the time fixed in Section 83.25 Fla. Statutes within which warrant of possession is required to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to review proceedings of this nature was fully discussed by us in the case of Dade Realty Corporation v. Schoenthal, 149 Fla. 674, 6 So. (2nd) 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Certiorari should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On authority of our opinion and judgment in the Schoenthal case, the writ of prohibition is granted as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-9\">CHAPMAN, C.
