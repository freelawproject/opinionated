Appellant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The ordinance which appellant attacks as not being applicable to appellant\u2019s status is not made a part of the record and is not before us for construction. We cannot take judicial cognizance of a municipal ordinance. See Stephens v. Anderson, 75 Fla. 575, 79 So. 205 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Therefore, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed. See Alper v. Tomlinson, 157 Fla. 471, 26 So. (2nd) 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Without the ordinance being pleaded in the court below no clear legal right to the relief prayed could be shown, and showing of clear legal right to the relief is essential to entitle one to prevail in mandamus. See State ex rel. Palmer v. Gray, 92 Fla. 1123, 111 So. 242; City of Bradenton v. Perry, 118 Fla. 838, 160 So. 506; Norris et al. v. Chancey et al., 129 Fla. 194, 176 So. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">So the order appealed from must be affirmed and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-11\">CHAPMAN, C.
