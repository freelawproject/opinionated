The record shows that the appellant not only had ample time in which to form and entertain a premeditated design to effect the death of the deceased, but it also shows he did do exactly that and that, pursuant to such premeditated design, he did, without justification or excuse, shoot and kill the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">No reversible error is made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The judgment should be affirmed on authority of our opinions and judgments in Crawford v.
