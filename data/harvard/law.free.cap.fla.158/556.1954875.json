Therefore, when equity assumes jurisdiction to grant relief in equity it will proceed with the determination of all matters pending between the parties properly presented. Commercial Bank v. First Nat. Bank, 75 Fla. 634, 79 So. 446; Szabo v. Speckman, 73 Fla. 374, 74 So. 411, L.R.A. 1917D, 357; Donegan v. Baker, etc. Co., 73 Fla. 241, 74 So. 202; Farrell v. Forest Inv.

White, 105 Fla. 581, 141 Sou; 884; Etter v. State Bank, 76 Fla. 203, 79 So. 724, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">The allegations of the bill show that plaintiff was entitled to an accounting. They show that it was entitled to have the lease adjudged forfeited for breach, of its covenants and was entitled to have certain personal property remain in the building where it was located and to an injunction prohibiting, its removal therefrom. As incidental to this relief it was entitled to be put in possession of the leased premises and of the personal property which is referred to in the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and described in the bill of sale which constituted parts of the transaction between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In this case the court did not in terms grant all the relief that the allegations of the bill of complaint and the proof warranted but such relief as was granted by the decree is within the purview of the allegations of the bill of complaint and sufficiently disposes of the rights of the parties as shown by the pleading and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Therefore, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-7\">THOMAS, C.J., ADAMS and BARNS,.
