D. 1946.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">(Signed) Geo. Wm. Jackson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">There are both assignments and cross-assignments of error. The appellant asserts there was error in refusal to allow the filing of tendered amended answer and that the Court erred in the entry of its declaratory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Appellee contends the Court erred in failing to find that all the property in question was the homestead of Moses Saucer, and that the Court also erred in not holding store buildings \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE,\u201d as marked on survey plat of Lots 2 and 3, Block 37, attached to and made <em>\u2022&amp; </em>part of general stipulation filed in the cause, and was part of Moses Saucer\u2019s homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">After careful study of the record, and due consideration of able argument, we find no error in the d\u00e9eree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The constitutionality of the so-called Stepmother Act, Chapter 18,999, Acts 1939, has heretofore been before this Court. See Adams v. Adams, 147 Fla. 267, 2 So. (2nd) 855, and Leffler v. Leffler, 151 Fla. 455, 10 So. (2nd) 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Appellants\u2019insist that since the' children; Of Moses Saucer were beneficiaries under his will (each having .received one dollar) they are precluded from seeking relief by the declaratory decree. Appellants contend the same bar as relates to \u00a1the will of Martha'. Saucer, because, they are beneficiaries thereunder and have not renounced in either case* .C\u00f3urisel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cites the case of Pournelle v. Baxter, 151 Fla. 32, 9 So. (2nd) 162; together with other authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">It is true a person may by conduct preclude or estop himself from asserting even constitutional rights under certain circumstances. See Abell v. Town of Boynton, 117 So. 508, 95 Fla. 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On the death of Moses Saucer the title to his lands was not left in suspension. The Constitution of Florida precluded his will from passing the title to his homestead as he sought to do. Therefore the trial court was correct in his determination in relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">As to the remaining property (non-homestead), Chapter 18,999, Acts 1939, determined and fixed where title should vest immediately upon the death of Moses Saucer.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We are not unmindful that the Constitution and statutes precluded Moses and Martha Saucer from disposing of the property in the proportions expressed in their respective wills. Very persuasive authority has been presented seeking to obtain order which would effectuate the manifest intent of the Saucers.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Suffice it to say they were each chargeable with knowledge of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The proposed amended answer could have been considered only in determining the intent of the parties. Since the positive provisions of the Constitution and certain provisions of the statute then in effect determined how and where title should descend, there was no error in denying motion to file an amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201cThe power to alienate any species of property by last will has never been an inherent right, but is derived from regulations.\u201d See Thomas v. Williamson, 51 Fla. 332, 40 So. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\u201cThe making of a will by a testator is not a common law right but exists by virtue of the Statute of Wills.\u201d In Re: Sharp\u2019s case \u2014 133 Fla. 802, 183 So. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The; decree of the Circuit Court, here for review, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-13\">\u25a0 : THOMAS, C. -J., TERRELL, BUFORD, CHAPMAN and ADAMS, JJ.,- concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
