Upon further consideration of the case we are convinced that we were in error in the first instance. Stovall\u2019s letter of conditional acceptance dated January 10, 1945, limited the one-third item to that \u201csalvaged so far as the corporation is concerned.\u201d Adm'ttedly the corporation, Stovall Properties, Inc., saved nothing out of the litigation. Williams then rests his claim for relief upon his statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201c. . . \u2018if I sign the praecipe for dismissal will you upon completion of the purchase by Crestyiew. issue to me as my contingent compensation one-third or 5 of the 15 shares coming to you or your nominees under the contract.\u2019 \u201d Whereupon Stovall replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">. , The proof of this assertion is affirmed by Williams and .denied by Stovall.' The chancellor weighed the evidence against Williams, who had the burden, and dismissed the bill. In this we see no re\u00e1son to put the chancellor in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The judgment heretofore entered is vacated and we recede from our former opinion and the decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-8\">THOMAS, C. J., BARNS, J., and FABISINSKI, Associate Justice, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b509-9\">TERRELL, BUFORD and CHAPMAN, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
