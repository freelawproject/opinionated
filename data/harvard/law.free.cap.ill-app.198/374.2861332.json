Lurya Lumber Company, plaintiff, against Philip Goldberg, defendant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\" pgmap=\"398\">The claim for a mechanic\u2019s lien was not passed upon. Defendant had a contract with L. Harris, a general contractor, for the erection of a building, in which contract all liens and claims or right of lien under the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Act for labor or materials furnished, etc., were waived. One Lazar had a contract with Harris for carpenter work to the amount of $2,100. Plaintiff furnished lumber to Lazar, which was used in defendant\u2019s building under the Harris contract. The Heitman Bond and Mortgage Company made a building loan on Goldberg\u2019s property and plaintiff executed and delivered a waiver and release of any and all liens and claims or right to a lien on Goldberg\u2019s premises on account of any material it had furnished to Lazar, which waiver and release it delivered to the mortgage comp\u00e1ny. The court awarded the judgment on the theory that Goldberg had testified in a prior suit that he had reserved out of the money to become due to Lazar; $200, which he was holding for the plaintiff. This claim was refuted by the testimony of defendant, Harris, the general contractor, and Frank Heitman, who represented the mortgage company.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-10\" pgmap=\"398\">Benjamin E.
