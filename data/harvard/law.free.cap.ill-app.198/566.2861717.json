C.

To do this work it required twelve horses and five men. On the morning of October 1, 1912, plaintiff\u2019s men and horses went to the South Halsted Street Iron Works to load the girder. When they arrived there they found a Mr. Carter, who was in the employ of the defendants. The girder was loaded on a wagon and taken to the Alaska Theater, but on account of some obstruction in the alley near the theater, plaintiff was unable to deliver the girder at the place desired. Plaintiff\u2019s men, after waiting a reasonable time, informed Mr. Carter, who had accompanied them to the theater, that they could not allow their teams and men to wait any longer; that unless the girder was unloaded at once, plaintiff would charge twenty-five dollars per hour for any further delay. Thereupon Carter went to a nearby telephone, and shortly afterwards returned and told the plaintiff\u2019s men if they would wait until the girder could be delivered at the proper place, they would be paid for such delay. Plaintiff\u2019s men waited for three hours before they could deliver the girder, and this suit was brought to recover for the three hours\u2019 delay at twenty-five dollars per hour.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\" pgmap=\"591(67) 592(11)\">One of the defendants testified that Mr. Carter was in their employ; that he was primarily an estimator on steel contracts; that he lived near the Alaska Theater, and that he was instructed to go to the theater three mornings each week and inspect the work and see how it was getting along. The witness further testified that Carter was not authorized by the defendants to make any agreement with the plaintiff\u2019s men in their behalf.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b592-7\" pgmap=\"592\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7SD\" pgmap=\"592\">Contracts, \u00a7 387*\u2014when evidence insufficient to sustain recovery.
