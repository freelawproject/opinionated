From a judgment for $1,669.46 in favor of plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\" pgmap=\"351(69) 352(94)\">It was not disputed that the rate charged was reasonable and in compliance with the schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Railroad and Warehouse Commission of Illinois, and was less than the maximum rate as fixed by the said railroad and warehouse commission. The defense was that the plaintiff during the month of August, 1911, hauled brick from Chicago Heights, Illinois, to Chicago, a distance of thirty miles, for $5.50 per carload, over the. same track as that on which it hauled the brick for the defendant from Blue Island to Chicago, a distance of but eighteen miles, for which plaintiff charged the defendant $9 per carload; that this was unjust discrimination and contrary to law, and that the defendant should not be required to pay more than that charged by the railroad company for hauling from Chicago Heights, $5.50 per carload and that therefore plaintiff\u2019s claim for $1,447.34 is excessive in the sum of $478.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\" pgmap=\"352\">In 1898 the railroad company entered into a written contract with a land association of Chicago Heights whereby the association conveyed land to the railroad company for right of way and for other purposes, in consideration of which the railroad company agreed that its freight charges for hauling carload lots from Chicago Heights to Chicago should, for a period of 99 years, be $5.50 per carload.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\" pgmap=\"352\">In 1910, when it attempted to raise the freight charges from Chicago Heights to Chicago, it was enjoined by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, from doing so, which injunction was still in full force and effect, the court holding said contract to be valid and binding.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352\">Felsenthal &amp; Wilson, for appellant; David Levinson, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-7\" pgmap=\"352\">Jesse B.
