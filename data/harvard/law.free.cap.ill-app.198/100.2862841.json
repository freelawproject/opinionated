Vaughn, plaintiff, against the City of Chicago, defendant, for twenty-seven days\u2019 wages as e\u00e1rpenter in the employ of the police department of the defendant city. From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-9\" pgmap=\"124\">Upon the trial it appeared that of the twenty-seven days\u2019 wages for which plaintiff recovered, ten days were in May, 1913, while he was absent, as he claimed, on a \u201cdouble header\u201d vacation of twenty-one days, and the remaining seventeen were embraced in a period in November, 1913, during which he was suspended from duty pending investigation of charges. It subsequently appeared from his own testimony that the charges were sustained and he was dismissed from the city\u2019s employ.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-10\" pgmap=\"124(109) 125(23)\">From a city ordinance in force January 15, 1912, it appeared that skilled laborers who had been in the service at least a year were entitled to a vacation of eleven working days, and specifically provided that \u201cAll persons eligible for leave of absence with full pay, as hereinbefore provided, shall be entitled to such leave of absence during any fiscal year, and in no case shall these periods be cumulative.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to and had been allowed a \u201cdouble vacation\u201d in May on account of his failure to take a vacation during the previous year. Plaintiff was allowed and received full compensation for eleven days\u2019 vacation in May, but at the trial no authority was shown in any officer to grant him the \u201cdouble header\u201d vacation claimed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b125-9\" pgmap=\"125\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3F\" pgmap=\"125\">1.

Under a city ordinance providing that skilled laborers in the service of the city at least a year are entitled to a vacation of eleven working days during any fiscal year and that these periods shall not be cumulative, an employee who does not take his vacation during the previous year is not entitled to a \u201cdouble\u201d vacation, as such a vacation is expressly forbidden by the ordinance.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Adj\" pgmap=\"125\">3.
