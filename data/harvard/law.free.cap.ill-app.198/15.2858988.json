H. Alsdurf, administrator of the estate of Martin Carra, deceased, plaintiff, against the Big Four Wilmington Coal Company, defendant, in the Superior Court of Cook county, to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate as a result of defendant\u2019s alleged violation of the Miners\u2019 Act (J. &amp; A. (f 7475 et seq.). From a judgment for plaintiff for $4,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-3\" pgmap=\"40\">The action was brought for the benefit of the next of kin of intestate. The deceased was killed by a large stone falling on him while engaged as a coal miner in defendant\u2019s mine, and while sounding the roof of his working place. The specific acts of wrongful violation of the statute, charged in the declaration, are, in part, failure to have its mine examiner\u2014</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\" pgmap=\"40\">(a) inspect the working places of deceased and others before they were permitted to enter the mine on that day,</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40\">(b) observe whether there were any dangerous roofs,</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\" pgmap=\"40\">(c) place a conspicuous mark thereat, as notice for all men to keep out,</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\" pgmap=\"40\">(d) observe that the roof and walls of the room in which decedent was working were in a dangerous condition.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\" pgmap=\"40\">Also that by reason thereof, decedent entered the place in the performance of his duties, and while so engaged was killed.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\" pgmap=\"40\">The mine is known as a long wall mine. A long wall mine is one where all the coal is taken out and the roof supported by the brushing or rock taken down. In such a mine, the mining commences in the center, the face or working edge of the layer or seam of coal forming a circle gradually increasing in circumference as the coal is taken out. There were two hundred rooms in the mine and two miners worked in each room. The room in question was only three feet in height, being the height of the vein or seam of coal. The coal was dug out to a width of four feet underneath the rock or brush not taken down 4at the end of the roadway, the face of the brush being four feet from the face of the coal.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-10\" pgmap=\"40(51) 41(52)\">All of the witnesses agreed that the only means of ascertaining the safety of the roof was by placing one\u2019s hand lightly against it, at the same time tapping it with a bar, pick or other implement. If the roof was loose or dangerous it would give a hollow or dead sound and the hand could feel it quiver; while if the roof was sound, or apparently safe, it would give hack a ringing or bell like sound, and the hand would feel no quivering or shaking, and in this way it can always be determined whether or not the roof is safe.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\" pgmap=\"41\">The only witness to the accident was Frank Aragno, a partner or \u201cbuddy\u201d of intestate, who worked with him. Remigo Sambon, who worked in an adjoining room, and John McNamara, a track layer, were with intestate shortly before the accident. Aragno testified that he saw the mark \u201c 23, \u201d the date of the month, on the \u201cbrush\u201d above the entrance to their room, before they entered it, indicating that the mine examiner had examined the room and that it was safe, but saw no similar mark on the walls of the room. The evidence of the mine manager was that the mark \u201c23\u201d was on the \u201cbrush\u201d (at the end of the roadway) and about six or seven feet from where the rock fell. The witness and intestate upon entering the room, about 7:30 a. m., before commencing work, sounded the roof with their picks. In the opinion of the witness the room was in good condition up to the time the stone fell. About 9:00 a. m., intestate and Aragno, Sambon and the latter\u2019s \u201cbuddy\u201d took lunch in the roadway near by. Aragno testified that upon returning to their room, intestate sounded the roof with his pick at the place where the rock subsequently fell, which was immediately to the right of the roadway, and about five minutes thereafter returned to the same point and while again sounding that part of the roof the stone fell upon him.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41\">Sambon testified that he and intestate entered the latter\u2019s room \u201cthe first thing\u201d that morning and found a \u201csqueeze,\u201d namely, where a portion of the roof or coal had fallen between his room and that of appellee\u2019s intestate. Sambon testified:</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\" pgmap=\"41(31) 42(47)\">\u201cQ. Had you seen him go in there that morning to the place where the rock fell on him? A. * * * Yes, sir. But he (intestate) looked\u2014it was pretty bad. Then he came \"out and I saw the props * * * he got the props down under it (the stone) * * *. Well you see the props the first thing off in the morning,\u2014he never sounded in the morning at all. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\" pgmap=\"42\">He further testified that he saw intestate sound the roof with a pick that morning between nine and ten o \u2019clock, and that the roof sounded good. Sambon testified, further/ that the stone slipped, diagonally, about six inches towards the face of the coal before it fell. Aragno testified that the top of the stone was damp, smooth and slippery. The stone was seven feet long, three and one-half feet wide in the center, tapering to a point at the right side, and about one to two feet thick. One of defendant\u2019s expert witnesses, who examined the stone after it had fallen, testified that in such a mine a stone can change or break within a few minutes. He described a \u201cslip\u201d as a condition in the top of the stone which can be detected by sounding. Another expert witness, who testified in behalf of plaintiff, stated that if a stone is wet it can be ascertained by examination and the danger determined. Aragno testified in this regard: \u201cIt is harder to tell if it (the stone) is solid when it is wet. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42(156) 43(112)\">The mine examiner, John Thom, testified that he examined the roof of the room at about three o\u2019clock on the morning of the accident, testing the roof with a pick, and that there was no loose stone nor dangerous condition. The examiner to get into the room had to pass through a space under the rock or brush three feet in height and four feet in width. On the face of the rock or brush, at the end of the roadway and above the said entrance, he inscribed the mark \u201c23,\u201d and did not place any danger mark on the walls of the room. The testimony of Sambon tended to show that it was customary to place the mark \u2018 \u2018 on the face of the brush or some stone alongside.\u201d Thom testified that he also examined the room after the stone fell and that at the time he made the examination before the accident, \u201cthere was nothing could have come there *\" * * except they * * * (Carra and his \u2018buddy\u2019) had dug the coal out, that the coal teas * * * still covering the place where the stone fell, and * * * that before Carra could have gone in there, he would have had to take the coal down.\u201d On cross-examination he was asked: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t sound it (the roof) at the place where he was killed * * *?\u201d Answer: \u201cIt was too tight * * * I sounded it after I got through, where I could get mu pick to sound it, where the man %vas killed.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-10\" pgmap=\"43\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aph\" pgmap=\"43\">1.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1544<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when giving of instruction to find defendant guilty if plaintiff made out case as alleged in declaration harmless error. Although the practice in actions based on negligence of giving instructions to find defendant guilty if plaintiff made out his case by a preponderance of the evidence as alleged in the declaration is not to be commended, yet such instructions are not reversibly erroneous where every count in the declaration contains allegations of the facts necessary to a recovery.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ALh\" pgmap=\"44\">4.

If 7475 et seq.), to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate as a result of defendant\u2019s alleged wilful violation of the act, an instruction in effect that plaintiff might recover for death of which a wilful violation of the act by defendant was the proximate cause, regardless of whether such violation was charged in the declaration, is not erroneous where other instructions given for plaintiff state fully that plaintiff can recover only for violations of the act as charged in the declaration, since in such case instructions must he taken as a series.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Adm\" pgmap=\"44\">5.
