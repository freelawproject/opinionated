Defendant invoked Rev. St., ch. 38, sec. 131 (J. &amp; A. 3734) as a defense. It was not contended that the one hundred and fifty dollars loaned, or any part of it, was paid to plaintiff as money won by him from defendant at the gambling game of poker or any other gambling game of cards. It seemed, however, that plaintiff and defendant and five other men were playing poker at plaintiff\u2019s house and that defendant lost one hundred and ninety dollars, and having only forty dollars with him, at' the conclusion of the game borrowed the one hundred and fifty dollars from plaintiff and. paid it, together with the forty dollars he had with him, to the persons who had won various amounts of money from him.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-14\" pgmap=\"507\">Leon A.
