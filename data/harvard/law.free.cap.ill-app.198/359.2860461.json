Meacham, Philo A. Otis and Seymour Morris as trustees, plaintiffs, against Harry H. Lobdell, trustee for Samuel Pitluk and Leo J. Lieberman, copartners, trading as La Salle Street Shoe Store, for pro rata share, by reason of a lease, in moneys recovered by defendant from the sale of assets of such copartners. From a judgment for plaintiffs for $1,754.22, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\" pgmap=\"383(178) 384(66)\">Pitluk and Lieberman were lessees of a store under a written lease from plaintiffs for a term beginning May 1, 1912, and ending April 30,1917, at a monthly rental of $500 payable on the first day of each month during the term. The lessees also agreed to pay lessors for electric light used. In April, 1913, the lessees made an assignment of their property to Lobdell, as trustee, to be converted into money to be used in paying their creditors. The rent of the store due April 1, 1913, was not paid. On April 10th the trustee took possession of the premises and occupied them until April 18th. Plaintiffs claimed that under the terms of the lease, the lessees being in default not only as to rent but on other covenants, the entire rental for the balance of the leased term became due and that plaintiffs were creditors of Pitluk and Lieberman to that amount, that is, from April 1, 1913, to April 30, 1917, at $500 a month, which is $24,500, and to this should be added a bill of $332.10 for electric light, making a total of $24,832.10; and from this should be deducted the-amount paid by the trustee while he was in possession, namely, $124.51, leaving a balance due plaintiffs of $24,707.59. Based upon the allowance of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for this amount, judgment was entered for their pro rata share of the moneys in the hands of the trustee.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-7\" pgmap=\"384\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AIRn\" pgmap=\"384\">1.
