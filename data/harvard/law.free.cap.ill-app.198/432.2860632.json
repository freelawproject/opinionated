Principal and agent, \u00a7 8*\u2014when evidence sufficient to establish agency to collect note and mortgage. In an action to recover the proceeds of a note and mortgage alleged to have been collected by defendants\u2019 agent, evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that plaintiffs were justified in presuming that defendants\u2019 salesman was authorized to act as agent of defendants in collecting the proceeds of the note and mortgage.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A1Y\" pgmap=\"457\">3. Principal and agent, \u00a7 246*\u2014tohen existence of agency question for jury. In an action in assumpsit where defendants\u2019 salesman assumed to act as agent of defendants in the matter of collecting the proceeds of a note and mortgage, and one of defendants paid over such proceeds to such salesman, held that it was a question for the jury to determine whether such defendant knew that such proceeds belonged to plaintiffs.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AqWk\" pgmap=\"457\">4. \u25a0 Principal and agent, \u00a7 223*\u2014when plaintiff relieved of burden of proving joint liability of principal and agent.

In an action to recover the proceeds of a note and mortgage given as part of the purchase price of land in which the question involved was the authority of a salesman of defendants to act for defendants in collecting such note and mortgage, held that the admission of letters signed by defendants\u2019 salesman and written more than a year prior to the time when the note and mortgage was given by plaintiffs to defendants\u2019 salesman for collection, and which merely related to the sale of the farm, was not prejudicial error.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ARH\" pgmap=\"457(55) 458(30)\">6. Principal and agent, \u00a7 8*\u2014when evidence sufficient to show collection of note and mortgage by agent.
