A. Johnson, plaintiff, against Paul Feyrirsen, defendant, for balance of contract price due under terms of contract to erect building. From a judgment allowing him $404.90, after the deduction of damages for defendant\u2019s recoupment, plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\" pgmap=\"391(90) 392(41)\">Plaintiff had a contract to do certain work in the erection of a building for defendant and after all the work had been done received an architect\u2019s certificate for $671, the balance of the contract price. By the terms of the contract plaintiff agreed to complete all the work he had undertaken to do on or prior to August 25, 1914. As a matter of fact this he failed as to one store to do. The work of plaintiff on this store was completed on September 15, 1914, a delay of twenty-one days. Defendant claimed that he had rented this store to a tenant who had paid $5 on account to bind the bargain, at a rental of $35 a month, which was the reasonable rental value of the store.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-8\" pgmap=\"392\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A_Y\" pgmap=\"392\">1.

The store remained unrented until May 15, 1915, and defendant claimed that the loss of the prospective tenant was due to the store not being ready for occupancy by such tenant at the time plaintiff had contracted to complete his work. Defendant claimed that the measure of his damages was the rental value of the store during the time it remained unrented, and the trial judge, heeding defendant\u2019s contention, gave judgment for $404.90, the amount of the architect\u2019s certificate, less the rental value of the store at the rate of $35 a month from August 25, 1914, when plaintiff\u2019s work should have been completed, to May 15, 1915, when defendant succeeded in securing a tenant. Plaintiff asked for a reversal and a judgment in his favor for the amount of the architect\u2019s certificate with interest, less the rental value of the store for twenty-one days, defendant\u2019s damages assessable for noncompletion within the contract time.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">Kremer &amp; Greenfield, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\" pgmap=\"392\">No appearance for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b393-13\" pgmap=\"393\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
