Cline, plaintiff, against the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Company, defendant, for damages done to plaintiff\u2019s automobile truck and goods therein, resulting from collision with defendant\u2019s locomotive at a public crossing. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\" pgmap=\"188\">The negligence charged in the declaration was the running of the engine across the highway without ringing a bell or whistling at a distance of eighty rods from crossing, and without ringing bell or blowing whistle until it had reached such highway. The railroad tracks were double, one hundred feet wide, and ran north and south at right angles to the highway. Plaintiff was going east on the highway and engine was going north. Plaintiff and his chauffeur testified that though they looked they did not see the locomotive until they were on the westerly track when they jumped from the track permitting it to continue under power and collide with the engine. The evidence showed that at a distance of thirty to forty feet west of the easterly track there was an unobstructed view of the tracks for at least a quarter of a mile from the crossing. While defendant testified that bushes in the southwest corner of intersection of highway and tracks prevented him from seeing down the tracks until he was within ten feet thereof, other witnesses placed the distance at from thirty to forty-five feet. The chauffeur said he could have stopped the truck within ten feet.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\" pgmap=\"188(64) 189(172)\">As to the negligence charged in the declaration, three witnesses on each side testified directly on the subject. Those for plaintiff\u2014himself, his chauffeur and Bleimehl\u2019s brother\u2014said they heard no whistle or bell and none was sounded. The muffler of the automobile was open. One witness a block and a half west while doing his chores was attracted to the truck\u2019s passing by its \u201cterrible noise.\u201d Another whom it passed within a half block of the tracks described its noise as unusual, \u201clike an old threshing machine.\u201d He however heard the train and its whistle, though he could not see the train, while stopping for the truck to come up and pass him and was anticipating whether the truck would stop. The engineer testified that the fireman was continuously ringing the bell from eighty rods south where he blew the whistle and which he repeated within four hundred feet of the crossing. The fireman was not a witness, being at the time in the regular army in the east. But two other witnesses confirmed the engineer\u2019s testimony as to the whistling. One was on the tracks four hundred feet north of the crossing going south, the other within one half block of the tracks on the highway going east. Both of them also heard the gong at the crossing sounding, but could not say whether the bell was ringing or not.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b189-7\" pgmap=\"189\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ACh0\" pgmap=\"189\">1.

Railroads, \u00a7 738<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when driver of automobile truck attempting to cross railroad track guilty of contributory negligence. In' an action for damages caused by collision of a railroad engine with an automobile truck, the law will not tolerate the absurdity of allowing plaintiff to testify that he looked but did not see the train, when the view was unobstructed and where if he had properly exercised his sight he must have seen it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ALT\" pgmap=\"190\">3.

In a suit for damages caused by a locomotive colliding with an automobile truck at a highway crossing, and where plaintiff\u2019s automobile truck, according to testimony, made a \u201cterrible noise,\u201d the situation of the occupants of the truck was less favorable for hearing, and their negative evidence is not entitled to more weight than positive evidence as to the fact that a whistle was blown by defendant\u2019s locomotive.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A2f\" pgmap=\"190\">4.
