When it was made in the Probate Court it appeared that the executrix had in her hands $14,459.70, that the uncollected accounts of the estate weye deemed worthless and that there were pending claims against the estate amounting to $4,495.10. It also appeared that executrix had not been allowed any compensation for her services as such executrix, nor fees for her counsel. The circuit judge, on the proof before him, estimated that the latter might equal $1,700, and from the showing of record her compensation as executrix might aggregate, on a full statutory allowance, $7,560. The record indicated that her services as executrix extended over a considerable period and involved handling numerous transactions and large sums of money,' aggregating over $125,000, incident to closing out a merchandise business, collecting the accounts and paying the creditors.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-9\" pgmap=\"444\">Elijah N.
