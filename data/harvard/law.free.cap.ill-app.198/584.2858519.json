Glende, plaintiff, against M. Spraner, trading as Wicker Park Garage, defendant, to recover damages for the loss of a motorcycle valued at $225. The case was tried before the court without a jury, and the issues were found against the plaintiff, a judgment was entered against the plaintiff for costs, to reverse which he prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-9\" pgmap=\"608(159) 609(91)\">The evidence showed that the defendant was the owner and proprietor of the Wicker Park Garage. The plaintiff was the owner of the motorcycle involved in this case. On the afternoon of May 31,1914, plaintiff and another were riding said motorcycle and, as they were nearing defendant\u2019s garage, the drive chain of the motorcycle broke, and plaintiff then pushed the motorcycle into defendant\u2019s garage to repair the chain. He worked for some time but was unable to fix the chain, and, a storm having arisen in the meantime, plaintiff decided to leave the motorcycle in the garage over night, which he did with the permission of the defendant. The plaintiff stated that he would call for it the next day. Some time during the next day, a man called at defendant\u2019s garage and presented a written order signed by the plaintiff directing the defendant to \u201cgive this gentleman permission to inspect\u201d the motorcycle. Defendant complied with plaintiff\u2019s directions, and while the man was inspecting the motorcycle he mounted it and rode away. Plaintiff arrived at the garage immediately after the man had gone and demanded the motorcycle. He was told that the motorcycle had been delivered to the man who presented plaintiff\u2019s written order; that he had just left with it, and would probably be back in a few minutes. Plaintiff waited around the garage for a while, but the man did not return, and plaintiff was never able to recover possession of his motorcycle.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-8\" pgmap=\"609\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AGSN\" pgmap=\"609\">1.
