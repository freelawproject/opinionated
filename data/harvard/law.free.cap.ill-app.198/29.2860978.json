Lehmann, defendant. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense as follows:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">\u201cDefendant believes that he has a good defense upon the merits to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, as follows: The whole sum, exclusive of interest, sued for, including item for diamond ring and money loaned, \u2022was, on or about July 26, 1913, paid by defendant and thereafter received by plaintiff; as to item of interest, sued for, on ground of alleged vexatious delay in payment, the.nature of the defense thereto is, that said payment included interest up to the time thereof, and, in addition, there was, and has been, no vexatious delay in payment. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\" pgmap=\"54\">Upon motion of plaintiff the court struck the affidavit from the files and entered judgment against defendant.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\" pgmap=\"54\">Plaintiff contended that the affidavit was insufficient under the rules of the Municipal Court. Defendant argued that it was sufficient. The rules of the Municipal Court, which were preserved for review, provide that defendant shall file an affidavit that he believes he has a good defense upon the merits, \u201cspecifying the nature of such defense, whether by way of denial or by way of confession and avoidance in such a manner as to reasonably inform the plaintiff of the defense which will be interposed at the trial.\u201d By rule 20 it is provided that it shall not be sufficient for defendant\u2019s affidavit \u201cto deny generally the facts alleged by the statement of claim * * *. Any denial of any allegation of fact made by the opposite party must not be evasive but must answer the point of substance.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATs\" pgmap=\"54\">Francis W.
