Defendant contended that plaintiff was in ill health, and upon her saying \u201cthat she wanted something to protect her for her funeral expenses,\u201d he gave the note to her \u201cto pacify her.\u201d On the other hand, plaintiff testified that the consideration for the. note was money which she had loaned to the defendant. Her testimony was that she received no allowance from her husband for personal expenses, and during their married life she had worked for a time in a laundry, had kept roomers, that she had received from a daughter payment for board and washing, and that she kept an account of her own moneys in the State Bank of Chicago; that it was from her own money thus accumulated that she made the advances to her husband, who borrowed the money for the purpose of buying a lot. It also appeared that when she was married she had something over $200 of her own. The husband, testifying, did not deny that he received this money from his wife, and the evidence showed that the amount of the note represented only a portion of the advances made by plaintiff to defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AVb\" pgmap=\"467\">1.
