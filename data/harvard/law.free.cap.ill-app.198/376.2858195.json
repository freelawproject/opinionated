The errors complained of were said to be encompassed within this record. The prosecution was by information. The statute which defendant was charged with offending went into force July 1, 1915. Defendant contended that the information stated no offense where it charged that defendant \u201con. the 7th day of August, A. D. 1915, at the City of Chicago aforesaid, at, to-wit: 1259 W. Madison street, was then and there an inmate of a house of ill fame or assignation or prostitution or lewdness, contrary to the statute.\u201d The contention was that the charges being in the disjunctive are insufficient to charge any offense of which defendant can be convicted, and that the venue in the caption of the information is no part of the information. Defendant voluntarily went to trial upon the information without objecting to its sufficiency or moving to quash.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-7\" pgmap=\"401\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AI8\" pgmap=\"401\">1.

Where only the statutory record in a criminal prosecution is brought before the Appellate Court and all the errors complained of are said to be encompassed within such record, it will be assumed that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction and judgment if the information warrants the conviction and the judgment is a lawful one.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AQ6z\" pgmap=\"401\">2. Prostitution, \u00a7 4c*\u2014when question of insufficiency of information may not he raised on appeal. The objections made for the first time on review that charges in the information charging a person with being an inmate of a house of ill fame, on which he is prosecuted, are in the disjunctive and that the venue in caption of such information is no part of the information, held without force, where defendant did not challenge its sufficiency in any way before the trial court or call for the ruling of the court thereon.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ATW\" pgmap=\"401\">3. Prostitution, \u00a7 3a*\u2014when information charging occupancy of house of ill fame sufficient. An information charging that defendant was \u201can inmate of a house of ill fame or assignation or prostitution or lewdness,\u201d even though in the disjunctive, charges but one offense in legal effect and intendment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AzIR\" pgmap=\"401(10) 402(37)\">4. Indictment and information, \u00a7 13*\u2014venue as part of information. The venue is a part of the information, and the charge that the offense was committed at the \u201cCity of Chicago aforesaid,\u201d by construction refers to the venue as laid in the caption of the information.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-4\" pgmap=\"401\">Benjamin E.

Prostitution, \u00a7 3a<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when information charging defendant with being an inmate of house of ill fame sufficient. On the contention that an information charging defendant with being an inmate of a house of ill fame does not charge that such act is unlawful, held it is sufficient if the charge is in the language of the statute and the statute made the act charged unlawful.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AW7\" pgmap=\"402\">6. Prostitution, \u00a7 4*\u2014when evidence presumed to sustain charge in information. Where the evidence in a prosecution for being an inmate of a house of ill fame is not in the record before the court of review, all intendments must be indulged necessary to sustain the charge in the information.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Ay3\" pgmap=\"402\">7. Appeal and error, \u00a7 198*\u2014lack of jurisdiction of Appellate Court in constitutional matters. The Appellate Court has no jurisdiction to determine constitutional questions.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A6U\" pgmap=\"402\">8. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1265*\u2014when Appellate Court will presume statute constitutional. The Appellate Court will presume that a criminal statute is constitutional, as it has no jurisdiction over constitutional questions.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AUu\" pgmap=\"402\">9. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1718*\u2014when constitutional question waived. Where the constitutionality of a criminal statute is involved, the review should be prosecuted to the Supreme Court, and seeking a review by the Appellate Court waives any constitutional question which might otherwise be raised.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A4K\" pgmap=\"402\">10. Costs, \u00a7 122*\u2014when culprit may be sent to House of Correction for nonpayment of costs. Hurd\u2019s Rev. St., ch. 38, sec. 452 (J. &amp; A. jf 4152), authorizes imprisonment for the nonpayment of fines or costs, and section 448 of such chapter (J. &amp; A. If 4148) provides that where jail sentences may be imposed upon defendants, the court may send the culprit to the House of Correction.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ASH\" pgmap=\"402\">11. Criminal law, \u00a7 391*\u2014how statute authorizing working out fine and costs in House of Correction construed. Hurd\u2019s Rev. St., ch. 38, sec. 448, (J. &amp; A. If 4148) providing that the fine and costs imposed on a culprit sentenced to the House of Correction for nonpayment of such fine and costs may be \u201cworked out\u201d at the rate of $1.50 per day, is in the interest of the convicted person, as it minimizes his term of imprisonment.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
