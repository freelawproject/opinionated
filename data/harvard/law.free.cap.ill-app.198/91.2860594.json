Roland, Thomas Hennessy and Frederick Erb, defendants.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\" pgmap=\"115\">Plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim was as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\" pgmap=\"115\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claim is for labor and materials furnished for carpenter repairs and alterations to the building No. 451 E. 41st street, Chicago, Illinois, done between March 20th and April 20th, 1914, under orders from defendant, Frederick Erb, the contractor, agent and superintendent of the repairs to said building for the owners thereof, viz.: the defendants Charles E. Roland and Thomas Hennessy; that the sum due this plaintiff for said work and material is $292.29; that the plaintiff caused to be served the notices prescribed by the statute in relation to Mechanic\u2019s liens upon the said defendants Roland and Hennessy on April 29, 1914, and April 30, 1914, respectively.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\" pgmap=\"115(107) 116(71)\">To this statement of claim defendants filed separate appearances and affidavits of merits. Thomas Hennessy denied ownership of the premises, and further, that the statutory notice had been served upon him as set forth in the statement of claim. Charles E. Roland admitted ownership of the premises in question, and further alleged that with reference to the labor and materials sued for, the same was the subject-matter of a contract which he had entered into with one Frederick Erb, and that he did not know of plaintiff\u2019s ever having furnished the labor and materials on the premises in question; he further - denied ever having received a notice of lien claim as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. Frederick Erb, as a contractor, denied that he ever for himself, as a contractor, entered into an agreement with plaintiff to furnish labor and materials for the carpenter repairs and alterations to the building in question, and further denied that he had a contract for said repairs to said building with the owners thereof.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\" pgmap=\"116\">The record shows that plaintiff dismissed his suit as to defendant Erb, and that the court, trying the case without a jury, found the issues against defendants Roland and Hennessy, and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages in the sum of $292.29, for which amount judgment was entered, to reverse which defendants Roland and Hennessy prosecute this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">Defendants, in urging a reversal of the judgment, proceeded upon the theory that' plaintiff\u2019s action was brought under section 28 of the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Act, ch. 82, Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. of Illinois for 1911 (J. &amp; A. jf 7166). They contended that a recovery by a subcontractor must be against both the owner and the original contractor and the judgment must be a joint one, and furthermore, there must be a proper ten-day notice served upon the owners; that there were no findings by the court, nor recitals in the judgment, of the facts required by our statute, viz., that the owner was indebted to the contractor, and the date from which said lien attached; that in the absence of such findings or recitals, (1) the court erred in entering said judgment, and (2) said judgment is void.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\" pgmap=\"116\">Plaintiff contended that under its statement of claim he might have recovered against all the defendants under the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Act, supra, if the evidence showed that Frederick Erb, as a contractor, ordered the labor and materials sued for, or against the owners alone, if the evidence showed that the labor and materials in question were ordered by the said Erb as the agent or representative of the owners, Roland and Hennessy.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b117-8\" pgmap=\"117\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AFe\" pgmap=\"117\">1.

In a proceeding under the Mechanics\u2019 Liens Act (J. &amp; A. f 7139 et seq.) against the owners and contractor, a statement of claim that plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201cis for labor and material furnished for carpenter repairs * * * under orders from defendant, * * * the contractor, agent and superintendent of \u2019 the repairs to said building for the owners thereof, viz.: the defendants * * *; that the plaintiff caused to be served the notices prescribed by the statute in relation to mechanics\u2019 liens upon said defendants * * *,\u201d is sufficient to support a recovery against all the defendants, if the evidence showed that the contractor defendant ordered, as a contractor, the labor and materials sued for, or against the owners alone, if the evidence showed that the labor and materials were ordered by the contractor defendant as agent or representative of the owners.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AOZ\" pgmap=\"117\">2.

In a proceeding under the Mechanics\u2019 Liens Act (J. &amp; A. 1f 7139 et seq.) against a defendant alleged to have been the contractor and defendants alleged to be owners, the former, by denying that he entered into a contract with plaintiff and that he had a contract with the owners to furnish such labor and materials, raises an issue of fact, the determination of which hears upon the question whether plaintiff has the right to recover against all of the defendants or against the owner defendants alone.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AAO\" pgmap=\"117\">3.
