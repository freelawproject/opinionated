For some years she had occupied the entire premises as her home. In January, 1914, she made a written lease to defendant of premises described therein as \u201cHouse known as 4352 Calumet Ave.,\u201d the term to commence May 1,1914, and expire April 30, 1916. Several weeks before the term began, defendant obtained from plaintiff permission to take immediate possession of the barn, and plaintiff removed her electric car therefrom and delivered the barn keys to defendant, who thereafter occupied it with his motor car. It also appeared that at the request of plaintiff\u2019s agent the defendant paid an additional insurance premium which was required on account of the occupancy of the barn with a gasoline car. There were also provisions in the lease which indicated that all the buildings on the lot were included in the demised premises.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b465-7\" pgmap=\"465\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ARa\" pgmap=\"465\">Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 34<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when lease of designated house construed as Including barn on premises.
