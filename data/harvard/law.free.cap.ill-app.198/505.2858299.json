Under the practice in the Municipal Court of Chicago, a motion to strike the affidavit of defense is tantamount to a demurrer to defendant\u2019s pleading and, when sustained, so far puts defendant out of court that he can only cross-examine witnesses for the purpose of minimizing damages.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AZq\" pgmap=\"530\">4.
