Holmes, James M. Pyott and David A. Pyott, trading as Holmes, Pyott &amp; Company, a copartnership, plaintiffs, against David Suffrin, defendant. From a judgment for plaintiffs for $1,414.47, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\" pgmap=\"69(87) 70(108)\">The evidence showed that defendant was the owner of a building in Chicago and June 7, 1911, contracted with the United Construction Company for the remodeling and improvement of his building. The Construction Company June 8th made a contract with plaintiffs to furnish and erect the structural and ornamental iron and steel work required in such improvement for the sum of $2,189. The contract between defendant and the Construction Company included a waiver of the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien, but this was not known to the plaintiffs until after the controversy out of which this suit grew had arisen. The Construction Company failed to pay plaintiffs the amount due them under the contract as the same became due. The contention of plaintiffs is that defendant promised, in case the plaintiffs would proceed with and complete the work they had undertaken to pay them the amount due and to become due, and that this was a direct and original promise and not within the Statute of Frauds; that the promise to pay the plaintiffs was. based on a sufficient consideration and therefore was original so far as defendant was concerned.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-9\" pgmap=\"70\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4S\" pgmap=\"70\">1.
