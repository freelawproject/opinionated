When plaintiff was about to board defendant\u2019s southbound car at that point, she alleged, the car swayed and struck, causing the injury sued on. The rail nearest plaintiff (the west rail) was about three-quarters of an inch higher than the other rail (east rail) of the southbound track. Defendant\u2019s men were detailed to watch the temporary track to keep it surfaced, lined and gauged. The west rail (nearest plaintiff) was four feet from the curbstone. The overhang of defendant\u2019s cars was twenty-two to twenty-four inches on each side. Plaintiff testified that she stood one foot from the curb while waiting for the car, and was so standing when the car struck her.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b225-7\" pgmap=\"225\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1Z\" pgmap=\"225\">1.
