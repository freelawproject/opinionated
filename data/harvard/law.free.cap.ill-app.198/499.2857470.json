Hoff, plaintiff, against L. Gould &amp; Company, defendant.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-20\" pgmap=\"523(78) 524(205)\">The evidence showed that the defendant is a wholesale dealer in wooden and willow ware and house furnishing goods in Chicago, and until July 6, 1909, owned and operated horses and wagons, etc., and used the same in the hauling of its goods. On that day defendant discontinued doing its own teaming and sold all of its horses, wagons, harness and other teaming equipment to the plaintiff. On the same day the parties entered into a contract which provided inter alia that plaintiff should do all defendant\u2019s teaming work for a period of five years; that it should for that purpose furnish defendant six double and two single teams with wagons, drivers and other necessary adjuncts, for which plaintiff was to receive from defendant as compensation $1,000 on the first day of each month, during the life of the contract. There was also provision made for the supplying of additional teams as the exigencies of defendant\u2019s business might require. Among the material conditions of the contract, plaintiff agreed that during the term of the contract he would keep the wagons well painted, have defendant\u2019s name painted on them, and keep all the wagons, horses, harness, etc., in as good order and condition as the same were in when possession thereof was surrendered to plaintiff, and generally to carry on and conduct the teaming business incident to the business of defendant in a manner \u201csatisfactory\u201d to defendant. On failure of plaintiff to comply with the foregoing conditions in a manner \u201csatisfactory\u201d to defendant, the defendant might, on giving thirty days \u2019 written notice to plaintiff, declare the contract \u201cforfeited and of no force or effect. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\" pgmap=\"524\">It was shown that plaintiff received the teaming outfit sold to him by defendant in first-class condition. The evidence showed that plaintiff kept the horses in an ungroomed condition; that the harness was not clean; that the. wagons were not \u201cwell painted\u201d or kept clean, but were habitually dirty; that there were many holes in the wagon covers, causing rain to percolate through and damage goods transported in such wagons; that, moreover, plaintiff\u2019s teamsters \u201cloafed upon the job.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\" pgmap=\"524(35) 525(46)\">These conditions, when called to the attention of plaintiff, were not denied but excused. Plaintiff, in effect, replied on one occasion that he could not afford to live up to his contract. Defendant being dissatisfied with conditions, availed of the right reserved by the contract to terminate it, and on February 13, 1913, gave plaintiff notice that the contract would be determined thirty days from that date. Since March 15, 1913, plaintiff has not done any teaming for defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-8\" pgmap=\"525\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AO4\" pgmap=\"525\">1.
