Schutt, plaintiff, against Ludwig Siems and Meta Siems, respondents, for the custody of plaintiff\u2019s child. . From an order quashing the writ and dismissing the petition, the relator brings error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aid\" pgmap=\"366(166) 367(87)\">The infant child involved in this controversy was the daughter and only child of the relator, and the granddaughter of the respondents. The relator was a man about thirty-two years of age, residing in the Village of Laporte, Minnesota, in which State he resided practically all of his life. On February 25, 1911, he was married to the daughter of the respondents at Kenosha, Wisconsin. Respondents\u2019 daughter and the relator were cousins of the first degree, and prior to said marriage she lived with her parents in Chicago.. She visited the relator and other relatives in Minnesota and there became engaged to marry the relator. Afterwards the relator came to Chicago to be married, but found that the law of this State prohibited marriages between cousins of the first degree. Thereupon he, together with the respondents and said daughter, proceeded to Wisconsin where the marriage ceremony was performed. They all immediately returned to Chicago, and within a day thereafter the re-. lator and Ms wife went to their home in Minnesota, where they continued to live together as husband and wife until April 10,1914, when she died. Vivian Dorothy Schutt, the child in question, was the only child bom to relator and his wife and was about two years old when her mother died. She was not very strong physically, and about three weeks after her mother\u2019s death was taken to the home of the respondents in Chicago, where she lived at the time of these proceedings.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-4\" pgmap=\"367\">About December 11, 1914,. relator was notified by publication that respondents had filed a petition in the County Court of Cook county for the adoption of said cMld. December 24, 1914, relator visited the respondents and the child, and on the 28th of the month demanded that the respondents deliver to him his child, which they refused to do. Thereupon the petition in this case was filed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\" pgmap=\"367\">The respondents contended that the custody of the child was turned over to them by agreement \u201cso that they could raise her to maidenhood, the father, however, to have the right to visit said child at reasonable times;\u201d that this was done at the dying request of the child\u2019s mother; that she was well taken care of and had a good home in Chicago, and that it is to the best interests of said child that she stay with respondents.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOa\" pgmap=\"367(109) 368(109)\">There was evidence to show that respondents were able to furnish the child with a more comfortable home than relator. The evidence tended to show that relator was very fond of his child and that he did not intend in any way to surrender any of his rights by turning her over to respondents; that he was a strong healthy man, was a carpenter and contractor, and engaged in the lumber business; that he had held positions of public trust such as assessor, member of the village council, etc.; that he was honest and industrious, and had no bad habits; that he had had some financial reverses occasioned by the destruction by fire of relator \u2019s lumber yard and was indebted in several small sums; that he was earning about one hundred dollars per month; and that he had arranged with a family living in Minnesota to take care of himself and child. Respondents further contended and the court found that the relator1 and his wife were married in Wisconsin to evade the laws of Illinois; that the marriage was incestuous and void ab initio; that the respondents were proper persons to have the custody of the infant child, and that it was for the child\u2019s best interest to be remanded to their custody.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b368-8\" pgmap=\"368\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AFDy\" pgmap=\"368\">1.
