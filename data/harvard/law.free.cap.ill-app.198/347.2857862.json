Trafton, as guardian of Alfonso, Louise and Jennie Cadamartrie, plaintiff, against National Council, Knights and Ladies of Security, defendant, on a benefit certificate issued to Flora Cadamartrie. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $967.50, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">This case in its general features and as to the question involved is similar to the case of Kraus v. National Council, Knights and Ladies of Security, ante, p. 345, and Neenan v. Same, 188 Ill. App. 490. Reference is made to the opinions in these eases for description of the character of the benefit certificate and the by-laws.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">The defense in this case was that the insured did not pay the assessment under the certificate for the month of July, 1913, before the last day of the month, and for that reason, under the by-laws, she became suspended, and that on August 26, 1913, when she paid the July and August assessments, she was not in good health, a condition necessary to reinstatement.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">It was proved that on August 28, 1913, the insured was suffering from a tumor of the uterus, with pressure symptoms which in the opinion of her physician, required the removal of the tumor. Upon his advice she was taken to a hospital and on August 30th an operation was performed removing the tumor and also the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. The tumor was about the size of a fist. The doctor describes it as \u201cquite a large tumor.\u201d It is also not controverted that this tumor had been growing for a period of at least several months prior to this time. Immediately after the operation her heart began to fail, the doctor testifying, \u201cthere was a weak heart-muscle, the heart wasn\u2019t strong enough to carry her along during the convalescence.\u201d She died on September 2nd. There was testimony to the effect that she appeared to be in good health on August 26th.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372(17) 373(13)\">It was contended that the by-laws were not properly introduced ip evidence. They were certified under the hand of the national secretary, with the seal of the society affixed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-9\" pgmap=\"373\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AE9\" pgmap=\"373\">1. Insurance, \u00a7 906<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to establish that member of fraternal order not in good health at time of attempted reinstatement. In an action on a benefit insurance policy, evidence held to show that insured, who had failed to pay an assessment for one month and was thus automatically suspended under the rules of the order, was not in good health during the following month at the time of an attempted reinstatement by the payment of the delinquent assessment, and that she was accordingly not a member of such society in good standing at the time of her death.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ajp\" pgmap=\"373\">2. Insurance, \u00a7 906*\u2014when evidence sufficient to sustain finding that member of beneficial order not in good health. Evidence that decedent was suffering from a tumor of the uterus, held to prove that she was not in good health.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AcV\" pgmap=\"373\">3. Insurance, \u00a7 807*\u2014what constitutes good health within rules of fraternal society as to reinstatement. The words \u201cgood health\u201d in the rules of a fraternal insurance society with reference to reinstatement of a member mean that a person is in a reasonably good state of health and free from any disease or illness that tends seriously or permanently to weaken or impair the constitution, and such words do not refer to the appearance of good health.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ahx\" pgmap=\"373\">4. Evidence, \u00a7 250*\u2014when by-laws of fraternal society admissible in evidence. By-laws of a fraternal insurance society, certified under the hand of the national secretary and with the society\u2019s seal affixed, were properly introduced in evidence, in compliance with Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. ch. 51, sec. 15 (J. &amp; A. f 5532).</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3s\" pgmap=\"373(19) 374(69)\">5. Insurance, \u00a7 807*\u2014where acceptance of delinquent assessment does not operate to reinstate member of beneficial society in poor health. Where there Is evidence that the \u201cfinancier\u201d of a fraternal insurance society accepted an assessment which would operate to reinstate decedent in membership in such society providing she was in good health, but there is no evidence that such \u201cfinancier\u201d knew that she was not in good health, such acceptance did not operate to reinstate decedent, and there is no liability upon her benefit certificate in such society.</headnotes><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-4\" pgmap=\"373\">It was also contended that the defendant waived the provision of the by-laws with reference to good health when the financier of the society accepted the assessment on August 26th.</p><attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-6\" pgmap=\"373\">A.
