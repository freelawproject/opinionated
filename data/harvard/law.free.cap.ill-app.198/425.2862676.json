From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $3,519.93, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-11\" pgmap=\"449\">Plaintiff was a manufacturer of castings and defendant was engaged in selling \u201clittle household savings banks,\u201d called safes. Under arrangements between them the former manufactured the parts and assembled them, and sent monthly bills for the same, which appear to have been paid regularly for over two years. This appeal brought up for review, the refusal of the court to allow three items of set-off, (1) one for $300, the cost of \u201cfillers\u201d made by plaintiff, and delivered and charged to- defendant against its protest; (2) one for $528.67, the aggregate of an increased price of one-half cent charged on safes made and furnished between October 1, 1912 and January 1, 1914; and (3) one for $10,285.92, being for what defendant called an overcharge for material delivered between April, 1910 and September, 1913.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-13\" pgmap=\"449(28) 450(116)\">Plaintiff at defendant\u2019s request made a written proposition in 1909 to manufacture the parts of the safe at certain specified prices which does not appear to have been acted on, defendant\u2019s secretary testifying that when it became ready to arrange with plaintiff to do its business, the latter raised its price. There was a futile effort to hold plaintiff to its original proposition. The subject of changed prices became a matter of discussion and correspondence, but the goods were billed and accepted at the changed prices up to the close of the parties\u2019 dealings, and were paid for without protest up to the accruing of the account sued on. It is the difference between the prices contained in the proposition of 1909 and said changed prices for the material furnished that constitutes the so-called overcharges in the said third item.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-7\" pgmap=\"450\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AHyC\" pgmap=\"450\">1.

Where a seller of goods raises prices to the purchaser above those contained in its original written proposition, even though purchaser may have been embarrassed thereby, he may not by way of set-otf in a suit for the value of merchandise delivered, Question the validity of the contract, especially after having given plaintiB orders on the basis of the new prices and having paid for the goods billed according to such prices.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4C\" pgmap=\"450\">2.

Where a seller of goods induces the purchaser to accept prices on exaggerated statements of cost of manufacture and materials, but the actual arrangement is for specified prices not based on such cost, it cannot be contended by way of set-off in an action for the value of goods delivered, that there was a mistake of fact whereby the right arose to recover back money paid under such mistake, and an item claimed by defendant for overcharges is properly disallowed, and evidence relating to the cost of material and manufacture properly rejected.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-4\" pgmap=\"450\">Dyrenforth, Lee, Chritton &amp; Wiles, for appellant; George A.
