Ehrlich and Fannie Ehrlich; in other words, whether immediately prior to the sale and delivery plaintiff was the owner thereof or plaintiff\u2019s parents. Thereupon the court suggested that this issue had better be determined by a jury, and the trial proceeded before a jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and assessed his damages at the sum of $375.02, upon which verdict the court entered judgment against the defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-4\" pgmap=\"177\">Harold J.
