Then follows the judgment of nil capiat, which recites that submission of the cause for trial by the court was pursuant to the stipulation of the parties. Subsequent to the entry of the judgment, defendant filed, by leave of court, a plea of puis darrein continuance. No issue was joined on this plea.
