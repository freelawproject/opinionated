Piper Company, defendant to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon as a result of the running away of the team owned by defendant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-11\" pgmap=\"349(79) 350(163)\">Plaintiff\u2019s horse was hitched to a wagon and was standing on the north side of Madison street in the village of Forest Park, facing west. The team and wagon belonging to the defendant, in charge of a driver, was delivering bread in said village, and it being about noon, the driver drove the team into a shed, which was in a yard immediately adjoining Madison street. The shed was about forty or fifty feet inside of the yard. The yard was inclosed with a fence, there being two entrances to the same. The driver took the bridles off the horses and hung them on the hames, fed his team, and then went into a restaurant, which was situated near the yard, to eat his dinner. About five minutes thereafter, he looked out and the team was gone. In some manner not disclosed by the evidence, the team got out on Madison street and turned east, running away. They ran into plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon. Plaintiff\u2019s horse was injured and parts of the wagon shafts broken. On account of the injuries the plaintiff was unable to afterwards use the horse. The value of the horse was placed by a witness on behalf of the plaintiff to be from $100 to $125, while a witness testified on behalf of the defendant that the horse was not worth to exceed $50. There was also evidence as to other items of damage incurred.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-7\" pgmap=\"350\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ACd\" pgmap=\"350\">1.
