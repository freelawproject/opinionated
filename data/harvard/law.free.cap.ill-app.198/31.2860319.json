From the judgment on the second trial appeal was taken to the Appellate Court, and a majority of the branch court which had the case under consideration were of the opinion \u25a0that the judgment should be affirmed. (See 177 Ill. App. 400.) A writ of certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court, and the judgments of the Superior and Appellate Courts were reversed. The case is reported in 262 Ill. 228.

In. an action to recover for the wrongful death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, on a second appeal to the Appellate Court involving facts not materially different, the conclusions of the Supreme Court on the former appeal as to the contributory negligence of plaintiff\u2019s intestate and the negligence of defendant are controlling.</headnotes><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56\">The facts adduced upon the present trial do not differ materially from those which were considered by the Supreme Court.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-6\" pgmap=\"56\">It is asserted by plaintiff that this case is different in that it is now claimed in an additional count that defendant was guilty of a violation of the municipal ordinance requiring a fender to be attached to the front of the car in such a manner that pedestrians would not be injured or thrown under the wheels of the car, and that the violation of this ordinance was the proximate cause of intestate\u2019s death. The evidence showed not only that the car was equipped with the required fender but that the presence or absence of a fender had nothing to do with the accident.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\" pgmap=\"56\">Franklin B.
