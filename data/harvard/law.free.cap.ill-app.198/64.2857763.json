Plaintiff also averred in his statement of claim that the said lease had never been assigned or transferred to any other person. The trial judge denied the motion to vacate, and defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b89-10\" pgmap=\"89\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Av\" pgmap=\"89\">1.
