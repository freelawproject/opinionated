This action in trespass was commenced in the Circuit Court of Cook county on April 6, 1905. For various causes a trial was not had until March, 1909. At the conclusion of the trial at the request of the defendant four special interrogatories in writing were submitted to the jury to be answered, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\" pgmap=\"154\">\u201cA.

Was the outer door broken by Constable Louis Greenberg?\u201d</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-13\" pgmap=\"154(28) 155(48)\">The jury, on March 25,1909, returned a general verdict finding the defendant guilty and assessing plaintiff\u2019s damages at the sum of $3,000, and in their special findings answered all of said interrogatories in the affirmative. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was not finally passed upon until February 3, 1910, at which time that motion and his motion in arrest of judgment were overruled and the court entered judgment upon the verdict.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\" pgmap=\"155\">From the judgment defendant prayed an appeal and perfected the same in this court, but on July 10, 1912, said appeal was dismissed by this court upon his motion. He having been arrested on a capias ad satisfaciendum issued on said judgment, and his petition for release from custody under the Insolvent Debtor\u2019s Act having been dismissed by the County Court of Cook county, he prayed an appeal from that judgment of dismissal to this court, and on November 10,1914, said judgment of the County Court was affirmed. (Greenberg v. Connor, 189 Ill. App. 419.) In the meantime, on February 1, 1913, he sued out this present writ of error to review said judgment of the Circuit Court, and the cause was continued from term to term for want of service on plaintiff (defendant in error). On January 14,1915, on defendant\u2019s motion the writ of error was made a supersedeas, defendant having filed a bond with surety in the sum of $5,000, and on May 11, 1915, publication having been made, plaintiff entered her appearance in this court.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\" pgmap=\"155(97) 156(147)\">The declaration consists of four counts. The first count alleges, in substance, that defendant, on April 20, 1904, \u201cwith force and arms, etc., broke and entered a certain dwelling house of the plaintiff,\u201d and stayed and continued therein, making a great noise and disturbance, for the space of three days; that defendant \u201cforced and broke open and broke to pieces and damaged the outer doors\u201d of said dwelling house, and \u201cbroke to pieces, damaged and spoiled divers locks, staples and hinges\u201d belonging to said doors and wherewith the same were fastened; that defendant, also, during said time, with force and arms, \u201cseized and took divers goods and chattels\u201d (here are specifically mentioned more than 100 articles including one piano, several oriental rugs, household furniture and $52 in money) \u201cbeing the goods of plaintiff then found and being in said dwelling house and being of the value of $2,500, and carried away the same and converted and disposed thereof to his own use;\u201d by means whereof plaintiff and.her family were not only greatly disturbed in the peaceable possession of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house but plaintiff was \u201chindered and prevented from carrying on and transacting therein her necessary affairs and business and has * * * been thereby deprived of her said dwelling house from hence hitherto, and * * * the business of plaintiff, being that of a boarding house keeper, was completely broken up and destroyed. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\">The second count alleges that on the date aforesaid defendant made an assault upon plaintiff and beat and illtreated her, and imprisoned her without any reasonable cause for the space of seven hours. The third count charges, in substance, that defendant assaulted plaintiff, seized her and with great violence dragged her about and struck her, and also forced her to go out on the public streets then and there in custody, whereby she was not only bruised and wounded but was exposed to public disgrace and injured in her standing and reputation. The fourth count charges an assault and battery by defendant.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-8\" pgmap=\"156(79) 157(183)\">The defendant filed a plea of the general issue to all four counts, and also a special plea \u201cas to the first count of plaintiff\u2019s declaration and as to the alleged wrongful taking of the property hereinafter named,\u201d in which he alleged, in substance, that on February 16, 1904, Clark &amp; Doran sued out of the justice court of W. D. Wilcox, a justice of the peace in said Cook county, a writ of fieri facias, commanding any constable of said county that of the goods and chattels of said plaintiff there should be made the sum of $133.20, and $4.50 costs, within seventy days; that defendant was then and thereafter a constable of said county and said writ was delivered to him, to execute; that after-wards and before the return day of said writ, on April 20, 1904, defendant as such constable \u201cpeaceably and quietly entered into the said dwelling house, 'in which, etc., the outer door thereof being then open,\u201d and seized and took in execution the following goods and chattels of plaintiff, viz.: \u201c1 piano, 1 piano stool, 2 rugs 9 x 12, two wardrobes, one hat rack and 2 small rugs,\u201d the same being in said dwelling house and liable to be seized and taken by virtue of said writ; that in so doing he necessarily and unavoidably made a little noise in said dwelling house but did no unnecessary damage to plaintiff; and that afterwards, after due notice given according to law, he sold said goods and chattels, and satisfied said judgment and costs.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\" pgmap=\"157\">To this special plea of justification plaintiff filed a replication in which she alleged that \u201calthough true it is that said writ of fieri facias was issued and delivered to the defendant as such constable * * * nevertheless * * * the plaintiff says that the defendant, at the time when, etc., of his own wrong and without the residue of the cause in that plea alleged, committed the trespasses in said declaration mentioned, in manner and form as the plaintiff has hereinabove complained against the defendant,\u201d etc.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157(70) 158(341) 159(215)\">The testimony of plaintiff and her witnesses disclosed, in substance, the following facts: On and prior to April 20, 1904, plaintiff conducted a boarding and lodging house on Ashland boulevard, between Jackson and Van Buren streets, Chicago. There were fifteen rooms in the house and ten boarders. Plaintiff\u2019s net income from her boarders and roomers at the time was about $100 per month. At the front entrance to the house there were two permanent doors. They were both \u201cdouble doors,\u201d one set opening into a vestibule and the other set opening from the vestibule into the main hall of the house. Outside of the first mentioned double doors were temporary double \u201cstorm\u201d doors which opened outwards. About 8:30 o\u2019clock on the morning of April 20, 1904, plaintiff was standing on the front porch. The storm doors were open. Both sets of double doors were locked. Defendant, accompanied by William Snyder, another constable, came upon the porch where plaintiff was. Other men, assistants of defendant, were on the sidewalk. Defendant stated to plaintiff that he had an execution against her in favor of Clark &amp; Doran for over $133, demanded that plaintiff open the doors and let him inside of the house, took hold of plaintiff\u2019s arm and further stated that she was his prisoner. Upon plaintiff\u2019s refusal to open the doors defendant directed Snyder and his other assistants to break in the doors, and they first broke open the double doors leading into the vestibule. In the meantime, at plaintiff\u2019s request, her daughter, standing inside in the hall, had \u201cput the chain on\u201d the doors opening from the vestibule into said hall. Defendant\u2019s assistants afterwards by pushing a ladder against said doors, succeeded in breaking open the same and in so doing broke off a portion of one of said doors and broke said chain. After gaining admission into the hall defendant again took hold of plaintiff\u2019s arm and again stated that she was under arrest, and demanded that $200 be paid him, otherwise he would carry away the household effects and sell them. Subsequently plaintiff paid defendant $40 and received from him a written receipt therefor. Plaintiff then requested that she be allowed to go down town and see her attorney and endeavor to procure more money. Defendant refused to permit her to go except in the custody of Constable Snyder, who accompanied her in a buggy to said attorney\u2019s office. In the interview there had Snyder told said attorney that plaintiff was under arrest, that both defendant and he had executions and that if money was not forthcoming they were going \u201cto clean out that place,\u201d and referred him to defendant for further information. Snyder accompanied plaintiff on the return to her home, where plaintiff again saw defendant and asked for additional time to procure more money. Defendant said he would put in a custodian at $10 per day, which he did for one day. Plaintiff paid $12 in all to the custodian. On the afternoon of the following day defendant, accompanied by Snyder and other men, again came to plaintiff\u2019s home. Two large moving vans of the Livingston Express and Storage Company were drawn up in front of the house, and during the afternoon there were taken and carried away in said vans and in buggies 100 articles of household furniture belonging to plaintiff. As one witness stated, \u201cthey took almost everything.\u201d Plaintiff, after enumerating various chattels taken, testified that the fair market value of the same at the time was $2,600. This testimony as to value was not contradicted. No part of the property was returned to plaintiff and she did not continue in her business as a hoarding house keeper.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\" pgmap=\"159(129) 160(171)\">The defendant claimed the protection of the execution issued by W. D. Wilcox, a justice of the peace, on a judgment against plaintiff and in favor of Clark &amp; Doran for $133.20 and costs. This paper was in the possession of the defendant and on the trial was offered in evidence by him. It does not appear to have ever been returned to said justice. On the back of the paper is a statement over defendant\u2019s signature that on April 20,1904, he levied on certain specific personal property of plaintiff (mentioning the same 9 articles as stated in his plea of justification). Below is the further statement that the sale is set for May 3, 1904. Defendant testified that he advertised and sold the property levied upon and that he took no other property. The theory of the defense was that the other property of plaintiff which was carted away was taken by Constable Snyder, who claimed to have another execution for $193 issued by said justice of the peace against plaintiff and in favor of one Anderson. Snyder testified that he made a levy at the same time that defendant made his levy on the Clark &amp; Doran execution. The Anderson execution was not produced. Snyder further testified that he returned it into court, but that he had not made a search to find it or ask the justice to do so. It appeared, however, from the original record of said justice in said Anderson case and from a transcript thereof, certified to by the justice nearly eight months after the alleged levy, that the Anderson execution was issued to defendant, as constable, on April 7, 1904, but it did not appear from said record or transcript that the execution had ever been returned.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\" pgmap=\"160(185) 161(136)\">Both defendant and Snyder testified to the effect that they did not break open the doors which opened into the vestibule; that these doors they found open when they arrived; that they demanded of plaintiff that she open the two doors which opened into the hall from the vestibule; and that upon her refusal they broke open these doors and entered. Both denied that they, or any one for them, laid hands on plaintiff, or stated that she was under arrest, or that they at any time arrested her. Both testified that the property taken, away from plaintiff\u2019s house was temporarily stored in the warehouse of the Livingston Company, and evidence was introduced on behalf of defendant tending to show that all the property taken, except the 9 articles alone claimed to have been levied upon and taken by defendant, were stored with said company in the name of Snyder. Plaintiff, however, testified that a day or two after her property was taken she called at the office of the Livingston Company and there saw an entry in a warehouse receipt book that her goods were there stored in the name of defendant. Plaintiff also introduced in evidence a sheet from a certain loose-leaf warehouse receipt hook of said Livingston Company, which purported to be a carbon copy of a warehouse receipt given by said company on April 22, 1904, for 78 articles of household furniture. Among the articles enumerated are: \u201c1 piano, 1 piano stool, 2 wardrobes and 1 hat rack,\u201d which articles defendant claimed he levied on. This sheet was identified by John L. Livingston of said company. He testified that all of said articles were taken directly from plaintiff\u2019s house and stored in the company\u2019s warehouse.' It clearly appears that the receipt as originally written was given to \u201cGreenberg,\u201d and that said name has been partially erased and the name \u201c\u00a5m. Snyder\u201d written over the erasure.</p><attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-4\" pgmap=\"161\">Martin C.

It is contended by counsel for defendant that because plaintiff, in her replication to defendant\u2019s plea of justification to the declaration, failed to \u201cnew assign, \u2019 \u2019 no recovery can be had by plaintiff. The statement as to defendant\u2019s plea being filed to the declaration is not accurate. The declaration contained four counts to which defendant pleaded the general issue, and his special plea of justification was filed only to the first count. After due consideration we do not think that counsel\u2019s point is well taken.</p> <p id=\"b161-8\" pgmap=\"161(42) 162(368) 163(352) 164(63)\">The first count of plaintiff\u2019s declaration charged, in substance, that defendant, with force and arms, etc., broke and entered plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house, forced and broke open the outer doors of said house, and therein seized and carried away over 100 articles of household furniture, the property of plaintiff, and converted the same to his own use, whereby she suffered damages as alleged. Defendant\u2019s plea of justification to this count alleged, in substance, that, by virtue of an execution for $133.20, issued by a justice of the peace to him as a constable, he as such constable peaceably and quietly entered plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house, \u201cthe outer door thereof being then open,\u201d and seized and took away under said execution 9 articles of household furniture mentioned, belonging to plaintiff, and subsequently sold the same, etc. The fact that defendant as a constable was armed with a writ of fieri facias would not justify him, for the purpose of executing such a writ, in breaking the outer door of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house; if, however, he found such outer door open, and he gained a peacable entry into the house, and he found that an inner door was closed so that he could not seize any of plaintiff\u2019s goods, then he could have demanded of plaintiff that said inner door be opened, and upon her refusal he could have opened that door and seized a sufficient amount of plaintiff\u2019s goods to satisfy the amount of said writ and costs. (Snydacker v. Brosse, 51 Ill. 357, 361.) If he broke the outer door, and thereby gained an entrance into plaintiff\u2019s house, he became a trespasser ab initio, and liable not only for the property taken by him but also for any damage to plaintiff which was the immediate result of his acts. (Snydacker v. Brosse, supra; Greenberg v. Connor, 189 Ill. App. 419.) The averment in defendant\u2019s plea (viz., the outer door of plaintiff\u2019s house being open at the time he entered) was a material one, as that fact, if it was a fact, was a condition precedent to his right to enter plaintiff\u2019s house. (Kerbey v. Denby, 1 Meeson &amp; W. Rep. 336.) To this plea the plaintiff filed a replication, in which she admitted that it was true as defendant had stated in his plea that he had the writ, but further alleged that nevertheless the defendant, at the time when, etc., \u201cof his own wrong, and without the residue of the cause in that plea alleged, committed the trespasses in said declaration mentioned, in manner and form as the plaintiff has hereinabove complained against the defendant.\u201d In other words, she alleged that notwithstanding defendant had the writ mentioned, nevertheless he committed the trespasses as alleged in her declaration, in the first count of which there was contained the distinct allegation that he forced and broke open the outer doors of her house. We think it was unnecessary for her to again specifically charge in the replication that defendant broke the outer doors. (Kerbey v. Denby, supra.) And we think that the issue of fact as to whether defendant broke the outer doors was sufficiently presented. \u201cIn trespass * * * the replication containing a general denial of the whole plea sometimes occurs, and is termed a replication de injuria sua propria absque tali causa, * * * or, if a part of the plea be admitted, then it is termed de injuria absque residuo causa, thereby denying all but the admitted fact or facts. This replication tenders issue upon and compels the defendant to prove every material allegation in his plea.\u201d (1 Chitty on Pl., 16th Am. Ed., star p. 632-3.) \u201cIf in any case the defendant justified under the warrant of a justice of the peace, * * * or by his command, the replication must have been special, and admit or protest the warrant or commandment, and reply de injuria absque residuo causa, or take issue simply on the warrant or commandment.\u201d (Id., star p. 636.) \u201cThere are some replications which rather partake of the nature of new assignments than are properly and strictly so. As where the defendant has abused an authority or license which the law gives him, by which he became a trespasser ab initio. In an action brought for a trespass thus committed, where the defendant pleads the license or authority, the plaintiff may reply the abuse. Such a replication it will be observed differs from a new assignment, because it does not operate in any manner as a waiver or abandonment of the trespass attempted to be justified, but states matter in confession and avoidance of the justification.\u201d (Id. p. 665.) Furthermore, defendant did not demur to plaintiff\u2019s replication. \u201cWhere de injuria is improperly replied, the defendant may demur specially, but the defect will be aided after verdict.\u201d (Id. p. 639.)</p> <p id=\"b164-5\" pgmap=\"164\">Second. It is also contended that the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff to testify that she had no knowledge or recollection of any summons ever having been served upon her in the action brought against her by Clark &amp; Doran in the justice court. We do not think, even if the court erred in his ruling, that defendant was so prejudiced thereby as to warrant a reversal, in view of the instructions subsequently given to the jury. Several of plaintiff\u2019s instructions were predicated upon the assumption that defendant had a valid writ of execution. Of the instructions given on behalf of the defendant the second told the jury that the writ of execution introduced in evidence was valid and authorized defendant, as a constable, to levy upon and take goods of plaintiff to satisfy the writ; and the eighth, that if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff was not served with a summons in the Clark &amp; Doran case, still the writ of execution in defendant\u2019s hands would be a protection to him in levying upon plaintiff\u2019s property although as a matter of fact there was no service upon her.</p> <p id=\"b164-6\" pgmap=\"164\">Third. It is further contended that the trial court erred in giving three instructions offered by plaintiff and in modifying an instruction offered by defendant.</p> <p id=\"b164-7\" pgmap=\"164\">Plaintiff\u2019s seventh given instruction is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b164-8\" pgmap=\"164(51) 165(97)\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury as a matter of law that an officer in levying an execution within a dwelling house must make a peaceable entry and has no right t\u00f3 break open an outer door or other outside protection of such dwelling house, and if the jury believe from the evidence in this case that the defendant broke open or caused to be broken open the outer door or other outside protection of the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house in levying- the writ or writs of execution in question, then all acts thereafter done pursuant to said wrongful entry, if the jury believe from the evidence there was such wrongful entry under said writ or writs by the defendant or by his direction, were unlawful. What constituted the outer door or other outside protection of the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house is a question of fact for the jury. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b165-4\" pgmap=\"165\">Counsel for defendant contend that this instruction was prejudicial because (1) it assumes that the boarding house kept by plaintiff was a \u201cdwelling house,\u201d and (2) because it left to the jury to decide, under the evidence, that an inner door might be an outer door, and therefore was misleading. The evidence clearly shows that the house in question was plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house. She resided therein with her family. We do not think that the mere fact that she rented certain rooms to others and also kept boarders made it any less a dwelling house. (State v. Leedy, 95 Mo. 76, 78.) The term \u201cdwelling house\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary as \u201ca house intended to be occupied as a residence, in distinction from a store, office, or other building;\u201d and in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201ca house usually occupied by the person there residing, and his family; the apartment, building, or cluster of buildings in which a man with his family resides.\u201d And it was not disputed on the trial that plaintiff occupied the house as her dwelling house, and defendant in his plea of justification stated that the articles which he seized and took in execution were in \u201csaid dwelling house.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b165-5\" pgmap=\"165(35) 166(236)\">The second objection to the instruction evidently has reference to the last sentence thereof. As we understand it the argument is, inasmuch as the evidence was conflicting on the question whether defendant broke in the double doors entering into the vestibule, and as there was no dispute as to the breaking in of the double doors leading from the vestibule into the hall, that by the instruction the jury might have thought that said last mentioned doors were outer doors, and that the court should have told the jury by an appropriate instruction which of the two sets of doors were the outer and which the inner, instead of submitting this question to the jury to decide. We do not think that the defendant was prejudiced by the instruction. In Snydacker v. Brosse, 51 Ill. 357, 359, it is said: \u201cIt is a uniformly recognized rule of the common law, that no officer has the legal authority to break an outer door, or other outside protection, to an individual\u2019s house, for the purpose of executing civil process.\u201d In our opinion, under the facts shown, the double doors leading from the vestibule into the hall are to be considered in law as much the 1 \u2018 outer door or other outside protection\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s house as the other outer doors leading into the vestibule. An entrance into the inside of plaintiff\u2019s house could not be effected by reaching the vestibule which is outside of the doors opening into the main hall of the house. There is therefore no basis for counsel\u2019s objection to the instruction.</p> <p id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166(112) 167(17)\">Complaint is made of the giving qf the tenth instruction offered by plaintiff. By it the jury were told that if they found the issues for the plaintiff, and that if they further found from the evidence that plaintiff had an established business which was injured or destroyed as the proximate result of the acts of defendant in taking plaintiff\u2019s goods, they might assess such damages, if any, proximately accruing to plaintiff from such loss of business. Counsel\u2019s argument against the instruction is based on the assumption that he lawfully entered plaintiff\u2019s house and made a lawful levy on plaintiff\u2019s goods. Under the facts shown we do not think there was error in the giving of the instruction. (Snydacker v. Brosse, 51 Ill. 357, 361.)</p> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">It is also contended that the giving of the fifth instruction offered by plaintiff tended to mislead the jury. As the portion complained of is predicated upon the assumption that defendant made a peaceable entry into plaintiff\u2019s house, and the jury found in one of their special findings that he broke the outer door thereof, we do not think that the defendant could have been prejudiced by the giving of the instruction. Furthermore, we think the jury were properly instructed as to the measure of damages for property unlawfully taken.</p> <p id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">Complaint is also made of the fact that the court refused to give defendant\u2019s thirteenth instruction, as offered, but modified it by inserting therein certain words and giving' it to the jury as modified. We do not think that the defendant was at all prejudiced by the' action of the court.</p> <p id=\"b167-7\" pgmap=\"167\">Fourth. It is further contended that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. We do not think so.</p> <p id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167\">The above are all the points urged and argued in the brief of defendant\u2019s counsel as grounds for a reversal of the judgment. Finding mo reversible error in the record the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b167-9\" pgmap=\"167\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
