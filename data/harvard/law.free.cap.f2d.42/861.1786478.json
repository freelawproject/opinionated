In September, 1929, a Packard truck, containing a quantity of distilled spirits on which no tax had been paid was seized at In-wood, in the Eastern district of New York. The government filed its libel for forfeiture, and a claimant appeared and secured a dismissal on the ground that there was no allegation that the spirits were of domestic origin. Leave to amend was granted, but the district attorney elected to stand on the pleadings without change, and the libel was dismissed. By its appeal the government now seeks to have-established its right to have distilled spirits of foreign manufacture held contraband under section 3450, Rev. St. (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1181, 1182), to the same extent and under the same circumstances that those of domestic origin would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">The appellee relies on our decisions in The Squanto, 13 F.(2d) 548, and The Pictonian, 20 F.(2d) 353. In both of those eases imported intoxicating liquors were involved, and it was held that section 3450, Rev. St. for that reason did not apply. Those seizures, however, were both made before section 900 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA \u00a7 245) was in effect. This last-named statute has clearly imposed a tax on imported distilled spirits, and in plain language provides that they shall \u201cbe held to be imported into the United States\u201d even if smuggled or brought in unlawfully. Now, therefore, section 3450, Rev. St. (26 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1181, 1182), undoubtedly applies alike to distilled spirits of foreign and of domestic origin. As to its application to the latter, see United States v. One Ford Coup\u00e9, 272 U. S. 321, 47 S. Ct. 154, 71 L. Ed. 279, 47 A. L. R. 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-20\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
