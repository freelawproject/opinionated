A number of men and several automobiles were there, and a quantity of the liquor was unloaded. The vessel, five trucks, and some of the men were captured. The overt acts alleged were sufficiently proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">It may be conceded that the evidence connecting the four appellants with the transaction was not as strong as it might have been and was disputed. However, we need not review it, as we cannot say, as a matter of law, there was no evidence at all to go before the jury. The conspiracy was conclusively established, and but slight evidence connecting the defendants was necessary. If the conflict was resolved in -favor of the government, it was sufficient to support the conviction. The question presented was essentially for the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">The record presents no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
