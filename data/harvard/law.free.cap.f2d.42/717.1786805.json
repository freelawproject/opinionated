The Alaska Maru, according to the answer, never carried any goods under the bill of lading in question. Consequently, she had none to discharge, and there was nothing upon which the notice clause could operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-22\">The valuation clause, to which exception has been filed, is, I think, free from the objectionable features which, in numerous decisions, have brought about the invalidation of somewhat similar clauses. The exception to it will therefore be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-23\">The interrogatories attached to respondent\u2019s answer are directed to an endeavor to prove that libelant is not a bona fide holder for value of the bill of lading upon which suit is brought. Upon that theory they are not improper. The exceptions to them will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
