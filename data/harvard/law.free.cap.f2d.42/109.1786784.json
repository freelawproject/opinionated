The petitioning creditors excepted to the rulings of the District Judge, excluding evidence as to fraud and directing a verdict for the defendant. To test the legality of the lower court\u2019s rulings, an appeal was taken thirty six days after the entry of judgment. The motion here is to dismiss the appeal because not taken within thirty days after the rendition of judgment, as provided by the amendment of 1926 to section 25a of the Bankruptcy Aet (11 USCA \u00a7 48(a). It is claimed by the appellant that the appeal so allowed is in the nature of a writ of error at common law, wherein the time for taking an appeal is three months, and that the amendment to section 25a of the Bankruptcy Aet has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The authorities have established that a clear-cut distinction exists between a writ of error, which brings up matters of law only, and an appeal, which brings up both law and fact. This distinction has been recognized by the legislation of Congress from the foundation of the government. Dower v. Richards, 151 U. S. 658, 14 S. Ct. 452, 88 L. Ed. 305, Elliott v. Toeppner, 187 U. S. 327, 23 S. Ct. 133, 47 L. Ed. 200; Duncan v. Landis (C. C. A.) 106 F. 839 (3rd Cir.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\"> Under section 19 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (11 USCA \u00a7 42), the person against whom a petition has been filed, is entitled, on demand, to a trial by jury to determine the question of insolvency, and any act of bankruptcy alleged to have been committed. In the absence of such application, within the time prescribed, a jury trial is presumed to have been waived. Except as provided in the act, the. right to submit the matters in controversy shall be determined according to the laws of the United States in relation to trials by jury. Section 19 of the original aet has not been amended in any way, and is therefore in full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">The Aet of May 27, 1926 (44 Stat. 662), amended certain sections of the original aet. Among others, it amended section 24a (11 USCA \u00a7 47(a). The amendment consisted of adding certain courts invested with appellate jurisdiction of controversies arising in bankruptcy. Subsection b, which provided that the Circuit Courts of Appeal should have jurisdiction in equity, either interlocutory or final, to superintend and revise <em>m matter of law, </em>the proceedings of the inferior courts of bankruptcy, was amended (11 USCA \u00a7 47(b) by adding to the -words \u201cin matter of law,\u201d the following, \u201cand in matter of law and fact the matters specified in section 25.\u201d The original subsection b provided that such power shall be exercised on due notice and petition by the party aggrieved. This was amended by the use of the following words, \u201csuch power shall be exercised by appeal and in the form and manner of an appeal, except in the eases mentioned in said section 25 to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court.\u201d This last provision, referring to discretionary powers, relates to appeals to the Supreme Court. The amendment also adds subsection e (11 USCA \u00a7 47 (e), which provided that, \u201cAll appeals under this section shall be taken within thirty days after the judgment, or order, or other matter complained of, has been rendered or entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">It will be noticed that section 24 has special reference to the jurisdiction of appellate courts, while section 25 relates specially to the appeals. Section 25 of the original aet (30 Stat. 553) provides, \u201cThat appeals, <em>as m equity cases, </em>may be taken in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy to the circuit court of appeals of the United States, and to the supreme court of the Territories\u201d in certain designated eases, one of which is \u201cfrom a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt.\u201d The appeal in such case shall be taken within ten days after judgment has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">The only change in amendment of section 25 was the addition to the appellate courts of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and the time of the appeal being extended from ten to thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">The other amendments in the act of 1926 have no relevancy to the question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">Title 28 of the United States Code was amended in 1928 by amendments \u00a7\u00a7 861a and 861b (28 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 861a, 861b), by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>which writs of error, civil and criminal, were abolished. \u201cAll relief which heretofore could be obtained by a writ of error shall hereafter be obtainable by appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">But this would appear to be only a change of name. Amendment \u00a7 861b provides, \u201cThe statutes regulating the right to a writ of error, defining the relief which may be had thereon, and prescribing the mode of exercising that right and of invoking such relief, including the provisions relating to costs, supersedeas, and mandate, shall be applicable to the appeal which the preceding section substitutes for a writ of error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">From the foregoing considerations, the following may be stated by way of conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">1. The right to trial by jury on application of the alleged bankrupt is absolute and cannot be withheld at the discretion of the court. In this it differs from the trial of an issue in equity, which the court is not bound to grant, nor bound by the verdict if such trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">2. A fact tried by a jury cannot be reexamined in any court in the United States, otherwise than according to the rule of the common law. At common, law there were only two modes known to re-examine such facts, namely, the granting of a new trial or the awarding of a venire facias de novo by an appellate court for some error of law which has intervened in the proceeding. The phrase \u201ccommon law\u201d is broad enough to include all suits in which legal rights are to be determined in that mode as distinguished from equitable rights, and cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Insurance Co. v. Cornstock, 16 Wall. 258, 21 L. Ed. 493; Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 7 L. Ed. 732; Duncan v. Landis (C. C. A.) 106 F. 839; Elliott v. Toeppner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">3. Section 25a, which provides, that appeals <em>as in equity cases </em>may be taken in bankruptcy proceedings from \u201ca judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt,\u201d has been distinctly held by the Supreme Court not to empower the appellate court to re-examine the facts determined by a jury under-section 19, otherwise than according to the rule of the common law. The provision has been held to apply only\u2019when trial by jury is not demanded, and the court of bankruptcy proceeds on its own findings of fact. In the latter ease, the facts and the law are re-examinable on appeal, while in the former, the verdict of the jury, on which judgment is entered, concludes the issues of fact, and the judgment is reviewable only for error of law. Elliott v. Toeppner, supra, and other cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">4. As section 19 of the Bankruptcy Act has not been amended, the right, on demand, to trial by jury on the question of insolvency and the commission of any act of bankruptcy still exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">5. This constitutional right of trial by jury, distinctly given by section 19, could not be construed as taken away by the words of the amendment to section 24b, wherein the appellate courts are given jurisdiction to superintend and revise in matter of law and in matter of law and fact, the matters specified in section 25, and by the use of the words, \u201cSuch power shall be exercised by appeal and in the form and manner of an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">In both sections, the appeals referred to are \u201cappeals <em>as in equity cases,\u201d </em>and the meaning of these words has been unequivocably adjudicated by the authorities above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">6. As section 25a has been held inapplicable to the cases where a jury trial is demanded by the alleged bankrupt, it would seem to follow, as a necessary conclusion, that section 25a, as amended, has no application where a jury trial is demanded. If inapplicable,- none of its provisions, including the time of appeal, will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss the appeal is therefore overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
