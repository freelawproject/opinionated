Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Generally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the primary method employed by federal prisoners to attack their convictions collaterally. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). On rare occasions, however, it is possible for federal prisoners to attack their convictions and sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 as opposed to \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>Under the savings clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus [pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241] in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added). Thus, a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federal imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979) (holding a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion is insufficient on its own to establish the ineffectiveness of \u00a7 2255 remedies); <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245 (holding \u00a7 2241 may not be used to circumvent the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions). \u201cThe burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the petitioner.\u201d <em>McGhee, </em>604 F.2d at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">We have articulated a three-prong test to determine whether \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. According to that test, the savings clause applies when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">(1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4t\"><em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. If the savings clause does apply, and the petitioner is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241, the proper inquiry in the \u00a7 2241 proceeding \u201cwill be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted, as \u2018actual innocence\u2019 is defined in <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Townsend was not convicted of any crime which was made nonexistent by a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1244. Therefore, under the test we established in <em>Wofford, </em>Townsend\u2019s claims do not fit within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. As we noted in <em>Wofford, </em>Townsend is attempting to use \u00a7 2241 to escape the procedural restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Moreover, Townsend cannot argue he was actually innocent until after he has shown the savings clause does in fact apply. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. As such, his arguments relating to his claim of actual innocence are without merit and fail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\">. On August 1, 2005, Townsend filed with this Court a number of documents collectively referred to as \"Counter Claim/Post Settlement and Closure of Account Under Public Policy.\u201d This \"Counter Claim\u201d contains various documents, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a(1) document which sets forth allegations based on various provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, (2) reinsurance agreement, (3) financing statement, (4) security agreement, (5) durable power of attorney, and (6) non-negotiable international bill of exchange. After careful examination, it does not appear Townsend requests this Court grant him a specific type of relief with respect to this \"Counter Claim,\u201d nor does it appear the filing relates in any way to the claims raised in this appeal. As such, we take no action on this filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-16\">. Townsend suggests because Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, which defined his offense of conviction, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to try, convict, and sentence him for acts or conduct committed within the sovereign territory of Georgia. This issue, however, was raised for the first time in his reply brief, and thus, has been abandoned. See <em>Hall v. Coram Healthcare Corp., </em>157 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir.1998). In any event, Townsend\u2019s arguments with respect to Congress\u2019s authority have no bearing on the fact \u00a7 2255's savings clause does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
