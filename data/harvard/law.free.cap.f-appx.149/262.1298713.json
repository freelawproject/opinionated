Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On direct appeal, Flores raised for the first time the claims that: the district court\u2019s upward departure was improper in view of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Concluding that those claims were foreclosed by our precedent, we affirmed Flores\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>122 Fed.Appx. 720 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">Flores subsequently filed a petition for writ of certiorari, requesting relief under <em>Booker. </em>After the Supreme Court remanded the case, pursuant to our instructions, the parties briefed the issue of whether <em>Booker </em>impacted Flores\u2019s sentence. We now reconsider the case in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Flores\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">Relying on <em>Booker, </em>Flores argues that the Sixth Amendment was violated because his enhanced sentence was based on the district court\u2019s determination of a fact not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. He further argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>sentencing pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines system in his case constitutes <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Flores admits that because he did not raise a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court this claim must be reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Under the plain error standard, this Court may correct a defendant\u2019s sentence only if there is (1) an error; (2) that is clear and obvious; and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520. If all three requirements are met, an appellate court may exercise its discretion to correct a forfeited error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In response to this Court\u2019s question, Flores admits that he \u201ccannot point to any statement in the record that could support an inference that the district court would likely impose a lesser sentence on remand.\u201d Clearly, Flores cannot shoulder his burden of demonstrating that the result would have likely been different had the district court sentenced him under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522. Flores thus cannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, because there is no plain error, we reinstate our judgment affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">. To preserve the issues for further review, Flores argues that the sentencing error was \"structural'' and that application of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedy would constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. However, as acknowledged by Flores, this Court has rejected these claims. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005) (rejecting claim that sentencing under a mandatory regime was \u201cstructural\u201d); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005) (rejecting contention that applying the advisory guidelines would constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>violation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
