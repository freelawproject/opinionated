For the reasons provided below, the court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">Florence began working for Frontier Airlines (Frontier) as a commercial airline pilot in September 2000. On November 30, 2000, Florence submitted an IRS Form W-4 classifying himself as exempt from tax withholding. On or about January 8, 2001, Frontier\u2019s Executive Vice President asked Florence to either provide proof that he was exempt from withholding or to submit a W-4 reflecting his status as nonexempt. Florence refused these options. On February 1, 2001, the Vice President sent Florence a letter telling him that he was being terminated because he failed to submit a valid W-4 IRS Form. In the letter, the Vice President indicated that Florence\u2019s \u201crefusal to follow the tax laws casts significant doubt on [his] judgment and the likelihood that [he] would follow Frontier\u2019s directives for the safe and effective operation of an aircraft.\u201d Florence then sued Frontier for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, and wrongful termination. Florence alleged that Frontier fired him for \u201crefusing to accede to the criminal act of signing an altered or forged record.\u201d Florence appears to contend that signing a W-4 that reflected his status as nonexempt from tax withholding would constitute a criminal act of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">The first judge assigned to Florence\u2019s case dismissed Florence\u2019s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The second judge assigned to the case entered summary judgment in Frontier\u2019s favor on Florence\u2019s claims for wrongful termination and defamation. Florence then appealed. Florence\u2019s pro se brief does not address the dismissal of his claim for breach of the covenant of good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and fair dealing, and therefore, this court will consider only Florence\u2019s complaints about the summary judgment on his wrongful termination and defamation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The court reviews the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same standard applied by that court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court conducts an independent review of the record, taking factual inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, and then determines whether the movant is entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The movant is entitled to summary judgment if the documentary evidence shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">On January 12, 2005, the district court entered a well-reasoned order that thoroughly justified its grant of summary judgment. After considering Florence\u2019s pro se brief and reviewing the record, this court finds no error in the district court\u2019s summary-judgment rulings. Summary judgment was proper on Florence\u2019s wrongful termination claim because he failed to produce evidence showing that Frontier required him to perform an illegal act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Florence contends that Frontier ordered him to sign an altered W-4, he testified in his deposition that he did not see the purported altered document and he did not recall what changes the Vice President wanted him to make to his W-4. In any case, he did not have to sign the document because he had another option\u2014 to provide proof that he was exempt for tax withholding. Florence, however, presented no evidence that shows he is exempt from withholding. Thus, Florence faded to present evidence that raised a fact question about whether Frontier required him to perform an illegal act. Consequently, Frontier was entitled to summary judgment on Florence\u2019s wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">Summary judgment was also proper on Florence\u2019s defamation claim because he failed to produce evidence that Frontier published a defamatory statement to a third party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead of contending that Frontier published a defamatory statement, Florence argues that he was required to publish defamatory statements by being required to produce copies of his termination letter to prospective employers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defamatory statements Florence identifies are the statements that he failed to submit a valid W-4 and that his refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to do so cast significant doubt on his ability to follow Frontier directives and to safely and effectively operate aircraft. Where a plaintiff relies on self-publication, he must produce evidence showing that he published the alleged defamatory statements without an awareness of the defamatory nature of the matter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Florence testified in his deposition that he produced copies of the letter to prospective employers when he applied for employment, but he presented no evidence showing that he was not aware of the nature of the purported defamatory statements. Florence has always maintained that the statements in his termination letter are defamatory, beginning with his complaint where he alleged that the letter \u201cfalsely stated that [his] sense of judgment would render [him] incapable of operating an aircraft in a safe and effective manner.\u201d In addition, Florence referred to the letter in his deposition as a \u201cletter of wrongful termination\u201d through which he was \u201crepeatedly defamed.\u201d These statements show that Florence was aware of the purported defamatory nature of the statements at the time he provided the letters to prospective employers. Florence presented no evidence that raised a fact question about whether he was aware of the purported defamatory nature of the statements in his termination letter. As a result, Frontier was entitled to summary judgment on Florence\u2019s defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">Florence also contends that the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment violated his right to have a jury decide disputed issues of fact. Whether summary judgment violates a litigant\u2019s right to a jury trial is a question of law the court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cA grant of summary judgment does not violate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. This right exists only with respect to disputed issues of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, the district court correctly determined that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Because no fact question exists, Florence was not entitled to a jury trial; thus, summary judgment did not violate Florence\u2019s right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Florence further complains that the district court denied his motion to strike an affidavit supporting Frontier\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u2014 specifically, an affidavit by Frontier\u2019s Vice President. In his motion, Florence argued that the Vice President was not competent to testify as an expert witness. The court reviews this complaint for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, the record does not show an abuse of discretion. In his affidavit, the Vice President attested to his personal knowledge of facts contained therein. The Vice President then discussed the events that led to Florence\u2019s termination. He did not give an expert opinion about any matter. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Florence\u2019s motion to strike the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Finally, Florence complains that the district court did not give him an opportunity for reciprocal discovery. The court reviews the district court\u2019s discovery rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record shows that Florence had over eleven months to obtain discovery from Frontier. In addition to the original nine months allowed for discovery, the district court extended the time for discovery by two months after Florence failed to attend his deposition and persisted in frustrating Frontier\u2019s attempts to obtain discovery. The record does not reflect an abuse of discretion or any error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Throughout this litigation, Florence has attacked the professional integrity and character of the judges assigned to his case. In addition, Florence has insulted Frontier\u2019s attorney. Although the district court was patient when faced with Florence\u2019s contumacious behavior, this court will not tolerate such disrespectful and inappropriate conduct. The court therefore admonishes Florence to cease and desist in his pattern of filing pleadings that insult the court and its officers and admonishes Florence about the role of civility in litigation. \u201c[0]ne acting pro se has no license to harass others ... and abuse already overloaded court dockets.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If Florence fails to heed this admonishment, the court will strike any pleading filed in this court that insults a judicial officer, the court, or an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Having determined that the district court did not err, the court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">. <em>Degan v.
