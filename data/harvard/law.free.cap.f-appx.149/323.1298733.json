Medrano appeals the denial by the district court of his request for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). We affirm for these reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">1. Because there was extensive evidence in the record supporting both sides of the dispute and the evidence did not conclusively weigh in favor of either side, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (the position of the government will be deemed to be substantially justified \u201cif there is a \u2018genuine dispute\u2019 ... or \u2018if reasonable people could differ as to [the appropriateness of the contested action]\u2019 \u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">2. The fact that the district court ultimately remanded the case back to the agency to further develop the factual record does not lead to a finding of no substantial justification. <em>Id. </em>at 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (stating that \u201ca position can be justified even though it is not correct\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
