We vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Because Lewis raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection before the district court, we review his sentence de novo, but will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We have clarified there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) Sixth Amendment, or consitutional, error based upon sentencing enhancements imposed under a mandatory Guidelines system neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">We have consistently rejected Lewis\u2019s argument that a district court errs when it considers prior convictions in sentencing a defendant as a career offender under the Guidelines. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>[523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998),] the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Here, the district court concluded Lewis qualified for the career offender enhancement based upon two of Lewis\u2019s prior convictions. The issue of whether the crimes qualified as crimes of violence or drug crimes, and thus satisfied the career offender enhancement requirements, was never submitted to a jury. We have consistently held that prior convictions are excepted from <em>Booker\u2019s </em>safeguards regarding facts found by a preponderance of evidence that serve to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment objection to the imposition of an enhancement based on a prior crime of violence failed because \u201c[the Supreme] Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker </em>... is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction.\u201d). Thus, there is no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Even in the absence of constitutional error, <em>Booker </em>error exists where the district court imposes a sentence under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. The district court sentenced Lewis under a mandatory Guidelines system, thus statutory error exists. <em>See id. </em>\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect.\u201d If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (some internal punctuation omitted). The burden is on the government to show the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">The Government cannot meet its burden. The Government cites that the district court denied Lewis\u2019s request for a downward departure, instead giving him a sentence at the low end of the Guideline range, as well as the district judge\u2019s statement that he believed the sentence was appropriate. However, this is not enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>for us to \u201csay with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error\u201d of treating the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See id. </em>We note the district court correctly calculated Lewis\u2019s Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005) (stating after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Lewis according to <em>Booker, </em>considering the Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-18\">. We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold the Government did not meet its burden of showing the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
