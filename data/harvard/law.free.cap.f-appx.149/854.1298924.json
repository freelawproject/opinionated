Haynes does not challenge the district court\u2019s findings regarding the deficiencies of his complaint, rather, he argues that it was an abuse of discretion to give an eleven-year-old child adult Lasix, citing to non-binding case law dealing with medical malpractice, personal injury, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">We reviews questions of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Milan Express, Inc. v. Averitt Express, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 975, 978 (11th Cir.2000). Subject-matter jurisdiction in federal court can be found under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, federal question, or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, diversity jurisdiction. For federal question jurisdiction, Haynes must allege a violation of his constitutional rights or a right created under a federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. For diversity jurisdiction, Haynes must allege that he and the defendants are citizens of different states and that the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In this case, Haynes is proceeding under federal question jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">In order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). State action requires both an alleged constitutional deprivation \u201ccaused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the States or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible,\u201d and that \u201cthe party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\u201d <em>Patrick v. Floyd Med. Ctr., </em>201 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2000). This is a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>Nail v. Community Action Agency of Calhoun County, </em>805 F.2d 1500, 1501 (11th Cir.1986). If we conclude there is no state action, we must dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">Only in rare circumstance may a private party be viewed as a state actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 1347. To hold that private parties are state actors, we must conclude that one of the following conditions is met: (1) the state coerced or at least significantly encouraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution (state compulsion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>test); (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state (public function test); or (3) the state had so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private parties that it was a joint participant in the enterprise (nexus/joint action test). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Because Haynes did not allege a constitutional violation by a state actor, he fails to meet the jurisdictional prerequisites to bring an action under \u00a7 1983. Haynes did not allege any other basis for federal jurisdiction, and thus, the district court properly dismissed his civil complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
