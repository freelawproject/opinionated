Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Previously, we affirmed West\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. West, </em>114 Fed. Appx. 159 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1867, 161 L.Ed.2d 717 (2005). Following our judgment, West filed a petition for certiorari, challenging for the first time the constitutionality of the federal Sentencing Guidelines as applied in his case. After reconsidering our decision in light of <em>Booker, </em>we reinstate our prior judgment affirming West\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We will not consider arguments raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Since West\u2019s case features none, we will not consider his <em>Booker </em>arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Alternatively, we note that West concedes in his certiorari petition that he did not preserve the <em>Booker </em>error at trial. Thus, even if we were to consider his Booker-based argument, we would still deny relief as West could not survive the plain error review mandated by <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Accordingly, we reinstate our judgment affirming West\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
