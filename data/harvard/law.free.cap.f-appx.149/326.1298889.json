Lexington cross-appeals the denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">Educare was sued as a result of one of its employee\u2019s alleged sexual assault of a resident in an Educare group home. Educare Employees DeLaCerda and Elvenia Hackett were implicated in claims for negligent hiring and negligent supervision and training. The parties settled the underlying lawsuit, Lexington contributing $1,000,000 to the settlement in accordance with the primary policy\u2019s maximum commercial general liability coverage. However, the primary policy contained two coverage parts: commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) and medical professional liability (\u201cMPL\u201d). Pursuant to the MPL coverage of the primary policy and to a non-waiver, reservation of rights agreement entered into between Educare and Lexington prior to the settlement, Educare seeks indemni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>f\u00edcation for the amount it paid in satisfaction of the settlement agreement. The crucial question on appeal, therefore, is whether the negligent supervision claim in the underlying lawsuit falls within the MPL coverage included in the primary policy, requiring Lexington to indemnify Educare for the additional $1,500,000 that Educare paid in settlement. Additionally, Lexington appeals the denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Fed.R.CivP. 56(c), the moving party bears the initial burden of \u201cinforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the moving party has met its Rule 56(c) burden, the nonmovant cannot survive a motion for summary judgment by resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court reviews the facts drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">Texas rules of contract interpretation control in this diversity case concerning disputed language in an insurance policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a coverage dispute, the primary concern of the court is to give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed by the policy language.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court gives the terms used in the policy their plain, ordinary meaning unless the policy itself shows that the parties intended the terms to have a different, technical meaning.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court must \u201cconsider the policy as a whole and interpret it to fulfill [the] reasonable expectations of the parties in light of customs and uses of the industry.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When considered as a whole, a contract is ambiguous only if \u201cit is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although a court will construe ambiguities in an insurance contract against the insurer and in favor of coverage, \u201cnot every difference in the interpretation of a contract or an insurance policy amounts to an ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The language of the insurance policy is clear. The MPL covered amounts that Educare become legally obligated to pay as \u201cdamages resulting from a medical incident arising out of professional services.\u201d The MPL defined a \u201cmedical incident\u201d as \u201cany act, error or omission in the providing of or failure to provide professional services.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The MPL defined \u201cprofessional services\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">1. Medical, surgical, dental, nursing or other health care services including but not limited to the furnishing of food or beverages in connection with such services; the practice of nuclear medicine; the furnishing or dispensing of drugs or medical, dental or surgical supplies or appliances; or the handling or treatment of deceased human bodies, including autopsies, organ donation or other procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">2. Services by any person as a member of a formal accreditation, standards review or similar professional board or committee of any Insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">8. Supervising, teaching, proctoring others at your request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On appeal, Educare argues that the negligent training and supervision of its employee qualifies as faffing within the \u201csupervising, teaching, and proctoring\u201d prong of the professional services definition, resulting in coverage under the MPL. This assertion, however, wholly removes the phrase from the list in which it is enumerated and from the context which that list provides \u2014 namely, professional healthcare. The very title of the coverage, \u201cMedical Professional Liability,\u201d suggests that coverage depends on providing professional medical care. All of the examples of services enumerated in part 1 of the definition require some specialized education or experience. Furthermore, part 2 requires some special accreditation. Though urging a broad interpretation of the language \u201cother health care services\u201d found in part 1, Educare does not argue that the relevant employees are covered by parts 1 or 2 of the definition. If we were to accept Educare\u2019s view of coverage under part 3, all of Educare\u2019s employees, simply by virtue of being trained or supervised in a group home environment, would qualify for coverage under the MPL part of the policy, irrespective of the employee\u2019s level of participation in providing healthcare. This cannot be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">Interpreting the policy as a whole, it is clear that the MPL excludes the training and supervision of an employee not possessing the type of skills set forth in parts 1 or 2 of the definition. After all, this is the purpose of MPL coverage, to supplement non-professional CGL coverage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, when read in context, the supervision and teaching must be for healthcare services \u2014 professional in nature \u2014 demanding either specialized knowledge, such as that required to perform the enumerated tasks in part 1, or recognized training, such as that required by part 2. In affirmation, this court previously has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>interpreted a coverage exclusion for supervisory activities contained within a detailed definition for professional services to require specialized training.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Moreover, when not expressly defined in such a way that purports to vary the customary usage of the term, the accepted meaning of professional services, according to both Fifth Circuit and Texas state law, conforms to this interpretation of the professional services definition in the present case. This Court has defined professional healthcare services as not \u201ca purely physical action in response to a business determination, but rather the exercise of a trained judgment in obedience to an established medical policy.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Likewise, Texas courts define \u201cprofessional services\u201d as requiring specialized education and knowledge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These customary definitions do not singularly inform but, rather, stand to buttress the conclusion that the parties contracted for coverage related to professional medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The record demonstrates that the training of and supervision by the Educare employees named in the underlying lawsuit did not involve professional services as defined by the instrument, thereby precluding coverage under the MPL part of the insurance policy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Neither DeLaCerda nor his supervisor Elvenia Hackett had any specialized medical education or experience. DeLaCerda was hired as a nighttime \u201cprogram technician,\u201d a position that required a high school diploma or equivalent, a valid driver\u2019s license with an acceptable driving record, and a demonstration of competency on the one-week new employee orientation that included a thirty-minute introduction to mental retardation. No state license was required. The program administrator for Educare described the night-shift program technician\u2019s duties as typically not involving resident contact, except in the case of emergency.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>job required cleaning and home maintenance duties and visually verifying that the residents were sleeping safely. Moreover, DeLaCerda was not allowed to perform medical tasks or even hand a pill to a resident; therefore, he was not even remotely involved in administering any type of professional medical care. The evidence on record does not create a question of fact; DeLaCerda\u2019s employment duties with Edureare did not qualify as \u201cprofessional services\u201d as defined in the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The claims against Educare in the underlying litigation also alleged the negligent supervision and training of DeLaCerda\u2019s supervisor Elvenia Hackett. Hackett, a residential director, obtained a G.E.D. and had attended both a business program and a cosmetology school prior to her employment with Educare. In addition to the same one-week orientation that DeLaCerda attended, she also received one week of on-the-job training, which included sitting in on interviews and familiarization with the paperwork involved in the administration of a group home.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Hackett was responsible for the grocery and household supply shopping, for staffing, and for interacting with the residents\u2019 guardians. She was not, however, allowed to perform any medical tasks, such as distributing medication to a resident. Thus, Hackett was not responsible for providing professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The record before this Court, viewed in light most favorable to Educare, does not raise a genuine issue of material facts regarding DeLaCerda and Hackett\u2019s provision of professional services as required by the MPL part of the insurance policy. We agree with the district court that Educare is not entitled to indemnification for the additional $1,500,000 it paid in satisfaction of the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Lexington also cross-appeals the district court\u2019s rejection of its claim for attorney\u2019s fees under its written agreement with Educare.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Again, this court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Of course, state law governs construction of the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For diversity cases, attorney\u2019s fees awards are also governed by state law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Lexington and Educare entered into an agreement preserving rights and possibly for reimbursement. Two separate paragraphs provided for recovery of fees in litigation in the event of any overpayment during settlement. Paragraph five provided that any party funding more than its share of the settlement would be reimbursed with interest and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Paragraph nine provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201c[t]he successful party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with this coverage dispute between the Parties incurred from the effective date of this agreement through final resolution.\u201d The agreement did not define the term \u201csuccessful party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Again, extricating a single clause from the whole instrument, Lexington now argues that it is the successful party under paragraph nine and is, therefore, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. However, the instrument, as read in its entirety, requires that the successful party prevail in an action for reimbursement of funds paid in excess of its share. Paragraph nine states that \u201c[t]he successful party shall ... recover ... attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with <em>this </em>coverage dispute\u201d \u2014 not in connection with any coverage dispute (emphasis added). Lexington did not overpay in the present case and is not entitled to any reimbursement pursuant to the non-waiver agreement. Therefore, as the district court concluded, attorney\u2019s fees cannot be sustained by the non-waiver agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\"> Pursuant to the 5th CIR.
