The Government seeks to enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision in Rios-Dominguez\u2019s plea agreement. Rios-Dominguez waived, inter alia, \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d except for a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure from the applicable sentencing guidelines range. Rios-Dominguez contends that this waiver provision is not enforceable because, at his rearraignment, the magistrate judge incorrectly told him that he retained the right to appeal \u201cany illegal sentence.\u201d Because the magistrate judge\u2019s statement regarding the parameters of the reserved right to appeal inaccu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>rately described the waiver provision, Rios-Dominguez\u2019s waiver cannot be deemed knowing and voluntary with respect to \u201cany illegal sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R. CrimP. 11(b)(1)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For the first time on appeal, Rios-Dominguez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Also for the first time on appeal, Rios-Dominguez argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rios-Dominguez acknowledges that this argument is reviewed for plain error, but argues that he does not have to show that the district court\u2019s error affected her substantial rights because the error is structural and because prejudice should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Plain error is the correct standard of review. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). The district court committed error that is plain when it sentenced Rios-Dominguez under a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556); <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005). Rios-Dominguez fails to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
