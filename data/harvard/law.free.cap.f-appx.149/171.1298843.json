Burns now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in her opinion, there are no meritorious issues for review. Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), counsel filed a supplemental brief asserting that Burns\u2019 sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely. </em>Burns later filed a pro se supplemental brief, contending that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm Burns\u2019 conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Burns pleaded guilty to distributing methamphetamine on April 29, 2002. The transcript of Burns\u2019 plea colloquy discloses full compliance with Rule 11 of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Rules of Criminal Procedure. Notably, he admitted that he sold 1.03 grams of methamphetamine to a confidential informant. Burns stated that he understood that the maximum sentence to which he was exposed was twenty years and that his sentence would be determined under the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Burns\u2019 presentence report held him accountable for a marijuana equivalency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 151.37 kilograms, for a base offense level of 26. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(e)(7) (2002). Two levels were added for possession of a firearm, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and obstruction of justice, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, respectively. With an adjusted offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of III, Burns\u2019 guideline range was 12 to 151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">At sentencing, Burns objected to the attribution to him of sixty grams of methamphetamine about which Darrell Jones testified before the grand jury, to one gram of the drug found on Jones\u2019 person, and to .67 grams found on Darrell Blankenship\u2019s person. Burns did not object to the attribution to him of the weight of drugs that were involved in six controlled purchases, including the April 29 sale to the informant, or to drugs that were found in a cooler at his residence. The marijuana equivalency of the drugs to which Burns did not object was 28.03 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The district court overruled the objection as to the sixty grams of methamphetamine about which Jones testified, sustained the objection to the methamphetamine that was taken from Blankenship, and counted only .58 grams of the methamphetamine that was taken from Jones\u2019 person. The marijuana equivalency for which the court therefore held Burns accountable had no impact on the base offense level, which remained 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Burns conceded at sentencing that he possessed a firearm in connection with his drug trafficking but disagreed that this fact warranted the two-level increase under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The district court overruled his objection, based in part upon the testimony of Terry White, Burns\u2019 wife, who stated that Burns obtained the gun to use as protection against anyone who might try to steal drugs or drug proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Finally, the district court overruled Burns\u2019 objection to the increase for obstruction of justice for threatening to harm White if she cooperated with authorities. White testified that Burns had beaten her in the past and that he threatened to harm her if she incriminated him. A videotape of White, showing bruises that she once sustained at Burns\u2019 hands, was admitted into evidence. The district court found that White was a credible witness and that the increase was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The court concluded that Burns\u2019 offense lever was 30 and his criminal history category was III, for a guideline range of 121 to 151 months. Burns received a 126-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">Burns first contends that admission of the videotape was unduly prejudicial. This argument is without merit. The Federal Rules of Evidence do not generally apply at sentencing. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). Further, there is no limitation on the information about a defendant that a court may consider in sentencing a defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (2000). Here, the district court acted appropriately when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>it permitted the introduction of the videotape. We note that, even without this evidence, White\u2019s testimony was strong enough to establish that the increase for obstruction of justice was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In both the formal supplemental brief and Burns\u2019 pro se brief, Burns contends that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory guidelines scheme which provided for sentence enhancements found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Booker, 125 </em>S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J.), 756-57 (Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), we held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based upon facts found by the court, not by the jury or admitted by the defendant, constitutes plain error that affects that defendant\u2019s substantial rights. In the guilty plea context, reversal is warranted when the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed based on the facts established by the plea or otherwise admitted by the defendant and the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Here, neither the indictment nor the plea agreement identified the amount of drugs involved in the offense. At the plea colloquy, Burns admitted that he sold 1.03 grams of methamphetamine to an informant on April 29, 2002. At sentencing, he admitted that he should be held accountable for the April 29 controlled purchase, the weight of methamphetamine involved in five other controlled purchases, and the weight of drugs (methamphetamine, oxycodone, and marijuana) found in a cooler at his residence. The marijuana equivalency of the drugs for which he conceded responsibility results in a base offense level that is markedly less than that assigned at sentencing. Under <em>Booker, </em>this error alone establishes that Burns\u2019 sentence <em>of </em>126 months stood well above the properly calculated guideline range. In accordance with <em>Hughes, </em>we recognize this plain error, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Our review of the entire record discloses no grounds for reversal of the conviction, which we accordingly affirm. Burns\u2019 sentence is vacated as violating <em>Booker, </em>and the matter is remanded for resentencing. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">.
