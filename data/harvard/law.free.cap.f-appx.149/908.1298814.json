Stephens filed the instant complaint in the Superior Court of Rockdale County, Georgia (\u201cRockdale Superior Court\u201d) against State Farm, alleging that, during discovery for a previous action, State Farm had fraudulently and in bad faith failed to disclose a liability policy that provided coverage for Stephens\u2019s automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">On appeal, Stephens first argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant her motion to remand. Specifically, Stephens asserts that (1) because she and State Farm both were citizens of Georgia, and her complaint alleged the violation of Georgia statutes, this case properly was filed in the Rockdale Superior Court; and (2) State Farm\u2019s notice of removal was not timely filed because State Farm failed to file page 3 of her complaint or a copy of Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to her complaint within 30 days of receiving service of her complaint. She also contends that State Farm was in default because it failed to file an answer to her complaint in either Rockdale Superior Court or the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">We review the district court\u2019s \u201cdenial of a motion to remand de novo.\u201d <em>Behlen v. Merrill Lynch, </em>311 F.3d 1087, 1090 (11th Cir.2002). A defendant may remove to federal court a civil action brought in state court, provided that the federal court has original jurisdiction over the action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Original jurisdiction may be based upon diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Diversity jurisdiction exists where the suit is between citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. <em>Id. </em>For purposes of \u00a7 1332, a corporation is a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1). A defendant seeking to remove a civil action from a state court must file a notice of removal in the United States district court for the district and division within which such action is pending, containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal and a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon it relating to the underlying action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a). \u201cThe notice of removal ... shall be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within thirty days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Because the district court had original diversity jurisdiction over the instant action, and State Farm timely filed its notice of removal, the district court did not err by denying Stephens\u2019s motion to remand the instant action to the Rockdale Superior Court. State Farm, under \u00a7 1332(c)(1), was a citizen of Illinois because it was incorporated under the laws of Illinois and had its principal place of business there. Thus, the district court had diversity jurisdiction because State Farm and Stephens were citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. Additionally, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Stephens contended that State Farm\u2019s notice of removal was not timely filed under \u00a7 1446 because State Farm did not file page 3 of her complaint and failed to file a copy of Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to her complaint within 30 days of receiving service of her complaint, this will not defeat removal. State Farm filed its initial notice of removal on October 10, 2003, within thirty days of receiving service of Stephens\u2019s complaint, these documents had no bearing on the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, and this Court has held that although a party failed to file all the necessary papers with the district court under \u00a7 1446, removal was proper. <em>Covington v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>251 F.2d 930, 932-33 (5th Cir.1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Stephens\u2019s argument that State Farm is in default for failing to file an answer to her complaint is without merit. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(c), State Farm had five days, after filing the petition for removal on October 10, 2003, within which to either \u201canswer or present the other defenses or objections available.\u201d Due to the intervening Columbus Day holiday and weekends, State Farm had until October 20th to file its response to Stephens\u2019s complaint. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) (stating that, in calculating a time period of less than 11 days, a party need not count legal holidays or weekends). State Farm filed its motion to dismiss on October 20, 2003. Therefore, Stephens is not entitled to a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Stephens also appears to argue that, because her complaint involved new issues of \u201cbad faith\u201d that had never been heard by any court, the district court erred by finding that her claims were barred by collateral estoppel. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss <em>de novo.\u201d Shields v. Bellsouth Advertising and Pub. Co., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a claim is barred on the basis of collateral estoppel. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Perneo Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 42, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). A federal court \u201cgive[s] preclusive effect to the judgment of a state court provided that two conditions are met: first, that the courts of the state from which the judgment emerged would do so themselves; and second, that the litigants had a \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 to litigate their claims and the prior state proceedings otherwise satisfied \u2018the applicable requirements of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shields, </em>228 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">In considering whether to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment, the district court must apply state law. <em>Vazquez v. Metropolitan Dade County, </em>968 F.2d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir.1992). Under Georgia law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\">[c]ollateral estoppel precludes the re-adjudication of an issue that has previously been litigated and adjudicated on the merits in another action between the same parties or their privies.... [U]n-like res judicata, collateral estoppel does not require identity of the claim \u2014 so long as the issue was determined in the previous action and there is identity of the parties, that issue may not be re-litigated, even as part of a different claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-14\"><em>General Elec. Capital Computer Servs., v. Gwinnett County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>240 Ga.App. 629, 523 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">The district court did not err by granting State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>on the finding that Stephens\u2019s claims were barred by collateral estoppel. In the instant action, Stephens claimed that during discovery for a previous action State Farm had fraudulently and in bad faith failed to disclose a liability policy issued to its insured that provided coverage for her automobile accident and would satisfy a judgment that the state court had granted her. In the previous action that Stephens filed against the insured, the Rockdale Superior Court determined that the only applicable insurance coverage for the van involved in Stephens\u2019s car accident was the $50,000 individual policy issued to Hudson, the driver of the van. The Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed the state court\u2019s findings. In a motion to set aside the judgment by the Rockdale Superior Court on the grounds of mistake or fraud, Stephens claimed that State Farm and the insured had failed to disclose the $500,000 liability policy issued to the insured. The Rock-dale Superior Court denied Stephens\u2019s motion, finding that the documents on which Stephens\u2019s claim was predicated were produced in prior discovery. Because State Farm was in privity with its insured, it was entitled to the benefit of those rulings. <em>See American States Ins. Co. v. Walker, </em>223 Ga.App. 194, 477 S.E.2d 360, 362 (1996) (holding that with respect to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the insurer stands in the shoes of the insured as to the identity of parties or privies). Accordingly, because the issue that Stephens raised in the instant action already had been adjudicated on the merits in a previous action between Stephens and a privy to State Farm, her action is barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Because the issue that Stephens raised in the instant action already had been adjudicated on the merits in a previous action between Stephens and a privy to State Farm, the district court did not err by granting State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the finding that Stephens\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-6\">. In <em>Bonner v.
