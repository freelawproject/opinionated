On appeal, he argues that the district court violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and committed Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>error, when it enhanced his sentence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (2002), and determined that he was a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, based on factual findings made only by a preponderance of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">McConnell does not clearly challenge the fact that his prior convictions satisfy the career offender requirements, nor could he, as discussed below. In order for a defendant to be designated a career offender, the Government must establish that (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) that the instant offense is a felony for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) that the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(a). The only \u201cfact\u201d that McConnell\u2019s brief could be construed as challenging is whether his prior convictions were for crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The prior convictions at issue were for kidnapping and common law robbery. Both are listed in the guidelines as \u201ccrime[s] of violence.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l). Thus, any claim that McConnell\u2019s prior convictions were not for crimes of violence is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">McConnell contends, however, that the district court plainly erred under <em>Blakely </em>in finding that the prior convictions were crimes of violence, even in light of the guideline definition and McConnell\u2019s lack of objection. We squarely rejected an identical claim in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.2005), holding that, where a defendant has no colorable defense to the career offender designation, we will decline to exercise our discretion to correct any Sixth Amendment error. Accordingly, McConnell\u2019s claim is without merit. <em>See also United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 522-23 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11 (4th Cir.2005) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation where district court did not need to resolve any disputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Because McConnell was correctly categorized as a career offender, his base offense level was determined by the statutory maximum for his crime, rather than by his relevant conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(b). Thus, his USSG \u00a7 2B3.1 enhancement had no effect on either his adjusted offense level or his final sentence. As such, he cannot show that the district court committed plain error when it imposed this enhancement after determining the underlying facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 548 (4th Cir.2005) (outlining prejudice requirement for showing plain error in <em>Booker </em>context).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Accordingly, we affirm McConnell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
