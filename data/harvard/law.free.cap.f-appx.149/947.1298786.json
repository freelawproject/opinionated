We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">The petitioners, a married couple of Russian ethnicity who lived in Estonia for most of their lives, were admitted into the United States in April 1997 as nonimmigrant visitors. They were given authorization to remain in the United States until 30 September 1997. On 14 March 2001, the petitioners were issued a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) before an IJ by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which alleged that they were citizens and natives of Russia and charged them with removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-18\">At their preliminary hearing before the IJ, the petitioners, through counsel, conceded removability and admitted to the charges set forth in their NTAs, with the exception that they denied Russian citizen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ship. They asserted that they were bom in the Soviet Union at a time when Russia was not an independent country and thereafter lived in Estonia for many years. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the petitioners alleged that their applications for Estonian citizenship were denied because the father of Vera Protsenko was part of the former Soviet Union military. The temporary travel documents issued to them by the Estonian government indicated their country of citizenship as \u201cXXX.\u201d AR at 70. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ found the petitioners removable, but reserved ruling on the issue of the petitioners\u2019 citizenship until a subsequent hearing. Finally, the IJ asked petitioners whether they wanted to designate a country of removability, to which they responded negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Subsequently, petitioners submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal based on the persecution they suffered in Estonia on account of their religion, nationality, and membership in a particular social group. To support her claims of persecution, Vera Protsenko alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) she had been persecuted for her Christian Orthodox faith, a prominent faith among ethnic Russians, by the Estonian government which refused to recognize the Christian Orthodox religion; (2) Estonian law denominated her a foreigner because she was of Russian nationality and hindered her from attaining Estonian citizenship; (3) she had been fired from her job as a teacher based on her lack of Estonian citizenship; (4) she and her family had been the victims of hate crimes as anti-Russian Estonians burglarized their home twice, and sprayed red stars on their home in one such incident; and (5) on 23 January 1997, the Kaitselit, an anti-Russian paramilitary group, beat Juri because of his status as a former Soviet military officer. In support of these claims, the petitioners submitted various documentation, including: hospital records which indicated that Juri was treated at a hospital for injuries after the January 1997 incident; a certificate from the Estonian government denying Vera Estonian citizenship and permanent residency; certificates from the Russian embassy which indicated there was no record petitioners were citizens of Russia; Juri\u2019s former military identification card; a certificate from Vera\u2019s employer which indicated she was terminated from her teaching position due to a \u201clack of pedagogical education,\u201d AR 208, and various newspaper articles which documented discrimination of ethnic Russians living in Estonia. In response, the government submitted the 2000 United States Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Estonia and Russia. The Country Report for Estonia noted that former Soviet military officers and their families are often precluded from obtaining Estonian citizenship. Estonian naturalization laws were, however, in line with international standards, according to the report. Moreover, although ethnic Russians often complained of discriminatory treatment in the workplace and in living conditions, the Estonian Country report stated that foreign government officials monitoring the situation in Estonia found no such pattern of human rights violations. The Russian Country Report indicated that immigrants with a legal claim to Russian citizenship often have difficulty emigrating to Russia from former Soviet republics and obtaining Russian citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">At the removal hearings, the petitioners provided testimony to buttress their asylum application. Particularly, Vera Protsenko testified that she was stateless because Estonian law had declared that anyone not residing in Estonia before 1940 was a foreigner, and because the Estonian government had denied her ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>plications for citizenship four times. She admitted that she had not applied for Russian citizenship because she had lived in Estonia her entire life and would have difficulty obtaining Russian residency permits and living in Russia without any ties to the area. Vera also testified that she had been a teacher for several years, but was terminated because she lacked the proper education. She stated that this was just an excuse to fire her, however, and that the real reason for her termination was her participation in a teacher\u2019s union and her reluctance to support the school administrators\u2019 plan to rapidly \u201cEstonianize\u201d the education system in place of the old Russian system. Vera admitted, however, that not all Russian teachers at her school were terminated. In addition, Vera testified that she participated in demonstrations to fight religious and anti-Russian persecution, and that she had been arrested and detained for twenty-four hours during one such demonstration. Finally, Vera testified that she and her family were targeted by an anti-Russian youth group on two specific occasions. In January 1993, she testified that a group of youth burglarized their home and left anti-communist graffiti on their walls. Although police investigated the burglary, she testified that they did not report or investigate the anti-Russian hate crime aspect of the incident. She testified that the same group burglarized her family\u2019s summer residence in 1995, but she did not report the crime because she felt that the police would not have helped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The IJ then rendered a decision denying the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. Although the IJ found Vera\u2019s testimony credible, she also found that the petitioners failed to meet their burden of showing eligibility for asylum or CAT protection. Specifically, the IJ noted that it appeared as though the petitioners had been victimized and suffered isolated incidents of discrimination, but not to the extent necessary to show that they had suffered past persecution. The IJ found that it was not enough that Vera had lost her job, noting that the stated reason for her termination was that Vera did not have a degree in education, which she had admitted was true. With regard to Juri\u2019s beating incident, the IJ found that, although it was \u201creprehensible,\u201d it was, at most, an isolated incident resulting from an Estonian \u201cbacklash\u201d against the Russian military occupation prior to Estonia gaining its independence. AR at 59-60. The IJ proceeded to note that the petitioners were \u201cnot just innocent Russian settlers in the area for Estonia,\u201d but, rather both Juri and Vera\u2019s father \u201cwere members of the military serving what Estonia now sees as the foreign enemy. And now they\u2019re basically paying the consequences of that.\u201d AR at 60. With regard to Russia being the country of removal, the IJ noted that the petitioners were ethnic Russians and found that it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the petitioners to claim that they had no roots or ties to Russia when the same could be said about their decision to apply for asylum in the United States. AR at at 61. The IJ concluded that the petitioners had a \u201cduty to avail themselves of the citizenship and protection of\u2019 Russia. AR at 62. In sum, because petitioners had established that they suffered from a \u201clevel of discrimination and nothing more,\u201d the IJ denied the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered them removed to the Russian Federation, or alternatively, in the case of Vera, to Estonia. AR at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Petitioners, through counsel, appealed the Id\u2019s decision to the BIA. They argued that the IJ erred because: (1) substantial evidence supported their asylum claims; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>(2) they were improperly ordered removed to Russia; and (3) the IJ expressed a political bias by suggesting that any anti-Russian discrimination they suffered was deserved after Estonia gained its independence. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision that petitioners had failed to establish eligibility for asylum and dismissed their claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">On appeal, the petitioners make three arguments that the BIA\u2019s order should be reversed. First, they argue that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that they failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA. Second, they argue that their due process rights were violated because the IJ did not give them notice they could be removed to Russia and because the IJ\u2019s comments betrayed an anti-Russian political bias. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">II. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">A. <em>Denial of Asylum and Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">\u2018We review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Here, because the BIA concurred with the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions. We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283. To reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, a reviewing court must conclude that the record not only supports such a conclusion, but compels it. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">The INA provides the Attorney General with the discretion to grant asylum to an otherwise removable alien. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The Attorney General may exercise such discretion upon finding that the alien is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-12\">A \u201crefugee\u201d is \u201cany person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-13\"><em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). The burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he or she is a refugee. <em>Id. </em>To establish past persecution, an \u201cextreme concept,\u201d the asylum applicant must show \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotations and citation omitted) (finding one bombing targeted at the asylum applicant and three threatening telephone calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>insufficient to establish past persecution). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d to qualify for asylum, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [his or her nationality].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Where an alien has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the alien likewise has failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT. <em>Nreka v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1369 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Based on the foregoing precedent, we conclude that the record does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s order. With regard to the loss of Vera\u2019s job, the record demonstrates that the stated reason for her termination \u2014 her lack of an education degree \u2014 had a factual basis which Vera admitted. Moreover, she admitted that she was not supportive of the school\u2019s plan to change its educational system from the old Russian system and that other ethnic Russian teachers were not fired. Thus, despite her allegations of pretext, the record does not compel a finding contrary to the one reached by the IJ and the BIA. In addition, with regard to the two incidents in which the Protsenkos\u2019 home was burglarized and the one incident in which Juri was beaten, the record does not demonstrate that these were more than isolated acts and therefore did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Moreover, in light of the facts that Estonian police investigated the first incident of burglary after being called by the Protsenkos, and that Juri was treated for injuries by an Estonian hospital, the record does not demonstrate that the Estonian government had refused to protect the Protsenkos. Additionally, the fact that Vera was detained after participating in a demonstration does not compel a contrary finding on the issue of past persecution. <em>See Rojas v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>134 Fed.Appx. 330, 334-35 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (one incident of short-term government detention along with threatening telephone calls insufficient to constitute past persecution). Accordingly, taking these allegations in the aggregate, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners had not demonstrated past persecution. Likewise, we conclude the petitioners did not sufficiently establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although they were allegedly denied citizenship and residency four times, they did not demonstrate that the Estonian government would decline to protect their rights because of their Russian ethnicity. Moreover, the government offered evidence from the Estonian Country Report which indicated that there was no pattern of human rights abuses against ethnic Russians in Estonia, and that programs existed for integrating ethnic Russians into Estonia. <em>See Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cA State Department report on country conditions is highly probative evidence in a well-founded fear case.\u201d). In addition, the IJ noted that Vera\u2019s parents and her brother, now an Estonian citizen, still live in Estonia, and yet the record does not reflect that they suffered any persecution. <em>See Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir.2004) (finding that an alien did not establish a well-founded fear where, <em>inter alia, </em>the alien\u2019s family continued to live in Lebanon without incident). Thus, because the petitioners failed to establish past persecution on account of their ethnicity or a well-founded fear of future persecution, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that they were not entitled to asylum. Moreover, because they could not establish eligibility for asylum, the BIA and IJ properly refused petitioners\u2019 claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>withholding of removal. <em>Nreka, </em>408 F.3d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">B. <em>Due Process Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>an asylum applicant\u2019s claim that due process rights were violated during removal proceedings. <em>Lonyem v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). To prevail on a due process challenge to the sufficiency of removal proceedings, an alien must show that the due process violation caused substantial prejudice, which typically requires a showing that the outcome would have differed had the due process violation not occurred. <em>See Ibrahim v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). Here, the Protsenkos argue that their due process rights were violated because they were not given notice that they could be removed to Russia and because of the IJ\u2019s alleged anti-Russian bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">1. Notice of Removal to Russia</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Aliens are entitled to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process rights during deportation proceedings. <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306,113 S.Ct. 1439, 1449, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). The Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201c[d]ue process is satisfied only by a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Ibrahim, </em>821 F.2d at 1550. A fair hearing occurs when applicants are given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Courts have found due process was violated where an asylum applicant was not given proper notice of a potential country of deportation and subsequently was ordered removed to that country. <em>See Kossov v. INS, </em>132 F.3d 405, 408 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Based on the foregoing precedent, we conclude that petitioners\u2019 argument about a lack of notice they could be deported to Russia is without merit. The record reflects that when asked to name a country of deportation at their hearing before the IJ, the Protesenkos declined to name a particular country. Notwithstanding this, the government submitted a State Department Country Report for Russia and there were extended colloquies in the record about the petitioners\u2019 ties to Russia and their interactions with the Russian government. In addition, at one point in the record, the issue of denominating Russia as a potential country of deportation was discussed. <em>See </em>AR at 81. Moreover, Vera Protsenko was offered an opportunity to discuss why Russia would not be a suitable country of deportation. <em>See </em>AR at 96-98. Accordingly, in contrast to the facts in <em>Kossov, </em>the record in this case reveals that the petitioners were given ample notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of Russia as a potential country of deportation. Thus, we reject the petitioners\u2019 argument that their due process rights were violated by the purported failure to notify them that they could be deported to Russia. Additionally, we note that when an alien refuses to designate a removal country, as in the instant case, the Attorney General has \u201cvery broad discretion\u201d in specifying the country to which the alien will be sent. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1295. Because the petitioners were ordered removed to a country pursuant to the regulations established by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2)(E), the IJ did not abuse its discretion in denominating Russia as the country of deportation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number><em>2. </em>IJ\u2019s Alleged Bias</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">As we noted previously, due process requires that petitioners are afforded \u201ca full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Ibrahim, </em>821 F.2d at 1550. Courts have recognized that due process guarantees that petitioners in removal proceedings \u201care entitled to an unbiased arbiter who has not prejudged their claims.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>398 F.3d 722, 725 (6th Cir.2005). Due process is violated when an IJ abandons the role of neutral factfinder and becomes a partisan advocate in the proceedings. <em>See Reyes-Melendez v. INS, </em>342 F.3d 1001, 1006-07 (9th Cir.2003). Where the IJ\u2019s inquiry and statements are supported by the record, however, there is no due process violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Based on the foregoing, we reject petitioners\u2019 due process claim regarding the IJ\u2019s bias. In characterizing the alleged attacks on petitioners by anti-Russian groups, the IJ noted that these events stemmed from a \u201cbacklash\u201d by Estonians newly independent from the Soviet regime. Rather than showing a bias on the part of the IJ, this characterization of events finds support in the record in the Country Report for Estonia. <em>See </em>AR 172-73. Moreover, in contrast to situation in which the IJ revealed its bias by aggressively questioning an asylum applicant, <em>see, e.g., Reyes-Melendez, </em>342 F.3d at 1007, the record does not demonstrate that the IJ actively questioned the petitioners or assumed the role of a partisan advocate. Moreover, assuming the IJ\u2019s comments could be construed as a due process violation, petitioners have failed to demonstrate they were substantially prejudiced. Because petitioners conceded removability, and because we have determined that substantial evidence did support the IJ\u2019s denial of their asylum application, petitioners cannot show the outcome would have been different in the absence of any due process violation. Accordingly, we reject petitioners\u2019 due process claim regarding the IJ\u2019s purported bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">On appeal, Vera and Juri Protsenko petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s affirmation of the IJ\u2019s order denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal and directing their removal to Russia. As we have explained, the IJ\u2019s denial of their asylum application was supported by substantial evidence and we discern no reversible due process violations in the removal proceedings. Accordingly, the PETITION is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">. On 25 November 2002, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (\u201cHSA\u201d), Pub. L.
