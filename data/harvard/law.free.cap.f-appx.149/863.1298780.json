Background</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">ECUA is a local government body which owns, manages, and finances the water and wastewater systems of Escambia County, Florida. Woods, an African-American male, began working for ECUA in 1988 as a clerk. In 1994, he was promoted to a position as a risk management and safety officer. Between 1995 and 1999, Woods received evaluations which alternatively noted that he needed improvement in communication, but that his performance was good or excellent. In February 2000, Donna Calhoun became Woods\u2019s supervisor, and Executive Director A.V. VanDever instructed Calhoun to ensure the development and implementation of a safety program. Accordingly, Calhoun advised Woods that he should develop a safety program and gave him a deadline to prepare a draft. With VanDever\u2019s approval, Calhoun outsourced some of Woods\u2019s responsibilities so that he could focus on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>safety program. This change in duties did not alter Woods\u2019s title or pay. To check Woods\u2019s progress, Calhoun and VanDever further determined that it was necessary to conduct more frequent special evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In March 2000, Calhoun reprimanded Woods for insubordination and unacceptable conduct towards another employee. Shortly thereafter, Woods was suspended for neglect of duty for allegedly failing to return a customer\u2019s phone call. In April 2000, Woods was again suspended for neglect of duty, this time for failing to complete a draft program by the deadline. Woods disputed the allegations and met with VanDever to express his concern that Calhoun was out to \u201cget\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In response to Woods\u2019s concern, VanDever transferred Woods\u2019s supervision to Ernest Dawson, an African-American male. Dawson supervised Woods for sixty days, during which time he informed Woods that he should focus on developing the safety program and gave Woods detailed instructions for doing so. According to Dawson, Woods did not complete the assignments by the due dates, and Dawson suspended Woods in May 2000 for neglect of duty. At the end of the sixty days, Dawson informed Woods that he would be submitting a special evaluation of his work performance and that Woods would be reassigned to Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">On July 28, 2000, Woods filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). After Woods filed his charge, he received Dawson\u2019s special evaluation which noted that his performance needed improvement in communication, quality, productivity, initiative, and safety. When Dawson submitted his special evaluation, he did not know that Woods had filed an EEOC charge. Woods returned to Calhoun\u2019s supervision and Calhoun completed other special evaluations in September and November 2000, which again gave Woods low marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">In December 2000, ECUA terminated Woods for poor performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Woods\u2019s amended complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he alleged, <em>inter alia,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that he was terminated in retaliation for his July 2000 EEOC complaint. The district court granted summary judgment to ECUA, reasoning that Woods had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Woods now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Eberhardt v. Waters, </em>901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, the plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>show that (1) he engaged in statutorily-protected expression; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is some causal relation between the two events. <em>Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 740 (11th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Woods filed his initial EEOC complaint in July 2000 and was terminated in December 2000. The district court properly found that the four-month time span between the fifing of the EEOC complaint and Woods\u2019s termination was not sufficiently close to raise any inference of a retaliatory motive and, therefore, that Woods failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliatory termination. <em>See Wascura v. City of South Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2001). On appeal, Woods does not quarrel with the district court\u2019s rejection of his retaliation claim based on his termination. Instead, he argues that his retaliation claim is also based on other adverse employment actions that occurred after he filed his EEOC charge but before his termination. Specifically, he points to the following: (a) the alleged reclassification of his job and (b) the special performance evaluations. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Woods\u2019s argument that the reclassification of his position constituted retaliation fails because he does not show that this amounted to an adverse employment action. \u201cAn adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that \u2018alters the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir.2000). Other conduct that \u201cfalls short of an ultimate employment decision must meet \u2018some threshold level of substantiality ... to be cognizable under the anti-retaliation clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining that level of substantiality, we have stated that \u201cTitle VII[ ] is neither a \u2018general civility code\u2019 nor a statute making actionable the \u2018ordinary tribulations of the workplace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Here, ECUA requested that the Civil Service Board reclassify Woods\u2019s position, but that request was denied. To the extent that any \u201cunofficial\u201d reclassification occurred, it did not reduce Woods\u2019s title or pay or otherwise affect his status. Some of Woods\u2019s duties were outsourced, but that was to enable him to concentrate on other aspects of his job such as the safety program. Woods does not explain how any reclassification that occurred amounted to an adverse employment action, other than to proffer his own conclusory allegations, which are insufficient to meet his burden. Accordingly, he failed to establish a prima facie ease of retaliation based on a reclassification of his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Likewise, Woods fails to establish a prima facie case of retaliation based on the special evaluations. Although the issuance of the special evaluations may amount to an adverse employment action, Woods cannot show a causal connection between the evaluations and the fifing of his EEOC charge. Woods\u2019s initial special performance evaluation occurred before he filed his EEOC charge. Although it is true that Woods received his second special evaluation after filing his EEOC complaint, Woods was told by Dawson several weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>prior to filing his EEOC complaint that Dawson would be preparing a special evaluation covering his temporary 60-day assignment to Dawson. Moreover, Dawson was unaware of Wood\u2019s EEOC complaint when he prepared the evaluation. Finally, the evidence does not support an inference that the later two evaluations issued after he filed his EEOC complaint were in retaliation for that complaint. As the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">In the five months prior to the plaintiffs July 28th, [sic] EEOC complaint, the plaintiff had received one written reprimand, was suspended three times, received one poor performance evaluation, was transferred to another supervisor due to problems, and received repeated notice that his failure to develop a satisfactory safety program was unacceptable. All of this preceded the plaintiffs filing of an EEOC complaint. Therefore, it is not surprising that the defendant continued to closely monitor and evaluate the plaintiffs work efforts after he filed the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Thus, Woods failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation based on the special evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Woods failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">. Woods raised other claims below, including a Title VII race discrimination claim and a race discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court granted summary judgment to ECUA on these claims as well. On appeal, Woods provides no argument as to how the district court erred in resolving these other claims. Therefore, he has abandoned these other issues. <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. After his termination, Woods filed a second charge with the EEOC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. The initial complaint named both ECUA and Executive Director A.V. Vandever as defendants. After ECUA moved to dismiss and for summary judgment, Woods amended his complaint, naming only ECUA and dropping certain claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b885-17\">. As discussed <em>supra </em>in note 1, Woods raised other issues in his amended complaint which are not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the employer does so, the plaintiff then bears the burden of demonstrating that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext for retaliation. <em>Meeks v. Computer Associates Int\u2019l., </em>15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
