Because we find no error in the determination of Billiott\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">On appeal, Billiott asserts that his sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He specifically asserts that the enhancements to his offense level that were based upon more than minimal planning and his role in the offense violated the Sixth Amendment because facts supporting these enhancements were not found by a jury, or found by a beyond a reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-19\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005), we held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not by a jury (or, in a guilty plea case, admitted by the defendant), constitutes plain error. That error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56. Sentencing courts were directed to calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005), and impose a sentence. If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court should state its reasons for doing so. <em>Id. </em>at 546. In determining the sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the probation officer enhanced the offense level by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2) because the crime involved more than minimal planning or a scheme to defraud more than one victim, and by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(c) because Billiott was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Billiott\u2019s total offense level was sixteen. This offense level and Billiott\u2019s criminal history category of I resulted in a sentencing range of twenty-one to twenty-seven months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Because Billiott did not object to the presentence report, we review the district court\u2019s guideline calculation for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under the plain error standard, Billiott must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the enhancement for more than minimal planning or a scheme to defraud more than one victim was not imposed in violation of Billiott\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. Although the facts supporting this enhancement were not charged in the indictment, Billiott admitted in the plea agreement that more than one victim suffered financial loss, thus demonstrating a scheme to defraud more than one victim. With regard to the enhancement for Billiott\u2019s role in the offense, we agree with Billiott that this enhancement is not supported by any facts alleged in the indictment or admitted by him during the plea hearing. We conclude, however, that no Sixth Amendment error occurred in the imposition of this enhancement. If this enhancement is removed, Billiott\u2019s total offense level would be seventeen, and his sentencing range twenty-four to thirty months. Because the twenty-six-month sentence imposed does not exceed the guideline range calculated without the improper enhancement, Billiott\u2019s sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 301 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cFor purposes of determining whether the district court erred, we necessarily use [the] guideline range based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>facts [appellant] admitted before adjusting that range for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We therefore affirm Billiott\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(1997) (''USSG\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
