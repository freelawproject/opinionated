Because Pullins failed to raise this claim below, we must review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Pullins pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine on October 14, 2003. At sentencing, the district court found Pullins responsible for cocaine equivalent to 11.95 kilograms of marijuana, but only 3.647 kilograms of that amount is attributable to Pullins\u2019 actions on October 14. That 3.647 kilograms of marijuana equivalent results in a base offense level of twelve, not the offense level of sixteen upon which Pullins\u2019 sentence was calculated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying offense level twelve<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Pullins\u2019 criminal history category of TV, Pullins\u2019 sentencing range would have been twenty-one to twenty-seven months. Pullins\u2019 sentence of twenty-seven months fell within that range. As Pullins\u2019 sentence did not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts of the offense to which he pled guilty, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred that affected his substantial rights. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error. <em>See Evans, </em>416 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">To the extent Pullins argues that the district court\u2019s treatment of the sentencing guidelines as mandatory requires resentencing, this claim also fails. Although Pullins is correct that the district court erred in treating the guidelines as mandatory, <em>see Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48, we have held that in the plain error context, the error of sentencing under the mandatory guidelines regime does not warrant a presumption of prejudice, nor is it a structural error. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 224 (4th Cir.2005). Nothing in the record suggests the error in applying the guidelines as mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>affected the court\u2019s ultimate determination of Pullins\u2019 sentence. Accordingly, Pullins cannot satisfy the prejudice requirement of the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Pullins\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">. Pullins does not challenge his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\" of Pullins\u2019 sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-15\">. As in <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298 (4th Cir.2005), for purposes of determining whether a Sixth Amendment violation occurred, the sentence imposed on Pullins is compared against the guideline range he should have received, based on a jury verdict or admitted conduct, excluding the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
