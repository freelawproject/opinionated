Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1563 (11th Cir. 1994). Because the record demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>that the district court did not address the ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and there was no opportunity to develop a record of evidence relevant to the merits of Fonseca\u2019s claims, we decline to consider Fonseca\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Fonseca next argues that there was no evidence to support the charge that he corruptly gave money for purposes of illegally and improperly importing an energy drink into the United States. The government responds that the district court did not plainly err in accepting Fonseca\u2019s guilty plea and in finding that there was a sufficient factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Where a defendant fails to object to the factual basis for a guilty plea, we review the issue for plain error only. <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>323 F.3d 1298, 1299 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). After reviewing the factual proffer made by the government at the plea colloquy and Fonseca\u2019s admission to the factual proffer, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in finding that the evidence was sufficient to support Fonseca\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Finally, we conclude that the district court did not err in imposing a three-year sentence of probation. The district court clearly acted within its discretion in imposing this sentence, and Fonseca has failed to show otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Because there is no merit to any of the arguments Fonseca makes in this appeal, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-13\">. Fonseca argues for the first time in his reply brief that the indictment was defective. Issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived on appeal. <em>See United States v. Dieter, </em>198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
