Toledo argues that the district court erred by imposing the eight-level increase in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2003) for having a prior aggravated felony conviction. Toledo contends that his Texas state conviction for possession of cocaine is not a qualifying aggravated felony because it is not a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Although Toledo conceded before the district court that this argument was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691 (5th Cir.1997), on appeal he asserts that these decisions are not binding because they conflict with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">Our precedent is clear that Congress has made a \u201cdeliberate policy decision to include as an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 a drug crime that is a felony under state law but only a misdemeanor under the [Controlled Substances Act].\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A prior conviction for a state drug offense will qualify as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) if it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and it is punishable by more than a year of imprisonment under the applicable state law. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005). Toledo\u2019s prior offense meets this definition. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2003); Tex. Health and Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 481.102(3)(D) <em>&amp; </em>481.115 (Vernon 2001); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35(a) (Vernon 2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
