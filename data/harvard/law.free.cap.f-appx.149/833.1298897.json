The district court concluded it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because Laurent failed to seek and obtain leave from the bankruptcy court prior to proceeding on appeal. Laurent argues the district court erred by dismissing his appeal because (1) he filed a timely motion for leave to appeal and a timely notice of appeal in the bankruptcy court, and (2) by its transmittal form, the bankruptcy court transferred the case to the district court, pursuant to ' Laurent\u2019s foregoing motion and notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We review determinations of law, whether made by the bankruptcy court or by the district court, <em>de novo. See Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y v. Sublett (In re Sublett), </em>895 F.2d 1381, 1383 (11th Cir.1990). The district court in a bankruptcy appeal functions as an appellate court in reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. As the second court of review, our review of the district court\u2019s decision is entirely <em>de novo. See id. </em>at 1384. \u2018We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>Carter v. Rodgers, </em>220 F.3d 1249, 1252 n. 3 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the district court erred by dismissing Laurent\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, rather than granting or denying leave to proceed with the appeal. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On October 10, 2000, Laurent filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In his Chapter 13 Schedules, Laurent listed Hugo Martinez as a creditor whose interest Laurent described as follows: \u201clien in real property held as guardian.... Guardianship held for benefit of children real property held as guardian for children transferred over 4 years prior to filing.\u201d In the Fourth Amended Chapter 13 Plan, Laurent described the following: \u201cHugo Martinez (Mortgage on guardian home) This mortgage will be dealt with outside the Chapter 13 Plan as mortgage is not valid. This debt will be avoided.\u201d The Fourth Amended Plan did not provide for payments to Hugo Martinez but did provide for payment to holders of delinquent tax certificates secured on the guardianship home. The Fourth Amended Plan identified Bank Atlantic as one of these tax-certificate holders and stated the payments to Bank Atlantic would amount to $7,776.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Laurent did not file a complaint or motion to avoid Hugo Martinez\u2019s lien on the guardian home. After notice and an uncontested hearing, on September 6, 2001, the bankruptcy court granted Martinez relief from the automatic stay to pursue a state-court claim concerning his rights in the guardian home. Martinez also was included in two more orders granting relief from the stay to certain creditors. Martinez then filed a mortgage foreclosure action in state court, which resulted in the issuance of a certificate of title, in Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>tinez\u2019s name, for the guardianship property-</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">During the pendency of the bankruptcy action, Martinez continued to make payments on the delinquent tax certificates secured by the property, but Bank Atlantic, pursuant to the automatic stay provisions, refused to accept the payments, instead forwarding them to the Chapter 18 Trustee. The Trustee, acting with explicit court authorization, then resubmitted the payments to Bank Atlantic, but Bank Atlantic refused the funds, again relying on the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">After Laurent moved on numerous occasions to modify, amend, or for clarification of the Chapter 18 Plan and the Trustee filed multiple notices of delinquency, resulting from Laurent\u2019s failure to make the required payments under the Fourth Amended Plan and failure to provide requested documentation, on January 7, 2004, the district court entered an order which \u201cdismissed with prejudice to the Debtor filing any bankruptcy proceedings for a period of six (6) months from the date hereof.\u201d The court subsequently denied numerous motions by Laurent concerning the filing of a Fifth Amended Plan and attempt to file a separate adversary proceeding. On June 18, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order closing the case and discharging the Chapter 13 Trustee. Laurent subsequently tried to appeal from this order, but did so only after the 10-day period specified in Bankruptcy Rule 8002 had expired. On July 2, 2004, the bankruptcy court dismissed the notice of appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Thereafter, on July 20, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order allowing the Trustee to release funds that Bank Atlantic had refused because the account was paid in full. The order directed the Trustee to refund any remaining funds, which included the guardian property payments returned to the Trustee from Bank Atlantic, to Laurent. Ten days later, on July 30, 2004, Laurent filed a \u201cMotion to Leave Appeal to District Court.\u201d On August 17, 2004, apparently without a ruling by the district court on Laurent\u2019s outstanding \u201cMotion to Leave,\u201d the Clerk of Court for the Southern District of Florida Bankruptcy Court transmitted the Motion and Laurent\u2019s Notice of Appeal to the district court, pursuant to a form order entitled \u201cTransmittal of Motion for Leave to Appeal.\u201d That same day, the Clerk of Court for the Southern District of Florida file-stamped a box on the transmittal form entitled \u201cBankruptcy Rule 8003 Acknowledgment of Assignment in District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Finally, on October 20, 2004, the district court, pursuant to its <em>sua sponte </em>review of the record, determined that it lacked jurisdiction because Laurent had not obtained leave from the bankruptcy court prior to proceeding with his appeal. Relying on our decision in <em>Carter v. Rogers, </em>220 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2000), the district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. In its dismissal order, the court stated: \u201cThe docket in the bankruptcy case is devoid of any motion for leave to bring suit in the district court against the Chapter 13 Trustee or any Order granting leave to do so.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">District courts have jurisdiction to review appeals from final bankruptcy court judgments, orders and decrees. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). Section 158(a)(3) also authorizes a district court to grant leave to appeal an interlocutory order from a bankruptcy court, but requires a party to obtain leave prior to proceeding. To appeal a bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order, a party must file a notice of appeal, accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(b). Even if a motion for leave to appeal is not filed, but a notice of appeal is timely filed, <em>\u201cthe district court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>... may grant leave to appeal or direct that a motion for leave to appeal be filed. . . . Unless an order directing that a motion for leave to appeal be filed provides otherwise, the motion shall be filed within 10 days of entry of the order.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8003(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The Bankruptcy Rules do not expressly provide the time for appealing an interlocutory order, but Rule 8001(b) states an interlocutory appeal \u201cshall be taken by filing a notice of appeal, as prescribed in subdivision (a) of this rule.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(b). In turn, subsection (a), governing the manner for appealing as of right, provides an appeal \u201cshall be taken by filing a notice of appeal ... within the time allowed by Rule 8002.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(a). Rule 8002 states that a notice of appeal must be filed within 10 days of the date of the entry of the order appealed from. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(a). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 If the notice is not timely filed, the appellate court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 403, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Here, the record reveals that the Trustee filed a \u201cMotion to Redirect,\u201d which the bankruptcy court granted on July 20, 2004. Within 10 days of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, on July 30, 2004, in the bankruptcy court, Laurent filed both a motion for leave to appeal and a notice of appeal. Thereafter, on August 17, 2004, the bankruptcy court transferred the case to the district court, pursuant to a form entitled \u201cTransmittal of Motion for Leave to Appeal.\u201d On this form, the bankruptcy court stated that the \u201cOrder to be Appealed\u201d was the \u201cOrder Granting Trustee\u2019s Motion to Redirect Payment.\u201d The bankruptcy court also noted on the form that it was transmitting Laurent\u2019s motion for leave to proceed and notice of appeal, along with a copy of the docket sheet, to the district court. The district court, acting pursuant to Rule 8003, confirmed receipt of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">It is clear that, after the bankruptcy court granted the Trustee\u2019s motion, Laurent timely filed a notice of appeal and a motion for leave to proceed on appeal. We observe, however, that Laurent\u2019s motion for leave did not comply with the requirements of Rule 8003. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr. 8003(a) (enumerating contents of motion for leave to appeal a bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)). However, such non-compliance is of no consequence here because he filed a timely notice of appeal from which the district court could have, pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8003, granted leave to appeal or direct that a motion for leave to appeal be filed. \u201cThe district court ... may also deny leave to appeal but in doing so <em>shall consider the notice of appeal as a motion for leave to appeal. </em>\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8003(c) (emphasis added). We note that a district court\u2019s leave <em>to proceed on appeal, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), is different from a bankruptcy court\u2019s leave <em>to bring suit </em>in the district court, which \u201ca debtor must obtain ... before initiating an action in district court when that action is against the trustee or other bankruptcy-court-appointed officer, for acts done in the actor\u2019s official capacity.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>220 F.3d at 1252 (internal citations omitted). It appears from the district court\u2019s order that the court construed Laurent\u2019s case as presenting the latter situation, when, in fact, Laurent\u2019s motion was for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">In this case, neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court ruled on Laurent\u2019s timely, albeit non-conforming, motion for leave to appeal. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>district court did not consider Laurent\u2019s timely notice of appeal as a motion for leave to appeal, as it is authorized to do under Rule 8003(c). Instead, pursuant to the Trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court concluded it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because Laurent had not obtained leave of the <em>bankruptcy court </em>prior to pursuing the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, Laurent highlighted that in the bankruptcy court, he had timely filed his notice of appeal <em>and </em>sought leave, via his \u201cMotion to Leave,\u201d prior to proceeding with his appeal. Notwithstanding the fact that Laurent timely appealed to the district court, no order was ever entered on his motion for leave, nor was his notice of appeal construed as a motion for leave. This situation did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction, within the meaning of our decision in <em>Carter, </em>since the procedural posture of the instant case in the district court presents a request for discretionary interlocutory review, <em>not </em>the initiation of a new action against the Trustee, as in <em>Carter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Based on our own review of the record, and construing Laurent\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings liberally, we conclude that Laurent\u2019s request for leave to appeal and his notice of appeal complied with the timing requirements for appealing to the district court the bankruptcy court\u2019s Order Granting Trustee\u2019s Motion to Redirect Payment. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(a), 8002(a); <em>Carter, </em>220 F.3d at 1252-53. The district court\u2019s construction of Laurent\u2019s notice of appeal as a new and separate action against the Trustee, filed without leave of the bankruptcy court, is belied by the face of Laurent\u2019s notice of appeal, from which we find it clear Laurent was seeking leave to <em>appeal </em>the decision granting the Trustee\u2019s motion to \u201cRedirect Payment.\u201d Thus, the district court erred by finding the record devoid of a request for leave, or at least, by failing to deny interlocutory review, rather than dismissing for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Again, Laurent is a <em>pro se </em>litigant, whose pleadings are construed liberally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On this record, we are satisfied Laurent followed the proper procedure for appealing to the district court from the bankruptcy court\u2019s Order Granting Trustee\u2019s Motion to Redirect Payment. It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny leave to proceed with the appeal, pursuant to either Laurent\u2019s non-conforming motion for leave to proceed or, pursuant to Rule 8003(c), by construing Laurent\u2019s timely filed notice of appeal as such a motion. <em>See Chrysler Fin. Corp. v. Powe, </em>312 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir. 2002) (noting that \u201cdistrict court\u2019s discretion to entertain an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy court is analogous to the court of appeals\u2019 discretion to entertain a Rule 23(f) appeal from the district court\u201d). Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to consider whether to grant or deny leave to proceed with the appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. The bankruptcy court properly transmitted the motion for leave to proceed on appeal to the district court since both Rule 8003 and the jurisdiction-conferring 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) discuss obtaining the <em>district </em>court\u2019s leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\">. <em>See Tannenbaum v.
