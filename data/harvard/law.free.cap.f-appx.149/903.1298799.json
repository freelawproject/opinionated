Relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Zarabia argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence based on facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by him. After review, we vacate Zarabia\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b924-19\">Zarabia pled guilty, without a plea agreement, to being a previously deported alien found in the United States without the government\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-20\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">During the plea colloquy, the government set forth the following facts, which Zarabia admitted as true. Zarabia, a Mexican citizen, was deported from the United States on May 27, 1998. Thereafter, Zarabia was found in the United States without the permission of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">Also during the plea colloquy, the government stated that Zarabia had prior felony convictions for delivery of a usable quantity of marijuana and for transporting a certain alien within the United States. Zarabia responded that he was stipulating only to the facts required to prove the charge in the indictment and not admitting to his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-23\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b924-24\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI noted that Zarabia had a prior conviction for transporting a certain alien within the United States and that this conviction qualified as an alien smuggling offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the PSI recommended that Zarabia\u2019s offense level be increased by 16 levels because Zarabia previously had been deported after committing an alien smuggling offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii). The PSI further recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VII, Zarabia\u2019s Guidelines range was 77-96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Prior to sentencing, Zarabia objected, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2581, 159 L.Ed.2d 408 (2004), to the PSI\u2019s recommendation of a 16-level enhancement. At the sentencing hearing, Zarabia renewed his <em>Blakely </em>objection. The district court overruled Zarabia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculation, and sentenced Zarabia to 77 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">On appeal, Zarabia argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him based upon a prior conviction for alien smuggling that he did not admit, and by sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Because Zarabia timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the' judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not violate Zarabia\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. This Court repeatedly has concluded that an enhancement based on prior convictions does not constitute a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. See, e.g., United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[W]e find no merit in Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s argument that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>must determine whether his prior conviction is within the category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii).\u201d); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005). In this case, the district court increased Zarabia\u2019s offense level by 16 levels because of a prior conviction for transporting a certain alien within the United States, which qualifies as an alien smuggling offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court in this case did not violate Zarabia\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Zarabia under a mandatory Guidelines regime. Thus, we must determine whether the statutory error in Zarabia\u2019s sentencing is harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, and citations omitted). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless and the standard \u201cis not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">After briefing, the government filed a concession of sentencing error and conceded that it could not \u201cmeet its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence or had \u2018but very slight effect.\u2019 \u201d There is no evidence or any indication in the record revealing what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. \u201cWe simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269,1271 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">Accordingly, we vacate Zarabia\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we are remanding the case to the district court, we note that the district court correctly calculated Zarabia\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>However, there is one Guidelines issue that needs to be addressed. On appeal, Zarabia argues that he did not stipulate to the characterization of his transporting a certain alien as an \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii). He further argues that the district court erred in finding that his offense was an alien smuggling offense, and thereby erred in increasing his offense level by 16 levels. We disagree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">According to the Guidelines, an alien smuggling offense \u201chas the meaning given that term in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) ].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. 1(B)(i). Section 1101(a)(43)(N) references the definition of alien smuggling set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In turn, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a) provides that an alien smuggling offense includes transporting or attempting to transport an alien within the United States. Specifically, a person commits alien smuggling when that person \u201ctransports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii). Thus, by referencing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), which in turn references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), the Guidelines define an alien smuggling offense to include transporting an alien within the United States. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. 1(B)(1); <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Candejas, </em>347 F.3d 853, 857 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e conclude that conspiracy to transport and harbor illegal aliens constitutes \u2018an alien smuggling offense\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vn).\u201d); <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cAccordingly, \u2018an alien smuggling offense\u2019 as used in the Guidelines includes transporting aliens within the United States.\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not err, let alone plainly err, in characterizing Zarabia\u2019s prior offense of transporting a certain alien within the United States as an alien smuggling offense for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Zarabia under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 77-96 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. According to the PSI, in December 1997, Zarabia pled guilty in the Southern District of Texas to transporting a certain alien within the United States. This offense is set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), which provides for punishment for any person who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0z\">knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, transports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">.

Although the government conceded that it could not meet its burden on the present record, the government significantly also stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">The United States does not concede, however, that the district court's <em>Booker </em>error in this case was harmful or that any sentence below the sentence that the district court imposed would have been reasonable under the circumstances in this case. The United States acknowledges only that the United States cannot show on the present record that the district court would not have imposed a different sentence if the district court would have known that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory <em>and, </em>consequently, cannot meet its burden of showing harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhKx\">(Internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b926-17\">.

Zarabia did not make this argument in the district court. In the district court, Zarabia argued only that the 16-level enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights pursuant to <em>Blakely. </em>Therefore, we review Zarabia's argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">To establish plain error, the defendant must show \u201c \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v.
