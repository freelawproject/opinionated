Petitioner challenges the IJ\u2019s decision to deny her asylum application, the BIA\u2019s decision adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen her case, and the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration of the denial of her motion to reopen. She argues that the IJ erred in finding that she lacked credibility, that she suffered no past persecution, and that she has no fear of future persecution. Because petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of IIRIRA, this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the INA, as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">After the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s order of removal, the alien may seek reconsideration on the ground that the BIA has made a legal or factual error, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), or may move to have the BIA, in its discretion, reopen the removal proceedings for the submission of new evidence, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). \u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). A motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a deportation proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Under the INA, a petitioner has 30 days from the date of the final order of removal to seek review in this Court and the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by filing a motion to reopen. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">We conclude from the record that we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s orders affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief or denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen because the petition for review was filed more than 30 days after these judgments became final. Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen her asylum case because her motion for reconsideration did not show any error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen, but merely restated the arguments made in her motion to reopen. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
