The parties agreed to a bench trial before a magistrate judge. After a bench trial, the magistrate judge entered judgment in favor of Lore on all claims. The Rosaleses filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The Rosaleses first challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to credit Lore\u2019s records of their work hours instead of their own records. An employee bringing suit for unpaid wages under the FLSA bears the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated. <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 686-87, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946). If the employer\u2019s records are \u201cproper and accurate,\u201d the employee may rely on these records; if the employer\u2019s records are \u201cinaccurate or inadequate,\u201d the employee may produce \u201csufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 328 U.S. 680. If the employee does so, the employer must \u201ccome forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee\u2019s evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 66 S.Ct. 1187. Factual findings regarding hours worked are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Anderson, </em>328 U.S. at 689, 66 S.Ct. 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Although Lore\u2019s records are not as clear or complete as they could have been, the Rosaleses\u2019 records were insufficient to allow a \u201cjust and reasonable inference\u201d of the hours they worked. The Rosaleses admitted that their records were a reconstruction prepared after the termination of their employment. Jose Rosales also claimed that he had worked 12 or more hours per day, seven days a week, for several months. Such claims strain credibility, especially when considered in light of the testimony of Lore\u2019s witnesses that the tasks the Rosaleses were hired to perform took less than two hours per day to complete. The magistrate judge did not clearly err by accepting Lore\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">The Rosaleses also challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that the mobile home that Lore provided them, rent-free, was sufficient to compensate them for their work. The magistrate judge accepted Lore\u2019s assertion that this trailer could be rented for $650 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">An employer generally may deduct the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of board, lodging, or other facilities provided to employees. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(m). There are three methods an employer can use to ascertain whether any furnished facilities are part of \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(m); because Lore did not request a determination from either the Administrator of the Hour and Wage Division or the Secretary of Labor under the second or third methods, only the method described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3 is relevant here. <em>See id.; </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.33. The formula in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3 provides that the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing his employees with lodging or other facilities is no more than the cost of operation and maintenance, including adequate depreciation, plus a reasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of capital investment by the employer. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.3(c). In order to substantiate \u201cactual cost,\u201d an employer must \u201cmaintain and preserve\u201d records of \u201citemized accounts showing the nature and amount of any expenditures entering into the computation of the reasonable cost.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In the instant case, Lore failed to comply with the applicable regulations for determining the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the trailer. Lore provided only her own unsubstantiated assertions that she could have rented the trailer for $650 per month. We conclude that the magistrate judge clearly erred by accepting Lore\u2019s estimate of the fair rental value of the trailer and in deducting this amount from any wages owed to the Rosaleses.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Rosaleses also challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s rejection of their supplemental state-law claim for breach of contract. The magistrate judge found that, even if it was assumed that Lore had signed the letter/contract presented by the Rosaleses, there was no evidence that she had read or understood the import of the letter before signing. The magistrate judge failed to address relevant Texas law that provides that a party to a contract is presumed to have read and understood its terms. <em>See Estes v. Republic Nat\u2019l Bank of Dallas, </em>462 S.W.2d 273, 276 (Tex.1970) (absent a showing of \u201cfraud or imposition,\u201d failure to read a contract before signing is not ground for avoidance); <em>Castroville Airport, Inc. v. City of Castroville, </em>974 S.W.2d 207, 211 (Tex.App.1998) (\u201cContracting parties are obligated to protect themselves by reading what they sign and are presumed, as a matter of law, to know the contract\u2019s terms.\u201d). We conclude that the magistrate judge erred in rejecting the Rosaleses breach-of-contract claim on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">For the reasons stated above, we VACATE the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
