Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014[, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621] (2005).\u201d In its remand order the Supreme Court did not specify which of the two majority opinions set forth in <em>Booker </em>was the basis for its remand decision. The Supreme Court did make clear in its <em>Booker </em>decision that both opinions would be applicable to all cases pending on direct review or not yet final as of January 12, 2005. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (citing <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328,107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987)). Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s appeal satisfies those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">In his original appeal to this court, Carrillo-Banuelos claimed three grounds of error: first, the erroneous imposition of a prohibition regarding possession of a dangerous device in his condition of supervised release; second, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional; and third, that his sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), an argument he conceded was foreclosed by our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473-75 (5th Cir.2004). Because Carrillo-Banuelos failed to make any Booker-related objection in the district court, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Applying our plain error analysis, we conclude: (1) there was error because the district court operated under a mandatory scheme and not an advisory scheme; and (2) such error is now plain under <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)(holding it is enough that error be plain at the time of appellate review). However, under the third prong of our plain error methodology, i.e., whether the error affects substantial rights, it is Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s burden to show that, but for the error of acting on the premise that the Guidelines are mandatory and not advisory, the district court would have made a different decision. In <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), we said that \u201cthe pertinent question is whether [the defendant] demonstrated that the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d That is, the plain error standard places the \u201cburden of proof [on the defendant] and requires \u2018the defendant to show that the error actually did make a difference: if it is equally plausible that the error worked in favor of the defense, the defendant loses; if the effect of the error is uncertain so that we do not know which, if either, side it helped the defendant loses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291,1300 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As the district judge noted, the circumstances of Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s previous imprisonment were indisputably \u201cbizarre.\u201d Carrillo-Banuelos illegally entered the United States in 1987. He was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance in 1994 and sentenced to ten years\u2019 probation. Probation was revoked upon his conviction for criminal mischief in 1996, and he was imprisoned. In January, 1998, Carrillo-Banuelos was deported. In October, 1998, he was arrested, in the United States, and charged under state law with child endangerment and evading detention. He was also charged under federal law with illegal re-entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">At Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s state criminal trial, the jury reported to the judge that it was deadlocked, at which point the judge gave them an <em>Allen </em>charge. Carrillo-Banuelos, in fear of an imminent, unfavorable verdict, changed his plea to guilty. Immediately thereafter, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s attorney moved for a new trial. The state court granted the motion soon after. Unfortunately \u2014 and improbably \u2014 no one told the attorney or Carrillo-Banuelos that the motion had been granted, and Carrillo-Banuelos sat in prison for four-and-a-half years \u2014 until his federal criminal trial \u2014 before anyone realized that he had been granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">At the sentencing hearing for the instant case \u2014 the federal illegal re-entry charge\u2014 the sentencing judge expressed dismay that the judge\u2019s order had been overlooked: \u201cI still do not get it. How in the world did he end up still spending five years in prison? How did that happen?\u201d She concluded: \u201cThat is just the weirdest set of facts I have ever heard. It\u2019s just bizarre that he would end up being in jail and nobody bothered to let anybody know that a new trial had been granted. That\u2019s just bizarre.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Due to this unusual circumstance, Judge Gilmore downwardly departed from a Criminal History Category of VI to a Criminal History Category of V. She wrote in the statement of reasons: \u201cThe Court finds a departure to criminal history category V is warranted, as the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>fendant\u2019s criminal history, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b).\u201d Based on this lower criminal history category, Carrillo-Banuelos\u2019s Guidelines range was 70-87 months. Judge Gilmore then sentenced Carrillo-Banuelos to 70 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Mares </em>suggests that non-verbal clues might aid the Court in determining whether the appellant has established a \u201cprobability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u2019 \u201d that the sentencing judge would have given a lower sentence if the Guidelines were discretionary. <em>United, States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cthere is no indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether she would have reached a different conclusion\u201d (emphasis added)). In this case, however, it is clear that the sentencing judge did not feel constrained to the range to which a dutiful application of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines committed her. Rather, she appropriately remarked that the circumstances were unusual, and downwardly departed accordingly. We are not persuaded that this combination of factors \u2014 (1) a downward departure, (2) a sentence at the bottom of the new range, and (3) a comment from the sentencing judge that the state criminal proceedings were \u201cbizarre\u201d \u2014 satisfies the third prong of the plain error test. Carrillo-Banuelos has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court violated his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We conclude, therefore, that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence as set by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
