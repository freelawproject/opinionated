Following that classification, Walker was transferred to Minimum-In-Housing, received a different work assignment, and lost his \u201ctrusty\u201d status. The district court dismissed Walker\u2019s suit as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Walker first argues that the district court erred in dismissing as frivolous his due process claims that he was deprived of notice and an opportunity to review the evidence supporting a finding that he was an STG member. This court reviews dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo. Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). Walker has not identified a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest in connection with his classification, either as an STG member or with respect to this \u201ctrusty\u201d status, or in the resulting housing and work changes. <em>See Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that prisoner\u2019s placement in administrative segregation, due to allegedly false information in his file indicating that he was a member of a prison gang, did not constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest); <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1247 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201c[A] prisoner has no constitutional right to a specific work assignment.\u201d). The district court did not err in dismissing Walker\u2019s claims as frivolous. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327-328, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (\u201cExamples of [frivolous claims] are ... claims of infringement of a legal interest which clearly does not exist, like [respondent\u2019s] claim that his transfer within the reformatory violated his rights under the Due Process clause.\u201d). Walker has abandoned any retaliation claim by failing to adequately brief this argument on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[Appellant\u2019s] abrupt assertion [in his brief] does not remotely suggest grounds for reversal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Walker next argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims with prejudice and without considering his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report or conducting an evidentiary hearing. The district court\u2019s order of dismissal reflects that the court did consider Walker\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report in dismissing Walker\u2019s complaint. Walker has shown no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint with prejudice. <em>See Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1506 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc) (construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and stating that, in an <em>in forma pauperis </em>proceeding, dismissals are treated as being with prejudice unless the district court specifies otherwise). Walker has also shown no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint without first conducting a <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), hearing. If a deficient complaint <em>in forma pauperis </em>might be remedied through greater factual development, a district court should hold an evidentiary hearing to allow the defendant to state his best case. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 474 (5th Cir.2001). Walker\u2019s allegations were deficient, however, not because he had not had an adequate opportunity to develop the facts of his case, but because the facts he alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996) (\u201c[A]ffirmance of a district court dismissal as frivolous counts as a single \u2018strike.\u2019 \u201d). Walker is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he mil no longer be allowed to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
