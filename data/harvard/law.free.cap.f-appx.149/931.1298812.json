On appeal, Gibson argues that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence, based on a finding that he was an armed career criminal, violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because his prior convictions were not alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or established beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">Because Gibson preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim in the district court, our review is <em>de novo, </em>but we will reverse and remand only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Preserved constitutional and statutory errors under <em>Booker </em>are reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-93 (11th Cir. 2005). Constitutional error is \u201charmless\u201d when the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. We review statutory error under a less demanding test: whether a review of the proceedings, as a whole, shows that the error either did not affect the sentence or had only a slight effect. <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92. \u201cIf one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>stantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (internal marks omitted). The government has the burden of proof under both standards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The facts relevant to Gibson\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim are these. After pleading guilty, Gibson proceeded to sentencing. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 24 for Count 1, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), and a base offense level of 6 for Count 2, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D2.1. The PSI determined that the offenses could not be grouped under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 and stated Gibson\u2019s combined adjusted offense level was 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The PSI then determined that Gibson was an armed career criminal because he was subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). Gibson had prior convictions for burglary, carrying a concealed firearm, possession of heroin with intent to sell, and battery on a law enforcement officer. The PSI enhanced Gibson\u2019s offense level to 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), Gibson\u2019s adjusted offense level was 30. With a criminal history category VI, his Guidelines sentencing range was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Finally, the PSI stated that Count 1 carried a statutory minimum 15-year term of imprisonment, while the statutory term of imprisonment for Count 2 was zero to one year. Based on the statutory minimum sentence for Count 1, the PSI adjusted the Guideline range to 180 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">Over Gibson\u2019s objections, including an objection based on <em>Blakely, </em>the district court imposed a 180-month term of imprisonment on Count 1 and a 12-month term of imprisonment on Count 2, to run concurrently, and five years\u2019 supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">The Supreme Court has held that the government need not allege in the indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on those convictions. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Booker, </em>the Court reiterated its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. See </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that after <em>Booker, \u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that [it] is not binding precedent.\u201d). Based on this binding precedent, we reject Gibson\u2019s argument that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when his sentence was enhanced based on his recidivism and find no <em>Booker </em>constitutional error here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">While the district court committed no constitutional error, <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional, or statutory, error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>to advisory. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the district court sentenced Gibson under a mandatory Guidelines scheme but imposed sentence in accordance with a <em>statutorily </em>mandated minimum term. We have concluded that <em>Booker </em>\u201cdoes not undermine the validity of minimum mandatory sentences, at least not where the enhanced minimum does not exceed the non-enhanced maximum.\u201d <em>Spero v. United States, </em>375 F.3d 1285,1286 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1099, 160 L.Ed.2d 1084 (2005), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1345, 161 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">In the instant case, the statutory minimum for Gibson\u2019s \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense, <em>without reference to his recidivism, </em>was 180 month\u2019s imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Accordingly, although the district court stated that it was applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion, any <em>Booker </em>error did not affect Gibson\u2019s sentence because a 180-month sentence was mandated by statute. <em>Cf. United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.) (finding harmless <em>Booker </em>error where district court sentenced defendant in accordance with mandatory minimum sentence statute), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>No. 05-5281 (Jul. 5, 2005). After <em>Booker, </em>district courts remain bound by statutory minimum sentences. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10. Thus, we readily conclude that any <em>Booker </em>statutory error in this case was harmless because the court could not have imposed a lesser sentence due to the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">.
