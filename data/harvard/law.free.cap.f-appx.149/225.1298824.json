In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Nguyen asserts there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lack merit, counsel asserts that Nguyen received ineffective assistance of counsel. Nguyen also filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that his sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Nguyen\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is ordinarily not cognizable on direct review unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is conclusively established on the record. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998). We find the evidence does not support such a finding. We further find that Nguyen was advised of the nature of the charge against him, the potential punishment, and the rights he was waiving by entering a plea of guilty, and he knowingly and intelligently waived those rights and pled guilty. Thus, Nguyen\u2019s appellate waiver forecloses any argument that his sentence, issued under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>mandatory guidelines system, was unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Nguyen\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny both Nguyen\u2019s motion to have counsel relieved and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> Nguyen\u2019s plea agreement contained an appellate waiver in which he,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">waive[d] all rights conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to appeal whatever sentence is imposed, including any issues that relate to the establishment of the guideline range, reserving only the right to appeal from an upward or downward departure from the guideline range established at sentencing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
