We affirm his conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">Plasimond contends that the district court improperly sentenced him when it imposed a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts he admitted to in his guilty plea. Because he failed to raise this claim below, we review it for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Plasimond pled guilty to possession of an unspecified amount of cocaine. At sentencing, the district court held Plasimond accountable for three kilograms of cocaine base for a base offense level of thirty-eight under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2004). The district court subtracted three offense levels for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a). With a total offense level of thirty-five and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a guideline range of 168-210 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court sentenced Plasimond to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">The district court\u2019s drug quantity factual findings provided the basis for a sentence that exceeded the sentence that could have been imposed based only on the facts Plasimond admitted to in his guilty plea. The district court erred in basing the sentence on judge-found facts under a mandatory guidelines regime, and the error was plain.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>48. Because Plasimond\u2019s sentence was longer than what could have been imposed based on the guilty plea alone, the error affected his substantial rights, <em>id. </em>at 548, and we will notice the error, <em>id. </em>at 555. Therefore, Plasimond must be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We affirm Plasimond\u2019s conviction. In light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>we vacate Plasimond\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Plasimond\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
