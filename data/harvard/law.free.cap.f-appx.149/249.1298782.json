The Diazes filed their petition for review within 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order denying their motion to reconsider. The Diazes did not, however, file a petition for review within 30 days after the BIA originally dismissed their appeal. As the requirement of a timely filed petition for review is jurisdictional, we have no jurisdiction to review that earlier decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1) (2000); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Rather than address the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration of its earlier affirmance of the Id\u2019s ruling, the Diazes assert that the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations were clearly erroneous and that the evidence clearly showed a well-founded fear of future persecution based on membership in a social group. Their failure to brief or argue this alleged error constitutes waiver. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993)(\u201cgrounds for reversal not set forth in a petitioner\u2019s (or appellant\u2019s) opening brief in this Court are normally waived\u201d). As the Diazes\u2019 motion for reconsideration failed to identify any change in the law, misapplication of the law, or aspect of the case that the BIA overlooked, they cannot prevail. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Even if the Diazes\u2019 motion is interpreted as arguing that the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration was legally or factually erroneous, however, they have not shown an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1141-42 (5th Cir.1984). The decisions of the BIA and the IJ rested on credibility determinations, and the Diazes have failed to show that the record compels a conclusion that the credibility determinations at issue must be overturned. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The Diazes\u2019 petition for review is therefore DENIED, as is their motion for stay of deportation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
