We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>104 Fed.Appx. 151 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the judgment and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) <em>(\u201cBooker\u201d). Martin v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1040, 160 L.Ed.2d 1028 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-29\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b858-30\">The facts of Martin\u2019s crime are described in <em>Martin, </em>104 Fed.Appx. 151:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-31\">On September 6, 2001, law enforcement officers Kelvin Mitchell (\u201cMitchell\u201d) and Jason Powell (\u201cPowell\u201d), assigned to the Second Judicial Circuit Drug Task <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Force, were looking for Martin. The officers saw Martin\u2019s Cadillac parked at an apartment complex where Richard Watson lived. When the officers approach Martin, he was standing near his car and hollowing out a cigar; there was a small bag of marijuana and a razor blade on the truck of his car. Watson and Martin had previously arranged to meet at Watson\u2019s residence and were preparing a marijuana blunt to smoke when the officers arrived. Mitchell asked Martin whether the marijuana belonged to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">Martin responded in the affirmative. Mitchell placed Martin in handcuffs, patted him down for weapons and put him in the patrol car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">After placing the marijuana and razor blade in evidence bags, Mitchell returned to Martin\u2019s car. A small-caliber piston wedged between the driver\u2019s seat and the console was in plain view through the open driver\u2019s window. Mitchell photographed the gun, removed it from the car and unloaded it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Martin was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The pre-sentence investigation report calculated the base offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) at 20, but added four points for use or possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2k2.1(b)(5) because Martin was in possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The total offense level of 24, together with Martin\u2019s criminal history of Level IV, yielded a U.S.S.G. sentencing range of 77 to 96 months. Had Martin not received the four-point enhancement, the U.S.S.G. sentencing range would have been 51 to 63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">At the sentencing hearing, Martin objected to the four-point enhancement and argued that considering possession of marijuana as a felony for sentencing purposes was unduly harsh. The court agreed with counsel for Martin that the four-point enhancement was harsh:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">COURT: I have studied this matter carefully, because I have to agree with you, Mr. Butler, that it seems to be a harsh result of the possession of an amount that would, without prior conviction, be a misdemeanor, and a possession of an amount for personal use for which the defendant was never charged as [sic] a substantial amount to his sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Sentencing Hearing Transcript at 6. Nonetheless, the court told Martin it was constrained by law to apply the enhancement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql9\">COURT: I\u2019ve looked to see if there was any law to the contrary, as you have. I\u2019ve come up with the same results that you came up with, and that\u2019s that this is what the law requires. I\u2019m going to make factual findings and conclusions of law on this. And I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 yes, you have the right to appeal in this case. And it may be something that the circuit will consider. It\u2019s not something that I can consider at the trial level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-13\"><em>Id. </em>The district court made a factual finding that Martin possessed the firearm in connection with possession of marijuana under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2k2.1(b)(5), and overruled Martin\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-14\">COURT: So based on those findings, it is my finding that the law requires me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>and that I have no discretion to do anything other than to give the four-point enhancement on this. So I overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The court sentenced Martin to imprisonment for 85 months, slightly below the midpoint of the recommended range of 77 to 96 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court justified the sentence based on Martin\u2019s criminal history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">COURT: Under all the circumstances of this case, I\u2019m not going to sentence as high as was recommended, but I cannot ignore the fact that this defendant has a criminal history category of IV. I can\u2019t, in good conscience, sentence the defendant at the low end of the guidelines with this type of criminal history. However, within the discretion that I have to sentence within the guideline range, I feel that an appropriate sentence for this defendant, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances, would be 85 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On appeal, Martin argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court erred by increasing his offense level four points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2k2.1(b)(5) because he was only actually charged with a misdemeanor for marijuana possession, and there was insufficient evidence he possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d marijuana. This court, affirming the sentence, held that Martin possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d marijuana possession, and Martin\u2019s possession of marijuana was a felony for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Martin petitioned for a rehearing on whether the panel\u2019s affirmation of the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was inconsistent with the requirement that the firearm be possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense. The petition having been denied, Martin then petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. Martin again raised his claim regarding the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), but also argued for the first time that his sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact increasing the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt). The Court granted Martin\u2019s writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. See Martin v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1040, 160 L.Ed.2d 1028 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">We directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on when Martin first raised the <em>Booker </em>issue, whether it was timely raised, and how it applies to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">In <em>United States v. Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d 1251, 1253 (11th Cir.2005) this court held that failure to raise a claim under <em>Booker </em>in the initial brief on direct appeal precludes its consideration. In <em>Pipkins, </em>the defendants first challenged the constitutionality of their sentences in petitions for rehearing <em>en banc. Id. </em>at 1252. We denied the petitions for rehearing; the defendants petitioned the Supreme Court; and the Court vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1252. We upheld this court\u2019s long-standing rule not to consider an issue argued for the first time in a petition for rehearing because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order required treating the <em>Booker </em>issue as timely raised. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Accordingly, we reinstated the defendants\u2019 sentences. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Martin contends he raised a claim under <em>Blakely </em>at his sentencing hearing and again on direct appeal. But at his sentencing hearing and on direct appeal, Martin\u2019s arguments regarding sentencing enhancement were based solely on the sufficiency of the evidence and proper construction of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language, not the power of the District Court to decide facts determining the length of the sentence. Martin did not raise any claim under <em>Booker </em>or <em>Blakely </em>until his writ of certiorari petition to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Because Martin did not raise a claim under <em>Booker </em>or <em>Blakely </em>in his initial brief on direct appeal to this court, we decline to consider that claim; our opinion affirming Martin\u2019s conviction and sentence is REINSTATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">. Simple possession of a small quantity marijuana is not ordinarily a felony, but Martin had a prior conviction for possession of marijuana, so the instant possession was punishable by more than one year in prison under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Martin was not charged with a felony for the marijuana possession; he was charged in state court with a misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">. The exact midpoint of the recommended sentencing range is 86.5 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
