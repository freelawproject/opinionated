He appeals, claiming that the district court erred in applying the federal sentencing guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">The indictment alleged that Hernandez-Hernandez had been convicted in March 2001 in Texas state court of aggravated sexual assault of a child. At sentencing, the district court increased Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s base offense level by sixteen levels because the Texas conviction constituted a crime of violence within the meaning of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (2002). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s total offense level was determined to be thirteen. With a criminal history category of II, the resulting guidelines range was forty-one to fifty-one months imprisonment; the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the range. The court also announced an alternative sentence of four years, pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the district court erred by treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory in determining his sentence. Hernandez-Hernandez does not challenge any enhancements to his sentence. Under <em>Booker, </em>in reviewing sentences that do not involve a Sixth Amendment violation, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>court applies the harmless error doctrine in determining whether resentencing is required. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769. The harmless error standard permits an error at sentencing to be disregarded if the reviewing court is certain that any such error \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Here, because the district court imposed an alternate discretionary sentence that was actually higher than the guideline sentence, the error inherent in the application of the guidelines as mandatory did not affect the court\u2019s ultimate determination of Hernandez-Hernandez\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
