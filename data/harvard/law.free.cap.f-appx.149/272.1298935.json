We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that Jackson\u2019s sworn testimony at a hearing before a magistrate judge establishes that there are disputed material facts concerning Jackson\u2019s claims that Sergeants Smith, Sergeant Collins, and Officer Weatherly subjected Jackson to excessive force. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Eason v. Holt, </em>73 F.3d 600, 602-03 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment as to those defendants. Because the district court dismissed Jackson\u2019s claims that Warden Cooper and Assistant Warden Rodeen failed to protect Jackson based on the court\u2019s determination that Jackson was a not victim of excessive force, we vacate the dismissal of Jackson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">Jackson\u2019s claims concerning the procedures used at a prison disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>hearing are barred under the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because they implicate the validity of his disciplinary conviction. We therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment with regard to Jackson\u2019s claims that prison disciplinary proceeding violated principles of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
