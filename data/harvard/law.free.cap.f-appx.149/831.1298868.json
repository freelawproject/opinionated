Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., </em>04-12137, in which we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law for Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. in Henry Lee Pickett\u2019s class action lawsuit brought under the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-26\">In this opinion, we address Pickett\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order assessing costs against him. After the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>court granted Tyson\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, Tyson filed its bill of costs pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). Pickett lodged both general objections to any costs being awarded to Tyson, and specific objections to individual items that Tyson claimed as reimbursable expenses. The district court overruled the general objections, sustained some of Pickett\u2019s specific item objections, overruled others, and ordered Pickett to pay $70,198.60 worth of costs to Tyson.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Pickett is not pursuing on appeal any of the specific objections he had to individual items in Tyson\u2019s bill of costs. Instead, he argues that Tyson, despite securing judgment as a matter of law in its favor, is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to costs under Rule 54(d)(1), and that, even if it is, the district court abused its discretion in not rejecting Tyson\u2019s request for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\u201c We review the factual findings underlying a district court\u2019s determination regarding prevailing party status for clear error. Whether the facts as found suffice to render the plaintiff a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 is a legal question reviewed <em>de novo. \u2019 \u201d Lipscher v. LRP Publ\u2019ns, Inc., </em>266 F.3d 1305, 1321 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Constr. Co., </em>254 F.3d 987, 1012 (11th Cir.2001)). We review a district court\u2019s decision about whether to award costs to the prevailing party for abuse of discretion. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012,1039 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Rule 54(d)(1) provides that \u201c[e]xcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs other than attorneys\u2019 fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs. . . .\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). The parties agree that, other than Rule 54(d)(1), no other statute or rules apply to the costs in this case. Where their positions diverge is on the question of who is the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">A defendant is a prevailing party if the plaintiff achieves none of the benefits sought in bringing its lawsuit. \u201cIf the case is litigated to judgment on the merits in favor of the defendant, the defendant is the prevailing party.\u201d 10 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 54.171[3][c][iv], at 54-285 (citing <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 419-20, 98 S.Ct. 694, 699-700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Pickett sought damages from and injunctive relief against Tyson for practices he claimed were in violation of the Packers and Stockyard Act. He did not obtain any of the relief he sought. While the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatory questions on the special verdict form were in Pickett\u2019s favor, the district court did not enter judgment on that verdict, and we have affirmed its decision not to do so. Because Pickett lost every aspect of the case and Tyson prevailed on it, Tyson is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of Rule 54(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Pickett contends that even so, the district court abused its discretion under Rule 54(d)(1) by failing to reject Tyson\u2019s request for costs. He relies primarily on White <em>&amp; White, Inc. v. Am. Hosp. Supply Corp., </em>786 F.2d 728, 731-32 (6th Cir.1986), arguing that where the case is a \u201cclose and difficult\u201d one, the non-prevailing party litigated the case in good faith, and it has significantly less financial resources then the prevailing party, a district court should not award costs under Rule 54(d). Pickett is wrong for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">First, good faith and limited financial resources are not enough to overcome the strong presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing party. The Sixth Circuit in <em>White &amp; White </em>itself stated that \u201c[g]ood faith without more ... is an insufficient basis for denying costs to a prevail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731. Our own en banc decision in <em>Chapman v. AI Transportation </em>held that a district court should not consider the relative wealth of the parties in deciding whether to reject prevailing-party costs. 229 F.3d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Second, this case was not a close and difficult one. As our opinion in the appeal on the merits explains, witnesses for both parties agreed that Tyson had a number of competitive justifications for its allegedly unfair practices. The legal issues were not particularly novel or difficult. Although it took a long time to try, the case was not especially complicated. In that respect, it differs from the complicated antitrust lawsuit involved in <em>White &amp; White. See id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">As we explained in <em>Chapman, </em>a district court needs a \u201csound basis\u201d to overcome the strong presumption that a prevailing party is entitled to costs. There was none in this case. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs to Tyson under Rule 54(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
