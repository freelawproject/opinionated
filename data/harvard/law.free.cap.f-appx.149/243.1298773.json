Against her Union, Williams first asserted a claim under \u00a7 301(a) of the LMRA. The district court granted the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Williams\u2019s claim under the LMRA was time barred by the applicable statute of limitations of six months. The court correctly cited <em>Barrett v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that the statutory period begins to run \u201cwhen the plaintiff either knew or should have known of the injury itself, i.e., the breach of duty of fair representation, rather than of its manifestations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Williams testified unequivocally that she filed her EEOC charge on April 11, 2003, because she had realized the previous month that her union grievance \u201cwasn\u2019t going any further,\u201d and that she \u201cfelt the Union wasn\u2019t prepared to do any more with the grievance.\u201d This determination by Williams was grounded in the fact that the training class that sits at that vortex of this controversy had been made available to Williams and was taken by her on April 8, 2003. Despite the vigorous argument of counsel for Williams, the district court found \u2014 and we agree \u2014 that Williams\u2019s testimony constitutes her concession that she knew or should have known no later than April 11, 2003, that the Union was not going to pursue her grievance. Taking that as the outside date, the statute of limitations on this claim ran no later than October 11, 2003. The fact that Williams was contacted by a Union representative approximately a year later and that her grievance was formally rejected by vote of the Union\u2019s members after that does not change the fact to which she testified regarding her knowledge. As such post-hoc facts cannot, as the district court observed, breathe life back into her prescribed claim, it was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">The district court also correctly dismissed Williams\u2019s complaint under the LMRDA because, as a matter of law, she could not assert a claim under that statute. Properly relying on <em>Breininger v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Assn. Local Union No. 6,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the district court noted the limited scope of the LMRDA\u2019s prohibition of fining, suspending, expelling, or otherwise disciplining union members for exercising their rights secured by the Act. The court relied on one of its recent opinions grounded in Breininger<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to reject Williams\u2019s claim as not implicating \u201cdiscipline\u201d within the meaning of the LMRDA. Given the vote of the Union membership against censure or any other punishment of Williams, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>was not fined, suspended, expelled, or \u201cotherwise disciplined.\u201d In this reasoning, the district court was also correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">For the foregoing reasons, as more fully-set forth in the aforesaid Order and Reasons of the district court, its grant of summary judgment dismissing with prejudice Williams\u2019s claims against the Union for breach of its duty of fair representation under the LMRA, the NLRA, and the LMRDA is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
