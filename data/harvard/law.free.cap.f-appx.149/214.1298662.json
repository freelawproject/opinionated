Hutchinson argues on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him to 180 months imprisonment as an armed career criminal,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), because he did not have the requisite number of prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d In so asserting, he argues that his convictions for common law robbery and breaking and entering under North Carolina law were not violent felonies under \u00a7 924(e)(2), and that his convictions for two counts each of robbery with a dangerous weapon and kidnaping should be treated as only one predicate offense. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2); <em>see United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-22\">Hutchinson first argues that his conviction of common law robbery was not a violent felony. In determining whether a conviction is for a violent felony, the courts look to the offense of conviction and the statutory definition and not the underlying conduct. <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>158 F.3d 199, 201-02 (4th Cir.1998). North Carolina defines common law robbery as the felonious nonconsensual taking of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>sonal property or money from the person or presence of another by means of force or placing in fear. <em>North Carolina v. Delk, </em>604 S.E.2d 868 (N.C.App.2004). Hutchinson argues that, because the elements of the crime did not involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <em>physical </em>force, as required under \u00a7 924(e)(2), this prior felony offense was not a predicate violent felony conviction under the armed career criminal provision. We have found that Virginia\u2019s nearly-identical definition of \u201crobbery\u201d qualifies as a violent felony. <em>United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64, 69 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that conviction under the Virginia robbery statute constituted a violent felony conviction under \u00a7 924(e)(2), even though definition did not include \u201cphysical\u201d as a qualifier to force or violence); <em>see North Carolina v. Herring, </em>322 N.C. 733, 370 S.E.2d 363, 368 (1988) (\u201c[C]ommon law robbery plainly, \u2018has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u2019\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1082 (4th Cir.1992) (noting that parties stipulated that North Carolina conviction for common law robbery was a violent offense under \u00a7 924(e)). Accordingly, we agree that Hutchinson\u2019s common law robbery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Hutchinson also argues that the district court erred in finding that his North Carolina conviction for breaking and entering qualified as generic burglary under \u00a7 924(e)(2), because it allows for a conviction for breaking <em>or </em>entering a building. We addressed this issue in <em>Bowden </em>and concluded that the argument was unavailing. <em>Bowden, </em>975 F.2d at 1084-85; <em>see Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Hutchinson\u2019s final argument is that his convictions for two counts of kidnaping and two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon should , count as only one, rather than two or more violent felony convictions, because the offense conduct resulting in the four convictions occurred on the same occasion. We need not resolve this issue because, even assuming Hutchinson is correct, he has the requisite three qualifying prior convictions for armed career criminal status: (1) common law robbery, (2) breaking and entering, and (3) kidnaping and robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Because Hutchinson had \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another,\u201d he was properly found to be an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Accordingly, we affirm Hutchinson\u2019s 180-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\"> A fifteen-year minimum sentence applies to armed career criminals. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A person is an armed career criminal if he had three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense or both, committed on occasions different from one another. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
