We conclude Saunders\u2019 notice of appeal is untimely. A notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the judgment being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1). The district court, upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, may extend the time period for filing a notice of appeal an additional thirty days. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Deft of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-23\">The district court denied Saunders\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition by order entered on July 7, 2004. His subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied by order entered on September 30, 2004. He did not file a notice of appeal until February 2005, over four months later, and never sought an extension of time in the district court. Thus, Saunders\u2019 notice of appeal is clearly untimely. Accordingly, we deny Saunders\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
