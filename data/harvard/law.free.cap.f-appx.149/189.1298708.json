We affirm his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Walker challenges his convictions on several grounds and challenges his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He argues: (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence; (2) insufficiency of the evidence regarding the possession with intent to distribute marijuana count; (3) insufficiency of the evidence regarding the \u00a7 924(c) count; (4) the district court erred in giving a flight instruction to the jury when there was no evidence of Walker\u2019s flight; (5) the district court improperly gave examples in a jury instruction of how a firearm may be used in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c) when some examples were not supported by the evidence; (6) Congress lacked the constitutional authority to enact the felon in possession statute, \u00a7 922(g), under the Commerce Clause; and (7) his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely </em>because it was enhanced based on judicial findings of pri- or convictions and because the guidelines are unconstitutional. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), issued, Walker filed two letters under Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) asserting his sentence was in violation of <em>Booker </em>and later asserting his enhancements for prior convictions were in violation of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and <em>United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834 (4th Cir.2005). The Government rejects Walker\u2019s challenges to his convictions and sentence. Regarding Walker\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>arguments, the Government argues the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Walker because the only judicial enhancements were based upon prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">We reject Walker\u2019s challenges to his convictions. First, in looking at the totality of the circumstances, <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-32, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), we find the arresting officers had probable cause to believe Walker had just committed a crime. <em>Cf. United States v. Al-Talib, </em>55 F.3d 923, 931 (4th Cir.1995) (ruling that police surveillance will support a finding of probable cause where officers observe conduct that is consistent with a drug transaction). Therefore, the evidence seized in a search of Walker incident to his arrest and Walker\u2019s spontaneous, voluntary statement regarding a firearm he possessed were admissible under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Next, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find substantial evidence supported the jury verdicts both on the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and on the possession of firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime counts. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (stating standard of review). With regard to the intent to distribute element of a \u00a7 841(a) violation, we note evidence revealed officers witnessed Walker engaging in acts consistent with a street-level drug transaction immediately prior to Walker\u2019s arrest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Regarding the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, we find there was significant evidence, substantially more than mere presence of the firearm at the scene, to support the jury\u2019s verdict that Walker possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Further, we find that the district court properly gave a flight instruction to the jury because there was evidence of Walker\u2019s attempt to elude police once he believed police were present. <em>Cf United States v. Obi </em>239 F.3d 662, 665 (4th Cir. 2001) (recognizing that consciousness of guilt may be inferred from evidence of flight).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We further find the district court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the \u00a7 924(c) count, which in part listed examples of how a firearm might be used in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, was proper. <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We also reject Walker\u2019s challenge to his felon in possession conviction on the ground that Congress lacked the authority to enact the statute under the Commerce Clause. It is well-established that the statute, which expressly requires an interstate commerce nexus, is a valid congressional enactment under the Commerce Clause. <em>United States v. Quarles, </em>330 F.3d 650, 651 n. 2 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 977, 124 S.Ct. 459, 157 L.Ed.2d 331 (2003); <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nathan, </em>202 F.3d 230, 234 (4th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Finally, we review Walker\u2019s challenges to his sentence. Because the issues under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are raised for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). We find no Sixth Amendment error in Walker\u2019s sentencing. Walker\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the career offender guidelines, USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, based solely upon his prior convictions. In both <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the fact of a prior conviction need not be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at \u2014, 124 S.Ct. at 2536. Walker does not dispute the fact of his prior convictions. We conclude the predicates for designating Walker as a career offender were satisfied because he has two prior convictions that on their face qualify as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 (defining predicate offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Next, we turn to whether the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines constituted plain error. We find Walker has not established that the error in treating the guidelines as mandatory affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215-25 (4th Cir.2005). For these reasons, we affirm Walker\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
