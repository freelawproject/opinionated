He made a statement in writing of the moneys so received, and of the sums expended by him, showing a balance in his hands due the club, and this balance, after first refusing, he subsequently promised, to pay. In an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>common counts brought by the club to recover this balance, he made defence upon the grounds that the money, was the result of work done or sales made, on Sunday in violation of the Sunday law ; that such work or business was illegal and <em>ultra vires; </em>that the charter of the plaintiff was fraudulently obtained, and that the election of its officers was illegal.

That the defendant, being a member of the club, and having participated in the violations of law and the infringements of the charter relied on by him as a defence, neither the alleged fraud of the plaintiff in obtaining its charter, the illegal election of its officers, nor the alleged violations of its charter by the plaintiff constituted a valid defence under the circumstances of the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b470-7\">3rd. That, even if the original transaction or contract by which the defendant obtained the money in question were in violation of the Sunday law and the charter of the plaintiff, yet the promise made by the defendant on a week day to pay said money to the plaintiff, in connection with the other evidence in the cause, was sufficient to support the action, and entitle the plaintiff to recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b470-8\">Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-10\"><em>JException.-^At </em>the trial the plaintiff offered the four following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-11\">1. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant had money in his hands belonging to the plaintiff, and on Thursday, the 30th of October, 1891, rendered the account offered in evidence to the plaintiff, whereby it appears that the sum of $161.44 in his hands was money belonging to the plaintiff, and the defendant then and there, and on other days (not being Sun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>days) promised to pay and deliver said amount of money to the plaintiff, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the said sum of $161.44, and interest thereon in the discretion of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">2.

If the jury believe from the evidence in the cause that, the defendant was the alleged treasurer of the plaintiff and as such received an amount of money of not less than $200, money belonging to the plaintiff from a certain Hoffmeister, his alleged predecessor in office, and the sum of $91.30, proceeds from a ball held by the plaintiff on a week day, and the initiation fees of $2 from each member, and the annual dues of $1 from each member, collected on week days, and has failed to deliver said money to- the plaintiff after he ceased to hold said alleged office as treasurer, when duly requested to do so, and has failed to account for the same to the plaintiff, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant such sum of money as the jury may find to be still in the possession of the defendant of said moneys so received by him and not expended for the use or by the authority of the plaintiff, and the jury in their discretion may allow interest on said amount of money, if they find any so to be in the hands of the defendant, from the 22nd day of January, 1891, the day when the request in writing, offered in evidence, was served on the defendant, if they believe such request was actually served on the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">The defendant offered the ten following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\">1. That if the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff filed a certificate of incorporation in the record office of the Superior Court of Baltimore City, by which they asked for authority to organize as a <em>\u201c </em>Social and Literary Club \u201d in the City of Baltimore, and in the said certificate, the said Social and Literary Club limited their place of business to Baltimore City, then they could not transact the business of the club in any other place than Baltimore City, and such business as was transacted at any other place was illegal and void. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>if the jury find that an election of the officers of the club was held in Baltimore County on the banks of the Middle river, on a Sunday, to wit: the first Sunday of November, A. D. 1890, and also on the first Sunday of November, A. D. 1891, that the said elections were void, as in violation of the charter of the club.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">2. That the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant because there is no legally sufficient evidence that any money he has in hand, if the jury find that he has money, came into his hands from the revenue of a social and literary club, and that the drinking of lager beer, and the rolling of ten-pins for pay, is not what is meant by \u201csocial and literary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">3. If the jury find that the \u201cKnights of Liberty of Baltimore City \u201d intended, when they obtained the certificate o\u00ed incorporation exhibited in evidence in this case, to set up and conduct a place or places for drinking, dancing and rolling ten-pins, and especially for the purpose of such indulgences and games on a Sunday, then the said certificate was fraudulently obtained, and affords no protection for doing, nor confers any right to do, the enumerated acts, and it is unavailing as a foundation for an action in this case, and the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">4. That \u201cSocial and Literary\u201d in the certificate of incorporation offered in evidence, means associating together for literary purposes, and any other thing is not within the powers conferred by the said certificate, and if the jury find that the money claimed by the plaintiff was not the result of a social and literary club within the meaning above set forth, then the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">5. If the jury find from the evidence that the defendant received money which is claimed by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had no right or power to take the said money under and by virtue of any rights conferred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>it by the certificate of incorporation offered in evidence,, and that the defendant did not at any time promise to pay the said money to the plaintiff, even though the jury find that it was incorporated as a social and literary club within the City of Baltimore, then their verdict-must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">6. If the jury find from the evidence that <em>\u201c </em>the Knights-of Liberty of Baltimore City\u201d is a body corporate, as a social and literary club, and that it leased from James-Gilmore the grounds known as Indian Grove, to give entertainments to members of the club, and such others-as might attend, which entertainments consisted of selling lager beer, selling cigars and rolling ten-pins, and that these entertainments were given on Sundays; that the lager beer was paid for by the parties \u2014 members of the club and others \u2014 who visited the grounds, by money collected at the entrance to the grounds, which was termed an admission fee, but which was meant to be and was in fact, payment for the beer that the party paying the fee was entitled to demand, because he paid the admission fee; and that the beer, cigars and ten-pin alley were* sold and kept for the purpose of making profit, and that the money in question in this case was collected from these sources; and that such doings and actings were in violation of the laws of the land, then the said club cannot recover in this case, even though the jury find that the defendant promised to pay the money\u2014 $167 \u2014 to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">7. That money collected from visitors to the grounds leased from J. Gilmore for tickets of admission to the grounds, and which entitled the holder to demand lager beer at the bar, for cigars sold at the ten-pin alley, and for the privilege of rolling ten-pins on Sunday, was not collected in pursuance of the charter-rights of the plaintiff, if the jury under the instruction of the Court find that it is a body corporate, and that the money so col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>lectod is not due to said body corporate as such; and their verdict must he for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">8. If the jury find that the operations and transactions of the plaintiff (if they find that it has legal existence in Baltimore County) were carried on and transacted on Sunday, then they were done and carried on in violation of law, and cannot form the grounds of a suit at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">9. If the jury find under the instructions of the Court that the plaintiff has legal existence as a social and literary club in Baltimore City, then the defendant asks an instruction that elections held in Baltimore County, where the annual meetings were held were illegal, both on account of the place where they were held and of the day \u2014 Sunday\u2014on which they were held, and the officers claiming to be so elected are not entitled to the office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">10. If the jury find that the plaintiff club, provided they find under the instructions of the Court there is such a club \u2014 consists of sixty members, and that it proceeded at its'annual meeting in 1890 to elect officers for the succeeding year when there was not a majority of all the members present, and that the treasurer, who pretends to have been elected at the said meeting, is the claimant of the money in question from the defendant, is not an officer of the said club, and his election was void, there is no person to whom the defendant could legally pay money on behalf of the said club, even if he admitted that he had money in his hands to which the club had a right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">The Court (Phelps, J.,) granted the prayers of the plaintiff, and rejected those offered by the defendant. The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">The cause was argued for the appellee before Alvey, C.

He is estopped in this action from inquiring into the regularity of their election, and is further estopped from the inquiry whether the Money entrusted to him was illegally collected by transactions not within the charter limits of the appellee. <em>United Germ.

As such treasurer he received from time to time, on Sundays and week days, money belonging to the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">He made a statement in writing of the moneys so received by him, and also of the amount expended by him, showing a balance in his hands due the club of something less than two hundred dollars. He refused, however, to pay this balance, claiming that he was responsib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>le for certain rent due by the association. Subsequently he promised to pay the amount so admitted to be due, but failed to do so, and the appellee sued him <em>in assumpsit </em>on the common counts. A judgment was recovered for the amount claimed to be due, and the question presented arises upon exceptions taken by the defendant to the rejection'of the prayers offered by him, and the granting of those of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The propositions announced in the defendant\u2019s prayers are that, if the money in question was the result of work done or sales made on Sunday, in violation of our Sunday law, or if such work or business was illegal and <em>ultra vires, </em>or if the charter of the appellee was fraudulently obtained, or the' election of its officers was illegal, then under none of these circumstances can the appellant recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The instructions granted at the instance of the plaintiff were to the effect that, if the defendant on any other day than Sunday promised to pay the money in question to the plaintiff, it was immaterial whether the defendant obtained possession of the money on Sunday or other days, or whether it was the result of work done or sales made on Sunday. Assuming that the funds of the club came into the hands of the officer, the appellant, contrary to law, and as the result of business done in violation of the Sunday law and of the charter of the appellee, we do not think the defendant should be allowed to escape liability in this case, upon any such pretexts. What the rights of the State may be in proceedings taken by it to forfeit the charter, or how far the appellee may be proceeded against for the alleged flagrant violations of law, are questions which cannot now be properly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The appellant was a member of the appellee club, and, according to the theory on which his prayers are based, he participated in the violations of law and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>infringements of the charter he now relies on as a justification for refusing to pay it money which he admits was in fact 'the property of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Neither the alleged fraud of the appellee in obtaining its charter, <em>Pattison vs. Albany Build. and Loan Association, </em>63 <em>Ga., </em>313, the illegal election of its officers, <em>Mech. Nat. Bank of Newark vs. Burnet Mfg. Co., </em>32 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>236, nor the alleged violations of its charter by the appellee, Uni<em>ted German Bank, &amp;c. vs. Katz, 57 Md., </em>128, constitute a valid defence for the appellant under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the case last mentioned we held that one who had a note discounted hy the Bank in question in violation of its charter would not he allowed to rely upon the illegality of the act in order to escape the payment of the note. And it was there said such conduct of the corporation \u201cmight he good ground for proceeding to forfeit the charter * * * * hut in a case like this it is not available as a defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The laws which the State has enacted to secure the due and orderly observance of Sunday, must, of course, he enforced, and so construed as to give them full effect, hut not at the expense of all the rules of common honesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In some of the States (see Revised Statutes of Maine, chapter 82, section 16,) it is provided that \u201cno person who receives a valuable consideration for a contract, express or implied, made on the Lord\u2019s day, shall defend any action upon such contract on the ground that it was so made, until he restores such consideration.\u201d The provisions of this statute are in accordance with the views of this Court in <em>United German Bank vs. Katz, supra, </em>namely, that it would he inequitable to allow one who has had the benefit of an illegal contract to plead that illegality, and at the same time to hold on to the benefit he derived therefrom.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AKX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>(Decided 2nd December, 1892.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">It would seem, also, that the instructions given the jury are free from objection. As we have said, they are based upon the proposition that, even if the original transaction or contract by which the appellant obtained the money in question is in violation of the Sunday law and the charter of the appellee, yet that the promise made by the appellant on a week day to pay said money to the appellee, in connection with the other evidence in the cause, is sufficient to support this action, and entitle the appellee to recover. The suit here is not upon a contract made on Sunday, but it is an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on a special promise made by the appellant to the appellee on the 30th of October, 1891, and on other week days, to pay to it \u00e1 sum of money, which, as matter of fact, he admits came into his hands as an officer of the appellee. Under the instructions of the Court below recovery was had upon this special promise, and not upon a contract or promise made on Sunday. In other words, the case of the appellee was complete when it offered in evidence its charter, proof of the account stated by the appellant, showing the balance in his hands, and that he had promised as above mentioned to pay the same. Evidence of the supposed illegal contract or illegal transactions must, therefore, have come, if at all, from the appellant, as matter of defence; but, as we have already said, he will not be allowed to set up any .such defence in this case. He is estopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
