Hooper.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-5\"><em>Affidavit of Defence </em>\u2014 Act <em>of </em>1886, <em>ch. </em>184, <em>sec. </em>170.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-6\">Under the Act of 1886, ch. 184, which provides that in any suit on a contract, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment after fifteen days from the return day, unless the defendant shall make oath that every plea pleaded is true, and shall further state the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, if anything, admitted to be due, and the amount disputed, an affidavit in an action of <em>assumpsit </em>\u201cthat the defendant does not admit any of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to be due and owing,\u201d is not such a denial of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness as the Act requires.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b155-7\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azv\">This action was brought by the appellee to recover from the appellant the sum of $775. The claim was sworn to in the usual form, and setting forth that said amount was due above all discounts. The defendant pleaded the general issue pleas. \u2014 -1. That it never was indebted as alleged. 2. That it did not promise as alleged. To these pleas the president and treasurer of the defendant company made oath in the usual form, with the addition, \u201cand it does not admit any of the plaintiff's claim to be due and owing.\" The plaintiff moved for a judgment by default for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and allowed a credit of $475.00 on the amount claimed. The Court gave judgment by default, and the same was extended for $300. On the next day after the judgment was entered, the defendant moved that it be stricken out, and filed the following reasons in support of its motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">First. Because the said judgment was entered irregularly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Second. Because the defendant had, prior to the entry of said judgment, filed good and sufficient pleas, with an affidavit thereto, as required by law, and certificate of advice of counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">Third. Because this defendant has a good and meritorious defence to the cause of action of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">Fourth. Because the affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant by its president, is a compliance with the requirements of section 167 of Article 4, title \u201cCity of Baltimore,\u201d sub-title \u201cCourts,\u201d of the Public Local Laws, and is, therefore, a bar to the recovery of any judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">The Court overruled the motion, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b156-8\">The cause was argued before Miller, Robinson, Irving, Bryan, Fowler, McSherry and Briscoe, J., for the appellant. The Court declined to hear counsel for theappellee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-9\"><em>William J. O\u2019Brien, Jr., </em>and <em>William J. O\u2019Brien, </em>(with whom was <em>Samuel Snowden, </em>on the brief,) for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-10\"><em>W. George Weld, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b156-11\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-v\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">We did not call upon the appellee, for it seemed very clear to us that the affidavit annexed to the pleas filed in this case was not in compliance with either the letter or the spirit of the Act of 1886, chap. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Now, this Act provides that in suits upon contract the plaintiff, upon malting affidavit as therein required, shall he entitled to judgment \u201cat any time after fifteen days from the return day to which the defendant shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>have been summoned, although he may have pleaded, unless such plea contains a good defence,\u201d and unless the defendant shall make oath \u201cthat every plea so pleaded is true, and shall further state the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, if anything, admitted to be due or owing, and the amount disputed; and further that the affiant verily believes the defendant will be able at the trial of the cause to produce sufficient evidence to support the said plea as to the portion disputed,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The object of this Act was, as we have said in <em>Adler vs. Crook, et al., </em>68 <em>Md., </em>494, to enforce the speedy collection of debts in the City of Baltimore, and to that end it provides that the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment after fifteen days from the return day, unless the defendant shall make oath that every plea so pleaded is true, and shall further state the amount of plaintiff\u2019s demand, if anything, admitted to be due, and the amount disputed. If the defendant in fact owes the entire amount claimed, the Act means that he shall so admit it, or if he owes but part of the claim he must state on oath the portion which is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Now, in this case, the defendant company pleaded \u201cnever indebted as alleged,\u201d and \u201cnever promised as alleged, \u201cand its president and treasurer made oath, that every plea so pleaded is true, and <em>\u201cthat the defendant does not admit any of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to be due and owing. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In saying it does not admit anything to be due, puts the plaintiff, it is true, to the proof of his claim. But this is not what the Act requires. It means that the defendant shall say on oath whether or not he owes the plaintiff anything upon the contract sued upon. If he owes the entire amount claimed he must so admit it, or if he owes but a part, he .must, in the language of the Act, state the amount disputed. And merely saying that it does not admit any of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>due, cannot be fairly considered as a denial on oath by the company, of its indebtedness to the plaintiff. Certainly not such a denial as the Act of 1886 requires.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AQ0\">(Decided 7th June, 1892.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
