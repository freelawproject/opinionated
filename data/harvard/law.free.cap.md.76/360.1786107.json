If the jury find that the plaintiff is possessed of the premises and dwelling house referred to in the evidence, and if they shall further believe that the defendant is in the possession of the adjoining premises, and works and operates a factory thereon, for the purpose of making boxes, in which he uses an engine and boiler run by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>steam,'and that whilst so operating the same, by himself, his agents and employes, loud and disturbing noises are made, and annoying vibrations are made in the premises of plaintiff, and large quantities of steam and foul aud offensive smoke, and dust, soot and cinders were caused thereby to be emitted from his factory and premises, which settled upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, entered his house, causing injury and damage to the same. And if they find that said smoke, steam and cinders, and vibration are of such a character, and in such a quantity as to cause great bodily discomfort to the plaintiff, his family and tenants, and compel the occupants to keep the doors and windows closed at times, and that thereby the value of plaintiff\u2019s property is depreciated, and in consequence thereof he has suffered injury by loss of tenants, if the jury find such, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-4\">3. That if the jury find for the plaintiff, then, in awarding damages, they may consider any loss of rental, and also any discomfort to the plaintiff occasioned thereby up to the time of bringing this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">The defendant offered the six following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">1. That if the jury should find that plaintiff\u2019s property was injured by the manner defendant conducted his\u2019factory, on his premises, they should not award damages to the plaintiff for such injury; unless they find that plaintiff\u2019s property has been materially injured or his comfort and enjoyment in the use of his property has been substantially impaired, and the jury are further instructed, that in determining whether defendant maintains a nuisance on his premises, by the machinery he has placed therein, or by the mode he conducts his business, or by smoke, steam, cinders, dirt, jarring or noise, the jury should take into consideration the locality of plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s premises, mentioned in the evidence, the nature of the business conducted by defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ant on his premises, the character of the machinery, used by him therein and his manner of using such machinery, in connection with the other facts in the case, and the jury are further instructed that if they find that plaintiff dwells in the midst of a commercial ox-manufacturing locality he is not entitled to have the same quiet, and freedom from axxnoyance that he would be entitled to in the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">2. Even if the jury shall find from the evidence that defendant erected oxi his premises Eos. 414 and 416 West Conway street, a stationary steam engine, and used it in connectioxx with his business of making cigar and other light wooden boxes, such erection and use is not in itself a nuisance, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, if the jury believe defendant caused to be constructed and used, in connection with the machinery on his said premises, the best appliances to prevent the escape of smoke, steam, cinders, soot and dust from his said premises, and that said appliances did prevent such escape to the extent of not seriously interfering with the plaintiff in the comfortable enjoyment of his property or substantially damaging the same, and no unreasonable noise or vibrations was caused by defendant\u2019s engine or uxachinery on his said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">3.

That if the jury find from the evidence, that the defendant conducted his factory in the ordinary business way and in a locality where there are other factories, then the wrong complained of must be naturally productive of actual physical discomfort, to persons of ordinary sensibilities and of ordinary taste and habits to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and the injury complained of must be material and direct from conduct of the defendant, without the operation of the other factories and manufacturing establishments, situate in the neighborhood of the dwelling of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">5. If the jury find from the evidence that defendant did not wrongfully cause to issue from the smokestack, on his premises, large quantities of offensive and unwholesome smoke, soot and other matter, which fell upon the ground and penetrated the premises of plaintiff, and that defendant did not, by noise and disturbing vibrations produced on his premises, render the rooms in plaintiff\u2019s dwelling unfit for habitation, and did not cause plaintiff to lose tenants, and the plaintiff was not unable to use the yard on his premises, for laundrying and other purposes, by reason of the causes above mentioned, and the defendant by the use of the steam engine and machinery, on his premises, and the manner he conducted his business, did not otherwise materially or substantially injure plaintiff\u2019s property or seriously interfere with his comfort or enjoyment thereof, then defendant under the pleadings and evidence in this case is entitled to a verdict in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">6. If the jury believe that the tenants in plaintiff\u2019s premises, No. 418 West Conway street, left the same for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>reasons, other than smoke, steam, cinders, soot, dust, noise or vibrations proceeding from defendant\u2019s adjoining premises, then plaintiff' cannot recover damages for any loss of tenants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The Court (Stewart, J.,) granted the plaintiff\u2019s first and third prayers, and refused his second prayer; and granted the defendant\u2019s second, fourth and fifth prayers, and refused his first, third, and sixth prayers. The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

The appellee is the owner and occupier of the premises known as No. 418 W. Conway street, in the City of Baltimore, and the appellant the owner and occupier of the premises Nos. 414 and 416 in the same street. The former dwelt in his premises, and rented out rooms to lodgers \u2014 the latter occupied his premises as a home, and was at the same- time engaged in the manufacture of cigar, and other light wooden boxes, using a steam engine and boiler in connection with his business. The evidence on the part of the appellee, shows that the use of said engine and boiler, produced loud and disturbing noises and annoying vibrations on his premises, and that large quantities of steam, oppressive smoke, dust, soot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and cinders came from appellant\u2019s premises and settled on those of the appellee, and entered his house, injuring the same, and causing tenants to leave his premises, and causing appellee and his family great disturbance and discomfort. The evidence further shows that the smoke and soot from the engine entered the house of appellee, rendering it unfit for comfortable occupation, and also fell in his yard, making it unfit as a place of washing and drying the clothes of the family; and further proved that the said nuisances created by the appellant greatly depreciated the value of the appellee\u2019s premises, and very much reduced their rental value. The evidence submitted on the. part of the appellant was in substantial denial of that which had been offered by the appellee, with the additional proof that he used the best appliances to prevent the escape from his premises of smoke, steam, cinders, and dust. In rebuttal the plaintiff offered evidence showing that the neighborhood was long built up, and was originally one used exclusively for domestic residences, and the factories, save one, are in other squares, and separated at intervals. The appellant, then offered as testimony in the cause, the original papers in the case of <em>Mitchell vs. Lloyd, </em>in the Circuit Court No. 2, of Baltimore City, which contained a mortgage on appellee\u2019s property on W. Conway street, mentioned in the evidence,, including all the papers, and proceedings in said cause, showing a regular foreclosure of said mortgage, and final ratification of the sale of said property to the mortgagee. This offer was objected to and the objection sustained. The action of the Court upon the objection presents the only exception to the admissibility of evidence. We think the Court committed no error in' refusing to admit this testimony; it certainly was not offered in its proper order. If it was relevant and proper to be considered by the jury, the defendant should have tendered the same when he pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>sented his testimony in chief. Not having done so, he had no just cause for complaint that the Court refused to receive it when offered. But the testimony was clearly irrelevant. The fact that the property had been sold to the mortgagee, did not prevent the mortgagor, still in possession, from maintaining his action to recover damages for the injury produced by the smoke, soot, etc., and for loss of tenants, etc. If the appellee had been only a tenant, he could have maintained this action; the nuisance here was not of a permanent character, and could, at any time, have been discontinued. It is not essential that we go again into any elaborate discussion of the law of nuisance, since only recently, in the case of <em>Susquehanna Fertilizer Co. vs. Malone, </em>73 <em>Md., </em>268, the subject has been thoroughly considered, and passed upon by this Court. Also in <em>Dittman and Berger vs. Repp, </em>50 <em>Md., </em>520, and <em>Woodyear vs. Schaefer, </em>57 <em>Md., </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">2nd. The appellant insists that there was error in the Court below granting the appellee\u2019s first prayer, in that it does not properly limit the effect of the words, \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cdamage,\u201d by the use of some such restrictive word as \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d The force of this criticism is lost, when it is ascertained that the second, fourth, and fifth of the appellant\u2019s granted prayers give him the most ample protection respecting the omission from the appellee\u2019s first prayer of the qualifying words alluded to. The appellant\u2019s first prayer was properly rejected. The testimony very clearly shows that the appellant did not dwell in a commercial or manufacturing locality, and, if he had, the law would not permit him to maintain such a nuisance as he seeks to defend in this case. We come now to the consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s third prayer, which in our opinion should not have been granted. The prayer segregates from the mass of testimony one item of damage alone, and then proceeds to prescribe a rule to the jury \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>in awarding damages, they may consider any loss .of <em>rental, </em>and also any discomfort to the plaintiff occasioned <em>thereby </em>up to the time of bringing this suit.\u201d This phraseology was well calculated to mislead the jury, who may very readily have believed from its uncertain terms that it meant to allude only to the question of the discomfort of the appellee, occasioned by his loss of rental, or of the discomfort occasioned by the facts set out in his first prayer. But it is indefinite and uncertain to an extent which can not justify us in giving to it our sanction. After the Court had granted the appellee\u2019s first prayer, there ought to have been no difficulty in framing appropriate instructions to the jury for their guidance in assessing the damages. This could have been done by a separate prayer, or could very properly have formed the conclusion to the first prayer, which contained a statement of the facts, upon which recovery was sought to he had.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aa9\">(Decided 18th November, 1892.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">One of the vices which the appellant criticized in the appellee\u2019s first prayer has been adopted by him in his sixth prayer, which the Court below very properly refused. The appellee\u2019s first prayer instructed the jury that if they found certain facts, then he was entitled to recover. The appellant\u2019s sixth prayer asks the Court to say in substance, that if they do not find those facts then the appellee is not entitled to recover. The prayer was unnecessary, only calculated to mislead and properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
