A discharge by the law of one country will be a discharge in another. 2 Stra. 733. The present suit must be fruitless ; for if after the assignment of a bankrupt\u2019s estate, a creditor knowing it and residing in England, attach the money of the bankrupt abroad, the assignee may recover it in an action for money received to their use. 4 Term Bep. 182. The case of Bailan tine v. Golding, (Cook\u2019s Bankr. Law, 347, 1st edit.) is expressly in point. So is Miller v. Hall. Dallas 229. So was Crafton v. Coulson, lately in France, wherein it was determined that the assignees of a bankrupt should prevail against attachment creditors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Mr. Tilgliman for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABNi\">candidly-admitted that the defendant\u2019s motion should prevail. Though in the case of Greenow v. Amery, determined not long ago, in the District Court of Massachusetts, it was resolved by Judges Iredel and Noel, that a bankruptcy and certificate obtained in Pennsylvania, should not protect a debtor, in a suit for goods bought in the state of Massachusetts, yet they held the law to be clearly otherwise in the ease of British subjects, on a certificate of bankruptcy obtained in England.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-5\">\n<em>Per etvr.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Am8\">Let the exonereturs be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
