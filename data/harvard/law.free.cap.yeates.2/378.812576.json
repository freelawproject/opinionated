Improvements were considered in those times as mere chattels, and sold as such in the course of administration. They were often transferred without any formal written instrument. Lands held by warrant, and even in some instances where they have been surveyed, were then deemed as little more than improvements, the legal title being considered in the proprietaries, until patents were obtained. And warranted lands have been assigned over by mere blank indorsements of the party\u2019s names, and have received the sanction of courts of justice. Such was the custom of the country at that day, and such the ideas of the inhabitants. The opinions of the people have changed, and so has the law, for at this period such a devise would only confer an estate for life. But it was formerly otherwise.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AooW\">Mr. <em>Duncan,pro. d&amp;f.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
