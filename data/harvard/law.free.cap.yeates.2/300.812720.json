Though at common Jaw, no incumbrance whatever, made by the husband after marriage, can effect her claim of dower, not even the debt of the king; yet her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>dower in this state is divested by the land being taking in execution for the payment of the debts of the baron. The lands of deceased persons are made chattels for the payment of debts. Dali. 484. And it has been held, that the dower of the wife is barred by the sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate under a <em>levari </em>facias, on a mortgage executed by the husband alone, after marriage. The present case is not such, as where the baron receives a monied consideration for granting the lands. The mode was fallen on to save expense, and is equivalent to the sale under the judgments, many of which were discharged in consequence of the assignment. There are other instances besides sales by sheriffs, wherein the widow\u2019s dower would be divested; as where an administrator sells by order of the Orphan\u2019s Court for payment of debts and maintenance of children. Dali. 486. And the case before the court is the same in principle with that of an administrator selling.</p>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b309-6\">Mr. C. Smith for the demandant.</attorneys>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b308-9\">Dower. \u2014 Case stated for the opinion of the Judges at Nisi Prius, to be decided by them, by consent.</p><p id=\"b308-12\">On the 27th July 1791, the said Wendel Keller executed an obligation to the persons before named as trustees for his creditors for 600\u00cd. payable six months after date, no part of which has ever been satisfied or paid.</p><p id=\"b308-13\">Judgments to a considerable amount remain unsatisfied on the records of the Court of Common Pleas of York county; and the said Wendell Keller has died intestate, in insolvent circumstances.</p><p id=\"b309-5\">The court said, they saw no difference between the present conveyance and one given for a money consideration, where the vendor with the amount of the sales pays off his judgments and other debts. In this instance, Keller has empowered his assignees to do what he himself might have done in his life-time, and his widow on such sale by him, without her joining, would not have been barred of dower. In the eases put by the tenant\u2019s counsel, the purchasers come in by act of law, claiming under sheriffs or administrators, and there positive institutions exclude her from dower. It is not so here. But as it is pressed, that Mr. Ingersoll should also be heard in behalf of the tenant, the entry of final judgment will be deferred until the meeting of the court in bank.</p><p id=\"b309-7\">Afterwards in March term 1799, Mr. Ingersoll argued for the creditors to the same effect as the former counsel, but the court were unanimously of opinion, that final judgment should be entered for the demandant.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
