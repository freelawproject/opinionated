It appeared by the record returned, that the plaintiff in error liad commenced an action of debt against tlie defendant on an obligation, to which the defendant pleaded payment, with leave to give the special matter in evidence. In September term 1791, tlie Court of Common Pleas made a rule that tlie defendant\u2019s attorney should furnish the plaintiff a particular account with all the items of such matters as he meant to prove, and insist on at the trial on the plea of payment or set-off\u2019; and also that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney should furnish to the defendant a particular account, with all the items of such matters, as he intended to prove and insist upon at the trial over and above tlie sum in tlie bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">Tlie cause came on to be tried by a special jury, at an adjourned court in September term 1794, when tlie jury found a verdict for the defendant, and further certified, that there was due to him from the plaintiff' the sum of <em>61. </em>9s. <em>5A. </em>damages and six pence costs.

The certificate of the jury in favor of the defendant, was grounded on the defalcation act of 4 Ann.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">He admitted that a debt barred by the statute of limitations, cannot be set off; if pleaded, plaintiff may reply the statute; if given in evidence, it may be objected to on the trial.
