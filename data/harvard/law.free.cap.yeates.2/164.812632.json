(2 Dall. St. Laws, 20.) it is provided thereby that no person shall be entered in the poor books of any township, or receive relief\u2019 before he has procured an order from two magistrates or justices of the peace for the same; but from these orders no appeal is given to the sessions. Express words provide for an appeal on orders of removal alone. So it.is in England, where no appeal lies from an order of maintenance.

There is no necessity for a fixed weekly sum to be expressed in the order. The necessities of the pauper and his state of health, may make different sums proper at various times. It often happens, that a distressed object may stand in need of immediate relief, and it becomes the duty of the justices to administer to his aid. The township to whom the order is directed must provide for his necessities; but if it is found that the pauper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>has no legal settlement there, they must get rid of him by an order of removal to his last place of settlement. What is said to be the common practice of appealing from orders of maintenance, is not justified by the law, but is highly erroneous. The order of sessions quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-5\">Yeates, J. as an inhabitant of the borough of Lancaster, gave no opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
