The court moreover declared, that the plaintiff had not entitled himself to the present action. The transaction between Daniel Duncan and him was merely confined to the order of David Duncan. It might have been given, for any thing that appears to the contrary, on a private account between Daniel and David. And the suit would have more properly lain against David Duncan by the plaintiff in his private capacity, if he had settled his accounts as assistant quarter master with the United States. But until such settlement was made by the plaintiff, the money was only suable for, in the. name and for the use of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">The counsel then said, they would tender a bill of exceptions, which was agreed to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">They afterwards agreed, that the suit should proceed for the benefit of the United States ; but the court adhered to their former opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOm\">Messrs.
