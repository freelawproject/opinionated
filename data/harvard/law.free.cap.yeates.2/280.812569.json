The defendants under the (3 Dali. St. Laws, 98,) act of assembly have become absolutely bound for payment of the debt, on the affirmance of the judgment. This cannot be compared to an action of debt brought on (2 Barnes, 93. 1 Bl. Rep. 507. Sayer 43,) a judgment where special bail has been originally entered. Even in account render, a defendant has been held to bail, where he has declared, that he means to leave the state.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
