A Mrs. Fleeson, who was seized of the remaining undivided third part, lived in one of the houses, but expressed no inclination to become a purchaser. The sale was adjourned at the instance of one of the agents of the creditors, from the 26th February until the 5 th March, and again to the 12th March, and was open and fair.</summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"AvPm\">Messrs.

Few persons would choose to purchase an undivided interest in a house, which was incapable of division. A buyer could not reasonably promise himself a title in the entirety, in any given time, and this consideration must necessarily depreciate the sale. If three houses stood together of equal value, the exchange of an undivided third part of-the whole could readily be effected for the benefit of all the parties. And if they were not of the same relative value, still an interchange was facilitated by an entire sale, as a sum of money might be given, or received by way of owelty of partition.</p><p id=\"b558-5\">And of this opinion was a majority of the court, who denied the motion, and confirmed the sale, (Smith, J. dissenting.)</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
