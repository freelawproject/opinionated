S. Laws 244, Oswald\u2019s ed.) duties exceeding 50 dollars on goods imported, shall be secured by bond, with one or more sureties, and in lieu of such surety deposits may be accepted. By \u00a7 45 thereof it is directed, that the United States, in case a bond for duties becomes due, shall <em>be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>first satisfied in all cases of insolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administrators shall be insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">A subsequent act of congress of 2d May 1792, (2 U. S. Laws 85) in the sec. 18, provides, that where the sureties in bonds for duties pay the same, they shall have the same advantage, priority and preference, as are secured to the United States for the recovery thereof. Peter Borger therefore having become insolvent, and absconded, and the plaintiff having paid his duties to the custom house, as his surety, is entitled to a preference.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-6\">Mr. Bawle for the defendant contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqm\">that the preference given to the United States in -cases of insolvency, held only in three instances: where a general assignment had been made for the use of the creditors ; where process, in the nature of a domestic attachment, letting in all the creditors, had issued; or where there had been a regular bankruptcy. And such has been the uniform construction of the act of congress.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b557-7\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8J\">The law of the union does not apply to the ease stated. Congress in the close of the 18th section of the act of 2d May 1792, have made alegislative declaration of the sense in which the words \u201c cases of insolvency \u201d shall be taken, and they must be restricted thereby to the three instances pointed out by the counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
