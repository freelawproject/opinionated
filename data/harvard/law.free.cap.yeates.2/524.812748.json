A <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to September term 1797, returned \u201cno buyers\u2019\u201d An <em>alias venditioni </em>issued to September term 1798, returned \u201c sale postponed at the plaintiff\u2019s risk,\u201d and a <em>pl/wries venditioni </em>afterwards issued to last September term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\">Moses Levy, esq. obtained a <em>testatum fi. fa. </em>to March term last, against the same defendant in the same county, on which part of the same personal property was again levied, and in persuance of a writ of <em>vendAtioni exponas </em>returnable to this term, the same was sold by the sheriff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-10\">Messrs. Ingersoll and Lewis moved,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD-\">that the money arising on the sales should be paid over to the first execution creditor, the personal property being bound by the delivery of the writ to the sheriff\u2019. This case is the same as that decided in Swift <em>et al. v. </em>Hartman; and in Cox <em>v. </em>M\u2019Dougal, determined last term, the circumstances were stronger, for there the plaintiff requested the sheriff, that the goods and household furniture might remain in the defendant\u2019s hands; and yet after a delay of going, on exceeding fifteen months, the plaintiff\u2019s prior lien was recognized by this court, and the moneys ordered to be paid to him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-11\">Messrs. Dallas and W. Tilgliman, <em>e contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An41\">The leaving of the goods in hands of the debtor tends to defraud others, and is a circumstance which shall postpone the creditor. 1 Wils. 44. It is within the principle of a bill of sale being deemed fraudulent when the possession of the articles is retained by the vendor. Such possession is presumptive evidence of fraud, and it is incumbent on the first execution creditor who permits it, to remove this legal presumption.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b532-12\">By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"AND\">We must be consistent in our determinations, otherwise the utmost uncertainty would ensue. A sheriff\u2019 levying on a debtor\u2019s personal estate is an act of notoriety, and is not to be compared to the case of a private bill of sale, which is generally transacted in secret. Our own customs must govern with respect to executions and the effects of a levy on goods not removed. If a sheriff here would insist on removing goods immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>after they were levied on, though security was offered for their being produced when demanded, it would create a just and general outcry against his cruelty. The cases of Hartman <em>v. </em>M\u2019Dougall are precisely in point, and binding on us. Wherefore, let the surplus of the property, after paying the costs of sale, be paid over to the first execution creditor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
