On inspection of a diagram, which represented all the tracts together, it was manifest that the terms of the Virginia certificate call for the lands held by Jeremiah Wright.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-14\">Mr. Brackenridge for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_r\">then proposed to call witnesses to prove that the Virginia certificate was intended to protect and secure the improvement of John Westfall, which was objected to by Messrs. Ross and Woods for the plaintiff, and immediately overruled by the court. Such testimony would render all property held under titles of this nature insecure. The terms of the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>paper must govern, and it is evident that the certificate was intended for the lands now occupied by Jeremiah Wright. Zadock Wright made his settlement there, at the mouth of Montour\u2019s run. We are no strangers to the mode of procedui\u2019e adopted by the Virginia commissioners. They never granted two certificates to the same person, unless he claimed one of the tracts as assignee of some other, and in such case it was uniformly so expressed in the certificate. Here it is not so expressed, and the consequence is obvious, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Verdict <em>pro quer. instanter.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
