Whether Mary Hallowel, the widow of Israel Hallowel deceased, who was a nephew of the testator, was entitled as a niece, to a proportion of such residue ? Messrs. Eawle and Thomas for the great nephews and nieces argued, that they were more nearly of bin to the testator (those who were of the whole blood,) than the nephews and nieces of the half blood, and would be entitled to take in the same manner as \u201c grand children \u201d would take under a devise to \u201cchildren and it could not be presumed, that the testator did not consider them as equal objects of his bounty, with their surviving uncles and aunts, being mentioned in his will. As to Mary Hallowel, she was a widow of a nephew of the whole blood. She is not stiled a niece in the will, but in fact was such, she having been the wife of a nephew. She may justly be deemed to be within the words, \u201c nephews and nieces of every description, \u201c mentioned in this will.\u201d And it is worthy of observation, that the will does not go on, saying \u201c mentioned in this will as nephews and nieces.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">Legacies to first and second cousins ; testator had at his death one first cousin, three first cousins once removed, and a great niece.

All the nephews and nieces whom the testator has in view, he particularly denominates as such in the whole of his will. But where he speaks of his great nephews or great nieces, he styles them the \u201cchildren\u201d of his nephews and nieces. This shows his meaning clearly, and excludes all presumption. The devise, to Mary Hallowel, is as the widow of Israel Hallowel, not as his niece. The case in Ambl. 603, seems decisive on both points. \u201c Grand children \u201d in common parlance, takes in every descendant, unless the intention appears to the contrary ; and Mary Hallowel cannot be considered as a niece, being only so by marriage. \u201c Nephews and nieces of every description, \u201d must refer to the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood, bewteen whom he makes no distinction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"b204-7\">Case stated, under the last will of'Samuel Lewis,, dated 21st May 1793, in these words :</p><p id=\"b206-5\">Two questions were submitted to the court. 1. \"Whether the children of the nephews and nieces of the said testator, (that is, such of them as are named in the will,) were included in the terms \u201cnephews and nieces of every description,\u201d and as such respectively entitled'to the proportions of the residue of his estate?</p><p id=\"b206-7\">It is not to be expected that authorities can be produced in the very expressions of the <em>will; </em>Put the following cases may be cited as illustrative of the principle, under which they claim.</p><p id=\"b207-6\">If one devises lands to A and his wife and their children or issue, and they have no children at the time of the devise, they have an estate tail. But if the devise be to A and his children or issue, and he then has children, they shall have a joint estate for life. The word \u201c children\u201d bears a sense co-extensive with \u201cissue.\u201d 6 Co. 16, 17. <em>a. </em>Beni. 30.</p><p id=\"b207-8\">An elder son construed as a younger, were unprovided for by collateral relations. 2 Vez. 203.</p><p id=\"b207-9\">An elder daughter where there is a son, is accounted a younger child, under a trust in marriage articles. 2 Atk. 457.</p><p id=\"b207-10\">Grand children is a word of large extent, and takes in every body descended from the testator. Ambl. 603.</p><p id=\"ACi\">The intention of the testator in his will, must determine both questions. There seems little room for presumption.</p><p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The court declared their opinion clearly to be for the plaintiff, for the reasons given byliis counsel, on both points.
