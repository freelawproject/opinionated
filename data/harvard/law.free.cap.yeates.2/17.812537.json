New York currency, payable on demand, which was afterwards indorsed to the plaintiff; and that on the 4th April 1776, Antill,who lived in New York, drew a bill on the defendant for the like sum, payable on sight to Michael Conner or order, who on the succeeding day indorsed it to the plantiff, and which the defendant afterwards accepted on the 23d August following. The plaintiff instituted a suit against the defendant in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, to December term 1782, and on the 15th September following, the same was fully paid to his attorney.</p><p id=\"b25-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted, that the note and bill were for the same debt, and the circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s keeping the bill in his hands above seventeen years before he commenced his action, though he brought his suit on the note many years before, was urged as strong evidence of it. But to put the matter out of all question, they offered in testimony the answer of colonel Antill to interrogatories administered to him under a commission, showing that the consideration of the note and hill was the same original debt and that there had been no other transactions between the parties whereby a now debt might have been contracted.</p><p id=\"b25-10\">The defendants counsel cited 5 Term Rep. 579, Bspin. 85, that it admits of a question, how far a man who has set his name to a negotiable instrument, can be called as a witness, to disprove the holder\u2019s right of action on it; and Lord Kennon has often overruled objections of that kind, in similar cases. One has been suffered to explain his own deed. 1 Term Rep. 300, 301.

In the present instance they thought the testimony might be spared, unless strong evidence was adduced on the part of the plaintiff.</p><p id=\"b26-6\">The counsel at length agreed that the answers of Antill should be read, and Mr. Conner be sworn as a witness ; but after hearing Antill\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff declined examining his witness, and became nonsuit.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
