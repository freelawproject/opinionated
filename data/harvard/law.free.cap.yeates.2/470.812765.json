And the said Adam in fact saith, that the said Daniel at the time of the bargain and sale aforesaid, had not any right or title whatsoever to the piece or parcel of land aforesaid, or any part thereof, and that he the said Adam, being in possession thereof uuder the said Daniel, was by a certain Timothy Peace<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>able, lessee of William Witman, junior, impleaded in an action of trespass and ejectment of and concerning the premises, to wit, in the Court of Common Pleas, held at Beading for the said county of Berks, on the, &amp;c. before, &amp;e. of which said action the said Daniel then had notice, to wit, at the county aforesaid. And the said Adam further saith, that he the said Daniel then and there having notice of the action aforesaid against the said Adam, did not warrant and defend the premises unto him the said Adam; and he the said Adam not having anything to say why the said Timothy Peaceable should be precluded from recovering the premises aforesaid the court afterwards did consider that the aforesaid Timothy should recover his term yet to come in the same premises and so the said Adam was evicted from the same premises in due course of law, of which the aforesaid Daniel also had notice, to wit, at the county aforesaid; nevertheless the aforesaid Daniel, although often required, hath not rendered unto the said Adam, other land in lieu of the premises, nor the value thereof, nor hath he satisfied the said Adam in any manner whatsoever, although often requested so to do, and therefore the said Adam saith that he the said Daniel hath not kept his covenant aforesaid, but hath broken the same, and hitherto hath refused and still doth refuse to keep the same, to the damage of the said Adam 500 dollars, and therefore he brings this suit, &amp;c, Pledges, &amp;c. To this declaration there was a general demurrer, which came on for argument at Nisi Prius by consent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-5\">Mr. Clymer for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abz\">in support of the demurrer, excepted to the declaration, that it did not state that the lessee of William Witman had the eldest title to the lands, or even a legal title. The want hereof was <em>held </em>fatal in <em>Kirby </em>v. Hansaker. Cro. Jac. 315. In covenant for enjoyment without eviction, a breach that a stranger recovered in ejectment is not good, without showing that he had the elder title, though there was a- rejoinder that the recovery was by covin, and a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">In covenant on a sale of lands with warranty, breach that I. S. having a legal title, entered and expelled the plaintiff by due process of law; held insufficient, for he might have had a lawful title under the plaintiff. Wooten v. Hele. 1 Lev. 301. 1 Mod. 293. Covenant to save a tenant harmless from all suits, evictions or expulsions. Plea covenants performed. Beplication that I. S. ousted him by writ of <em>hob. fae. y&gt;oss. </em>out of <em>B. R. debito modo </em>exuente, and held ill on demurrer for two reasons; one whereof was, that he ought to have shown, that I. S. had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a legal title before the lease. Nicholas <em>v. </em>Pullen. 1 Keb. 379, 413. S. C. 1 Lev. 83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">In debt on a bond to save lessee harmless, the plain tiff must reply that the person who recovered against him by verdict had the ancient title; for otherwise, the covenant is not broken. Noke\u2019s case. 4 Co. 80. He also cited Chanudflower <em>v. </em>Prestley.

It is objected, that it is not shown that the recoverer had the eldest or even a legal title; but it is obvious that he could not succeed in the ejectment without having the eldest and best title. That the defendant received notice of the suit, and that the plaintiff was evicted by due process of law, is tantamount to, if not stronger than averring, that the nominal lessee had the elder and better title. The breach here pursues the words of the covenant, which has always been held sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-8\">\u25a0 By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q4\">The declaration might have been more artificially drawn, but we consider it as substantially good. It is said (1Burr. 319 ) that the rules of pleading are founded in the closest logic, and the good sense of the cases cited must be, that as the plaintiff must entitle himself to his action, and as in covenants of quiet enjoyment and warranty the acts of wrong doers are not comprehended, (1 Stra. 400. Hob. 35, 3 Term Rep. 584 ) he should state a case, wherein the title of the covenanter must n\u00e9cessarily have come in question. A lawful opposing right should therefore be averred, though it need not be set out. 4 Term. Rep. 617. The plaintiff here has asserted, that the defendant at the time of the sale had no right or title to any part of the lands sold, and the demurrer confessing all facts which have been well pleaded, (Co. Lit. 72. <em>a. </em>5 Co. 69. Carth. 31) it follows, that the recovery could only have been under a good and and elder title, inconsistent with the right of the now defendant, and not under that right. The declaration is certain to a common intent, and the notice stated to have been given of the commencement of the ejectment precludes every idea of collusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Judgment for the plaintiff, and writ of inquiry of damages awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
