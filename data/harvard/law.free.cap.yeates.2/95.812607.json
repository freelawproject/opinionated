His clients were not averse to a submission, but he expressed his doubts, whether the same could legally be done consistently with the act of 13th March 1791, which required the court \u201c to direct an issue to be tried by a jury during a next term, upon whose verdict final judgment shall be entered.\u201d 3 Dall.

In accounts of a long standing, depending on a great variety of facts, it is almost impossible to do complete justice by a jury trial, and we have frequently experienced the necessity of references, after the court have delivered their sentiments on particular points of law. The defalcation act of 1705, declares \u201cthe award of referees mutually chosen and approved of by the court, to have the same effect, and to be as available in law as a verdict given by twelve men.\u201d Express negative words appear necessary to oust courts of justice from making such rules of court, in matters of mere account, where the parties consent to a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Referees appointed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
