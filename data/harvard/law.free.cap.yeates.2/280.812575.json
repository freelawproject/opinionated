Dall St. Laws, 225. It is analogous to a question of bail, (2 Stra. 1757. 1 Wils. 888. 2 Burr. 2017. 1 Term Rep. 717) in the king\u2019s bench, where when the affidavit of a debt is positive, no contradictory proof is permitted to be given. Neither is it absolutely necessary, though it may be prudent to make such demand in writing under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
