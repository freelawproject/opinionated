Widdoss (Wid-doss) under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act for the death of her daughter, Crystal Renee Miller, less than 24 hours after being vaccinated with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT). Because Widdoss\u2019 motion to review the special master\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>sion was untimely, the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain and rule upon the merits of that motion.

(100 Stat.) at 3762, the special master assigned to hear a petition has a limited period of 240 days after the petition\u2019s filing date in which to hear the merits and issue a decision. If the special master fails to issue a decision within the 240-day period, the special master shall notify the petitioner of her options either to have the petition remain before the special master or to withdraw the petition, upon submitting written notice to the Claims Court. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-12(g), 300aa-21(b) (West 1991 &amp; Supp.1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(C), however, the special master may, upon motion of either party, toll the 240-day period for an aggregate period not to exceed 150 days.

This concern was further evidenced by the addition one year later of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(D) (West Supp.1992),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which permits the chief special master, acting on his own initiative \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d to suspend proceedings associated with pre-September 30, 1990 vaccinations for a period of up to 540 days in addition to the 150-day suspension time under section 300aa-12(d)(3)(C), upon determining that \u201cthe number of filings and resultant workload place an undue burden on the parties or the special master involved in [the] proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither of these suspension provisions was intended to contravene the Vaccine Act\u2019s desire to resolve petitions rapidly, but instead resulted from the recognition that special masters assigned to hear individual cases may become so overburdened with the enormity of the caseload that they would be unable to deal properly with each case. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(D) (West 1991 &amp; Supp.1992); 136 Cong.Rec.

If no such motion is filed, the clerk of the Claims Court is required by statute to enter judgment immediately on the basis of the special master\u2019s decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">On June 28, 1988, at the age of five months, Crystal Renee Miller received her first DPT vaccination. Less than 24 hours later, the child was discovered dead in her crib after being unobserved for over two hours. The autopsy results indicated her cause of death as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">On June 4, 1990, Dawn Widdoss, both individually and as administratrix of the deceased, timely filed a petition for compensation for Crystal\u2019s death under the Vaccine Act. Widdoss alleged that Crystal had died as a direct result of suffering a \u201cshock-collapse or hypotonic-hyporespon-sive collapse\u201d (HHE).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Widdoss\u2019 case was immediately assigned to Special Master Wright, whose statutory 240-day period in which to conclude the case would have expired on January 30, 1991. Pursuant to section 300aa-12(d)(3)(C), however, Special Master Wright granted one 30-day suspension in the proceedings prior to the January 25, 1991 evi-dentiary hearing, and one 30-day suspension thereafter to permit the parties to file post-hearing papers. Wright thereby extended the deadline for issuing her decision through March 31, 1991. During the post-hearing period in which she was to decide the case and issue her opinion, Special Master Wright, on March 28 and May 22, 1991, further suspended the proceedings for 60 and 7 days, respectively, thereby further extending her 240-day statutory deadline to June 6, 1991. Wright granted a final suspension of 14 days on June 6 in order to retain the authority to issue her opinion, which she did on June 7, 1991. Each exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>sion of time was granted pursuant to a request by one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">On the merits, Special Master Wright determined that Widdoss had failed to prove by preponderant evidence that Crystal\u2019s death was a sequela of a table injury. This determination was based in part on the fact that Crystal failed to exhibit any clear symptoms of an HHE other than as part of the agonal process of death: \u201cTo say that death is a sequela of a shock-like state that is an integral part of the dying process simply defies logic.\u201d <em>Widdoss v. Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-486V, slip op. at 11, 1991 WL 112208 (Cl.Ct.Sp.Mstr. June 7, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">On July 9,1991, 31 days after the special master\u2019s decision issued, Widdoss filed her motion to review the special master\u2019s decision with the Claims Court. As a result of the untimely filing, on that same date, the clerk of the Claims Court <em>sua sponte </em>entered final judgment in accordance with the special master\u2019s decision as mandated by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In response to the Claims Court\u2019s adverse judgment, Widdoss submitted a motion for \u201creconsideration\u201d of the clerk\u2019s entry of judgment, urging that the Claims Court vacate the judgment and review the merits of the case. On November 21,1991, the Claims Court granted Widdoss\u2019 motion \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Widdoss v. United States, </em>24 Cl.Ct. 547, 548 (1991) (order vacating judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In so doing, the Claims Court addressed three argued bases on which to vacate the entry of judgment. First, the judge concluded that the June 6,1991 order pursuant to Vaccine Rule 9,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[suspending] proceedings on the petition\u201d for 14 days, had tolled the running of the 30-day period in which to file a motion for review until after the expiration of the suspension period on June 20, 1991. The court reasoned that \u201cno steps could be lawfully taken during the pendency of the suspension\u201d and therefore the June 7, 1991 decision \u201cissued\u201d within the meaning of section 300aa-12(e)(l) on June 20. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. Second, in the alternative, even if the suspension period had not tolled the 30-day period, relief was appropriate under Rule 60(b) of the Rules of the United States Claims Court (RUSCC), because such relief would be \u201c \u2018in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the Vaccine Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 (quoting <em>Zimmerman v. Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-2758V, 1991 WL 211926, at *3 n. 2 (Cl.Ct. Sept. 27, 1991) (order granting motion to reinstate petition)). Finally, the court determined that the three-day deadline extension afforded by RUSCC 6 and Vaccine Rule 19(c), available in situations where papers are served by mail, had no application to the 30-day period for filing a motion for review, since the period ran from the date of issuance of the special master\u2019s decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d), regardless of whether the petitioner received a copy of the decision through the mails. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">On the merits, the Claims Court reversed the special master\u2019s decision, holding that the special master had ignored unrebutted testimony on the existence of symptoms of an HHE, in light of which Widdoss had demonstrated by preponderant evidence that Crystal had suffered an HHE, and that she was therefore entitled to compensation for Crystal\u2019s death. <em>Widdoss v. Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>25 Cl.Ct. 251, 263-68 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">Review of whether the Claims Court had jurisdiction to hear the motion to review the special master\u2019s decision is <em>de novo. Dehne v. United States, </em>970 F.2d 890, 892 (Fed.Cir.1992); <em>Zumerling v. Marsh, </em>783 F.2d 1032, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1986). This decision necessarily involves statutory interpretation, which we likewise review <em>de novo. Commercial Energies, Inc. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed.Cir.1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number><em>Pasteur v. United States, </em>814 F.2d 624, 626 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Section 300aa-12(d)(3) authorizes the special master to toll or \u201csuspend\u201d the time period in which she must decide the case upon motion of either party. The actual language of the section reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">(A) A special master to whom a petition has been assigned shall issue a decision on such petition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-8\">(ii) ... as expeditiously as practicable but not later than 240 days, exclusive of suspended time under subparagraph (C), after the date the petition was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">(C) In conducting a proceeding on a petition a special master shall suspend the proceedings one time for 30 days on the motion of either party. After a motion for suspension is granted, further motions for suspension by either party may be granted by the special master, if the special master determines the suspension is reasonable and necessary, for an aggregate period not to exceed 150 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3); <em>see also </em>Vaccine Rules 9, 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">In considering the effect of Special Master Wright\u2019s June 6 suspension on the issuance of her decision, the Claims Court ruled that the suspension \u201cfroze <em>all </em>proceedings during that entire [suspension] period to the end that <em>no </em>steps could be lawfully taken during the pendency of the suspension.\u201d <em>Widdoss v. United States, </em>at 551 (order vacating judgment) (emphasis added). This understanding of the effect of a suspension erroneously limits a special master\u2019s power to act during periods of suspension. <em>See </em>Vaccine Rule 9(c) (single effect of suspension is to toll statutory time periods), <em>supra </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">As noted above, the legislative history demonstrates that periods of suspension serve only to enlarge the legally available time period in which to render a decision on a petition. Such extensions are authorized if the special master determines that \u201cfurther time is necessary for ... action on the petition to proceed.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 386, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 516 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3119. That a special master is able to consider the evidence, decide the case, and prepare her opinion for issuance during periods of suspension thus are unquestionable propositions. Were the law otherwise, the effect, for example, of a 30-day suspension granted on the 240th day would be simply to delay by 30 days the special master\u2019s inevitable announcement that she could no longer entertain the petition. This clearly was not intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">Furthermore, both sections 300aa-12(d)(3)(A) and 300aa-12(e)(l) evidence that the proceedings on <em>a, </em>petition conclude with the special master\u2019s final act of \u201cissupng] a decision on the petition,\u201d at which time the clock measuring the time for filing a motion to review the special master\u2019s decision begins to run. Consequently, the effective date of issuance of-a decision by the special master has to be the date actually issued, because upon issuance of the decision, the special master is thereafter relieved of any further power to suspend the case, since there are no longer any \u201cproceeding[s] on a petition\u201d to suspend under section 300aa-12(d)(3)(C). The June 6, 1991 14-day suspension thus had the <em>sole </em>effect of extending the period of time within which the special master could decide the case, since \u201cfurther time [was] necessary for the action on the petition to proceed.\u201d Upon issuing her decision, any remaining suspension period was of no further effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">Moreover, interpreting the statutory suspension provisions so as to require delaying the effectiveness of the special master\u2019s decision until the expiration of the suspension period would be contrary to the legislative history\u2019s premium on rapid resolution of petitions for compensation and on avoidance of unnecessary delays within the statutory framework. This emphasis supports \u201cdeciding\u201d a case as soon as possible, and \u201cissuing\u201d the decision as soon as it is made. A clearly expressed purpose of the Vaccine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>Act was to resolve petitions for compensation \u201cas expeditiously as possible,\u201d furtherance of which is accomplished through our interpretation of the special master\u2019s power to \u201csuspend\u201d proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Thus, for purposes of section 300aa-12(e)(1), the special master\u2019s decision effectively \u201cissued\u201d on the date it actually issued, regardless of any remaining period of suspension. The 30-day period in which Widdoss could file a motion to review the special master\u2019s decision began to run on June 7, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Widdoss\u2019 July 9, 1991 motion to review the special master\u2019s decision was untimely filed in the Claims Court. We must therefore determine whether the 30-day time limit under section 300aa-12(e)(l) is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The pertinent section of the statutory compensation scheme, entitled \u201cCourt jurisdiction,\u201d reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-8\">(e) Action by United States Claims Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-9\">(1) <em>Upon issuance </em>of the special master\u2019s decision, <em>the parties shall have 30 days to </em>file<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with the clerk of the United States Claims Court <em>a motion </em>to have the court review the decision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-10\">(2) <em>Upon the filing of a motion </em>under paragraph (1) with respect to a petition, <em>the United States Claims Court shall have jurisdiction </em>to undertake a review of the record of the proceedings and may thereafter [exercise its standards of review].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-11\">(3) <em>In the absence of a motion </em>under paragraph (1) respecting the special masters decision ..., the clerk of <em>the United States Claims Court shall immediately enter judgment </em>in accordance with the special master\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Vaccine Rule 11(a); Vaccine Rule 23 (\u201cNo extensions of time under this rule will be permitted, and failure of a party to timely file such a motion shall constitute a waiver of the right to obtain review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">Congress specifically used this phraseology to illustrate in the strongest possible terms that filing a motion to review the special master\u2019s decision within the 30-day period is a prerequisite to the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction. The pertinent legislative history accompanying the addition of section 300aa-12(e) emphasizes the same notion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-16\">The conference agreement provides for an appeal of the [special] master\u2019s decision to the U.S. Claims Court under very limited circumstances. <em>If such a motion for review is filed within the applicable time limits, </em>the Court is <em>then </em>to decide to [exercise its standards of review]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">H.R.Conf.Rep.

Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>23 Cl.Ct. 169 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>960 F.2d 156 (Fed.Cir.1992) (table). In <em>Wilson, </em>which was summarily affirmed without opinion by this court, petitioners withdrew their motion to review a special master\u2019s decision prior to any action thereon by the Claims Court, and judgment was thereafter entered on the basis of the special master\u2019s decision without reaching the merits thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 170. Petitioners thereafter attempted to invoke RUSCC 59 to obtain post-judgment relief. Due to the petitioners\u2019 failure to pursue pre-judgment remedies, the Claims Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the case, since any jurisdiction had been lost upon the original motion\u2019s withdrawal. Though Widdoss would have us limit <em>Wilson </em>to its facts, we read the case to stand for the broader principle that the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear appeals under the Vaccine Act is \u201cunambiguously circumscribed by the plain language of [section 300aa-12(e)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">In light of the above, we hold that the 30-day time period in which to file a motion for review under section 300aa-12(e)(1) is jurisdictional. The jurisdictional character of the 30-day time period does not preclude the Claims Court from adjudicating the question of whether Widdoss\u2019 petition for review was timely filed, however. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3). The Claims Court obviously has jurisdiction to determine if it has jurisdiction. <em>Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, </em>893 F.2d 324, 328 (Fed.Cir.1989); <em>cf. C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Schwartz, </em>716 F.2d 874, 877 (Fed.Cir.1983) (Federal Circuit has inherent jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction); <em>see also Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>978 F.2d 679, 686-89 (Fed.Cir.1992) (&amp; cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Because the 30-day time period is jurisdictional, invocation of RUSCC 60(b) to authorize review of the merits of Widdoss\u2019 petition for review is to no avail, because such a rule cannot be used to escape a jurisdictional limitation. RUSCC 60(b) reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-12\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment ... for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; ... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">RUSCC 60(b) was promulgated by the Claims Court under authority conferred thereon by Congress to govern practice and procedure in matters before the court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2503(b) (1988). Although the Rule\u2019s language would at first glance apparently apply to the immediate issue, it is well settled that \u201c[a]n authority conferred upon a court to make rules of procedure for the exercise of its jurisdiction is not an authority to enlarge its jurisdiction[.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 589-90, 61 S.Ct. 767, 771, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). Moreover, it is clear that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>[Claims Court] cannot, through its [acknowledged] rule-making power, expand its jurisdiction beyond the limits prescribed by Congress.\u201d <em>RSH Constructors, Inc. v.

Although the Claims Court undertook to review the decision of the special master \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d, I agree that the untimely filing can not be overcome under Rule 60(b). However, to the extent that the panel majority holds that the thirty-day limit is not subject to waiver or toll for purposes of review of the master\u2019s decision because this time limit is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d, I respectfully must dissent from the ruling of the panel majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">In <em>Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>978 F.2d 679 (Fed.Cir.1992) this court again sought to place in perspective the ubiquitously loose usage of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d. Although we have on occasion used that term to describe situations wherein statutory requirements have not been met, I believe that the analysis in <em>Spruill </em>is in better harmony with the analysis of precedent. The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-16\">[W]hen the plaintiff bases his cause of action upon an act of Congress jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a plea denying the merits of the claim____ [I]f the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>plaintiff really makes a substantial claim under an act of Congress there is jurisdiction whether the claim ultimately be held good or bad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-5\"><em>The Fair v. Kohler Die and Specialty Co., </em>228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S.Ct. 410, 411, 57 L.Ed. 716 (1913) (Holmes, J.). A claim that does not meet a statutory time period may not be a \u201cgood\u201d claim, it may not be an actionable claim, but it does not defeat the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 71 S.Ct. 692, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951) (\u201cAs frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter, the question of whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with whether the complaint states a cause of action.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">Jurisdiction of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was assigned to the United States Claims Court. The Act provides that a request for review by the Claims Court of the decision of a special master must be filed within thirty days of the date of the master\u2019s decision. However, the special master is an instrumentality of the Claims Court, and the Claims Court has jurisdiction <em>ab initio. </em>Indeed, judgment can be entered only by the Claims Court, even if no request for review is filed. While the step of reviewing the special master\u2019s decision requires a timely request therefor, an untimely or no request does not mean that the Claims Court is devoid of jurisdiction, for the Claims Court already has jurisdiction, and it is on the basis of that jurisdiction that final judgment is entered. The somewhat imprecise draftsmanship of the Vaccine Act can not deprive the court of the jurisdiction that it must retain in order to carry out its assignment. Thus by reconsidering the judgment that had been entered by its clerk of court, the Claims Court was not taking forbidden jurisdiction, whether or not it was acting appropriately under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">In sum, when petitioner Widdoss was one day late<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in filing her request for review by the Claims Court of the decision of the special master, this did not raise a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d issue. In denying or granting that review the Claims Court is not determining its jurisdiction. <em>See Do-Well Machine Shop, Inc. v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 637 (Fed.Cir.1989) (one year time limit for appeals under the Contract Disputes Act is not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d); <em>Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>773 F.2d 313, 316 (Fed.Cir.1985) (failure to meet a valid statutory and regulatory requirement is not a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defect); <em>Ralston Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>340 F.2d 663, 667, 169 Ct.Cl. 119 (Ct.Cl.1965) (determination that a plaintiff does not have a statutory right to relief does not deprive the court of jurisdiction <em>ab initio); Amgen Inc. v.

However, this does not implicate the court\u2019s jurisdiction, or require on jurisdictional grounds that the thirty-day limit can not be tolled or waived in the interest of justice. <em>See Irwin v. Veterans Administration, </em>498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (equitable tolling of statutory period of limitations is available in suits against the United States); <em>Thompson v.

Indeed, whether a requirement is described as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d does not prohibit recourse to the interest of justice, and does not bar equitable tolling or waiver should the circumstances warrant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-19\">.
