United States, </em>24 Cl.Ct. 714 (1991). The issues appealed by the government are: (1) whether the Claims Court erred in holding that payments made by Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Company (ODECO) (on behalf of its operating subsidiaries) to Mentor Insurance Limited (Mentor), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ODECO, constituted true insurance premiums that are deductible as business expenses under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (IRC),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) if properly classified as insurance premiums, whether Mentor\u2019s income from insuring the drilling rigs of ODECO\u2019s subsidiaries located in waters of the outer continental shelf of the United States constituted income from the insurance of United States risks within the meaning of sections 951-953 of the IRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">We adopt the analysis and holding on these issues as set forth in the Claims Court\u2019s opinion, which is attached as an appendix.

Plaintiff Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company (\u201cODECO\u201d or \u201cplaintiff\u201d) was incorporated in 1953 to take advantage of business opportunities that resulted from the opening up of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Murphy Oil Corporation (\u201cMurphy\u201d) and private investors provided the funds to establish plaintiff. The objectives of plaintiff were to build offshore drilling rigs and to invest the profits earned from this undertaking to establish an oil and gas reserve base. Plaintiff achieved these objectives and during the years at issue in this case, 1974 and 1975, operated as a holding company, with subsidiaries conducting its business. Plaintiff\u2019s principal lines of business during that period were offshore contract drilling, exploration for and production of oil and gas, underwater diving services, and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Richard E. Roberson, Jr., testified as to the development and business operations of plaintiff and its insurance subsidiary, Mentor Insurance Limited (\u201cMentor\u201d). Mr. Roberson\u2019s knowledge derives from his experience as an internal auditor at Murphy from 1962 to 1965; controller for plaintiff from 1965 to 1977; vice-president for plaintiff from 1974 to 1977; and controller for Mentor from 1968 through the years at issue in this case. Currently, Mr. Roberson is employed by plaintiff as vice-president of finance. He returned to ODECO in 1986 after serving in executive positions with two other oil companies between 1977 and 1983 and as a financial consultant between 1983 and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Mr. Roberson described at length the type of drilling rigs owned by plaintiff and its subsidiaries and insured by Mentor. Plaintiff designed the first rig capable of operating as a mobile drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the advent ,of mobile rigs, exploration companies had to construct artificial islands, also known as platforms, and use conventional land rigs on these sites. If oil was not discovered, the platform had to be torn down. Mobile drilling rigs reduced the cost of exploration; they could be moved from one location to another, thereby avoiding the cost of constructing and tearing down platforms. The mobile drilling rigs at issue in this case were operating in the Outer Continental Shelf area of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">During the 1960\u2019s plaintiff faced difficulties insuring its drilling rigs. At that time the drilling rig business was written predominately by the Lloyd Syndicate (\u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d), with the London Market serving as an ancillary market to Lloyd\u2019s. As the technology of drilling rigs developed rapidly, Lloyd\u2019s adjusted its insurance rates in an attempt to cover itself against potential losses from the new drilling rigs. Because of the limited experience in insuring the new rigs and a number of substantial losses on these rigs, insurance rates increased sharply. By the end of the 1960\u2019s, rates were as high as 10 percent of the value of insured vessels, and plaintiff was unable to obtain full coverage of its rigs through the existing insurance market. In response to this dilemma, plaintiff analyzed its history of premiums and losses and determined that establishment of a captive insurer could alleviate the problems that plaintiff faced in the insurance market. In 1968 plaintiff established Mentor as a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Bermuda.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>The initial capitalization for Mentor was $12,000.00, the minimum amount of capitalization required to organize a company in Bermuda. Plaintiff increased the capital contribution to Mentor to $200,000.00 by the end of 1968. In a December 19, 1968 meeting of Mentor\u2019s board of directors, the chairman of the board stated that this increase in capital was necessary for the insurance business that Mentor was undertaking. In June 1969 plaintiff increased Mentor\u2019s capitalization to $950,000.00. At the time Mentor was increasing its insurance of plaintiff\u2019s risks and considering insuring the risks of companies unrelated to plaintiff. Mentor increased its capitalization because of its concern that it be adequately capitalized and able to attract unrelated entities to insure with Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The capitalization of Mentor remained at $950,000.00 through the years 1974 and 1975, despite Mentor\u2019s purchase of another insurance company in 1975.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Through 1975 Mentor was never asked by the Government of Bermuda to increase its capital, nor was it informed that it did not meet the capital requirements of Bermuda. For 1974 the capital surplus (share capital + retained earnings + minority interests) of Mentor amounted to $12,508,417.00; the net earned premiums (accounted for premiums net of commissions and reinsurance) were $5,335,617.00; the losses paid were $2,527,640.00; and the reserves for losses (liabilities) were $2,512,030.00. For 1975 the capital surplus was $15,943,790.00; the net earned premiums were $12,310,711.00; the losses paid were $7,946,191.00; and the reserves for losses were $6,427,834.00. Mentor\u2019s capitalization during 1974 and 1975 was adequate to cover any losses that might be presented to Mentor for payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Mentor maintained offices in Bermuda from the time of its inception in 1968. Initially, Mentor shared an office and employees with Universal Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. (\u201cUniversal Marine\u201d), a company not affiliated with plaintiff. This share arrangement between Mentor and Universal Marine was a common practice among insurers in Bermuda. Mentor entered into the arrangement prior to underwriting any insurance and concluded the arrangement in 1973 due to the increased business of both companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">When the arrangement between Mentor and Universal Marine was instituted, Mentor\u2019s books were transferred to Bermuda. A chartered accountant kept Mentor\u2019s books, and Anthony Robert Gwinnell, an employee of both Mentor and Universal Marine in Bermuda, underwrote insurance for Mentor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Gwinn\u00e9ll was employed by Mentor and Universal Marine from December 1968 to February 1971. His position with Mentor required that Mr. Gwin-nell establish an underwriting seat for Mentor in Bermuda. He was also responsible for the placement of investments for Mentor, but plaintiff determined how funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>would be invested during Mr. Gwinnell\u2019s tenure with Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">When plaintiff hired Mr. Gwinnell, plaintiff explained to him that Mentor initially would insure risks of plaintiff and that, if such endeavor proved successful, Mentor would begin underwriting risks for unrelated parties. Consequently, the first policies Mr. Gwinnell wrote for Mentor were those of plaintiff, followed by those of unrelated parties from 1970 onward. The reinsurance of Mentor\u2019s policies began in 1969 as a measure to protect the policies written by Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In his position with Mentor, Mr. Gwinnell rejected submissions for insurance that he deemed undesirable or bad for business. The rates charged by Mentor to plaintiff and third parties were not established or approved by plaintiff. Plaintiff negotiated through its brokerage house, Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc. (\u201cMarsh &amp; McLennan\u201d), the rates it would pay for insurance by Mentor. Plaintiff paid Marsh &amp; McLennan for insurance obtained for itself and its subsidiaries with Mentor and other insurers. Marsh &amp; McLennan then paid the insurers directly, and plaintiff charged its subsidiaries for their share of the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Subsequent to the conclusion of the arrangement with Universal Marine, Mentor retained its own accountant and underwriter in Bermuda. Mentor compensated them with funds from accounts in Bermuda. Mentor also retained both legal counsel, Conyers, Dill &amp; Pearman, and a certified public accounting firm, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., in Bermuda. Operations conducted in Bermuda by Mentor included hiring, firing, budgeting, underwriting, and expanding business. To execute these practices, Mentor had five to six employees in Bermuda during 1974 and 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The underwriter for Mentor during 1974 and 1975 was Francis James Carter. Mr. Carter, an impressive and informative witness, testified as to the operations of Mentor during his tenure in Bermuda. Mr. Carter started working for both Mentor and Universal Marine in 1971 after working for Lloyd\u2019s for eleven years. In 1971 Mentor had a capital surplus of greater than $2 million, and Mr. Carter was expected to underwrite a general account for Mentor. When the arrangement between the two insurance companies ended in 1973, Mr. Carter worked exclusively for Mentor until 1978. In 1974 Mr. Carter was promoted to vice-president and director of Mentor. In this position he was responsible for the entire running of the office, including underwriting, budgeting, expanding business, hiring and firing of employees, and generally managing Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Mr. Carter knew of no Mentor funds loaned to or commingled with funds of plaintiff or its subsidiaries. Mentor refrained from undertaking such transactions because the resulting arrangements would have reflected negatively on Mentor\u2019s financial stability. From 1973 until the time Mr. Carter left Mentor, the investment decisions of Mentor were under the control of Mentor\u2019s accountant, Collin O\u2019Conner, who worked with plaintiff\u2019s treasury department on investment decisions. Investment guidelines were established by Mentor\u2019s board of directors in accordance with plaintiff\u2019s investment criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Premiums paid to Mentor for insurance coverage were placed in Mentor\u2019s accounts. Mentor maintained a premium loss account of approximately $2-$3 million in Bermuda during 1974 and 1975 to cover operating expenses and policyholders\u2019 claims. Funds in excess of this amount were maintained in accounts outside Bermuda. Investment of Bermuda funds consisted primarily of high grade certificates of deposit. Plaintiff\u2019s treasury department, or, specifically, Odie Vaughan, managed the investment of Mentor\u2019s other funds within the guidelines established by Mentor\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Vaughan was treasurer of both plaintiff and Mentor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>Mentor\u2019s funds were separate from plaintiff\u2019s funds through 1975; Mentor never loaned money to plaintiff or its subsidiaries;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mentor\u2019s funds were never used as collateral for plaintiff\u2019s loans; Mentor never invested in any of plaintiff\u2019s non-insurance subsidiaries; and Mentor\u2019s investment funds were not commingled with plaintiff\u2019s investment funds. The only guarantee by plaintiff of amounts payable under a Mentor policy of insurance was for a policy issued to Ben ODECO Limited (\u201cBen ODE-CO\u201d) in 1977.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, for both tax years 1974 and 1975, plaintiff included the revenue and income of Mentor on its Consolidated Statements of Income and included Mentor as an asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Mentor\u2019s business was not completely separate from plaintiff\u2019s business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mentor was required to obtain approval from plaintiff\u2019s board of directors for certain facets of its business, including approval of its operating budget, approval of letters of credit over a certain amount, approval of large claims, and approval of capital expenditures.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, Mentor had directors and officers who were employees of plaintiff and its affiliates. In 1974 four of Mentor\u2019s seven officers were employees of plaintiff or its affiliates, and in 1975 four of Mentor\u2019s eight officers were employees of plaintiff. The treasurer for both plaintiff and Mentor, Mr. Vaughan, is an example of an individual with loyalties to both plaintiff and Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Mr. Vaughan testified as to his responsibilities as treasurer for both plaintiff and Mentor during 1974 and 1975. Although he acted as treasurer for both entities, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>Vaughan was considered an employee of plaintiff. The work performed for Mentor was done under a fee arrangement. Mr. Vaughan was responsible for the administrative functions with respect to the receipt, disbursement, and investment of money of both plaintiff and Mentor. Mr. Vaughan knew of no Mentor funds commingled with plaintiffs funds, loaned to plaintiff, or used as collateral for plaintiffs loans. When plaintiff owed a subsidiary money or a subsidiary owed plaintiff money, a check would be issued for the amount owed, rather than merely noting the transfer of funds in their books.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Charles Niederer<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was a second individual affiliated with both plaintiff and Mentor. Prior to August 1974, Mr. Niederer occupied the position of insurance manager for Murphy. This position entailed the purchasing of insurance and the general management of insurance operations for Murphy. Mr. Niederer held a similar position with plaintiff from August 1974 until January 1977, when he became vice-president of insurance for plaintiff. Mr. Niederer\u2019s positions with Mentor included vice-president of Mentor from May 1969 to April 1974 and director and chairman of the board of directors of Mentor from April 1974 through the years at issue. As chairman of the board, Mr. Niederer received reports from Mr. Carter on the underwriting business transacted by Mr. Carter. While Mr. Carter actually determined what business to underwrite within the guidelines established by the board, Mr. Niederer maintained an active role overseeing such business. His active role stemmed from his ardent interest in Mentor\u2019s business and from his personal relationship with some of the parties acquiring insurance from Mentor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The rates charged by Mentor to plaintiff were based on the commercial rates in London. In 1974 and 1975, the rates Mentor charged to plaintiff were the London rates modified to reflect plaintiff\u2019s experience. Mentor\u2019s typical policy for plaintiff was a joint policy with an unrelated insurer that would underwrite 5 to 20 percent of the risk of plaintiff. In addition to co-insuring plaintiff\u2019s policies, Mentor reinsured a portion of plaintiff\u2019s risk. During 1974 and 1975, Mr. Carter determined what risk Mentor would accept within the guidelines established by Mentor\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Carter could decline to insure the risks of plaintiff. When a claim for loss was submitted to Mentor by plaintiff, Mentor appointed an experienced surveyor to verify the validity of the claim. This same procedure of verification was used by Mentor for claims by unrelated parties that Mentor reinsured as a lead underwriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Mentor\u2019s business entailed writing direct insurance for plaintiff and writing reinsurance for unrelated companies. Mentor\u2019s insurance of risks of plaintiff\u2019s subsidiaries consisted of two types of policies. One type of policy covered the full value of the property insured for plaintiff. The second type of policy was a first-loss policy that covered the first $1 million of a loss. Plaintiff purchased first-loss policy insurance for property that it had insured with Oil Insurance Limited (\u201cOIL\u201d) and for which there existed a $1 million deductible per occurrence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, if there was an event that caused damage to one or more ships, Mentor would be liable for the first $1 million of loss and OIL would be liable for the balance of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">With respect to business of Mentor unrelated to plaintiff for the years 1974 and 1975, respectively, the net premiums received from Highlands Insurance Company (\u201cHighlands\u201d) accounted for 57 percent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>56 percent of all net premiums received from unrelated business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mentor\u2019s ratios of incurred claims to net premiums for Highlands during 1974 and 1975 were 138.4 percent and 112.4 percent, respectively, indicating that incurred claims exceeded net premiums. The corresponding ratios for all unrelated business of Mentor were 123.4 percent and 101 percent, while those ratios for business of plaintiff were 15.1 percent for 1974 and 13.9 percent for 1975, indicating that plaintiff\u2019s net premiums exceeded its incurred claims. These underwriting statistics do not reveal whether Mentor ultimately suffered a loss from its unrelated business during 1974 and 1975, since they do not take into account money earned from investment of premiums.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) in its audit of plaintiff for tax years 1974 and 1975 determined that premiums received by Mentor from plaintiff and its consolidated United States subsidiaries amounted to self insurance. The IRS proposed for disallowance as a business expense the amount of $1,433,214.00 for 1974 and $1,744,194.00 for 1975. In addition, the IRS developed an alternative position in the event that the premiums were allowed as a deduction. The IRS determined that premiums earned from drilling rigs operating over the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico were premiums on property located in the United States. The IRS determined that such premiums not already included as income by plaintiff amounted to $1,333,617.00 for 1974 and to $1,257,876.00 for 1975. The IRS proposed that these amounts be included as income under Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) \u00a7 953 (1970), a provision requiring taxpayers to include as income premiums earned from insurance of United States risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Edward K. Dwyer testified as to the derivation and accuracy of the IRS\u2019s figures. Mr. Dwyer was employed by plaintiff from July 1973 to July 1984, initially as tax manager and subsequently as tax director. Mr. Dwyer was responsible for tax planning, complying with tax laws, handling IRS audits, working with outside and in-house tax counsel, and filing of federal income tax returns for plaintiff and its subsidiaries. Mr. Dwyer was involved in, and had the responsibility for, IRS audits of the tax returns of plaintiff and its subsidiaries for tax years 1969-1975. The tax returns were compiled from the workpa-pers of outside auditors, from the workpa-pers of earlier years, and from supplemental material obtained from plaintiff and its subsidiaries. In auditing plaintiff and its subsidiaries, the IRS examined the workpa-pers used to prepare the tax returns and scrutinized thoroughly inter-company dealings. Mr. Dwyer reviewed the assessments made by the IRS for tax years 1974 and 1975 and determined that the amounts assessed for disallowance of a business expense and for premiums earned on property located in the United States were complete and accurate representations of what the IRS purported them to be \u2014 that is, he agreed that the amounts assessed for disal-lowance were the premiums received by Mentor from plaintiff and its consolidated United States subsidiaries and that the amounts assessed for premiums earned on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>United States risks were the premiums earned from drilling rigs operating over the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico that had not been included as income by plaintiff.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">I. <em>Risk shifting and risk distributing </em>The first issue to be addressed is whether payments by plaintiff to its subsidiary insurer constitute insurance, thus qualifying as a business deduction for federal income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a) allows as a deduction from taxable income \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d Insurance premiums are considered an ordinary and necessary business expense. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-l(a) (1973). Over the last ten years, several courts have addressed the issue of whether premiums paid by a parent company to a subsidiary insurer constitute insurance. These courts based their findings on this issue on the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of insurance in <em>Helvering v. Le Gierse, </em>312 U.S. 531, 61 S.Ct. 646, 85 L.Ed. 996 (1941). In <em>Le Gierse </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cinsurance involves risk-shifting and risk-distributing____\u201d 312 U.S. at 539, 61 S.Ct. at 649. The Court in <em>Le Gierse </em>did not provide definitions for risk-shifting and risk-distributing, and consequently lower courts differ on their interpretations of these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">1. Courts also have differed on the significance of treating the parent company and the subsidiary insurer as separate entities on the question of whether payments to a subsidiary insurer constitute insurance. Under <em>Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>319 U.S. 436, 438-39, 63 S.Ct. 1132, 1133-34, 87 L.Ed. 1499 (1943), a corporation with a legitimate business purpose must be treated as \u201ca separate taxable entity.\u201d Thus, <em>Moline Properties </em>stands for the proposition that a parent corporation and its subsidiary corporation be accorded treatment as separate taxable entities. <em>National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>336 U.S. 422, 69 S.Ct. 726, 93 L.Ed. 779 (1949). The courts disagree on the role of this requirement in determining whether payments to a subsidiary insurer constitute a valid business deduction for the parent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">The focus in the case at bar differs from that of some of the earlier cases involving a parent company and its subsidiary insurer. The primary issue in this case involves the effect of business unrelated to the parent that a subsidiary insurer underwrites in determining whether a parent\u2019s payments to its subsidiary constitute insurance. The following discussion of prior case law indicates that this issue was not a central focus of any court\u2019s decision until earlier this year. However, analysis of the prior case law is helpful in understanding the development of a definition for what is meant by \u201cinsurance\u201d in tax law. The cases discussed below are not binding precedent on the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\"><em>Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, </em>640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 506, 70 L.Ed.2d 381 (1981), involved a subsidiary insurance company, incorporated in Bermuda, and wholly-owned by its parent. The subsidiary wrote insurance solely for the parent company and its subsidiaries. The parent company, Carnation Company, purchased insurance from an unrelated insurer and the subsidiary insurer then reinsured the unrelated insurer for 90 percent of Carnation\u2019s liability. As part of the agreement with the unrelated insurer, the parent company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>agreed to capitalize the subsidiary insurer for up to $3,000,000.00 at either the subsidiary\u2019s request or the parent\u2019s election.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">In assessing whether risk shifting and risk distribution took place, the Ninth Circuit looked to \u201cthe substance of the transaction.\u201d 640 F.2d at 1013. The court analyzed the insurance, reinsurance, and capitalization agreements together and determined that the agreements operated to neutralize risk in the instances of reinsurance by the subsidiary insurer. In addition, the court noted that Rev.Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 53, situation 2, stated on facts identical to those before the court that \u201cthere ... [was] no risk shifting or risk distribution with respect to the risks carried or retained by the wholly owned subsid-iary____\u201d <em>Carnation, </em>640 F.2d at 1013.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court did not attempt to define \u201cinsurance\u201d except to say that it involves risk shifting and risk distribution. Without discussing how risk is shifted or distributed, the court concluded that the agreements neutralized risk to the extent of reinsurance and that the separate corporate status of the subsidiary and parent had no bearing on whether the risk was shifted away from the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\"><em>Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, </em>774 F.2d 414 (10th Cir.1985), involved an insurance company, incorporated under state captive insurance laws. Under these laws the captive insurer could insure only risks of the parent company, its subsidiaries, its affiliates, and associated companies. The parent company, Steams-Roger Corporation, and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries owned all the stock of the captive insurer. The parent company provided initial and subsequent capital to the captive insurer and indemnified the captive insurer for up to $3,000,000.00 for losses that it might suffer. The captive company insured risks of the parent, the parent\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates, and participants in projects where the parent had assumed such participants\u2019 risks. The parent company paid for this coverage by the captive company.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The Tenth Circuit in <em>Steams-Roger </em>did not attempt to define \u201cinsurance\u201d beyond stating that it must involve risk shifting or risk distribution. The court focused on the effects of the parent\u2019s payments to the captive insurer to resolve whether the payments amounted to insurance. The court asserted that it did not ignore the separate corporate status of the captive and parent companies and that this status was not inconsistent with its findings. The court determined that the parent company\u2019s assets were diminished by any casualty loss and, thus, that the economic reality of the situation was that the risk of loss did not leave the parent company. The parent did not receive insurance for its payments, the court concluded, because the parent did not shift its risk of loss. The court noted that it did not consider the indemnity agreement in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\"><em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. United States, </em>8 Cl.Ct. 555 (1985), involved four insurance companies, owned indirectly by one company, Mobil Oil Corporation (\u201cMobil\u201d).. The loci of incorporation for the affiliate insurers included the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the United Kingdom. The affiliate insurers wrote insurance for the parent, its affiliates, and for unrelated parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">To determine if insurance existed, the Claims Court in <em>Mobil </em>analyzed whether Mobil had sufficiently transferred the risk of loss. The court assessed the economic substance of the transaction and determined that any losses or profits realized by the insurance affiliates would be reflected on Mobil\u2019s financial statements. The court concluded that this did not amount to a transfer of risk of loss by Mobil. The court stated that \u201c[ijnsurance through a wholly-owned insurance affiliate is essentially the same as setting up reserve accounts. The risk of loss remains with the parent and is reflected on the balance sheet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>and income statements of the parent____\u201d 8 Cl.Ct. at 567. The court determined that its holding did not disregard the separate status of parent and affiliate insurer, but, rather, was \u201can example of reclassification of a transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court did not address the issue of what impact the writing of unrelated business by the affiliate insurer might have on the determination of whether the payments by Mobil amounted to insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. v. United States, </em>797 F.2d 920 (10th Cir.1986), the insurance company was incorporated in Bermuda and was primarily owned by Beech Aircraft Corporation (\u201cBeech Aircraft\u201d) and its affiliates. All but 0.5 percent of the insurer\u2019s business was insurance issued Beech Aircraft. The premium paid by Beech Aircraft supplemented by the interest the premium would earn equaled the liability of the insurer to Beech Aircraft. The Tenth Circuit stated that <em>Stearns-Roger </em>\u201cbears directly on\u201d and \u201cfor all practical purposes, is dispositive of\u201d the case before the court. 797 F.2d at 923. The court in <em>Beech Aircraft </em>assessed the economic reality of the transaction and determined that Beech Aircraft paid for any losses sustained by the insurer and that no shifting of risk occurred. The court held that the separate corporate status of Beech Aircraft and the insurer did not prevent a finding that risk of loss did not shift. The court did not discuss any effects of unrelated business.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\"><em>Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, </em>811 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir.1987), involved a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Colorado under state captive insurance laws. The parent company, Clougherty Packing Company (\u201cClougherty\u201d), purchased insurance from an unrelated insurer which then reinsured the first $100,000.00 of each claim against Clougherty with the subsidiary insurer. The subsidiary insurer\u2019s only business was reinsurance of the parent company. The Ninth Circuit in <em>Clougherty </em>defined \u201cinsurance\u201d as involving risk shifting and risk distributing. The court stated that \u201c[i]f the insured has shifted its risk to the insurer, then a loss by or a claim against the insured does not affect it because the loss is offset by the proceeds of an insurance payment____\u201d 811 F.2d at 1300. With respect to risk distributing, the court stated that \u201c[i]nsuring many independent risks in return for numerous premiums serves to distribute risk____\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that risk shifting did not take place and, therefore, did not address the issue of risk distributing.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">According to the Ninth Circuit, the insurance and reinsurance contracts were interdependent; interdependent agreements must be considered together to determine their economic effect. The court examined the assets of the insured party, not the insurer\u2019s assets or \u201csome aggregation of the two,\u201d to see if the risk of adverse economic consequences was divested from the insured by the agreements. 811 F.2d at 1305. Because the insurer\u2019s \u201cincome and net worth f[e]ll dollar for dollar by the amount of the loss\u201d claimed by the parent and because the insurer did no business other than the parent\u2019s, the stock of the insurer declined by the amount of the claim. <em>Id. </em>The court maintained that, consequently, the assets of the insured fell by the amount of the claim: The insured was the owner of the insurer\u2019s assets and the reduction in value of the insured\u2019s assets was the same as it would have been if the parent had self-insured. Thus, the court concluded that risk of loss did not shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">The court stated that its holding did not conflict with <em>Moline Properties </em>since only the assets of the insured were analyzed to determine if risk shifted. The Ninth Circuit reiterated its holding in <em>Carnation, </em>that Rev.Rul. 77-316 does not conflict with <em>Moline Properties. </em>The court pointed out that other courts had addressed the captive insurer issue and none had determined that \u201ca policy provided by a wholly-owned subsidiary that exists solely for the purpose of providing insurance to its parent constitutes insurance, or that such a conclusion violates <em>Moline Properties.\u201d </em>811 F.2d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\"><em>Humana Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>881 F.2d 247 (6th Cir.1989), involved an insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>anee company incorporated in Colorado under state captive insurance laws. The insurer provided coverage for the parent company and its subsidiaries. The parent company, Humana Incorporated (\u201cHuma-na\u201d), purchased insurance for itself and its subsidiaries from the captive insurer and then charged its subsidiaries for their share of coverage. Humana owned 75 percent of the insurer, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana owned 25 percent of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The Sixth Circuit, relying on <em>Le Gierse, </em>stated that an insurance contract involves risk shifting and risk distribution: \u201cRisk shifting involves the shifting of an identifiable risk of the insured to the insurer____ Risk distribution involves shifting to a group of individuals the identified risk of the insured____\u201d 881 F.2d at 251. The court then separately analyzed the premiums paid by the parent and the premiums paid by the subsidiaries. It concluded that the rationale of <em>Clougherty </em>and <em>Carnation </em>applied to the parent\u2019s premiums and, consequently, that these premiums did not constitute insurance. With respect to the premiums paid by the subsidiaries, the court determined that <em>Moline Properties </em>required that the separate corporate status of the subsidiaries and the insurer be maintained. Adopting the analysis in <em>Clougherty, </em>the Sixth Circuit examined the effect of a claim on the assets of the insured. The court considered the insured to be the subsidiaries and not the parent under <em>Moline Properties. </em>When the insurer paid a claim, the assets of the subsidiaries were not affected and, thus, the risk of loss transferred from the insured to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The court stated that it did not look to the assets of the parent because to do so would be to treat the parent, its subsidiaries, and the insurer \u201cas one \u2018economic unit\u2019 and ignore the reality of their separate corporate existence for tax purposes in violation of <em>Moline Properties.\u201d </em>881 F.2d at 256. The court noted that \u201cabsent specific congressional intent to the contrary, ... a court cannot disregard a transaction in the name of economic reality and substance over form absent a finding of sham or lack of business purpose under the relevant tax statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">After determining that risk shifting occurred, the court stated that risk distribution must also be present for insurance to exist. The court concluded that risk distribution was present since several corporations were insured and losses could be spread among them. Thus, the court ruled that the premiums paid by the subsidiaries of Humana constituted insurance because both risk shifting and risk distribution occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\"><em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>914 F.2d 396 (3d Cir.1990), an appeal from the United States Tax Court, involved a subsidiary insurer incorporated in Bermuda. The insurer was undercapitalized until 1975 when the parent company, Gulf Oil Corporation (\u201cGulf\u201d), transferred ownership of the insurer to Gulf\u2019s wholly-owned holding company, which provided additional capital to the insurer. Gulf and its affiliates paid premiums to third-party commercial carriers. These carriers then reinsured a significant portion of their liability to Gulf and its affiliates with the subsidiary insurer. Gulf executed guarantees to the third-party commercial carriers obligating Gulf to indemnify them should the subsidiary insurer be unable to meet its obligations to them. All of the subsidiary\u2019s premium income came from related parties except for 2 percent in one of the two tax years involved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">The Third Circuit discussed the necessity of risk shifting and risk distribution for insurance to exist and noted that interdependent agreements must be considered together. The court determined that the un-dercapitalization of the insurer and the guarantees executed by the parent indicated that risk did not shift. The court viewed <em>Humana </em>as distinguishable on the basis that <em>Humana </em>did not involve an un-dercapitalized insurer or guarantees executed by the parent company.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">The court noted that the Tax Court in prior decisions held that risk does not transfer in circumstances where a wholly-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>owned subsidiary does not insure parties unrelated to the parent company. In the present ease, the Tax Court was divided over the effects of unrelated business on risk shifting. The appeals court stated that it need not reach this issue since it was clear that \u201cbecause of the guarantee to the primary insurers, Gulf and Insco [the subsidiary insurer] did not truly transfer the risk, nor was there a de facto risk distribution to third parties, elements crucial to the allowance of a premium deduction.\u201d 914 F.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Subsequent to <em>Gulf the </em>Tax Court established a three-step analysis to determine if insurance existed in cases wherein the subsidiary insurer did business for parties unrelated to the parent and its affiliates. These cases are <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, </em>96 T.C. 61, 1991 WL 4979 (1991), <em>as modified, </em>96 T.C. 671, 1991 WL 61250 (1991); <em>The Harper Group v. Commissioner, </em>96 T.C. 45, 1991 WL 4980 (1991); and <em>AMERCO v. Commissioner, </em>96 T.C. 18, 1991 WL 4981 (1991). The Tax Court analysis, based on <em>Le Gierse, </em>involves \u201cpresence of insurance risk,\u201d \u201crisk shifting and risk distributing,\u201d and \u201ccommonly accepted notions of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">With respect to \u201cpresence of insurance risk\u201d the Tax Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akt-dedup-0\">Basic to any insurance transaction must be risk. An insured faces some hazard; an insurer accepts a premium and agrees to perform some act if or when the loss event occurs. If no risk exists, then insurance cannot be present. \u201cInsurance risk\u201d is required; investment risk is insufficient. If parties structure an apparent insurance transaction so as to effectively eliminate the effect of insurance risk therein, insurance cannot be present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0n\"><em>AMERCO, </em>96 T.C. at 38-39. With respect to \u201crisk shifting and risk distributing,\u201d the Tax Court stated that while <em>Le Gierse </em>established that insurance requires risk shifting and risk distributing, <em>Le Gierse </em>did not define these terms. The Tax Court relied on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Beech Aircraft </em>for the following definition: \u201c \u2018Risk-shifting\u2019 means one party shifts his risk of loss to another, and \u2018risk-distributing\u2019 means that the party assuming the risk distributes his potential liability, in part, among others.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>96 T.C. at 58-59, and <em>AMERCO, </em>96 T.C. at 40 (quoting <em>Beech Aircraft, </em>797 F.2d at 922). With respect to the third requirement of \u201ccommonly accepted notions of insurance,\u201d the Tax Court did not discuss how to apply the requirement. The court dealt with this requirement by applying the facts of each case to determine if insurance existed in a commonly understood manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\"><em>Sears </em>involved a wholly-owned subsidiary insurer of Sears, Roebuck and Co. (\u201cSears\u201d). The subsidiary insurer, Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d), was licensed in 40 states. While the subsidiary insured 10-15 percent of the parent company\u2019s risk, the premiums received from this business only amounted to 0.25 percent of the premiums earned by the subsidiary insurer for the years in issue. The other 99.75 percent of the subsidiary\u2019s premiums were received from policyholders unrelated to the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The Tax Court, employing its three-step analysis, concluded that payments by Sears to the subsidiary constituted insurance. The court found that the claims involved\u2014 claims relating to injuries to persons on the parent\u2019s premises or by the parent\u2019s vehicles \u2014 established the presence of insurance risk. Risk shifting existed in both form and substance: in form because insurance contracts were written; premiums were transferred; losses were paid; and the subsidiary insurer was a separate, viable entity financially capable of meeting its obligations \u2014 in substance because the insurer\u2019s business relationship with its parent was the same as its business relationship with unrelated insured parties. The scope of the subsidiary\u2019s business demonstrated the presence of risk distribution. Finally, the court determined insurance to be present, in the commonly accepted sense, based on the arrangements between the parent and subsidiary being understood as insurance for non-tax purposes and there being no justification to look at such arrangements differently for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number><em>Harper </em>involved a subsidiary insurer incorporated in Hong Kong. The parent company, The Harper Group (\u201cHarper\u201d), was a holding company that owned several subsidiaries. The subsidiary insurer shared facilities and employees with another subsidiary of the parent. The subsidiary insurer provided insurance to the parent\u2019s domestic and foreign subsidiaries and to customers of two of the parent\u2019s subsidiaries. The customers were parties unrelated to the parent, and the premiums received from these unrelated parties approximated 30 percent of the subsidiary\u2019s premiums for the years in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The Tax Court in <em>Harper </em>concluded through its three-step analysis that premiums received by the subsidiary insurer from related parties constituted insurance. The court determined insurance risk to exist, stating that the transfer of risk to the insurer and the exposure of the insurer were \u201creal, not illusory.\u201d 96 T.C. at 58. The court found risk shifting to exist based on the following facts: Insurance contracts were written; premiums were paid; claims were paid; related parties\u2019 premiums were negotiated at arm\u2019s length; and the subsidiary insurer was a separate entity, regulated under the laws of Hong Kong and financially capable of meeting its obligations. The court considered that risk distribution existed, finding that unrelated business approximating 30 percent was sufficient to provide risk distribution. Finally, the court determined insurance to exist in the commonly accepted sense, listing as relevant factors the following: The subsidiary insurer was organized and operated as an insurance company and was regulated by Hong Kong insurance law, the insurer\u2019s capitalization was adequate, premiums were negotiated at arm\u2019s length, and the policies issued by the insurer were valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>AMERCO </em>involved a subsidiary insurer incorporated in Arizona. The parent Company, AMERCO, was a holding company with one to three employees during the years at issue. AMERCO filed consolidated tax returns with approximately 250 of its subsidiaries. These subsidiaries were a primary component of the U-Haul rental system. The subsidiary insurer was not included in AMERCO\u2019s consolidated returns. The subsidiary insurer had gross written premiums attributable to parties unrelated to the parent in the range of 52 to 74 percent during the seven years at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The Tax Court concluded that the premiums paid by parties related to AMERCO constituted insurance. The court determined that risk existed, stating that the insured parties faced potential hazards. The court found there to be technical risk shifting and risk shifting in substance: technical because insurance contracts were written; premiums were paid; claims were paid; and the insurer was a separate, viable entity, financially capable of meeting its obligations, licensed and operating under many states\u2019 insurance laws \u2014 in substance because of the substantial business the insurer wrote for parties other than AMER-CO. Risk distribution was present based on the diverse, multifaceted, and substantial unrelated business of the insurer. Finally, the court found that insurance existed in the commonly accepted sense, emphasizing the technical and substantive nature of the transactions and the state regulators\u2019 view of such transactions as insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">2. The case law demonstrates the different issues that have been presented to courts on the overriding question of whether payments by a parent to a subsidiary insurer constitute insurance. A consensus on a precise definition of insurance does not emerge from these opinions. At trial plaintiff presented an expert witness to define \u201cinsurance.\u201d Defendant did not tender such a witness. Dr. Neil A. Doherty testified for plaintiff as an expert on the economics of insurance. Dr. Doherty is a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he primarily teaches classes on insurance and risk management. He has written several books and numerous articles for academic journals on the topic of insurance. Dr. Doherty testified as an expert witness in the trilogy of Tax Court cases discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Dr. Doherty described insurance as \u201can institution whereby a number of individuals or firms transfer their premiums and their exposures to loss to a common fund, and the common fund is then available to pay for the losses of whoever might suffer them.\u201d He stated that the risk dimension that is being transferred is the unpredictability or variability of loss and not the expected loss or long run average cost.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the statistical principle of the law of large numbers, risk or variability is reduced by increasing the number of policies in a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Dr. Doherty asserted that when the only business of a captive insurer is that of insuring its parent, the risk for the parent is the same as it would be if the parent had self-insured by setting aside funds to cover possible losses. In neither case is risk reduced for the parent; the two scenarios therefore did not conform to Dr. Doherty\u2019s definition of insurance. He then demonstrated that when a captive insurer underwrites insurance for both its parent and unrelated parties, risk is lower for the parent than it would be if the parent was self-insured. Under the axiom of the law of large numbers, risk is reduced when the number of policyholders is increased by the captive insurer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In his analysis Dr. Doherty distinguished between ownership risk and policyholder risk. He described the latter as the risk the parent transferred to the subsidiary. Ownership risk, he asserted, is the investment risk or the level of risk that exists after combining all the policies written by the insurer. Dr. Doherty illustrated that the policyholder risk and the ownership risk would be the same only if an insurer did not write any unrelated business. He demonstrated how the ownership risk is reduced the greater the amount of unrelated business that is written by the insurer. Dr. Doherty described the owner as the one that takes the equity interest in the profit or loss of the pool after the insurance function of the arrangement is completed. He stated that the capital of the company serves as a second line of defense to cover losses if premiums are not sufficient to pay out claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">It was Dr. Doherty\u2019s expert opinion that the premiums paid by plaintiff and its subsidiaries to Mentor constituted insurance. He stated that the percentage of unrelated business by Mentor was economically significant in terms of risk reduction. He determined that unrelated business was approximately 44 percent of Mentor\u2019s business for 1974 and 66 percent for 1975. According to the witness, the risk reduction created by this unrelated business was sufficient to qualify the premiums paid to Mentor by plaintiff and its subsidiaries as insurance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">This court must adhere to the principles of <em>Le Gierse </em>and <em>Moline Properties </em>in reaching a decision. Plaintiff and Mentor must be considered as separate entities in evaluating whether the transactions between the two companies resulted in risk shifting and risk distributing. However, if the business operations of Mentor are a sham, Mentor\u2019s \u201ccorporate form may be disregarded.\u201d <em>Moline Properties, </em>319 U.S. at 439, 63 S.Ct. at 1134. Furthermore, even if plaintiff and Mentor are separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>entities, if plaintiff retained the risk of the losses against which it insured, plaintiffs premiums amounted to a reserve for losses, and plaintiff would not be entitled to deduct such premiums from taxable income. <em>Beech Aircraft, </em>797 F.2d at 922 (citing <em>United States v. Newton Livestock Auction Market, Inc., </em>336 F.2d 673, 676 (10th Cir.1964), and <em>Spring Canyon Coal Co. v. Commissioner, </em>43 F.2d 78, 79 (10th Cir.1930), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>284 U.S. 654, 52 S.Ct. 33, 76 L.Ed. 555 (1931)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">3. The court turns first to the issue of whether the separate status of Mentor was a sham. Defendant attempted at trial to establish that Mentor\u2019s operations were controlled by plaintiff and that Mentor\u2019s existence was therefore a sham. Defendant was unsuccessful in this endeavor and in post-trial closing argument abandoned the contention that Mentor was a sham. Nevertheless, the court believes it useful to elaborate on the facts that demonstrate Mentor\u2019s valid business existence. These facts establish two of the three factors found by the Tax Court to illustrate the existence of insurance: \u201cpresence of insurance risk\u201d and \u201ccommonly accepted notions of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Several factors contribute to recognizing Mentor as a valid insurance company. The parties that insured with Mentor, both plaintiff and unrelated parties, truly faced hazards. Events such as hurricanes and accidents were real possibilities and could result in losses to the insured parties. The business underwritten by Mentor was understood to be insurance provided by Mentor. Insurance contracts were written and premiums were paid. Unrelated parties purchased reinsurance from Mentor. Unrelated parties co-insured a portion of the direct insurance Mentor wrote for plaintiff. Unrelated parties reinsured policies that Mentor wrote for plaintiff. Premiums charged to plaintiff and unrelated parties were based on the commercial rates in London. The validity of claims was established before payments were made on them. Claims were paid from funds of Mentor that were maintained separately from plaintiff\u2019s funds. Mentor\u2019s capitalization was adequate, and the policies it entered into were valid and binding. Mentor\u2019s business operations were separate from plaintiff\u2019s.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Cumulatively, these facts indicate that Mentor\u2019s existence as an insurance company was valid and not a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Having established Mentor was not a sham, the next question to be addressed is whether plaintiff shifted its risk to Mentor through its arrangements with Mentor. In order to determine if risk is shifted, it is necessary to identify the risk that is shifted in the insurance context. The case law previously discussed does not delve into the connotation given to risk by the various courts. The Tax Court asserts that insurance risk must be present, but does not define the risk that parties insure against. The Tax Court\u2019s assertion that there must be the chance of an event occurring that will cause a loss to the insured party addresses the issue of whether the business is a sham rather than the definition of risk. The other courts use terms such as \u201crisk of loss\u201d or \u201crisk of adverse economic consequences,\u201d without elaborating on their meaning. Thus, the prior case law does not provide a definitive answer to the question of the risk that is shifted by insured parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The court found Dr. Doherty\u2019s testimony helpful on this point. Dr. Doherty explained how insurance operates and clarified what the risk element is that insurance premiums guard against. Insurance protects against the variability of loss. An insured party pays a premium that is expected to cover the average loss. Therefore, the insured party does not transfer the cost of the average loss, since the insured party pays that amount to the insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>er. What the insured party transfers to the insurer when it pays premiums is the cost of variability in losses. The risk that the insured transfers to the insurer is the variability of loss, not the complete loss from an event, such as a hurricane or an accident, since the insured pays a premium that covers the average cost of the complete loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Plaintiff paid premiums to Mentor, and Mentor thereby became liable for claims of loss on the insured property. When plaintiff experienced a loss, a claim was filed with Mentor and Mentor paid the claim out of its own funds, funds that were separate from plaintiffs funds. However, because Mentor was a subsidiary of plaintiff, any expense of Mentor, such as payment of a claim, would reduce the assets of plaintiff. If this court were to rely on <em>Stearns-Roger </em>or <em>Mobil, </em>this fact alone would be sufficient to find that risk did not transfer from plaintiff to Mentor. Both <em>Stearns-Roger </em>and <em>Mobil </em>concluded that risk did not transfer from parent to subsidiary because the parents\u2019 assets were diminished by casualty losses when the subsidiary paid off a claim on the loss.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court does not consider these decisions to offer the correct approach to the present case. To follow <em>Stearns-Roger </em>or <em>Mobil </em>would be to ignore the effect that unrelated business underwritten by Mentor has on the level of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Unrelated business operated to reduce the amount of risk to which plaintiff was exposed. When plaintiff purchased insurance from Mentor, plaintiff transferred to Mentor a certain level of risk or a certain amount of variability of loss. Because Mentor had unrelated business, this level of risk was not retained by plaintiff, the parent of Mentor. The considerable amount of unrelated business, approximately 44 and 66 percent during the years in issue, caused a significant reduction in risk. Plaintiff as the parent of Mentor thus shouldered a level of risk significantly lower than the level of risk that it initially transferred to Mentor. Consequently, the risk transferred to Mentor and the risk ultimately borne by plaintiff were not the same, and plaintiff\u2019s premiums constituted the transfer of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">If the level of risk plaintiff initially had transferred and the level of risk plaintiff ultimately had shouldered were virtually the same, plaintiff\u2019s risk effectively would not have transferred. However, this situation is not present in the case at bar, and plaintiff\u2019s payment of premiums to Mentor did amount to a transfer of risk. The court does not address the question of what amount of unrelated business is necessary to result in transfer of risk. The court notes that the Tax Court found transfer of risk in situations where unrelated business was 30, 52 to 74, and 99 percent. The percentage of unrelated business present here, 44 and 66 percent, is within the range of unrelated business found by the Tax Court\u2019s decisions to constitute transfer of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Unlike this court\u2019s analysis, the Tax Court\u2019s discussions of risk transfer did not focus solely on the amount of unrelated business. The Tax Court\u2019s decisions concluded that risk shifting occurred based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>some of the following factors: Insurance contracts were written; premiums were paid; claims were paid; the insurer operated as a separate, viable entity, financially capable of meeting its obligations; the insurer wrote substantial unrelated business; and the insurer was regulated under insurance laws. The only factor in this list not established at trial was that Mentor was regulated under insurance laws.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court does not find that the absence of this factor negates the existence of insurance. Although during the years at issue, the Bermuda law under which Mentor was regulated was general corporation law, rather than specifically insurance law, Mentor effectively was regulated by the insurance industry itself.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Unrelated parties would reinsure and co-insure with Mentor only if they viewed Mentor as financially sound, since they would be liable if Mentor was unable to meet its obligations. Thus, Mentor was required to maintain financial stability if it desired to undertake business with unrelated parties. Mr. Carter\u2019s testimony on this point was unimpeachable. The significant amount of unrelated business underwritten by Mentor during the years in issue illustrates Mentor\u2019s success in meeting the industry\u2019s standards of a viable business. Because the factors that led the Tax Court to conclude that risk shifting occurred in its decisions are also present in this case, the court finds risk shifting to be present under the Tax Court\u2019s analysis, in addition to being present under this court\u2019s own analysis.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"acc-dedup-0\">Since risk shifting was present, the next question to be addressed is whether risk distribution occurred. Risk distribution involves spreading the risk of loss among policyholders. Mentor had unrelated business of approximately 44 and 66 percent for the two years at issue. This amount of unrelated business sufficiently spreads risk so as to constitute risk distribution. The court notes that the Tax Court found risk distribution to exist in <em>Harper </em>where unrelated business approximated only 30 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Since risk shifting and risk distributing were present, the court finds that insurance exists as outlined in <em>Le Gierse. </em>Thus, the payments by plaintiff to Mentor constituted insurance and were allowed to be deducted from taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">4. Other arguments raised by defendant were considered and found to be without merit. Defendant\u2019s argument regarding the inconsistency of <em>Humana </em>with Federal Circuit law is deemed irrelevant to this decision because this court does not rely on <em>Humana. </em>Nevertheless, the court notes that it does not agree with defendant\u2019s assertion that plaintiff and the subsidiaries with which it filed a consolidated return must be treated as a single entity under <em>Exxon Corp. v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 277 (Fed.Cir.1986), despite <em>Moline Properties. Exxon, </em>in stating that those who file a consolidated return must be treated as a single entity, quotes <em>American Standard, Inc. v. United States, </em>220 Ct.Cl. 411, 602 F.2d 256 (1979). 785 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>280. <em>American Standard </em>specifically states with respect to the proposition quoted in <em>Exxon, </em>\u201cThe single entity framework does not mean that all items of income, deductions, and credit for the affiliated corporations are combined into single accounts as if the corporations were one. The consolidated return regulations, in fact, primarily deal with the affiliated corporations as separate corporate entities____\u201d <em>American Standard, </em>220 Ct.Cl. at 418, 602 F.2d at 261. Thus, <em>American Standard </em>and <em>Exxon </em>do not require disregarding the separate status of affiliated entities and do not conflict with <em>Moline Properties. </em>Furthermore, to the extent they might, <em>Moline Properties </em>as a Supreme Court decision would override such contrary decisions by lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">This court also views as without merit defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff\u2019s payments to Mentor are not deductible under <em>Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>403 U.S. 345, 91 S.Ct. 1893, 29 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971), based on their serving to create or enhance a separate asset for plaintiff. The funds in <em>Lincoln Savings </em>that were determined to constitute an asset are clearly distinguishable from the premiums paid by plaintiff. In <em>Lincoln Savings </em>the funds that were determined to be an asset were a \u201cprepayment with respect to future premiums,\u201d 403 U.S. at 348, 91 S.Ct. at 1896; if such funds were converted to actual premiums or \u201cused to pay losses,\u201d the funds became deductible. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 91 S.Ct. at 1900. In the present case the payments by plaintiff were actual premiums, not prepayments of future premiums. Furthermore, the insured parties in <em>Lincoln Savings </em>had a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the funds constituting future premiums, earned a return on the funds, and in certain situations could receive funds back. <em>Id. </em>at 355, 91 S.Ct. at 1899. Plaintiff\u2019s payments were placed into a pool of funds used to pay claims of the insurer, and plaintiff did not maintain a property interest in these payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">II. <em>Insurance of United States risks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">The second issue to be addressed is whether the court\u2019s determination that plaintiff\u2019s premiums to Mentor constituted insurance results in plaintiff\u2019s owing taxes because the premiums received by plaintiff\u2019s subsidiary, Mentor, were for insurance of property located in the United States.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Under I.R.C. \u00a7 951 a United States shareholder must include in gross income his pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation\u2019s subpart F income. I.R.C. \u00a7 952(a)(1) includes as subpart F income \u201cthe income derived from the insurance of United States risks (as determined under section 953).\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 953(a) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-14\">(a) General rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-15\">For purposes of section 952(a)(1), the term \u201cincome derived from the insurance of United States risks\u201d means that income which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-16\">(1) is attributable to the reinsurance or the issuing of any insurance or annuity contract\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-17\">(A) in connection with property in, or liability arising out of activity in, or in connection with the lives or health of residents of, the United States____[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">Under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 951-953, if the premiums paid by plaintiff to Mentor were for insurance of property located in the United States or for liability arising out of activity in the United States, these premiums should have been included in plaintiff\u2019s gross income for the years in which the payments were received by Mentor. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>insured property at issue was located over the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Plaintiff and defendant disagree as to whether the Outer Continental Shelf is a part of the United States for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 953(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">I.R.C. \u00a7 7701 sets forth general definitions for the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7701(a)(9) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">(a) When used in this title, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-6\">(9) United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">The term \u201cUnited States\u201d when used in a geographical sense includes only the States and the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-1\">The regulations for section 953 provide, in pertinent part: \u201cFor purposes of section 953(a), the term \u2018United States\u2019 is used in a geographical sense and includes only the States and the District of Columbia____\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.953-2 (1964). Thus, section 7701(a)(9) and the regulation applicable to section 953 do not include the Outer Continental Shelf as a part of the United States. If the- court were to rely solely on section 953, its applicable regulation, and section 7701, the court would conclude that plaintiff\u2019s payments were not insurance of United States risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Defendant contends that the court must look beyond section 953 and its pertinent regulation to I.R.C. \u00a7 638 and its regulations. Section 638 was enacted in 1969 and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-11\">Continental shelf areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-12\">For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter (including sections 861(a)(3) and 862(a)(3) in the case of the performance of personal services) with respect to mines, oil and gas wells, and other natural deposits\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-13\">(1) the term \u201cUnited States\u201d when used in a geographical sense includes the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of the United States and over which the United States has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Defendant argues that I.R.C. \u00a7 638 operates to include the Outer Continental Shelf as a part of the United States for purposes of section 953. According to defendant, reference to \u201cthis chapter\u201d in section 638 is a reference to Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, encompassing I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1399, and the language \u201cwith respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources\u201d in section 638 refers to any activity relating to exploration and exploitation, including insurance of mobil drilling rigs. In support of its position that section 638 is intended to apply to insurance activities, defendant cites an example in the Treasury Regulations for section 638 that indicates insurance income from a platform attached to the Outer Continental Shelf \u201cis income derived from the insurance of United States risks, within the meaning of section 953(a)(1)(A).\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.638-l(f) (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">Plaintiff responds that I.R.C. \u00a7 638 operates to include the Outer Continental Shelf as a part of the United States only when the activity involved is the actual exploration and exploitation of natural resources or the personal services performed on mines, oil and gas wells, and other natural deposits. Plaintiff asserts that the language of section 638 clearly reinforces its contention and, furthermore, that the legislative history of section 638 illustrates that the intention of Congress through enactment of section 638 was to determine the source of income from actual mining activities. The report of the Senate Committee on Finance states with respect to enactment of section 638:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-17\">Present law. \u2014 Present law is not explicit as to <em>whether for purposes of the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources </em>in the continental shelf area of a country over which the country exercises tax jurisdiction under the principles of international law, that area is considered for U.S. tax purposes as a part of the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-18\">General reasons for change. \u2014 The development of natural resources in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>continental shelf areas of the world makes the status of these areas for tax purposes of increasing importance. This status is important, for example, in determining the <em>source of income from mining activities </em>conducted in continental shelf areas____ Accordingly, the committee believes it appropriate to clarify the status of continental shelf areas with regard to the application of the income tax provisions of the code to <em>natural resource activity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-6\">Explanation of provision. \u2014 ...

United States, </em>231 Ct.Cl. 457, 463, 687 F.2d 371, 376 (1982) (quoting <em>Gould v. Gould, </em>245 U.S. 151,153, 38 S.Ct. 53, 53, 62 L.Ed. 211 (1917) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">The court carefully examined the above statutes and regulations to determine the applicability of I.R.C. \u00a7 638 to \u00a7 953. The court concludes that rules of statutory interpretation support a construction that section 638 does not affect section 953. First, the specific references in the legislative history to \u201cpurposes of the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources,\u201d \u201csource of income from mining activities,\u201d \u201cnatural resource activity,\u201d and \u201cpersonal services performed\u201d are references to mining activities and to personal services performed at mining sites, not to insurance activities. Second, it is unlikely that the statutory language \u201cthis chapter\u201d is intended to be so broad as to include any type of activity that relates to mining in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1399. Persuasive to this end is the fact that the statute specifically states that \u201cthis chapter\u201d includes \u201cthe performance of personal services.\u201d This reference would not have been necessary were section 638 to apply to all activities that have any relationship to mining in Chapter 1, since the performance of personal services is a part of Chapter 1. Third, because insurance activity is more remote to mining activity than personal service activity conducted at the site of exploration, it seems likely that if Congress had intended for section 638 to apply to insurance activity, Congress would have made specific reference to that activity since Congress made specific reference to personal service activity. Fourth, I.R.C. \u00a7 953, and not section 638, explicitly relates to insurance activity. Moreover, the accompanying regulation to section 953, even after amendment in 1980, maintained that the United States includes only the States and the District of Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>bia.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Fifth, the sections of the Internal Revenue Code that precede section 638, I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 611-636, are related to actual mining activities, not to insurance activities. Finally, if there is a doubt as to the meaning of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the doubt \u201cmust be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Citizens Nat\u2019l Bank of Waco v. United States, </em>213 Ct.Cl. 236, 255, 551 F.2d 832, 843 (1977) (citing <em>Porter v. Commissioner, </em>288 U.S. 436, 442, 53 S.Ct. 451, 453, 77 L.Ed. 880 (1933), and <em>United States v. Merriam, </em>263 U.S. 179, 188, 44 S.Ct. 69, 71, 68 L.Ed. 240 (1923)). Thus, if a doubt exists as to the applicability of section 638 to insurance activities, it must be resolved against the IRS position in order to favor plaintiff taxpayer. Although the court does not consider this last factor determinative, the foregoing factors, cumulatively, fully support the conclusion that I.R.C. \u00a7 638 is not applicable to section 953. The premiums paid to Mentor by plaintiff were not for insurance of United States risks since the insured property was located over the Outer Continental Shelf which is not a part of the United States for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 953.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Based on the foregoing, plaintiff has established its entitlement to a refund of federal corporate income taxes.

Mentor purchased Enterprise Insurance (\"Enterprise\u201d) on January 1, 1975, for $1,375,000.00 and thereby assumed the insurance obligations of Enterprise. Prior to acquiring Enterprise, Mentor acted as an agent for Enterprise. Its activities as agent entailed underwriting risks for Enterprise and then ceding the risks to Enterprise by way of reinsurance. Enterprise had been a subsidiary of Murphy, a 51.8-percent owner of plaintiff, but had not underwritten risk for Murphy. Thus, the purchase of Enterprise by Mentor did not increase the amount of related business Mentor was insuring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">. Francis James Carter, the underwriter for Mentor during 1974 and 1975, testified that the capitalization of Mentor was sufficient to cover potential losses of insured companies. He stated that it was normal in the insurance business for net earned premiums to be as much as two and one-half times greater than the amount of capital surplus and that Mentor's ratio of net earned premiums to capital surplus of less than one to one was very conservative. Mr. Carter concluded that Mentor\u2019s conservative ratio, combined with the fact that Mentor\u2019s capital surplus was considerably greater than its reserve losses, indicated that Mentor was sufficiently capitalized to pay off any claims. The court concurs with the assessment of Mr. Carter that Mentor was adequately capitalized in 1974 and 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"alq-dedup-0\">. The deposition of Mr. Gwinnell, now deceased, was taken on August 1, 1978, in a previous action between the parties.

Defendant in its post-trial brief stated that Mentor\u2019s \u201cmain\u201d bank account was located in the Whitney National Bank, New Orleans, Louisiana. This was not established at trial. Mr. Vaughan \u201cthought\u201d that premiums were received by Mentor at the Whitney account in New Orleans, which he believed to be the main account. However, Mr. Carter definitively testified that Mentor collected premiums in Bermuda. Because it was established at trial that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>Mentor\u2019s funds were not commingled with plaintiffs funds, the court does not deem essential to its decision the determination of the location of either the collection of premiums or the main account of Mentor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. Defendant\u2019s assertion in its post-trial brief that Mentor loaned money to plaintiff is unfounded. The evidence that defendant offers as proof of its assertion does not indicate that Mentor loaned money to plaintiff. Plaintiffs accounts receivables noted that Mentor Insurance Company (U.K.) Limited, owned 70 percent by Mentor and 30 percent by plaintiff, owed plaintiff $34,095.05 at the start of both 1975 and 1976 and that plaintiff owed Mentor approximately $36,000.00 at the beginning of 1976. The accounts receivable documents did not specify the items represented by these amounts. This is not proof that Mentor loaned funds to plaintiff. The court finds credible the testimony of Messrs. Roberson, Carter, and Vaughan that Mentor to their knowledge did not loan money to plaintiff. Because the court believes these principal employees of Mentor and plaintiff would have known if Mentor had loaned funds to plaintiff, the court finds that no loans were made to plaintiff by Mentor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. Ben ODECO was a joint venture between ODE-CO and Ben Line Streamers. Ben ODECO owned and operated drilling barges and purchased insurance through Ben Line Streamers and through ODECO via Marsh &amp; McLennan. Mentor\u2019s arrangement with Marsh &amp; McLennan resulted in Mentor\u2019s insuring a small portion of the risk of Ben ODECO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b925-10\">. Defendant in its post-trial brief stated that Mentor was required to insure risks of North American Reinsurance Company (\"North American\") as part of an agreement between plaintiff and North American. This fact was not established at trial. Mr. Carter testified that Mentor\u2019s business relationship with North American was one of reciprocity or goodwill trading and that he believed this business represented only two out of hundreds of treaties written by Mentor. Such evidence is not sufficient to validate defendant\u2019s implication that plaintiff determined what business Mentor would write. In actuality, this implication was specifically negated at trial by the testimony of Mr. Carter that he determined whether to underwrite the risks of North American.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b925-15\">. Mentor\u2019s submission of its budget to plaintiffs board of directors for approval was a part of an aggregate budget submitted by plaintiff and its subsidiaries to the board for approval. In addition to the budget process, plaintiff had an authorization for expenditure (\"AFE\u201d) process that applied primarily to its contract drilling and oil and gas operations. Under this process expenditures, depending on the amount, had to be approved by a manager, the president, or the board. Thus, when Mentor paid off on a claim, the subsidiaries of plaintiff insured by Mentor had to go through the AFE process before spending the money received from Mentor.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">With respect to the payment of large claims, plaintiffs approval was required only in instances where Mentor had approved a payment that could severely drain the premium loss account. If Mentor did not approve payment of a claim, Mentor\u2019s decision was not subject to review by plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">. Mr. Niederer is now deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. Defendant stated in its post-trial brief that Mr. Niederer had final authority to determine which policies to accept. Evidence to support this contention was not forthcoming at trial. The testimony of Messrs. Roberson and Carter established that Mr. Carter made the underwriting decisions for Mentor and that Mr. Niederer\u2019s role merely was one of oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b926-13\">. OIL, a Bermuda insurance company, was created by several major oil corporations.

When William Nolan, a senior vice-president of Highlands, wrote to Mentor to request letters of credit, he addressed the correspondence to Mr. Niederer, who was responsible for acquiring insurance for plaintiff, not to Mr. Carter, who was vice-president of Mentor at the time. Mr. Carter testified that this was due to Mr. Nolan\u2019s incompetence and offered as further proof of such incompetence the fact that Mr. Nolan had incorrectly stated Mentor\u2019s name. (Mr. Nolan wrote \"MENTOR INSURANCE COMPANY\" rather than Mentor Insurance Limited.) Mr. Carter admitted that Mentor needed to obtain the approval of plaintiff to issue letters of credit over a certain amount. Defendant in its post-trial brief asserted that Mr. Nolan was correct in writing to Mr. Niederer, since Mr. Niederer had the authority to approve Mentor\u2019s providing the requested letters of credit. The only point the court finds relevant with respect to this matter is that letters of credit for large amounts could not be issued by Mentor without plaintiffs approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\">. Defendant, in its post-trial brief, concluded that this evidence indicated that the earned surplus of Mentor for 1974 and 1975 was derived solely from premiums paid by plaintiff. The term \"earned surplus\" was not defined at trial or in defendant\u2019s post-trial brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b928-11\">. Mr. Dwyer did not comment on the legal contentions of the IRS that such amounts were income. Rather, he verified the accuracy of the derivation of the numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">In addition, Mr. Dwyer testified that the tax returns for 1974 and 1975 were completed in accordance with the \u201c70/30 Rule\u201d [sic] that appears in the Treasury Regulations for I.R.C. \u00a7 953. The rule provides that if an asset is in the United States for not more than 30 percent of the days of a period, such asset shall not be considered to be located in the United States and that if an asset is in the United States for more than 50 percent of the days of a period, such asset shall be considered to be located in the United States.

The expected loss is the average loss expected to occur over a period of time. The insurance company charges a premium that will cover the expected loss. Thus, the risk of the expected loss theoretically is not transferred, since the insured pays an amount through a premium that covers the expected loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b934-8\">. Dr. Doherty noted an additional distinction between a captive insurer\u2019s underwriting only for its parent and a captive insurer's underwriting for unrelated parties. He stated that when unrelated parties are involved, the parent company does not have the same level of control over the insurer\u2019s funds, since such funds must be available to meet all the parties\u2019 claims and thus are not available to the parent to spend in whatever manner it wishes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b934-14\">. Dr. Doherty also determined that Mentor was adequately capitalized, but stated that this was not a crucial factor to his determination of whether the premiums by plaintiff and its subsidiaries constituted insurance. In his view, inadequate capitalization would not negate the existence of insurance, but, rather, would reduce its effectiveness, since there would be greater risk to the policyholders than in the case of adequate capitalization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">. Defendant questioned the separate status of Mentor and plaintiff based, in part, on the overlap in several key employees and officers and on plaintiffs control over the investment of some of Mentor\u2019s funds. Defendant cited no case law supporting the proposition that either factor would serve to negate the separate status of plaintiff and Mentor. Having examined all the factors, the court finds that Mentor\u2019s business operations were separate from those of plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"AHrg\">. The other cases discussed above that did not find transfer of risk did not base their conclusions solely on the existence of the parent/wholly-owned subsidiary relationship and can be distinguished from the present case. The finding of no risk transfer in <em>Carnation </em>was based, in part, on the parent company's agreement to further capitalize the insurer. No such agreement is present here. The finding of no risk transfer in <em>Beech Aircraft </em>was based on the fact that the liability of the insurer for the parent\u2019s losses could not exceed the amount paid in premiums by the parent, supplemented by interest. That situation is not present here. <em>Clougherty </em>made specific reference to the fact that assets of the parent were reduced by the exact amount of the casualty loss experienced by the parent because no outside business was written by the insurer. Thus, <em>Clougherty </em>distinguishes itself from the present case. To the extent <em>Humana </em>determined risk transfer to not be present, it based its findings on <em>Clougherty </em>and <em>Carnation, </em>and is distinguishable for the same reasons as these cases. The finding of no risk transfer in <em>Gulf </em>was based on the insurer\u2019s being undercapitalized and on the presence of guarantees by the parent. These factors are not present here. (The court does not consider one guarantee executed by plaintiff after the years in issue to be evidence of guarantees by plaintiff for the years in issue.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b937-6\">. Defendant argued that the terms of business were different for plaintiff and unrelated parties since plaintiffs policies were for direct insurance and unrelated parties\u2019 policies were for reinsurance. Defendant\u2019s contention is not persuasive. Direct insurance and reinsurance are both considered insurance, and the premiums charged on both types of policies were based on commercial rates in London. The court finds that Mentor underwrote business for plaintiff and unrelated parties on the same terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. From evidence presented at trial, it appeared that Bermuda did not have laws specific to regulating insurance until after the years in issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b937-11\">. The court did not find convincing defendant's distinctions of the Tax Court\u2019s cases. The factors that the Tax Court relied on in concluding that risk shifting occurred are present in this case, except for regulation by insurance laws. Each of the three Tax Court cases, <em>Sears, Harper, </em>and <em>AMERCO, </em>listed some, but not all, of the factors listed above. The court does not read the Tax Court cases as creating specific criteria that must exist for risk shifting to occur between a parent and a subsidiary. Rather, the Tax Court\u2019s intention was to examine all the factors of a particular case together to determine if risk shifting was present. This court analyzed all the facts of this case and determined that risk shifting occurred within the Tax Court\u2019s meaning of risk shifting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">.

Having determined for the reasons given above that the premiums paid by plaintiff were not for insurance of United States risks, the court need not address the other issues raised by plaintiff, including the role of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1343 (1970) (originally enacted in 1953). It is noted that, to the extent possible, tax questions should be resolved within the Internal Revenue Code itself, without reference to other statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
