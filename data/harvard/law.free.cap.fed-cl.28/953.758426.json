We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">On December 5, 1985, Hughes Communications entered into a contract with the United States, represented by NASA, in which NASA agreed to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to launch ten of Hughes\u2019 commercial satellites through its Space Shuttle program. At that time, NASA operated a fleet of four manned shuttles. The United States government was then promoting commercial use of its shuttle fleet by private industry to offset the costs of its space program. To further this goal, NASA actively marketed its shuttles as launch vehicles for commercial payloads to both domestic and foreign users.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">The contract executed between Hughes and NASA was, as the Claims Court recognized, unique. Labeled a Launch Services Agreement (LSA), the contract provided at the outset that \u201c[a]ll Launch and Associated Services to be furnished by NASA to the Customer under this Agreement shall be so furnished by NASA using its best efforts.\u201d Art. I.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract included a cut-off date of September 30,1994, at which time NASA\u2019s obligations under the contract would expire, whether or not Hughes\u2019 spacecraft had been launched.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The LSA also granted both parties termination rights. Hughes was given the right to terminate the contract at virtually any time, provided it pay NASA any costs actually incurred by NASA at the time of termination. Art. VII, H 2. NASA\u2019s right to terminate was somewhat more limited, and included the right to terminate \u201cupon a determination in writing that NASA is required to Terminate such services for Reasons Beyond NASA\u2019s Control.\u201d Art. VII, H l.a.(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-13\">Article I of the contract designated a \u201cPlanned Launch Date\u201d for each of Hughes\u2019 spacecraft.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three of Hughes\u2019 spacecraft were designated as \u201cScheduled Launches\u201d while the remaining seven were designated as \u201cStandby Launches.\u201d Art. I, 11 l.a. Standby Launches were subject to more uncertain launch dates, \u201cwith each launch to nominally occur within one year following its respective Planned Launch Date.\u201d Art. IV, H l.b.(2). The \u201cFirm Launch Date and Shuttle flight assignment for the Payload will be selected solely by NASA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Scheduled Launches, however, were to be \u201cimplemented as set forth in Subparagraph l.a----\u201d Art. IV, H l.b.(l). Subparagraph l.a. of Article IV provided that for launches which are not Standby Launches, the Planned Launch Date would mark the beginning of a ninety-day launch period. About one year before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Planned Launch Date, NASA was to assign the payload to a shuttle and establish a Firm Launch Date by coordinating with Hughes and other customers scheduled to share the same shuttle launch. Despite these provisions, Article IV allowed both Hughes and NASA considerable flexibility in the actual launch date of the satellites by permitting both parties to delay or postpone a scheduled launch. Art. IV, 11112-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\">In addition, Article XV, entitled \u201cServices Consistent with United States\u2019 Obligations, Law and Published Policy\u201d provided that, \u201cNASA shall provide Launch and Associated Services under this Agreement to the extent consistent with the United States\u2019 obligations (including any intergovernmental memorandum of understanding entered into by NASA and the Customer), United States\u2019 Law and United States\u2019 Published Policy.\u201d Article IV also addressed NASA\u2019s obligation to provide launch services, and provided in relevant part, \u201cWith respect to launch priority and scheduling, NASA will provide Launch and Associated Services in accordance with the United States policy governing launch assistance approved by the President of the United States on August 6, 1982. Consistent with this policy, NASA will generally treat all comparable payloads on the same basis.\u201d The referenced policy was issued by President Reagan on August 6, 1982, and was entitled \u201cSpace Assistance and Cooperation Policy.\u201d It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-5\">With respect to the priority and scheduling for launching foreign payloads at U.S. launch sites, such launchings will be dealt with on the same basis as U.S. launchings. Each launching will be treated in terms of its own requirements and as an individual case. Once a payload is scheduled for launch, the launching agency will use its best effort to meet the scheduling commitments. Should events arise which require rescheduling, the U.S. will consult with all affected users in an attempt to meet the needs of users in an equitable manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"adl-dedup-1\">NASA compiled a list of all scheduled payloads to be launched, including Hughes\u2019, into a \u201cmanifest.\u201d The manifest listed commercial payloads in order of their Planned or Firm Launch Dates, and indicated which payloads were to be launched on which shuttle. Hughes\u2019 spacecraft were assigned specific slots on this manifest. However, on January 28, 1986, the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. None of Hughes\u2019 spacecraft had been launched at this point, less than two months after Hughes and NASA executed the LSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">As a consequence of the Challenger tragedy, NASA\u2019s shuttle fleet was reduced to three craft. Also, NASA immediately initiated an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. Ultimately, following extensive evaluation of space policy by various governmental entities, the President issued an order on August 15, 1986, in which he announced that NASA would no longer be in the business of launching commercial spacecraft. However, the government was left with the question of how best to handle the remaining 44 commercial payloads it had contracted to launch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">In response to this problem, the government grouped the remaining payloads into four categories \u2014 \u201cShuttle Unique,\u201d \u201cNational Security and Foreign Policy,\u201d \u201cCostly to Retrofit,\u201d and the \u201cRemainder.\u201d The \u201cShuttle Unique\u201d category included payloads which could not be launched using an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) but require a manned vehicle launch. The \u201cNational Security and Foreign Policy\u201d category included those payloads which were designated as having national security or foreign policy implications. The third category referred to payloads which could be launched by an ELV, but with considerable additional expense. Three of Hughes\u2019 satellites fell into this category, while the other seven were included in the \u201cRemainder\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">Based on these categories and the President\u2019s revised policy, NASA announced a new manifest for its shuttle fleet. This manifest included only those payloads which fell into the \u201cShuttle Unique\u201d and \u201cNational Security and Foreign Policy\u201d categories. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>cordingly, on October 30,1986, NASA issued a letter to Hughes informing it that the new manifest did not include Hughes\u2019 spacecraft. The letter also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-5\">It appears almost certain you will not be provided launch services either prior to or after your current contract expires. At the very least, it can be said with absolute certainty that your payloads will be delayed far in excess of the nine-month period described in Article VII, sub-paragraph 2.b. of Parts II and III of your Launch Services Agreement (LSA). Thus, should you wish to terminate your LSA prior to expiration, Article VII provides you may do so based on these delays. Upon termination, your payments to NASA will be refunded in accordance with the terms of the LSA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">Hughes filed suit in the United States Claims Court claiming that NASA breached the LSA and that Hughes\u2019 contract rights were taken in violation of the Fifth Amendment. On cross motions for summary judgment, the court granted the government\u2019s motion and held that Hughes could not recover under either of its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">With regard to the first claim, the Claims Court held that there was no breach of the LSA. Initially, the court determined that in spite of its \u201cunusual features,\u201d the LSA was a binding contract because the government was obligated to use its best efforts to launch Hughes\u2019 spacecraft. 26 Cl.Ct. at 134. The court declined to determine whether or not the combined effect of the government\u2019s actions operated to invoke the contract\u2019s termination clause. <em>Id. </em>at 136. Instead, the Claims Court determined that the new manifest, and the exclusion of Hughes\u2019 spacecraft, were the result of a valid sovereign act \u2014 a policy decision issued by the President with proper authority. The court reasoned that Article XV of the contract incorporated the sovereign act defense by its terms and that the LSA was therefore explicitly made subject to changes in policy. <em>Id. </em>at 140. The Claims Court concluded that because the reorganization of the manifest was in compli-anee with the new policy announced by the President, the government did not breach the LSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">The Claims Court also determined that the Fifth Amendment did not provide any basis for compensating Hughes. Recognizing that Hughes must have an identifiable property interest in order to establish a Fifth Amendment taking, the court determined that Article XYs incorporation of all future policy changes precluded Hughes from establishing any \u201c \u2018distinct investment-backed expectation\u2019 that its slot on the Shuttle manifest would be unaffected by subsequent sovereign acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145. Hughes now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">Contract interpretation is a matter of law which we review de novo. <em>Blake Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>987 F.2d 743, 746 (Fed.Cir.1993). We hold that the Claims Court erred in its conclusion that Hughes\u2019 right to have its spacecraft launched under the LSA was subject to all policy changes issued after August 6, 1982.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, Article IV of the LSA unambiguously required the government to schedule launch services according to \u201cthe United States policy governing launch assistance approved by the President of the United States on August 6, 1982.\u201d Art. IV 11 l.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">We disagree with the conclusion that Article XV, and not Article IV, is the more specific provision of the contract. Article XV limits NASA\u2019s obligation to provide Launch and Associated Services \u201cto the extent consistent with United States\u2019 obligations ..., United States\u2019 Law and United States\u2019 Published Policy.\u201d Article IV, on the other hand, states that NASA \u201cwill provide Launch and Associated Services in accordance with the United States policy governing launch assistance approved by the President of the United States on August 6, 1982.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-15\">By identifying and incorporating an existing, specific and dated item of presidential policy, Article IV is manifestly more specific than Article XV, which subordinates the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>tract only to unspecified United States obligations, law and published policy. \u201cWhere specific and general terms in a contract are in conflict, those which relate to a particular matter control over the more general language.\u201d <em>Hills Materials Co. v. Rice, </em>982 F.2d 514, 517 (Fed.Cir.1992). To the extent that Articles IV and XV are in conflict, Article IV\u2019s specific reference to the policy issued by the President on August 6,1982, controls.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">This interpretation of the contract does not render Article XV redundant or superfluous. By its reference to all obligations, law and policy, Article XV has broader scope than Article TV, which only limits launch priority and scheduling to comply with the August 6, 1982, policy. There could be changes in the United States\u2019 obligations, laws or policy which are not superseded by Article IV\u2019s more narrow language and would still apply to the contract. A contract should be interpreted in such a way that all parts make sense. <em>United States v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 1541, 1555 (Fed.Cir.1983). Article IV\u2019s reference to the August 6, 1982, policy would be superfluous and meaningless if launch priority and scheduling remained subject to any subsequent change in policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We also believe the government\u2019s reiteration that Article XV embodies the sovereign act defense contributes nothing in aid of interpreting the contract. Under the sovereign act doctrine, the United States as contractor will not be held responsible for the acts of the United States as sovereign. <em>Atlas Corp. v. United States, </em>895 F.2d 745, 754 (Fed.Cir.1990) (citing <em>Horowitz v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 458, 461, 45 S.Ct. 344, 344, 69 L.Ed. 736 (1925)). The sovereign act defense is an inherent element of every contract to which the government is a party, whether or not explicitly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">Finally, we address the government\u2019s invocation of the principle that it retains the authority to act as sovereign unless it surrenders this right in \u201cunmistakable terms.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, </em>477 U.S. 41, 52, 106 S.Ct. 2390, 2397, 91 L.Ed.2d 35 (1986) (citing <em>Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, </em>455 U.S. 130, 147, 102 S.Ct. 894, 906, 71 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982)). Under our interpretation of the contract, we have no trouble concluding that Article IV obligates the government to provide launch priority and scheduling in accordance with the August 6, 1982, policy in language which more than satisfies the \u201cunmistakable terms\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">We do not share the concern that our reading of Article IV \u201cwould have the effect of allowing NASA to contract away Congressional and Presidential power to set space policy for the entire term of the LSA, twelve years.\u201d 26 Cl.Ct. at 139. In the cases relied on for this proposition, the plaintiffs sought literally to enjoin the exercise of sovereign power. It was in this context that the \u201cunmistakable terms\u201d standard was developed. <em>See Public Agencies, </em>477 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 2390 (The state of California and other parties sought to enjoin Congress from enforcing an amended provision of the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <em>et </em>seq.); <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe, </em>455 U.S. 130, 102 S.Ct. 894 (Oil and gas companies who entered into long term leases to extract and produce oil and gas from tribal land sought to enjoin the tribe from acting as sovereign by imposing a severance tax on oil and gas removed from the land.); <em>see also Transohio Sav. Bank v. Director, OTS, </em>967 F.2d 598 (D.C.Cir.1992) (Thrifts challenged Congress\u2019 authority to revise capital accounting rules issued by government agencies for thrifts with forbearance agreements.). These cases also required the reviewing court to determine whether Congress, by enacting the legislation which authorized the government to enter into the contracts in question, waived in \u201cunmistakable terms\u201d its right to exercise certain sovereign powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">In contrast, the present case simply involves the question of how liability for certain contingencies was allocated by the contract. In its contractual capacity, the government executes countless agreements with private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>entities to receive and provide services, goods and supplies. These contracts routinely include provisions shifting financial responsibility to the government for events which might occur in the future.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That some of these events may be triggered by sovereign government action does not render the relevant contractual provisions any less binding than those which contemplate third party acts, inclement weather and other <em>force maj-eure. </em>The policy approved by the President on August 6, 1982, remained controlling \u201c[w]ith respect to launch priority and scheduling\u201d as provided in Article IV. Our conclusion does not prevent the President or Congress from implementing space policy, but does require NASA, absent the successful assertion of another defense in this case, to bear the cost of changes in launch priority and scheduling resulting from the revised policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">The government shall bear the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">.
