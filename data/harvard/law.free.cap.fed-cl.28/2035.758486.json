In trying to recoup some of the money it was paying to litigate and settle the cases, Keene filed two complaints against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When it filed each complaint, however, Keene had a similar claim pending against the Government in another court. We hold that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 consequently precludes Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over Keene\u2019s actions and affirm the dismissal of its complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">Through its subsidiary Keene Building Products Corporation, Keene manufactured and sold thermal insulation and acoustical products containing asbestos, as did a company it acquired in 1968, Baldwin-Ehret-Hill, Inc. In the mid-1970\u2019s, plaintiffs be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2038\">*2038</page-number>gan suing Keene in tort, alleging injury or death from exposure to asbestos fibers. In a typical case filed against Keene and other defendants in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, <em>Miller v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>No. 78-1283E, the plaintiff alleged, on behalf of the estate of one Dzon, that the decedent had died of lung cancer caused by asbestos fibers and dust inhaled during employment in 1943 and 1944. In June 1979, Keene filed a third-party complaint against the United States, alleging that any asbestos products to which Dzon was exposed had been supplied to the Government in accordance with specifications set out in Government contracts, and seeking indemnification or contribution from the Government for any damages Keene might have to pay the plaintiff. This third-party action ended, however, in May 1980, when the District Court granted Keene\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">In the meantime, in December 1979, with the <em>Miller </em>third-party action still pending, Keene filed the first of its two complaints in issue here, seeking damages from the United States in the Court of Federal Claims \u201cfor any amounts which have been, or which may be recovered from Keene by the claimants, by settlement or judgment.\u201d <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>No. 579-79C <em>(Keene I), </em>App. to Pet. for Cert. H15. The \u201cclaimants\u201d are defined as the plaintiffs in the more than 2,500 lawsuits filed against Keene \u201cby persons alleging personal injury or death from inhalation of asbestos fibers contained in thermal insulation products\u201d manufactured or sold by Keene or its subsidiaries. <em>Id., </em>at H3. Keene alleges conformance with Government specifications in the inclusion of asbestos within the thermal insulation products Keene supplied to Government shipyards and other projects funded or controlled by the Government, and Keene further claims that the Government even sold it some of the asbestos fiber used .in its products. Keene\u2019s theory of recovery is breach by the United States of implied warranties in contracts between the Government and Keene, a theory only the Court of Federal Claims may entertain, given the amount of damages requested, under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Keene\u2019s next move against the Government came the following month when it filed a 23-count complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>No. 80-CIV-0401(GLG). The pleadings tracked, almost verbatim, the lengthy factual allegations of <em>Keene I, </em>but the action was recast in terms of various tort theories, again seeking damages for any amounts paid by Keene to asbestos claimants. Keene also added a takings claim for the Government\u2019s allegedly improper re-coupment, under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8132, of money paid by Keene to claimants covered by the Act. For this, Keene sought restitution of \u201cthe amounts of money which have been, or which may be, recouped by [the United States] from claimants from judgments and settlements paid by Keene,\u201d App. 37, as well as an injunction against the Government\u2019s collection of FECA refunds thereafter. This suit suffered dismissal in September 1981, on the basis of sovereign immunity, which the court held unaffected by any waiver found in the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Suits in Admiralty Act, and the Public Vessels Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>700 F.2d 836 (CA2 1983), and we denied certiorari, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Only five days before the Southern District\u2019s dismissal of that omnibus action, Keene returned to the Court of Federal Claims with the second of the complaints in issue here. <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>No. 585-81C <em>(Keene II). </em>Although this one, too, repeats many of the factual allegations of <em>Keene I, </em>it adopts one of the theories raised in the Southern District case, seeking payment for \u201cthe amounts of money that [the United States] has recouped\u201d under FECA from asbestos claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2039\">*2039</page-number>ants paid by Keene. App. to Pet. for Cert. F10-F11. Again, the recoupments are said to be takings of Keene\u2019s property without due process and just compensation, contrary to the Fifth Amendment. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (covering, <em>inter alia, </em>certain claims \u201cfounded ... upon the Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">After the Court of Federal Claims raised the present jurisdictional issue <em>sua sponte </em>in similar actions brought by Johns-Man-ville, the Government invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 in moving to dismiss both <em>Keene I </em>and <em>Keene II, </em>as well as like actions by five other asbestos product manufacturers. With trial imminent in the <em>Johns-Manville </em>cases, the Court of Federal Claims initially granted the motion to dismiss only as to them. <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>12 Cl.Ct. 197 (1987). That decision was affirmed on appeal, <em>Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 1556 (CA Fed. 1988) <em>(per </em>curiam), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1066, 109 S.Ct. 1342, 103 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989), and the Court of Federal Claims then entered dismissals in <em>Keene I </em>and <em>Keene II, </em>among other cases, finding that when Keene had filed both <em>Keene I </em>and <em>Keene II, </em>it had the same claims pending in other courts. 17 Cl.Ct. 146 (1989). While a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed on the ground that \u00a7 1500 was inapplicable because no other claim had been pending elsewhere when the Court of Federal Claims entertained and acted upon the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, <em>UNR Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>911 F.2d 654 (1990), the Court of Appeals, en banc, subsequently vacated the panel opinion, 926 F.2d 1109 (1990), and affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissals, 962 F.2d 1013 (1992). We granted certiorari. 506 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 373, 121 L.Ed.2d 285 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">The authority cited for dismissing Keene\u2019s complaints for want of jurisdiction was 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1500 (Supp.1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">\u201cThe United States Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court any suit or process against the United States or any person who, at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">The lineage of this text runs back more than a century to the aftermath of the Civil War, when residents of the Confederacy who had involuntarily parted with property (usually cotton) during the war sued the United States for compensation in the Court of Claims, under the Abandoned Property Collection Act, ch. 120, 12 Stat. 820 (1863). When these cotton claimants had difficulty meeting the statutory condition that they must have given no aid or comfort to participants in the rebellion, see \u00a7 3 of the Act, they resorted to separate suits in other courts seeking compensation not from the Government as such but from federal officials, and not under the statutory cause of action but on tort theories such as conversion. See Schwartz, Section 1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo.LJ. 573, 574-580 (1967). It was these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress to prohibit anyone from filing or prosecuting in the Court of Claims \u201cany claim ... for or in respect to which he ... shall have commenced and has pending\u201d an action in any other court against an officer or agent of the United States. Act of June 25,1868, ch. 71, \u00a7 8, 15 Stat. 77. The statute has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2040\">*2040</page-number>long outlived the cotton claimants, having been incorporated with minor changes into the Revised Statutes of 1878, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1067, 18 Stat. 197 (1874); then reenacted without further change as \u00a7 154 of the Judicial Code of 1911, Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, \u00a7 154, 36 Stat. 1138 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (1940)); and finally adopted in its present form as \u00a7 1500 of the Judicial Code of 1948, Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 942 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Keene argues it was error for the courts below to apply the statute by focusing on facts as of the time Keene filed its complaints (instead of the time of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss) and to ignore differences said to exist between the Court of Federal Claims actions and those filed in the District Courts. Neither assignment of error will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Congress has the constitutional authority to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts, see <em>Finley v. United States, </em>490 U.S. 545, 548, 109 S.Ct. 2003, 2006, 104 L.Ed.2d 593 (1989), and, once the lines are drawn, \u201climits upon federal jurisdiction ... must be neither disregarded nor evaded.\u201d <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, </em>437 U.S. 365, 374, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 2403, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978). In \u00a7 1500, Congress has employed its power to provide that the Court of Federal Claims \u201cshall not have jurisdiction\u201d over a claim, \u201cfor or in respect to which\u201d the plaintiff \u201chas [a suit or process] pending\u201d in any other court. In applying the jurisdictional bar here by looking to the facts existing when Keene filed each of its complaints, the Court of Federal Claims followed the longstanding principle that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.\u201d <em>Mollan v. Torrance, </em>9 Wheat. 537, 539, 6 L.Ed. 154 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.); see <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 49, 69, 108 S.Ct. 376, 387, 98 L.Ed.2d 306 (1987) (opinion of SCALIA, J.); <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 289-290, 58 S.Ct. 586, 590-591, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union R. Co., </em>270 U.S. 580, 586, 46 S.Ct. 402, 405, 70 L.Ed. 743 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">While acknowledging what it calls this \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that subject-matter jurisdiction turns on the facts upon filing, Keene would have us dispense with the rule here. Brief for Petitioner 33. Assuming that we could,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, Keene gives us nothing to convince us that we should. Keene argues that if \u00a7 1500 spoke of \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment\u201d instead of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d pure and simple, the phrase would \u201call but preclude\u201d application of the time-of-filing rule. <em>Id., </em>at 34. But, without deciding whether such a change of terms would carry such significance, we have only to say that \u00a7 1500 speaks of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d without more, whereas some nearby sections of title 28 use the longer phrase. This fact only underscores our duty to refrain from reading a phrase into the statute when Congress has left it out. \u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another ..., it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Keene\u2019s next appeal, to statutory history, is no more availing. The immediate predecessor of \u00a7 1500, \u00a7 154 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2041\">*2041</page-number>Judicial Code of 1911, provided that \u201c[n]o person shall file or prosecute in the Court of Claims ... any claim for or in respect to which he ... has pending in any other court any suit or process____\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, \u00a7 154, 36 Stat. 1138. With this express prohibition against filing claims for which another suit was pending, there could, of course, have been no doubt that at least a time-of-filing rule applied. See <em>Shapiro v. United States, </em>168 F.2d 625, 626 (CA3 1948) (\u00a7 154 \u201cforbids the filing\u201d of a Little Tucker Act claim when a related suit is pending); <em>British American Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 438, 439 (1939) <em>(per </em>curiam) (dismissing a claim under \u00a7 154 where, \u201c[a]t the time the petition was filed in this court, the plaintiff ... had pending in the District Court ... a suit based upon the same claim\u201d), cert, denied, 310 U.S. 627, 60 S.Ct. 974, 84 L.Ed. 1398 (1940); <em>New Jersey Worsted Mills v. United States, </em>80 Ct.Cl. 640, 641, 9 F.Supp. 605, 606 (1935) <em>(per </em>curiam) (\u201c[W]e think it clear that the plaintiff was not permitted even to file its claim in this court\u201d). Although Keene urges us to see significance in the deletion of the \u201cfile or prosecute\u201d language in favor of the current reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the comprehensive revision of the Judicial Code completed in 1948, we do not presume that the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law \u201cunless an intent to make such [a] chang[e] is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., </em>353 U.S. 222, 227, 77 S.Ct. 787, 791, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957) (footnote omitted); see <em>Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, </em>490 U.S. 826, 831, n. 4, 109 S.Ct. 2218, 2222, n. 4, 104 L.Ed.2d 893 (1989); <em>Finley v. United States, supra, </em>490 U.S., at 554, 109 S.Ct., at 2009; <em>Tidewater Oil Co. v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 151, 162, 93 S.Ct. 408, 415, 34 L.Ed.2d 375 (1972). On the point in issue here, there is no such clear expression in the shift from specific language to the general, and the Reviser\u2019s Note to \u00a7 1500 indicates nothing more than a change \u201cin phraseology,\u201d see H.R.Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A140 (1947); cf. <em>Newman-Green, supra, </em>490 U.S., at 831, 109 S.Ct. at 2222. Since Keene, indeed, comes up with nothing to the contrary, we read the statute as continuing to bar jurisdiction over the claim of a plaintiff who, upon filing, has an action pending in any other court \u201cfor or in respect to\u201d the same claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">The statutory notion of comparable claims is more elusive. By precluding jurisdiction over the claim of a plaintiff with a suit pending in another court \u201cfor or in respect to\u201d the same claim, \u00a7 1500 requires a comparison between the claims raised in the Court of Federal Claims and in the other lawsuit. The exact nature of the things to be compared is not illuminated, however, by the awkward formulation of \u00a7 1500. Nor does it advance the ball very far to recognize from the statute\u2019s later reference to \u201cthe cause of action alleged in such suit or process,\u201d that the term \u201cclaim\u201d is used here synonymously with \u201ccause of action,\u201d see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 247 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201ccause of action\u201d), since, as both parties admit, \u201ccause of action,\u201d like \u201cclaim,\u201d can carry a variety of meanings. See Brief for Petitioner 18; Brief for United States 15; see also <em>Johns-Manville Corp., </em>855 F.2d, at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Fortunately, though, we can turn to earlier readings of the word \u201cclaim\u201d as it appears in this statute. The phrase \u201cany claim ... for or in respect to which\u201d has remained unchanged since the statute was first adopted in 1868, see Act of June 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2042\">*2042</page-number>1868, ch. 71, \u00a7 8, 15 Stat. 77, and prior encounters with \u00a7 154 of the Judicial Code of 1911, the immediate predecessor to \u00a7 1500, shed some light on the issue. <em>Corona Coal Co. v. United States, </em>263 U.S. 537, 44 S.Ct. 156, 68 L.Ed. 431 (1924), was an action brought against the United States in the Court of Claims, seeking compensation for coal requisitioned by the Government. Before bringing its appeal to this Court, the plaintiff sued the President\u2019s agent in Federal District Court, \u201cthe causes of action therein set forth being the same as that set forth in the [Court of Claims] case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 539, 44 S.Ct. at 156. After noting that the causes of action \u201carose out of\u201d the same factual setting, we applied \u00a7 154 and dismissed the appeal. <em>Id., </em>at 539-540, 44 S.Ct. at 156. Later that year, we had the case of a plaintiff seeking a writ of mandamus to stop the Court of Claims from reinstating a suit it had dismissed earlier, without prejudice, on the plaintiff\u2019s own motion. <em>Ex parte Skinner &amp; Eddy Corp., </em>265 U.S. 86, 44 S.Ct. 446, 68 L.Ed. 912 (1924). Skinner &amp; Eddy had sued the United States in the Court of Claims for nearly $17.5 million; \u201c[t]he largest item of the claim was for anticipated profits on 25 vessels\u201d covered by an order, later cancelled, by the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation. <em>Id., </em>at 91, 44 S.Ct. at 447. After the Court of Claims had granted its motion to dismiss, Skinner &amp; Eddy sued the Emergency Fleet Corporation in state court \u201con substantially the same causes of action as those sued for in the Court of Claims.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 92, 44 S.Ct., at 447. There was no question that the factual predicate of each action was the same, except for the omission from the state court action of any demand for anticipated profits, thus limiting the damages sought to $9.1 million. We issued the writ of mandamus, holding that \u00a7 154 prevented the Court of Claims from exercising jurisdiction over the claims it had dismissed earlier, given the intervening state court suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">A few years later, the Court of Claims settled a key question only foreshadowed by <em>Skinner &amp; Eddy: </em>whether \u00a7 154 applied when the Court of Claims action and the \u201cother\u201d suit proceeded under different legal theories. In <em>British American Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 438 (1939) <em>(per </em>curiam), after the plaintiff had surrendered his gold bullion to the Government (in compliance with executive orders and regulations that took this country off the gold standard), he sued in the Court of Claims on allegations that he had been underpaid by more than $4.3 million. Earlier the same day, the plaintiff had filed a suit in Federal District Court \u201cfor the recovery of the same amount for the same gold bullion surrendered.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 439. The Court of Claims observed that \u201c[t]he only distinction between the two suits instituted in the District Court and in this court is that the action in the District Court was made to sound in tort and the action in this court was alleged on contract.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 440. Because the two actions were based on the same operative facts, the court dismissed the Court of Claims action for lack of jurisdiction, finding it to be \u201cclear that the word \u2018claim,\u2019 as used in section 154, ... has no reference to the legal theory upon which a claimant seeks to enforce his demand.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">These precedents demonstrate that under the immediate predecessor of \u00a7 1500, the comparison of the two cases for purposes of possible dismissal would turn on whether the plaintiff\u2019s other suit was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2043\">*2043</page-number>on substantially the same operative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least if there was some overlap in the relief requested.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Skinner &amp; Eddy, supra; Corona Coal, supra. </em>That the two actions were based on different legal theories did not matter. See <em>British American Tobacco, supra. </em>Since Keene has given us no reason to doubt that these cases represented settled law when Congress reenacted the \u201cclaim for or in respect to which\u201d language in 1948, see 62 Stat. 942, we apply the presumption that Congress was aware of these earlier judicial interpretations and, in effect, adopted them. <em>Lorillard v. Pons, </em>434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 870, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978); cf. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 55, n. 13, 85 S.Ct. 248, 253-54 n. 13, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964) (presumption does not apply when there is no \u201csettled judicial construction\u201d at the time of reenactment). The decision in <em>British American Tobacco </em>strikes us, moreover, as a sensible reading of the statute, for it honors Congress\u2019s decision to limit Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction not only as to claims \u201cfor ... which\u201d the plaintiff has sued in another court, but as to those \u201cin respect to which\u201d he has sued elsewhere as well. While the latter language does not set the limits of claim identity with any precision, it does make it clear that Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered useless by a narrow concept of identity providing a correspondingly liberal opportunity to maintain two suits arising from the same factual foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Keene nonetheless argues, for the first time in its merits brief,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201c[a] claim brought outside the [Court of Federal Claims] is \u2018for or in respect to\u2019 a claim in the [Court of Federal Claims only] when claim-splitting law would treat them as the <em>same </em>\u2014 ie., require them to be joined in a single suit \u2014 if the two claims were both brought against the United States.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 20. Under this theory, \u00a7 1500 would not apply to a Court of Federal Claims plaintiff unless his suit pending in the other court rested on a legal theory that could have been pleaded (as Keene\u2019s could not have been) in the Court of Federal Claims. But this reinterpretation of \u00a7 1500 is bound to fail, not because novelty is always fatal in the construction of an old statute, but because the novel proposition in Keene\u2019s suggested reading would have rendered the statute useless, in all or nearly all instances, to effect the very object it was originally enacted to accomplish. Keene fails to explain how the original statute would have applied to the cotton claimants, whose tort actions brought in other courts were beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, just as tort cases are outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Keene\u2019s theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2044\">*2044</page-number>was squarely rejected in <em>British American </em>Tobacco,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and it must be rejected again this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Finally, Keene takes the tack that if we adopt the Court of Appeals\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1500, we will be announcing \u201ca new rule of law\u201d that ought to be applied only prospectively under the test set out in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v.

And while Keene contends that nothing less than these repudiations of precedent would have sufficed to dismiss its suits, we read the five cases as supporting neither Keene\u2019s position that the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over its cases nor its plea for pure prospectivity of the overruling decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">In applying \u00a7 1500 to the facts of this case, we find it unnecessary to consider, much less repudiate, the \u201cjudicially created exceptions\u201d to \u00a7 1500 found in <em>Tecon Engineers, Casman, </em>and <em>Boston Five. </em>See 962 F.2d, at 1021. <em>Tecon Engineers </em>held that a later-filed action in another court does not oust the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over an earlier-filed complaint; our decision turns on Keene\u2019s earlier-filed District Court actions, and even Keene now concedes it to be \u201cunnecessary for the Court to address the <em>Tecon </em>question\u201d in ruling on the dismissal of Keene\u2019s claims. Reply Brief for Petitioner 14, n. 14; see n. 4, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Casman </em>court recognized an exception (followed in <em>Boston </em>Five) for plaintiffs who seek distinctly different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2045\">*2045</page-number>types of relief in the two courts; here, Keene had sought monetary relief in each of the cases pending when it filed the complaints seeking monetary relief in <em>Keene I </em>and <em>Keene II. </em>See n. 6, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Brown, </em>the Court of Claims reinstated a claim after the plaintiffs District Court action for the same claim had been dismissed, on the grounds that the other suit was \u201cno longer \u2018pending\u2019 \u201d and had itself been dismissed because jurisdiction lay exclusively in the Court of Claims. 175 Ct.Cl., at 348, 358 F.2d, at 1004. Brown\u2019s narrow reasoning, that \u00a7 1500 does not apply after dismissal of an earlier-filed District Court suit brought in derogation of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, was echoed in <em>Hossein, </em>a <em>per curiam </em>order citing neither <em>Brown, </em>nor any other case, on this point.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See also <em>Boston Five, supra, </em>at 139-140 (following <em>Hossein). </em>Since Keene\u2019s District Court actions were not, and could not have been, dismissed on the ground of falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, Keene gets no support from <em>Brown </em>and <em>Hossein.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, there is no \u201cnew principle of law\u201d at work in ruling against Keene, see <em>Chevron Oil, supra, </em>404 U.S., at 106, 92 S.Ct., at 355, and no need to plunge into retroactivity analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We have said nothing until now about Keene\u2019s several policy arguments, and now can only answer that Keene addresses the wrong forum.

It is not that Keene has not tried to meet the objection. Keene assumes, contrary to the plain text, that the statute here is not jurisdictional, arguing instead that it was meant to supplement the formalistic nineteenth century concept of res judicata. According to Keene, res judicata would not have barred a cotton claimant from instigating an action against a federal officer who had acted for the Government, even though the claimant had lost an otherwise identical action against the Government itself (and vice versa), the difference between the named defendants being significant at that time. On the assumption that the statute eliminated non-identity of parties defendant as a barrier to the application of res judicata, Keene then argues that causes of action were treated as identical in those days if the same evidence was used to prove multiple claims. On this view of the law, Keene concludes, multiple cotton claims would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2044\">*2044</page-number>have been treated as the same, and the statute would have barred the Court of Claims suit, just as Congress intended. Reply Brief for Petitioner 7. Even on its own terms, however, this argument fails, for the Court of Claims in 1868 had no jurisdiction to try a tort action for conversion, however similar it might have been for res judicata purposes to the statutory action within that court\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, under Keene\u2019s claim-splitting theory, the conversion action would not have been treated as identical with the statutory action; each would have survived, leaving the statute useless to solve the problem Congress was addressing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b994-10\">.

Rather, the plaintiff may continue to pursue his claim so long as there is no other suit pending when the Court of Federal Claims decides the motion to dismiss. Neither the text nor the history of the statute demands more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2046\">*2046</page-number>plaintiff than that he make an \u201celection either to leave the Court of Claims or to leave the other courts\u201d at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Section 1500 is not itself a grant of jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims. That function is performed by other sections of the Judicial Code immediately preceding \u00a7 1500, which give the court \u201cjurisdiction <em>to render judgment </em>upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), and \u201cjurisdiction <em>to render judgment </em>upon any claim by a disbursing officer of the United States ...,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1496 (emphases added). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1497; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1499 (granting jurisdiction to \u201crender judgment\u201d over other claims).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1500, by contrast, \u201ctakes away jurisdiction even though the subject matter of the suit may appropriately be before the Claims Court.\u201d <em>UNR Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 1013, 1028 (CA Fed.1992) (Plager, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). It is only reasonable to assume that the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d \u00a7 1500 takes away is the same as the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d surrounding Code provisions bestow: the jurisdiction to enter judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The text of \u00a7 1500 simply provides that the Court of Federal Claims \u201c \u2018shall not have jurisdiction\u2019 over a claim \u2018... which\u2019 the plaintiff ... <em>\u2018has pending\u2019 </em>in any other court----\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 2040 (emphasis added). Accordingly, so long as a plaintiff has pending another suit in another court, the Court of Federal Claims may not adjudicate the plaintiff\u2019s claim, even though its subject matter would otherwise bring it within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Government may invoke this exception by putting such a plaintiff to his choice: either \u201cleave the other courts,\u201d n. 1, <em>supra, </em>or forgo further proceedings in the Court of Federal Claims. If the plaintiff declines to leave the other courts, then the Court of Federal Claims is without jurisdiction to proceed with case before it, though it may retain the case on its docket pending disposition of the other action. <em>Hossein v. United States, </em>218 Ct.Cl. 727 (1978). But if the plaintiff does dismiss his other action, then the Court of Federal Claims is free to decide his case. Section 1500 was so construed over a quarter of a century ago, see <em>Brown v. United States, </em>175 Ct.Cl. 343, 358 F.2d 1002 (1966),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and I see no reason to interpret it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2047\">*2047</page-number>now as a broader prohibition on pretrial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">It is true that an earlier version of \u00a7 1500 provided that a claimant may not \u201cfile or prosecute\u201d an action in the Court of Federal Claims while another action is pending. <em>Ante, </em>at 2041. That original text, however, did not prescribe the consequences of a prohibited filing. In view of the fact that the text did not then mention the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d there is nothing to suggest that pendency of another action would have to be treated as a defect warranting automatic dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, given the plain statement of the legislation\u2019s sponsor that he intended to force an election of remedies before trial, see n. 1, <em>supra, </em>this earlier language is fairly construed as giving the Government the right to avoid duplicative litigation, by having the Court of Claims action dismissed if the plaintiff chose not to abandon the claim pending elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">In any event, when the text of \u00a7 1500 was revised in 1948, Congress removed the prohibition on filing. The Court nevertheless assumes that the section should be construed as originally drafted, because Congress did not intend the 1948 revisions of the Judicial Code to make substantive changes in the law. See <em>ante, </em>at 2041. In fact, the 1948 revision did work a significant substantive change, by enlarging the class of suits subject to dismissal to include suits against the United States, as well as suits against its agents. See <em>ante, </em>at 2043, n. 6; <em>Matson Navigation Co. v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 352, 355-356, 52 S.Ct. 162, 164-165, 76 L.Ed. 336 (1932); see also Schwartz, Section 1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo.L.J. 573, 579-580 (1967). But even if it were the case that Congress intended no substantive change in 1948, that would mean only that the present text is the best evidence of what the law has always meant, and that the language of the prior version cannot be relied upon to support a different reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">In my judgment, the Court of Claims properly construed \u00a7 1500 in 1966 when it held that the provision merely requires claimants to choose between alternative pending claims before proceeding to trial. See <em>Brown, </em>175 Ct.Cl., at 348, 358 F.2d, at 1004. The statute limits the power of the Court of Federal Claims to render judgments, and thus the ability of a plaintiff to prosecute simultaneous actions against the Government, but it does not prevent the Court of Federal Claims from allowing a case to remain on its docket until the claimant has made the required election. Even if I did not agree with this interpretation of \u00a7 1500, however, I would nevertheless endorse it here, as litigants have a right to rely on a longstanding and reasoned judicial construction of an important statute that Congress has not seen fit to alter. See <em>McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 376-377, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 2890-2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (citing cases). Whether or not \u201cnovelty is always fatal in the construction of an old statute,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 2043, the overruling of a consistent line of precedent raises equitable concerns that should not be disregarded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2048\">*2048</page-number>Admittedly, this is a badly drafted statute. Viewed against a legal landscape that has changed dramatically since the days of the cotton claimants, see <em>ante, </em>at 2040-2039, it does not lend itself easily to sensible construction. Moreover, the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1500 today may have the salutary effect of hastening its repeal or amendment. Nevertheless, a reading that is faithful not only to the statutory text but also to the statute\u2019s stated purpose is surely preferable to the harsh result the Court endorses here. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-5\">.

Our earlier order of dismissal was predicated on the fact that the other \u2018claim remains pending in the said District Court.\u2019 That is no longer true, and the claim is no longer \u2018pending in any other court.\u2019 In this situation, we do not believe that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 requires us to deprive plaintiffs of the only forum they have in which to test their demand for just compensation.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>175 Ct.Cl., at 348, 358 F.2d, at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-14\">See also <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank v.

As Justice Holmes pointed out, in a similar context, \"no one would say that the words of the Mississippi statute of frauds, \u2018An action shall not be brought whereby to charge a defendant,\u2019 go to the jurisdiction of the court. Of course it could be argued that logically they had that scope, but <em>common </em>sense would revolt.\u201d <em>Fauntleroy v.

The Court seeks to minimize these concerns by suggesting that the <em>Brown </em>line of cases on which petitioner relies would not in any event apply here, because petitioner\u2019s district court action was not dismissed on the grounds that it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Ante, </em>at 2043. In my view, <em>Brown, </em>and cases like it, do not warrant such a narrow reading, but stand instead for the broader proposition that a former district court action, once dismissed, no longer bars adjudication in the Court of Federal Claims. See n. 2, <em>supra; National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. United States, </em>8 Cl.Ct. 274, 275-276 (1985) (in case of concurrent jurisdiction, providing for automatic reinstatement of Court of Federal Claims action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2048\">*2048</page-number>upon dismissal of district court suit). That the Court of Appeals felt it necessary to overrule <em>Brown </em>on the facts of this case, see <em>UNR Industries, </em>962 F.2d, at 1022, suggests a similar understanding of <em>Brown's </em>scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
