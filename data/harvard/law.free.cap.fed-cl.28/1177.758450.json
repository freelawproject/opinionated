Because the United States has waived its sovereign immunity in the Claims Court with respect to this sanction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-29\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-30\">The single issue raised in this appeal is whether the United States, as defendant in every suit brought in the Claims Court, has waived its sovereign immunity in that court to an award of monetary sanctions pursuant to the court\u2019s rules for abusing its discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-31\">M.A. Mortenson Company filed suit on behalf of itself and several subcontractors in the Claims Court against the Veterans Administration, claiming additional costs of over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>twelve million dollars incurred in constructs ing a hospital in Seattle, Washington. The Claims Court issued an order governing pretrial matters, including discovery, on June 22, 1987. Pursuant to this order, Mortenson served discovery requests on the government in August, 1987. After the government failed to respond thereto, Mortenson filed a motion to compel discovery, and requested attorney fees and costs incurred in the discovery dispute. On January 25, 1988 after a hearing, the Claims Court granted Morten-son\u2019s motion to compel, adopted a detailed discovery schedule and deferred ruling on the motion for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The Claims Court again faced the issue of discovery when it became aware that the government had not complied with the discovery timetable set in the court\u2019s January 25 order. In response to this information, on March 15, 1988, the court ordered the government \u201cto provide ... full and complete responses to Mortenson\u2019s discovery requests on or before April 6,1988.\u201d <em>M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, </em>Nos. 815-86C, 178-87C, slip op. at 1 (Cl.Ct. Mar. 15, 1988) (order directing compliance with discovery schedule). The court also announced its intention to consider \u201cappropriate financial and evidentiary discovery sanctions should [the government] fail, without adequate reason, to comply with the court\u2019s orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">After a hearing to determine compliance with its orders, the Claims Court found that the government had conceded that three of the four items requested by Mortenson had not been produced. <em>M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, </em>Nos. 815-86C, 178-87C, slip op. at 1 (Cl.Ct. Apr. 14, 1988) (order granting sanctions). As to the fourth category, the court found the government\u2019s responses \u201cincomplete and confusing,\u201d \u201cfacially contradict[ory]\u201d when compared with the government\u2019s admissions and surprisingly brief considering the government\u2019s earlier representation that additional time was required because the interrogatories required \u201ca very lengthy and specific type of answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. As a consequence of the government\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery orders, the Claims Court (i) assessed certain evidentiary sanctions under Rule 37(b)(2) of the Rules of the United States Claims Court (RUSCC), and (ii) directed the government to pay attorney fees and costs associated with the discovery dispute pursuant to RUSCC 37(a)(4). <em>Id </em>at 10. The amount of the sanction was ultimately set at $21,983, representing the expenses \u201crelated to the motion to compel in that they would not have been incurred but for [the government\u2019s] lack of diligence in responding to discovery requests and its failure to obey the court\u2019s discovery orders.\u201d <em>M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, </em>Nos. 815-86C, 178-87C, slip op. at 1-2 (Cl.Ct. June 15, 1988) (order establishing appropriate sanction amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">The government stated that the sanction would not be paid unless the amount was entered as a partial judgment against the United States. Upon Mortenson\u2019s subsequent motion to have the court enter such a partial judgment, the government raised the issue of sovereign immunity for the first time. The Claims Court rejected the government\u2019s position on sovereign immunity in its September 12, 1988 decision, and granted Mortenson\u2019s motion. <em>M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, </em>15 Cl.Ct. 362 (1988) (order granting partial judgment). First, the court found that sanctions for abusing discovery may be assessed under RUSCC 37 regardless of a lack of any independent statutory or common law basis on which to rely. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64. Second, the court determined that Congress, via the Equal Access to Justice Act, had evidenced its intent to place the United States on an equal footing with other parties with respect to an award of attorney fees and costs under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), and that the legislative history of the Equal Access to Justice Act and the accompanying repeal of Rule 37(f) \u201cstrongly militate against creating a different result under the RUSCC [than under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">The United States\u2019 immediate appeal from the entry of partial judgment was dismissed as interlocutory by this court pending entry of final judgment in the case. <em>M.A. Morten-son Co. v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 50, 52 (Fed.Cir.1989). Thereafter, all remaining claims between the parties were settled, and final judgment for $21,983 was entered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>March 30, 1992. The United States timely appealed the judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1H6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Whether the Claims Court has jurisdiction to entertain certain motions is an issue we review <em>de novo. Dehne v. United States, </em>970 F.2d 890, 892 (Fed.Cir.1992); <em>Placeway Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>920 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed.Cir.1990). This particular review necessarily involves statutory interpretation, which we likewise review <em>de novo. Commercial Energies, Inc. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed.Cir.1991); <em>Pasteur v. United States, </em>814 F.2d 624, 626 (Fed.Cir.1987). Before this court, the government again raises its defense of sovereign immunity, which we address in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the federal government, as this nation\u2019s \u201csovereign,\u201d is immune to an award of money damages, except to the extent that the government has explicitly waived such immunity. <em>Zumerling v. Marsh, </em>783 F.2d 1032, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1986). This court is cognizant of the fact that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed in favor of the government. <em>See, e.g., Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310, 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 2963, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986) (waiver of sovereign immunity is construed \u201cstrictly in favor of the sovereign\u201d); <em>Fidelity Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>700 F.2d 1379, 1387 (Fed.Cir.) (\u201c[G]reat care must be taken not to expand liability [of the United States] beyond that which was explicitly consented to by Congress.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>464 U.S. 826, 104 S.Ct. 97, 78 L.Ed.2d 103 (1983). In this case, however, Congress has indeed waived that immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">In 1980, Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act, Pub.L. No. 96-481, Title II, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. (94 Stat.) 2325 (1980) (EAJA) (codified as amended at various sections of 5 &amp; 28 U.S.C.). As finally enacted, the EAJA separately waived the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for two distinct purposes: (i) to authorize special fee-shifting rules that would encourage individuals and organizations without substantial resources to challenge arbitrary government action; and (ii) to ensure that the United States as a litigant in a civil action would be subject to court-awarded fees to the same extent as would be a private party. H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6 (1980) (H.R.Rep. 1418), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4953, 4984, 4984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">Embodying the first waiver of immunity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) authorizes awards of fees and other expenses to certain organizations and individuals who satisfy the statutory net-worth requirements and who prevail in their actions against the government, provided both that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and that special circumstances which would render such an award unjust are absent from the case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1988). This section is not at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">The second waiver of immunity, EAJA \u00a7 204(a), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b) (1988),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> explicitly waives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity in a civil case to an award of reasonable attorney fees \u201cto the same extent [any court having jurisdiction] may presently award such fees against other [private] parties.\u201d H.R.Rep. 1418 at 5-6, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4984. Section 2412(b) essentially strips the government of its cloak of immunity with respect to costs and fees and requires it to litigate under the same professional standards applicable to a private litigant. Where a fee provision does not itself specifically authorize an award of fees against the United States, the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity is waived by virtue of section 2412(b) for purposes of that fee provision. <em>See </em>1 Mary F. Derfner &amp; Arthur D. Wolf, <em>Court Awarded Attorney Fees </em>H 7.04, at 7-32.2(4) (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Where the language of a statute is clear, the plain meaning of the language governs interpretation thereof: \u201c[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2055, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). Where congressional intent would be thwarted absent reference to the legislative history, however, it is permissible to look beyond the specific language used, especially recognizing the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance that the EAJA be interpreted \u201cin light of [the EAJA\u2019s] manifest purpose.\u201d <em>Sullivan, Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. Hudson, </em>490 U.S. 877, 890, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 2257, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989). This is no less true when attempting to determine the scope of the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See, e.g., McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. United States, </em>926 F.2d 1126, 1129-32 (Fed.Cir.1991) (rejecting the government\u2019s position that the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 must be interpreted without resort to the legislative history of the Tucker Act; Congress\u2019 intent was clearly evidenced from the legislative history, and would have been frustrated by a technical reading of the statutory language).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">The present case is representative of a situation in which congressional intent is clear, even though imprecisely couched in the statutory phraseology of section 2412(b). The legislative history of the EAJA and the circumstances surrounding the passage thereof demonstrate that the drafters explicitly contemplated recovery of attorney fees against the government under circumstances other than those narrowly revealed by the \u201cterms of any statute\u201d language. The pertinent legislative history reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-6\">First, [EAJA] amends [section 2412(b) ] to permit a court in its discretion to award attorney fees and other expenses to prevailing parties in civil litigation involving the United States to the same extent it may award fees in cases involving private parties. Thus, the United States would be liable for fees under the \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201ccommon fund,\u201d and \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exceptions to the American rule [against fee-shifting]. <em>Fees may also be recovered against the United States under [R]ule 37 [of the FRCP], which provides for sanctions for failure to make discovery and under the terms of any Federal statute which authorizes awards against private parties unless the statute expressly provides otherwise. </em>There appears to be no justification for exempting the United States in these situations; the change simply reflects the belief that, at a minimum, the United States should be held to the same standards in litigating as private parties ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">S.Rep. No. 253, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (Star Print 1979) (S.Rep. 253) (Senate Report accompanying S. 265) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">Rule 37 of the FRCP, to which the above passage explicitly refers, provides a federal district court with the authority to award sanctions against a party failing to cooperate during the discovery process. Specifically, Rule 37(a)(4) empowers the court to award \u201creasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order [compelling discovery], including attorney\u2019s fees\u201d against a party whose position is not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in the discovery dispute. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(4). By incorporating as an example Rule 37 into section 2412(b), Congress emphasized that there was no longer a need to differentiate between the government and a private litigant in matters relating to awarding fees and costs as a sanction for abusing the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">By such incorporation of the FRCP into the scope of the EAJA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, Congress evidenced that the phrase \u201cterms of any statute\u201d should not be read narrowly. The FRCP were promulgad ed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority and implicitly adopted by Congress after transmission thereto of the FRCP in proposed form. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071-2074 (1988). In light of this statutory promulgation scheme, the Supreme Court itself has held that the FRCP are deemed to have \u201cthe force [and effect] of a federal statute.\u201d <em>Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 13, 61 S.Ct. 422, 426, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number><em>also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b) (1988) (\u201cAll laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u201d). Thus, it is consistent with Congress\u2019 intent and the legislative history to interpret \u201cstatute\u201d as including the FRCP. <em>See Adamson v. Bowen, </em>855 F.2d 668, 670-72 (10th Cir.1988); 1 Derfner &amp; Wolf, <em>supra, </em>1111.05[4](d)(vi) at 11-131. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that \u201c[t]he Government as a litigant is, of course, subject to the rules of discovery.\u201d <em>United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>356 U.S. 677, 681, 78 S.Ct. 983, 986, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">More than the legislative history, however, evidences Congress\u2019 intent to permit a court under the FRCP to assess fees against the United States for abuse of discovery. EAJA \u00a7 205(a), 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. (94 Stat.) at 2330, repealed Rule 37(f) of the FRCP, which had prohibited the imposition of attorney fees on the United States as a discovery sanction except to the extent permitted by statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(f) Note; 4A James W. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>1137.07, at 37-136 (1993). Recognizing that to leave Rule 37(f) intact would be to create a conflict with the EAJA\u2019s language, Congress remarked: \u201cThis change reflects the belief that the United States should be liable for fees the same as other parties when it abuses discovery.\u201d S.Rep. 253 at 22; H.R.Rep. 1418 at 19, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">The government argues that this repeal was necessary because section 2412(b) authorized an award of attorney fees allowable under both statute <em>and </em>common law against the United States, and therefore Rule 37(f) as it existed before passage of the EAJA was inconsistent with the EAJA. Though we agree that at a minimum, modification of Rule 37(f) was required so as to avoid any ambiguous conflict with the EAJA, the government\u2019s position stops short of the true impact of Congress\u2019 actions: The EAJA\u2019s repeal of Rule 37(f) not only avoided creating a riddle for the district courts to solve, but also gave the courts authority to rely on Rule 37 <em>itself </em>as the equivalent of a statute providing for such an award against the United States for abuse of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">Consistent with this reading of the EAJA is the fact that other circuit courts have employed the FRCP as vehicles for sanctioning the United States for various abuses of the litigative process. <em>See, e.g., Adamson, </em>855 F.2d at 672 (EAJA waived sovereign immunity to an award of fees pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11); <em>United States v. Gavilan Joint Community College Dist., </em>849 F.2d 1246, 1251 (9th Cir.1988) (sovereign immunity does not prohibit award under Fed. R.Civ.P. 11); <em>United States v. National Med.

United States, </em>939 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cSince Congress authorized the promulgation of [the FRCP], applying them to the government with full force cannot be said to violate the principles of sovereign immunity.\u201d); <em>Barry v.

Various courts have also relied upon procedural rules other than the FRCP, yet promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2072 &amp; 2075, in assessing monetary sanctions against the United States. <em>See, e.g., In re Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>886 F.2d 480, 482 (1st Cir.1989) (\u201cIt is not [the court\u2019s own procedural rule] that by itself waives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity. Rather, it is section 2412(b) that waives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for purposes of [Fed.R.App.P. 38].\u201d); <em>In re Dorman, </em>98 B.R. 560, 572 (Bankr.D.Kan. 1987) (EAJA waives sovereign immunity to sanctions under Bankruptcy Rule 7037, which incorporates Fed.R.Civ.P. 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">In the present case, it is clear that . the Claims Court qualifies as a \u201ccourt having jurisdiction of such [civil] action.\u201d Mortenson brought its cause of action under both the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (1988), under which the Claims Court shall hear \u201cany claim against the United States founded ... upon ... any express or implied contract with the United States____\u201d, and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-563, 92 Stat. 2383 (codified at 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613 (1988)). Since Mortenson claimed increased costs in excess of $10,000 incurred as a result of performing a contract with the federal government, its cause of action fell within the competent and exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a)(1) (1988). The Claims Court therefore falls within the statutory language of section 2412(b). <em>Cf. Essex Elec-tro Engineers, Inc. v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 247, 250-52 (Fed.Cir.1985) (Claims Court qualifies as a \u201ccourt having jurisdiction of such [civil] action\u201d within section 2412(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">The government nevertheless contends that the Claims Court acted without jurisdiction with regard to the award of attorney fees and costs. It argues that the court awarded the discovery sanction against the United States pursuant to its own rules of procedure, the RUSCC, rather than the FRCP; that RUSCC 37 is not a \u201cstatute which specifically provides for such an award\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b); and that therefore the government has not waived its sovereign immunity to such an award. In essence, the government\u2019s position is that because the abuse of discovery occurred in the Claims Court, the court in which the government appears in one hundred percent of cases, the government cannot therein be held to the same high standards of behavior to which private litigants are held, and to which it uniformly is held in other federal courts. Presumably, the government\u2019s argument extends to all of the fee-shifting provisions in the Claims Court\u2019s rules, such that the United States</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-11\">could not be sanctioned under [RUSCC] 11 for violation of signature requirements, under [RUSCC] 16(f) for failure to abide by a pretrial order, under [RUSCC] 26(g) for abusive discovery, under [RUSCC] 30(g) for failure to attend a deposition, under [RUSCC] 37(c) for improper failure to admit, or under [RUSCC] 56(h) for making an affidavit in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\"><em>M.A. Mortenson Co., </em>15 Cl.Ct. at 364. We disagree with the government\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">Acting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2503(b) (1988), which codified congressional authority for the Claims Court to prescribe its own rules of practice and procedure, the Claims Court promulgated RUSCC 37(a)(4), which adopted in pertinent part the <em>entirety </em>of Rule 37(a)(4) of the FRCP. <em>See, e.g., Croskey v. United States, </em>24 Cl.Ct. 420, 422 n. 2 (1991) (RUSCC 15(a) \u201cmirrors, in all material aspects, [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 15(a)\u201d); <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>91 B.R. 604, 608-09 (Bankr.N. D.Fla.1988) (Bankruptcy Rule 9011 \u201cadopts [Fed.R.Civ.P. 11] with minor changes to make the text of the rule appropriate to bankruptcy cases.\u201d). Thus, unlike the United States district courts, which lack the power to promulgate their own rules, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2071, 2072 (1988), Congress authorized the Claims Court to adopt its rules without the need for supervisory or statutory oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-15\">It is well established that a court\u2019s procedural rules promulgated pursuant to statutory authorization are deemed to have the force and effect of law. <em>See, e.g., Weil v. Neary, </em>278 U.S. 160, 169, 49 S.Ct. 144, 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>73 L.Ed. 243 (1929) (citing <em>Rio Grande Irrigation &amp; Colonization Co. v. Gildersleeve, </em>174 U.S. 603, 608, 19 S.Ct. 761, 762, 43 L.Ed. 1103 (1899)); <em>Fairfield Gloves v. United States, </em>73 F.R.D. 133, 138 (Cust.Ct.1976) (\u201cRules of court adopted in conformity with authority delegated by statute to make rules of practice, pleading, and procedure have the same force and effect as if expressly included in the statute.\u201d), <em>ajfd, 558 </em>F.2d 1023 (CCPA 1977). This position is only strengthened when the rule in question specifically adopts its corresponding FRCP, which itself was proposed by the Supreme Court and implicit ly adopted by Congress. More important, however, is the fact that the rule, once adopted by the court, is binding on both the court and the parties litigating before the court, such that a party other than the United States would be liable under that rule. Thus, under the statutory language of section 2412(b), the government must also be held liable, since the \u201cUnited States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">In light of the above analysis and Congress\u2019 intention that a court be allowed \u201cin its discretion to award fees against the United States to the same extent it may presently award such fees against other parties,\u201d H.R.Rep. 1418 at 6, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4984, we find no basis on which to differentiate between the abilities of the federal district courts and the Claims Court to award monetary sanctions for abuse of discovery against the United States pursuant to either the FRCP or the RUSCC. Further, we emphasize and embrace the precedent that the requisite waiver of sovereign immunity for an award of attorney fees against the United States pursuant to RUSCC 37 exists in section 2412(b) and not in the terms of RUSCC 37 itself. <em>See In re Good Hope Indus., Inc., </em>886 F.2d at 482; <em>Adamson, </em>855 F.2d at 670-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">As a practical matter, the United States seeks to deny to a private litigant that which Congress freely gave. In creating the Claims Court and enacting the Tucker Act and the Contract Disputes Act, Congress provided a forum in which the public could bring suit against the government and expect the opportunity for a fair fight over the merits of the claims. We cannot accept the government\u2019s position that it can consent to suit in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act and the Contract Disputes Act, and yet simultaneously may abuse the litigative process to the impairment of fair adjudication. We reject the notion that the government can frustrate and undermine the goals in creating such a tribunal, leaving the Claims Court itself helpless to preclude such conduct on the government\u2019s part, and thereby eliminating the possibility of achieving a \u201cfair\u201d result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Because the United States has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to an award of attorney fees under RUSCC 37,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1119-20\">.

During oral argument, the government agreed that the Claims Court can police compliance with its discovery orders by entering a default judgment against the offending party. This court has noted the draconian nature of such judgments and the infrequency with which they properly may be entered. <em>Hendler v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364, 1382 (Fed.Cir.1991). To encourage a more common use of default judgments against the government when it abuses the discovery process would only warp the playing field which Congress levelled by enacting section 2412(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">.
