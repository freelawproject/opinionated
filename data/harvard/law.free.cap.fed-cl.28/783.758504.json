The Claims Court (1) altered the contracting officer\u2019s calculations to increase the quantum of delay damages awarded to Melvin Wilner, d/b/a Wilner Construction Company (Wilner), by $26,-271.49 plus interest, (2) denied a claim for further delay compensation asserted by Wil-ner, and (3) rejected the government\u2019s claims for repayment of $133,094.79 in delay compensation already paid to Wilner. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-16\">Wilner was engaged by the government to construct an Operational Trainer Facility at Camp Pendleton, California, pursuant to Contract No. N62474-83-C-2280. The undertaking experienced delays which postponed the project\u2019s completion by 447 days. Wilner then filed a claim with the Navy\u2019s contracting officer, William Lindstrom, to recover the additional costs resulting from the project\u2019s delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">Wilner\u2019s claim was principally directed to delay costs arising from: 1) the duct revision work; 2) the open web joist (OWJ) revision work; and 3) the smoke detector work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wilner alleged that the delay had been caused by the government. Contracting Officer Lindstrom awarded Wilner compensation based upon 260 days of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-18\">On review before the Claims Court, Wilner presented evidence relating to the critical path of the project. However, the court determined that the evidence presented by Wilner was inadequate to establish the project\u2019s critical path. The court also heard the testimony of Contracting Officer Lindstrom who was called as a witness by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The Claims Court found, based only on the evidence presented by Wilner, that: 1) the compensable critical path delay attributable to the Navy and arising from the duct revision work totaled only 91 days; and 2) the compensable critical path delay resulting from the OWJ and smoke detector revision work was unascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The court made clear throughout its decision that the best evidence to establish the government\u2019s responsibility for delay beyond 91 days would be a critical path analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While no such analysis was ever presented, the court perceived more compensable delay than what Wilner had been able to establish. Accordingly, the court then went on to consider the next best available evidence presented at trial in an effort to ascertain the actual amount of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">First, the court considered the contracting officer\u2019s decision to issue unilateral modifications. The contracting officer had issued unilateral contract modifications granting Wilner extensions of time. Wilner argued that these modifications constituted an admission by the contracting officer that the delays were the fault of the government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the Claims Court disagreed and gave no evidentiary weight to the contracting officer\u2019s decision to issue unilateral modifications. The court next considered the trial testimony of the contracting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Contracting Officer Lindstrom, who was called as a witness by the government, testified as to the factual basis or foundation behind his final decision. Specifically, Mr. Lindstrom testified that his final decision was based in part upon the results of a technical review performed by the Navy\u2019s Engineering Construction Division as well as the opinions of a Navy \u201ctechnical analyst, his consultant, and counsel who conducted a legal review of the technical analysis\u201d each of whom thought compensation was due.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Lindstrom also testified that he was convinced, after weighing the arguments of both parties equally, that 260 days of compensable delay had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">Upon consideration, the Claims Court rejected Wilner\u2019s claim for added delay compensation but altered the contracting officer\u2019s delay calculations slightly to increase the quantum of delay damages already awarded, based upon 259, rather than 260 days of delay, by $26,271.49. The Claims Court also denied the government\u2019s claim for reimbursement of the delay compensation already paid to Wilner. In so ruling, the court rejected the government\u2019s contention that recovery was precluded by Wilner\u2019s inadequate critical path analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">The government moved post-trial for leave to amend its answer and asserted another claim seeking repayment of $133,094.79 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>delay-based compensation received by Wil-ner. However, the court held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear that claim. The government now appeals alleging that the Claims Court failed to make a proper de novo review of the contracting officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Where both parties to a contract contribute to delay, neither can recover damages, unless there is in the proof a clear apportionment of the delay and the expense attributable to each party. <em>Blinderman Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>695 F.2d 552, 559 (Fed.Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Coath &amp; Goss, Inc. v. United States, </em>101 Ct.Cl. 702, 714-15 (1944)). Thus, there can be no recovery by a contractor where the government\u2019s delay is concurrent or intertwined with other delays. <em>Commerce Int\u2019l Co. v. United States, </em>167 Ct.Cl. 529, 338 F.2d 81, 90 (1964); <em>Marshall v. United States, </em>143 Ct.Cl. 51, 164 F.Supp. 221, 224 (1958). The determination of delay causation is a question of fact. <em>J.D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>171 Ct.Cl. 70, 347 F.2d 235, 245 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">In the present case, the Claims Court found that the best evidence for establishing delay causation would be a critical path analysis. However, such an analysis was not introduced at trial. Accordingly, the Claims Court relied on the testimony of the contracting officer as the next best evidence available to establish delay causation. The government suggests that the contracting officer\u2019s testimony is inadmissible hearsay because it refers to: 1) the opinions of subordinates; and 2) a technical report which was not entered into evidence. The government is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">Under Rule 801(c) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement is not hearsay if it is not \u201coffered in evidence for the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Here, the contracting officer\u2019s testimony is not hearsay because it was not offered to establish that the opinions or the technical report were accurate. Rather, the testimony was offered to explain the basis or foundation behind the contracting officer\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>M. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 6705 (interim ed. 1992); <em>cf. United States v. Blan-dina, </em>895 F.2d 293, 300-01 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that statements offered to show that the listener conducted an adequate investigation are not hearsay). Also, even if the statements were hearsay, under Rule 103(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the government would be estopped from raising the issue on appeal since it was not timely raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">A contracting officer\u2019s findings of fact are \u201cnot binding in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a) (1988). The contracting officer merely provides an effective, nonjudicial first step in the dispute resolution process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Claims Court reviews contracting officer decisions de novo. <em>Assurance Co. v. United States, </em>813 F.2d 1202, 1206 (Fed.Cir.1987) (\u201c[W]here an appeal is taken to a board or court, the contracting officer\u2019s award is not to be treated as if it were the unappealed determination of a lower tribunal which is owed special deference or acceptance on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">However, contracting officer testimony is not without value. It constitutes evidence which may be considered and weighed by a reviewing tribunal in the same way as any other piece of evidence. <em>J.D. Hedin Constr., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>347 F.2d at 245; <em>Lathan Co. v. United States, </em>20 Cl.Ct. 122, 125 (1990). <em>See also Elmore Moving &amp; Storage, Inc. v. United States, </em>845 F.2d 1001, 1003 (Fed.Cir.1988); <em>Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, </em>803 F.2d 701, 704 (Fed.Cir.1986); <em>CACI, Inc. v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1567, 1579 (Fed.Cir.1983); Hoel-<em>Steffen Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>231 Ct.Cl. 128, 684 F.2d 843, 847 (Fed.Cir.1982); <em>Churchill Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>221 Ct.Cl. 284, 602 F.2d 358, 365 n. 8 (Fed.Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Here, the Claims Court could not ascertain, based upon the information presented by Wilner, whether the government was responsible for all of the alleged delay. The Claims Court determined that the evidence presented by the contractor, <em>taken alone, </em>entitled Wilner to only 91 days of compensatory delay. Accordingly, the court then considered the contracting officer\u2019s trial testimony to determine what weight, if any, it should be given as evidence of causation for the disputed periods of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">There is nothing in the Contract Disputes Act or the rules of evidence to prohibit the consideration of a contracting officer\u2019s testimony when ruling on liability or quantum. The court, in its role as fact finder, gave the contracting officer\u2019s testimony weight, not deference. Accordingly, the court did conduct a de novo review of the contracting officer\u2019s findings of fact when it found that Wilner was entitled to 259 days of compensa-ble delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Mr. Lindstrom testified that he relied \u201cprimarily\u201d on the \u201ctechnical review\u201d performed by the Engineering Construction Division, and that he relied on his consultants. Mr. Lindstrom also testified that he had no specific recollection at trial of the documents he reviewed in making his decision several years earlier. <em>See supra notes </em>6, 7. However, these considerations would seem to go more toward the proper weight that Mr. Lind-strom\u2019s testimony should be given rather than to whether the court below conducted a proper de novo review as required under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(3). Reliance on technical reports prepared by specialists, and the expert opinions of consultants, are not unusual in government. <em>See </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-2(c) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">A similar case to that presented here is the aforementioned <em>Assurance Company v. United States. </em>In <em>Assurance, </em>the Federal Circuit was asked to review a decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (board) relating to whether the board could reduce two damage awards made by the contracting officer. 813 F.2d at 1206. As in the present case, the government called the contracting officer as a witness. However, the contracting officer\u2019s testimony in <em>Assurance </em>cast doubt upon his own final decision. Based upon that testimony, the board rejected one of the contracting officer\u2019s damage, awards and reduced the amount of the other. <em>Id, </em>at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">On appeal, the Federal Circuit determined \u201cfrom the face of the Disputes Act that a contract appeals board can, with respect to a contracting officer\u2019s decision that has been appealed to it, reduce as well as increase the award made by that contracting officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206. The court then affirmed the board\u2019s decision. <em>Id, </em>at 1207. In doing so, the court noted that, as to the first award, the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence since the contracting officer\u2019s testimony had discredited his earlier decision, <em>id. </em>at 1206, and as for the second award, the board\u2019s decision was likewise supported by substantial evidence since the contracting officer testified that he had \u201coverstated\u201d that award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">The present case differs only slightly from <em>Assurance. </em>As in <em>Assurance, </em>the trial court considered the statement of the presiding contracting officer who testified as to the reasoning behind his decision. However, in the present case, the contracting officer\u2019s testimony confirmed rather than discredited the contracting officer\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">Finally, the United States Court of Claims, to whose precedent we are bound, <em>South Corp. v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1982) (in banc), has distinguished contracting officer decisions which are adverse to the contractor from those which are favorable. <em>See </em>John Cibinic, Jr. &amp; Ralph C. Nash, Jr., <em>Administration of Government Contracts </em>1001-02 (2d ed. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>A contracting officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law which are adverse to the contractor have not been entitled to a presumption of validity, <em>see Southwest Welding &amp; Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 925, 413 F.2d 1167, 1184-85 (1969); <em>L. Rosenman Corp. v. United States, </em>182 Ct.Cl. 586, 390 F.2d 711, 712 n. 2 (1968), whereas decisions favorable to the contractor have been held to constitute an \u201cevidentiary admission\u201d of liability. <em>Dean Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 62, 411 F.2d 1238, 1245 (1969); <em>Robert E. Lee &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>164 Ct.Cl. 365, 370 (1964); <em>Vulcan Rail &amp; Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>158 Ct.Cl. 234, 241 (1962); <em>George A. Fuller Co. v. United States, </em>108 Ct.Cl. 70, 94, 69 F.Supp. 409 (1947); <em>J.D. Hedin Constr., </em>347 F.2d at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The justification for this distinction is that a decision of a contracting officer which is favorable to the contractor can be viewed as a government admission against interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the court explained almost 50 years ago in <em>Irwin &amp; Leighton v. United States, </em>101 Ct.Cl. 455, 475 (1944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-5\">It is true that we are not bound by the findings of the contracting officer in a claim for damages due to delay, but there is a strong presumption that the delay was not less than that found. The contracting officer, or his representative, had day to day contact with the work and was in the best position of anyone, except the contractor, to know the extent of the delay. He is supposed to weigh the facts with an even hand before rendering his decision; but it cannot be overlooked that he is the defendant\u2019s selection and its own employee. He is not apt to err on the side of the contractor and against his employer, whose interests he is employed to guard and protect. Unless the clear weight of the evidence shows the delay was less than that found by him, we think defendant is bound by his finding. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">It is arguable that this reasoning, which originated long before the enactment of the Contract Disputes Act, does not apply to Claims Court suits. Nevertheless, we adhere to the belief that a contracting officer decision which is favorable to a contractor can logically be considered an evidentiary admission by the government \u2014 and that this position does not run afoul of the requirement under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(3) that contracting officer decisions be reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Here, the contracting officer\u2019s decision, which established 260 rather than 91 days of delay, was favorable to the contractor. Accordingly, that decision constitutes a strong evidentiary admission, subject to rebuttal, of the extent of the government\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">The Claims Court did conduct a proper de novo review of the contracting officer\u2019s decision. That decision was properly considered by the Claims Court as evidence tending to prove compensable delay, and the government failed to overcome that finding. Accordingly, the decision of the Claims Court is</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-1\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">. <em>Wilner </em>v. <em>United States, 26 </em>Cl.Ct. 260 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">. The Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-572, \u00a7 902(a), 106 Stat. 4506, 4516, changed the name of the United States Claims Court to the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1043-19\">. Compensation was also requested for weather related delays; however, the government does not challenge that portion of the Claims Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">. As to the duct work, the Claims Court stated: \"Without a critical path analysis, the court cannot exclude the possibility that the contractor caused concurrent delay on the project\" Regarding the OWJ revision work, the court stated: \"The absence of a critical path analysis prevents the court from discerning whether the OWJ design defect may have been discovered earlier, but for a delay of the contractor. ... The evidence relating to the OWJ revision work is insufficient for this court to attribute critical path delay to the Navy.\u201d Finally, with regard to the smoke detector work, the court likewise stated: \"The absence of a critical path analysis for the project prevents the court from determining that critical path delay, attributable to the Navy, occurred with respect to the smoke detector work.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">. The grant of an extension of time by a contracting officer may carry with it the administrative admission that the delays resulted through no fault of the contractor. <em>J.D. Hedin Constr.

At trial, the court asked Mr. Lindstrom whether he had any independent evaluation of the project's critical path. In his response, Mr. Lind-strom explained that he had made his own evaluation, but that this case required him to rely on the expertise of his subordinates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-14\">Now, I did not go back into this whole thing and examine everything in detail. I believe it's quite obvious from the document that I relied very heavily upon the content of the conclusions of the Analyst that I was using. One of the reasons being that there was a part of this claim that spoke to how much Mr. Wilner was worth per year, per hour, per day. And I felt that I had absolutely no expertise in that particular area at all, and therefore I tended to stay away from this part of the \u2014 of the analysis and relied upon my Consultants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-15\">The documents referred to by Mr. Lindstrom were before the Claims Court, although apparently not entered into evidence by the government, which had called Mr. Lindstrom as a witness. There is no suggestion that these government-generated documents were otherwise in the possession of the contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">.

The Court of Claims has described government admissions against interest as \"pieces of evidence in favor of the contractor, to be weighed along with the other evidence\" but which, when contradicted by other more direct, convincing evidence, are of \"little weight\u201d. <em>Winston Bros. v.

Litigation is not free, and the charges arising from costs and attorney fees can be considerable. Thus, a contractor may not be quick to incur the expense of litigation to appeal a favorable decision, especially since (1) such litigation would place the amount already awarded by the contracting officer at risk, and (2) the contracting officer\u2019s decision would not tend to establish entitlement to compensation beyond that which was already awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">.

I believe that the Claims Court erred as a matter of law by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>failing to employ the approach of a de novo proceeding, which is mandated by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 601-613 (1988 &amp; Supp. I 1993) (CDA or Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">In response to Wilner\u2019s claims, the contracting officer made an award to Wilner based upon 260 calendar days of delay. Subsequently, Wilner brought a direct action suit in the Claims Court under the CDA. In the Claims Court, Wilner alleged that government conduct was the legal cause of <em>all </em>of the delay to the project: from October 1, 1986 (the original contract completion date) through January 19, 1988 (the date of contract completion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">Following a careful and thorough review of the evidence adduced at trial, however, the Claims Court concluded that the only critical path delay attributable to the government extended from February 27,1987, to May 29, 1987, a total of 91 calendar days. <em>Wilner v. United States, </em>26 Cl.Ct. 260, 275-77 (1992). Having so concluded, the Claims Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-7\">The problem that the court perceives is that its determinations thus far reflect the government-caused delays <em>as proved by plaintiff at trial, </em>rather than what the court perceives, <em>but plaintiff failed to prove, </em>to be the actual government-caused delays.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 277 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">Further on in its opinion, the Claims Court explained that, \u201c[d]ue to the absence of a critical path analysis,\u201d and without considering the contracting officer\u2019s decision, it was \u201cunable to determine whether delays caused by the Navy were properly compensable as critical path delays.\u201d 26 Cl.Ct. at 279. The Claims Court then turned to the contracting officer\u2019s decision, in which, as noted above, the contracting officer awarded Wilner compensation based upon 260 calendar days of delay. The Claims Court described the contracting officer\u2019s decision as \u201cevidence before the court that must be considered and weighed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After summarizing the contracting officer\u2019s testimony explaining how he had reached his decision, the Claims Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s failure to present a critical path analysis at trial is an insufficient basis to reject the contracting officer\u2019s determinations of critical path delay days based on the technical analysis [presented to the contracting officer].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\"><em>Id, </em>The Claims Court then went on to make an award to Wilner based upon 259 calendar days of government-caused critical path delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-17\">The CDA provides that \u201c[a]ll claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a). As far as the contracting officer\u2019s decision is concerned, the Act states that \u201c[s]pecific findings of fact are not required, but, if made, shall not be binding in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CDA further provides that, after a contracting officer renders a decision upon a claim, a contractor may bring an action directly on the claim in the Court of Federal Claims. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(1). In the Court of Federal Claims, the action proceeds \u201cde novo in accordance with the rules of the court....\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-18\">In <em>Assurance Co. v. United States, </em>813 F.2d 1202 (Fed.Cir.1987), this court addressed the question of the status of a contracting officer\u2019s decision under the CDA. The issue in <em>Assurance </em>was whether the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (Board) could legally reduce a contracting officer\u2019s award to a contractor when the contractor, dissatisfied with the award, brought an action before the Board. The court concluded that, under the CDA, the Board did have the power to reduce the contracting officer\u2019s award. In reaching its conclusion, the court looked to the provisions of the CDA cited above which state that findings of fact by a contracting officer are not binding in any subsequent court proceeding, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a), and that in a court action on a contracting officer\u2019s decision, the suit is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>proceed de novo. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(3). In addressing the de novo nature of the proceedings under the CDA, the <em>Assurance </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-4\">[T]he Disputes Act itself suggests that, where an appeal is taken to a board or court, the contracting officer\u2019s award is not to be treated as if it were the unappealed determination of a lower tribunal which is owed special deference or acceptance on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">813 F.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The plain language of the CDA and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Assurance </em>make it clear that when suit is brought following a contracting officer\u2019s decision, the findings of fact in that decision are not binding upon the parties and are not entitled to any deference. Put another way, once an action is brought following a contracting officer\u2019s decision, the parties start in court with a clean slate. This means that when, as here, the claim being asserted by the contractor is based upon alleged government-caused delay, the contractor has the burden of proving the extent of the delay, that the delay was proximately caused by government action, and that the delay harmed the contractor. <em>See, e.g., William F. Klingensmith, Inc. v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 805, 809 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Blinderman Constr. Co. v. United States, 695 </em>F.2d 552, 559 (Fed.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">The plain language of the CDA and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Assurance </em>also make it clear that, in court litigation, a contractor is not entitled to the benefit of any presumption arising from the contracting officer\u2019s decision. Rather, the contractor has the burden of proving the fundamental facts of liability and damages de novo. In this case, however, the Claims Court gave the contractor the benefit of just such a presumption. After reading <em>J.D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>171 Ct.Cl. 70, 347 F.2d 235 (1965), as indicating that \u201cthe findings of a contracting officer are entitled to a strong presumption of validity, subject to rebuttal,\u201d <em>Wilner, </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 277, and after stating that Wilner had failed to carry its burden of proof with respect to alleged government-caused delay, <em>id., </em>the Claims Court stated that Wilner\u2019s failure to present a critical path analysis was \u201can insufficient basis to reject the contracting officer\u2019s determinations of critical path delay days based on the technical analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279. Thus, contrary to the mandate of the CDA that a contracting officer\u2019s findings of fact are not \u201cbinding in any subsequent proceeding,\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a), and contrary to the conclusion in <em>Assurance </em>that a contracting officer\u2019s award is owed neither \u201cspecial deference [nor] acceptance on appeal,\u201d the Claims Court accorded the contracting officer\u2019s findings a presumption of validity, which it weighed against the evidence at trial, thereby allowing Wilner to escape the consequences of its failure to meet its burden of proof. In my view, this approach constituted error because it was contrary to the concept of proceeding de novo, which is mandated by the CDA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the Claims Court conducted a de novo review because it gave \u201cweight\u201d to the contracting officer\u2019s testimony. Opinion at 787. I believe that a review of the pertinent portion of the Claims Court\u2019s opinion \u2014 which appears under the heading \u201cContracting Officer\u2019s final <em>decision\u201d</em>\u2014Wilner, 26 Cl.Ct. at 279, reveals that, in fact, what the court did was rely upon the contracting officer\u2019s decision, not the testimony of the contracting officer at trial. The Claims Court\u2019s opinion makes it quite clear that Contracting Officer Lindstrom did not offer testimony which independently established the determination of 260 calendar days of government-caused delay. Indeed, Mr. Lindstrom had no firsthand knowledge of the events that transpired during performance of the contract, and no specific recollection of the documents he reviewed in making his decision. Rather, Mr. Lindstrom testified to the general practices within his office and the bases for his final decision. In short, Mr. Lindstrom explained what he relied upon for the conclusions in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>final decision. His testimony, however, added nothing to, and provided no support for, those conclusions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The majority rests its affirmance of the Claims Court\u2019s decision upon the proposition that \u201ca contracting officer decision which is favorable to a contractor can logically be considered an evidentiary admission by the government____\u201d From this proposition, the majority concludes that the contracting officer\u2019s decision in this case constituted \u201ca strong evidentiary admission, subject to rebuttal, of the extent of the government\u2019s liability.\u201d For its position, the majority relies upon the authority of <em>Dean Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 62, 74, 411 F.2d 1238, 1245 (1969); <em>J.D. Hedin Constr. Co., supra, </em>171 Ct.Cl. at 83-84, 347 F.2d at 245; <em>Robert E. Lee &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>164 Ct.Cl. 365, 370 (1964); <em>Vulcan Rail &amp; Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>158 Ct.Cl. 234, 241 (1962); <em>George </em>A. <em>Fuller Co. v. United States, </em>108 Ct.Cl. 70, 94, 69 F.Supp. 409 (1947); and <em>Irwin &amp; Leighton v. United States, </em>101 Ct.Cl. 455, 475 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">In my view, the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Dean, Hedin, Robert E. Lee, Vulcan, Fuller, </em>and <em>Irwin &amp; Leighton </em>is misplaced. The most recent of these cases predates the effective date of the CDA by almost ten years, and \u201c[w]ith the passage of the [CDA], a new era in the resolution of government contracts emerged.\u201d <em>Tuttle/White Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>228 Ct.Cl. 354, 357, 656 F.2d 644, 646 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Most importantly, the view which these cases take of the legal effect of a contracting officer\u2019s decision is at odds with the plain language of the Act. That language provides that \u201c[s]pecific findings, of fact [by the contracting officer] ... shall not be binding in any subsequent proceeding,\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a), and that an action in court on a claim \u201cshall proceed de novo____\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(a)(3). Contrary to section 605(a), the majority opinion makes a contracting officer\u2019s findings binding upon the government as admissions in a subsequent proceeding unless they are rebutted. Likewise, I do not think that a court proceeding on a claim can fairly be termed \u201cde novo\u201d within the meaning of section 609(a)(3) if the government is said to enter the proceeding fettered by the proposition that the contracting officer\u2019s decision on the claim \u201cconstitutes a strong evi-dentiary admission, subject to rebuttal, of the extent of the government\u2019s liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-18\">Finally, I believe that today\u2019s decision could have unfortunate consequences for the resolution of government contract disputes. First of all, the decision adds a complicating factor to litigation under the CDA In certain cases, judges of the Court of Federal Claims and the boards of contract appeals will now have to engage in the preliminary activity of weighing evidence. They will have to do so in order to determine whether a \u201cstrong evidentiary admission\u201d in favor of the contractor arising from findings of the contracting officer has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-19\">Second, the CDA was intended to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Government Procurement. <em>Paragon Energy Corp. v. United States, </em>227 Ct.Cl. 176, 185, 645 F.2d 966, 972 (1981). One of those recommendations was to \u201c[e]mpower contracting agencies to settle and pay ... all claims or disputes arising under or growing out of or in connection with the administration or performance of contracts entered into by the United States.\u201d 4 Report of the Commission on Government Procurement at 22. In addition, it has been recognized that one of the purposes of the CDA\u2019s certification requirement is to \u201cencourage settlements.\u201d <em>Folk Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>226 Ct.Cl. 602, 604 (1981). I believe that an unintended result of today\u2019s decision could be that, contrary to the intent of Congress, it will become more difficult to resolve contract disputes before the contracting officer, with the result that more time and money will be spent in board and court litigation by both the government and contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-20\">The reason I say this is that I believe today\u2019s decision creates an incentive for contractors to litigate rather than settle and a disincentive for contracting officers to make partial awards in response to contractor claims. By permitting a contractor to use a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>partial award as evidence, we create an incentive for the contractor to litigate rather than settle. We do so because we increase the contractor\u2019s chances of getting the government\u2019s partial award \u2014 in effect, the government\u2019s initial offer \u2014 as its recovery floor. With its downside risk lessened, the contractor\u2019s upside gain may not need to be great before it is in the contractor\u2019s interest to litigate rather than settle. Likewise, if a contracting officer knows that a decision making a partial award to a contractor constitutes \u201ca strong evidentiary admission, [albeit] subject to rebuttal, of the extent of the government\u2019s liability,\u201d it is not unreasonable to expect that he or she will decide not to risk tying the government\u2019s hands in subsequent litigation by issuing a decision which could give rise to such an admission. In short, I believe that a result of today\u2019s decision could well be that fewer cases will settle and that there will be fewer partial awards to contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Claims Court and would remand the case to the Court of Federal Claims for a computation of the award, if any, to which Wilner is entitled, based upon the determination. of the Claims Court, following a review of the evidence at trial, that the government was responsible for 91 calendar days of critical path delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"aid-dedup-0\">Aug. 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The appellant, the United States, having filed a petition for rehearing, and a response thereto having been invited by the court and filed by the appellee, and the petition for rehearing having been referred to the panel that heard the appeal and denied, and thereafter the suggestion for rehearing in banc and response having been referred to the circuit judges who are in regular active service,</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">Upon consideration thereof, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">ORDERED that the suggestion for rehearing in banc be, and the same hereby is, accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the judgment of the court entered on May 24, 1993, is vacated and that the opinions of the court accompanying the said judgment are withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Additional briefing and argument are not indicated at this time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">.

Moreover, as noted in <em>Assurance, </em>Court of Claims precedent after <em>Hedin </em>held that, in the event of an appeal to a board of contract appeals under the Disputes clause of a government contract, the contracting officer\u2019s decision was deemed \"vacated\" and enjoyed \"no presumptive validity whatever.\u201d <em>Southwest Welding &amp; Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 925, 954, 413 F.2d 1167, 1184-85 (1969). \"There is no reason to believe that in enacting the Contract Disputes Act, Congress intended to change this established rule.\u201d <em>Assurance, </em>813 F.2d at 1206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">. As a general proposition, I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s statement that \"contracting officer testimony is not without value.\u201d Opinion at 787. What I would say, though, is that in this case, that proposition is not relevant. The reason is that, as just discussed, the Claims Court\u2019s decision is based upon the contracting officer\u2019s decision, not his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
