United States, </em>23 Cl.Ct. 483 (1991). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The single issue raised in this appeal is whether the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes of Title 5 sanction payment of Sunday premium pay for periods of authorized annual or sick leave taken by employees who are regularly scheduled to work on Sunday, but who do not actually work on the leave-taken days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Appellees in this case, all of whom are either present or former federal police officers at various federal facilities, filed suit in the Claims Court claiming, pursuant to the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes, a right to receive, <em>inter alia, </em>Sunday premium pay for regularly scheduled Sunday hours even though absent from work on authorized annual or sick leave.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The Claims Court concluded that under this court\u2019s precedent in <em>Lanehart v. Horner, </em>818 F.2d 1574 (Fed.Cir.1987), the plaintiffs had a right to receive Sunday premium pay for regularly scheduled hours which were not worked, but for which they were charged with annual or sick leave, and granted summary judgment thereon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anb-dedup-0\">The court [in <em>Lanehart </em>] in effect found that the leave with pay statutes overcome the limitation that employees must actually have worked the hours to have them counted in the overtime calculations. The result should be the same here. Plaintiffs are entitled to Sunday premium pay [for Sunday hours] which [were] not worked but for which leave was charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\"><em>Armitage, </em>23 Cl.Ct. at 493. The government timely appealed the judgment with respect to Sunday premium pay to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. National Cable Television Ass\u2019n v. American Cinema Editors, Inc., </em>937 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1991); <em>Mingus Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 1387, 1391 (Fed.Cir.1987). The issue of statutory interpretation is also a question of law, which this court reviews <em>de novo. Commercial Energies, Inc. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed.Cir.1991); <em>Pasteur v. United States, </em>814 F.2d 624, 626 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">The pertinent \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes of Title 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> originally enacted as part of the Act of Sept. 6, 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378 (codified as amended in various sections of 5 U.S.C. (1988)), entitle an employee to \u201cleave with pay\u201d for authorized periods of leave. In <em>Lanehart, </em>the court defined \u201cpay\u201d as used in the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes to mean \u201cthe total compensation or remuneration normally and regularly received by an employee.\u201d 818 F.2d at 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">The Sunday premium pay statute, originally enacted simultaneously with the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes, reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ9\">An employee who <em>performs work </em>during a regularly-scheduled 8-hour period of service ... a part of which is <em>performed </em>on Sunday is entitled to pay for the entire period of service at the rate of his basic pay, plus premium pay at a rate equal to 25 percent of his rate of basic pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5546(a) (1988) (emphasis added). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interpreted this statute to require that an employee must actually perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>work on Sunday before becoming eligible for Sunday premium pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">The definition[ ] of Sunday ... work ... [has] been modified to clarify that the <em>work must be performed by the employee </em>to be payable at premium rates____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">If a full-time employee <em>performs work </em>on Sunday, he or she is entitled to Sunday pay if the Sunday work was scheduled as part of his or her basic 40-hour workweek____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">48 Fed.Reg. 3931 (Jan. 28, 1983) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.103(o) (1992) (\u201cSunday work\u201d defined as \u201cnon-overtime work performed by an employ-ee____\u201d). This case requires us to determine the relationship between the Sunday premium pay statute and the authorized sick and annual \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes, a task remarkably similar to that confronting the court in <em>Lanehart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In <em>Lanehart, </em>we addressed the issue of whether the statutes in Title 5 authorizing federal employees to receive \u201cleave with pay\u201d entitled federal firefighters to undiminished pay for pay-periods in which authorized leave was taken in lieu of performing work for which they would have been eligible to receive overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Pub.L. No. 718, ch. 676, 52 Stat. 1060 (codified as amended by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-259, 88 Stat. 55, at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219 (1988)) (FLSA). The case necessarily addressed the apparent tension between the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes and FLSA\u2019s requirement that only those hours during which the employee is actually on duty are includable as hours worked for the purpose of calculating FLSA overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">In <em>Lanehart, </em>the government attempted to rely on an OPM directive instructing federal agencies on the application of the FLSA to federal employees. Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter No. 551-5 Attachment 2 (Jan. 15, 1975) (Ltr. 551-5 Attach. 2), as far as the government was concerned, specifically addressed the issue in <em>Lanehart </em>and required an employee to have actually worked the overtime before becoming entitled to receive overtime pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">Only those hours that the employee is actually on duty ... shall be included in hours worked under the FLSA. Paid time off during the work period ... shall <em>not </em>be included as hours worked [in computing FLSA overtime].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">Ltr. 551-5 Attach. 2, at 4 (emphasis in original); <em>Lanehart, </em>818 F.2d at 1576. We found this language to be inapposite, however, because instead of aiding interpretation of the \u201cleave with pay\u201d provisions of Title 5, it only pertained to interpreting the FLSA overtime provisions in Title 29. Whether or not overtime pay was recoverable under the FLSA was irrelevant to the issue of whether such premium pay was recoverable under the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 1578.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">Because paid leave was \u201ca matter of private contract between the parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.219(a)(1) (1978)), wholly independent of the FLSA, and because we interpreted Congress to have indicated that the term \u201cleave with pay\u201d requires that pay \u201cnot be diminished in any way\u201d while on leave, <em>id. </em>at 1582, we concluded that \u201cthe \u2018leave with pay\u2019 statutes ... <em>prevent any reduction in pay </em>in the customary and regular pay of the [firefighters], including overtime pay under Title 29 to which they would be entitled, when ... on authorized leave____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1583 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">The United States argues that we must distinguish this case from <em>Lanehart </em>on the grounds that the present case requires us to interpret only multiple sections of Title 5 of the United States Code rather than multiple sections of Title 5 and one section of Title 29, as in <em>Lanehart. </em>The government also relies on OPM\u2019s interpretations of the Sunday premium pay statute in its promulgated regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.219(a)(1), and directive, FPM Letter No. 550-16 (Aug. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>5, 1966) (Ltr. 550-16),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arguing that we should defer to OPM\u2019s explanation of the statute. The government\u2019s argument in a nutshell is that section 5546(a) requires that only \u201c[a]n employee who performs work\u201d is eligible to receive Sunday premium pay. An employee who is on authorized leave does not perform work. Therefore the employee is not entitled to receive Sunday premium pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Contrary to the government\u2019s position, this case must be decided on the basic principle underlying and compelling our decision in <em>Lanekart: </em>namely, that correct application of the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes prevents any reduction in customary and regular pay. The claimed distinction between <em>Lanekart </em>and the present case on the ground that all the statutes to be interpreted are in Title 5, or even that the statutes were all enacted as part of the same act, is feckless. As in <em>Lanekart, </em>we are faced with reading statutes potentially in conflict with one another in attempting to achieve harmony therebetween. The difficulty of this task is not altered by their existence in the same title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">At oral argument, however, the government stressed the fact that Congress, when it wished, knew how to provide for premium compensation for hours spent on authorized leave, which it did in at least one section of Title 5. Citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5545(a) (1988),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the government argued that the Sunday premium pay statute does not permit premium pay for hours not worked because the statute lacks language similar to that of section 5545(a). First, we note the possibility that explicit congressional language precluding premium compensation for hours of authorized leave, though not part of the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes, could work to prevent the appellees from prevailing in this case. Under the holding of <em>Lanekart, </em>however, namely that the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes prevent any reduction in pay for employees on authorized leave, we think the better reading of section 5545(a) is that Congress instead knows how to limit the amount of premium pay earned by an employee while on authorized leave, as evidenced by the language \u201cif the periods of leave with pay during a pay period total less than 8 hours.\u201d In contrast, section 5546(a) contains no such limitation on the recovery of Sunday premium pay and therefore does not explicitly preclude such pay for authorized leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">Also, as in <em>Lanekart, </em>the government\u2019s reliance on OPM\u2019s interpretations is to no avail. Ltr. 550-16 in this case, just as with Ltr. 551-5 Attach. 2 in <em>Lanekart, </em>expressly implements only the Sunday premium pay statute, and therefore as in <em>Lanekart, </em>does not aid our interpretation of the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes. Thus, consistent with and mandated by our decision in <em>Lanekart, </em>we hold as a matter of law that the appellees in this case are entitled to receive Sunday premium pay for hours regularly scheduled for work on Sunday, but which were not worked due to charged periods of authorized annual or sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">The only other ground upon which we could upset the Claims Court\u2019s summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>judgment would be if there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the federal police worked \u201cregularly scheduled\u201d hours such that they would fall within the scope of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Lane-hart, </em>818 F.2d at 1583 n. 17 (work in question required to be scheduled on a \u201cregularly recurring basis\u201d to qualify as \u201cpart of customary and regular pay\u201d). The government bases its factual challenge to the summary judgment solely on the language of several of the individuals\u2019 complaints, which state that they were scheduled for work on Sunday \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this ground was accompanied by sworn declarations attesting to the fact that Sundays were part of the appellees\u2019 regularly scheduled workweek. This evidence was unrebutted by the government at the motion for summary judgment. Upon presentation of such evidence, the burden of avoiding entry of summary judgment shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact precluding entry of such a judgment. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (summary judgment motion may be opposed by the nonmoving party by \u201cany of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves. . . .\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Since this burden was not met by the government in this case, summary judgment was appropriate. \u201cRegularly scheduled\u201d furthermore need not be interpreted as requiring scheduling on every single Sunday of each month. Rather, all that the language requires is that the scheduling be \u201cregular\u201d as opposed to intermittent. Finally, no challenge is made to the determination by the Claims Court that \u201cthe material facts as to liability are undisputed.\u201d <em>Armitage, </em>23 Cl.Ct. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Because the \u201cleave with pay\u201d statutes of Title 5 preclude any reduction in pay for hours regularly scheduled, but for which the employee is charged annual or sick leave, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">. The other issues raised below but not appealed were the plaintiffs\u2019 right, pursuant to the \"leave with pay\" statutes, to receive (i) pay for regularly scheduled overtime hours when leave is taken during the basic workday but when no leave is charged for the unworked overtime hours; and (ii) premium pay for regularly scheduled holiday hours when the holiday is not worked and no leave is charged. 23 Cl.Ct. at 484. The Claims Court granted the government\u2019s motions for summary judgment on both issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">.
