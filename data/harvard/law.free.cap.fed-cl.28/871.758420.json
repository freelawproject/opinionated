Murphy, a retired Air Force reserve officer, was unlawfully released from active duty based on incorrect military records, and ordering reinstatement, back pay and correction of military records. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-27\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-28\">Murphy received a commission as an officer in the United States Air Force Reserve on June 1,1959, and entered active duty as a second lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve on August 29, 1959. He remained on active duty until August 27, 1962, at which time he was voluntarily released to pursue a Master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>degree. On November 17, 1962, he was appointed a first lieutenant in the Indiana Air National Guard. He returned to active duty as a reserve officer in the Air Force on July 18, 1967, and was promoted to permanent major on February 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">At the end of the Vietnam War a Reserve Officer Screening Board (ROSB) was convened by the Secretary of the Air Force to select reserve officers for involuntary separation from active duty pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 681(a) (1970), which says: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this title, the Secretary concerned may at any time release a Reserve under his jurisdiction from active duty.\u201d Under the authority of this statute and Air Force Regulation (AFR) 36-12 1171,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Secretary issued a Letter of Instructions directing the ROSB to release the officers based on its review and overall ranking of their service records. Murphy was reviewed along with all other reserve officers serving on active duty in specified year groups with surplus officers, and was selected to be separated effective June 27, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">On October 29, 1975, Murphy filed an application with the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (board), seeking correction of alleged errors in his military record and reinstatement to active duty. The board denied his application in its entirety, stating that he had not provided sufficient evidence to establish probable error or injustice. Murphy filed a second application on November 22,1979; again the board declined to make changes to his military record or to reverse the ROSB\u2019s decision to discharge him. On review, the Claims Court held that there were errors in Murphy\u2019s personnel record and that the board\u2019s failure to correct them was arbitrary and capricious. It ordered that the record be corrected, and that Murphy be reinstated to active duty with pay retroactive to June 27, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Our initial inquiry is whether the Claims Court properly exercised its authority when it reached the merits of this case. Jurisdiction is proper under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), which provides that \u201c[t]he United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded ... upon ... any Act of Con-gress____\u201d Murphy\u2019s claim is founded on 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a)(1), which entitles an Air Force reserve officer on active duty to pay and allowances. Because he claims monetary relief, that he was entitled to compensation unless properly released from active duty, the Claims Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">However, the existence of jurisdiction does not confirm the court\u2019s ability to supply relief. Just as \u201c[a] grant of <em>jurisdiction </em>to issue compliance orders hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under all circumstances,\u201d <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 193, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2301, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (quoting <em>Hecht Co. v. Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 591, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944)), so too, here. The issue must also be justiciable; it must be within the competency of the court. Justiciability is distinct from jurisdiction; it depends on \u201cwhether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded.\u201d <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 198, 82 S.Ct. 691, 700, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). Justiciability is a particularly apt inquiry when one seeks review of military activities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-14\">[JJudges are not given the task of running the Army. The responsibility for setting up channels through which [] grievances can be considered and fairly settled rests upon the Congress and upon the President of the United States and his subordinates. The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"awq-dedup-0\"><em>Orloff v. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 93-94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953). Aside from the limited warrant of courts to invade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the military province, intrusion also raises a separation of powers issue. Congress and the Executive have primary authority and responsibility over matters military. \u201cWe do not sit as a committee of review, nor are we vested with the power of veto.\u201d <em>TVA, </em>437 U.S. at 194, 98 S.Ct. at 2302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Accordingly, we have recognized that there are \u201cthousands of [ ] routine personnel decisions regularly made by the services which are variously held nonjusticiable or beyond the competence or the jurisdiction of courts to wrestle with.\u201d <em>Voge v. United States, </em>844 F.2d 776, 780 (Fed.Cir.1988) (and cases cited). We have emphasized that judicial review is only appropriate where the Secretary\u2019s discretion is limited, and Congress has established \u201ctests and standards\u201d against which the court can measure his conduct. <em>See Sargisson v. United States, </em>913 F.2d 918, 922 (Fed.Cir.1990); <em>Voge, </em>844 F.2d at 780. Unless such a test or standard is provided, courts must abstain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">When the military is given unlimited discretion by Congress, it is nevertheless bound to follow its own procedural regulations if it chooses to implement some. <em>Sargisson, </em>913 F.2d at 921. But the utility of the distinction between procedural and substantive matters in assessing a court\u2019s ability to review military decisions should not be overemphasized. On procedural matters, the test or standard is inherent. A court may appropriately decide whether the military followed procedures because by their nature the procedures limit the military\u2019s discretion. The court is not called upon to exercise any discretion reserved for the military, it merely determines whether the procedures were followed by applying the facts to the statutory or regulatory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Murphy asked the Claims Court to correct his military records, which he asserts were compiled in violation of Air Force regulations. Then he asked the court to review the merits of his release from active duty which was based on the allegedly erroneous records. Because the Claims Court\u2019s authority to grant equitable relief such as the correction of military records is premised on the award of monetary relief, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court must first assess the justiciability of the separation by determining what limits were placed on the Secretary\u2019s discretion to release a reserve officer from active duty. This is explicitly controlled by <em>Sargisson, </em>913 F.2d 918. In that case, an Air Force reserve officer challenged his separation by the same ROSB which considered Murphy. Like Murphy, Sargis-son also argued that the ROSB considered erroneous military records in making its decision, and sought reinstatement and back pay. We held the Claims Court could not review the board\u2019s decision because \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s compliance with AFR 36-12 H 71 and the Letter of Instructions is beyond the ken of judicial competence; it is nonjusticiable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">Murphy argues that there is a significant difference between his case and <em>Sargisson, </em>because there the board conceded that the records contained errors and made the appropriate corrections before reviewing the ROSB\u2019s release decision. Here, Murphy contends the errors in his records remain and the board\u2019s review therefore was not based on accurate records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">We disagree with his premise. While we do not consider the merits of the trial court\u2019s action, the possibility of erroneous records does not transform an otherwise nonjusticia-ble action into a reviewable one. After the Claims Court reviewed and purported to correct the records, any additional corrective action it devised was the result of nothing more than speculation that the ROSB decision would have been different. \u201cA court lacks the special expertise needed to review reserve officers\u2019 records and rank them on the basis of relative merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922. The correction of allegedly erroneous records added nothing to the court\u2019s ability to second guess the military. There were still no tests or standards it could apply to determine whether the officer would have been released even on the court\u2019s version of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>We acknowledged this dilemma in <em>Voge, </em>which held that the Navy\u2019s decision to terminate a medical officer\u2019s Additional Special Pay (ASP) was a purely discretionary matter and nonjusticiable. 844 F.2d at 780. We refused to countenance correction of alleged errors in the officer\u2019s records because \u201c[b]y considering her service records for error in their \u2018preparation or content\u2019, the Claims Court was passing on the merits of the decision to deny ASP which was first and last for the Navy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. Even if we were to order remand of Murphy\u2019s case to the board for reconsideration based on corrected records, the trial court would be precluded from reviewing the board\u2019s new decision. Because the merits of the Air Force\u2019s decision to release Murphy from active duty are beyond judicial reach, so too is consideration of his military records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">Finally notwithstanding the language of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> invocation of the rubric \u201cinjustice\u201d provides no basis for judicial relief. There must be a \u201cpure legal error.\u201d <em>Grieg v. United States, </em>640 F.2d 1261, 1265, 226 Ct.Cl. 258 (1981). Section 1552(a) describes the Correction Boards\u2019 jurisdiction to act on behalf of the Secretary to \u201cremove an injustice.\u201d It says absolutely nothing about the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction which is circumscribed solely by the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, and which demands that the government be called upon to answer in money. Absent that, there is no review in the Claims Court of alleged \u201cinjustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Perhaps Murphy could have sought correction of his records through the Administrative Procedure Act in the district court. <em>See, e.g., Kreis v. Secretary of the Air Force, </em>866 F.2d 1508, 1511 (D.C.Cir.1989) (Although \u201crequest for retroactive promotion falls squarely within the realm of nonjusticiable military personnel decisions,\u201d judicial review of decisions involving the correction of military records is available under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2)). But the Claims Court has no authority to invoke the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">.
