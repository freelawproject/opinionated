Despite the plain language of the statute and precedent from this circuit to the contrary, Appellant argues that a debtor may seek relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 525(b) even when the discrimination alleged by the debtor took place before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-20\">Section 525(b) provides, in relevant part: No private employer may terminate the employment of, or discriminate with respect to employment against, an individual who <em>is or has been </em>a debtor under this title ... solely because such debtor or bankrupt ... <em>is or has been </em>a debtor under this title or a debtor or bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-21\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 525(b) (emphasis added). In <em>In re Kanouse, </em>53 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.1995), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>516 U.S. 930, 116 S.Ct. 336, 133 L.Ed.2d 235 (1995), we affirmed the district court\u2019s holding that only one \u201cwho is or has been a debtor\u201d is afforded protection under \u00a7 525(b), and that \u201c[t]he statute does not allow a remedy to \u2018will be\u2019 debtors.\u201d <em>In re Kanouse, </em>168 B.R. 441, 447 (S.D.Fla.1994). The district court in <em>Kanouse </em>held that because the plaintiff \u201cwas not a debtor nor had been a debtor at the time of the alleged acts of discrimination by [his employer], he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 525(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit agreed with the <em>Kanouse </em>analysis and reached the same conclusion in <em>In re Majewski, </em>310 F.3d 653, 656 (9th Cir.2002). The only cases that Appellant can cite that reach a contrary result are two bankruptcy court decisions: <em>In re Mayo, </em>322 B.R. 712 (Bankr.Vt.2005), and <em>In re Tinker, </em>99 B.R. 957 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1989). These decisions are clearly contrary to the court\u2019s decision in <em>Kanouse </em>and therefore are not persuasive in this circuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Like the debtor in <em>Kanouse, </em>it is undisputed that the debtor in this case was terminated from his employment <em>before </em>he filed for bankruptcy. Therefore, as in <em>Ka-nouse, </em>he was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 525(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-18\">. In fact, the district court in <em>Kanouse </em>expressly questioned <em>Tinker, </em>stating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>court in <em>Tinker </em>relied \"upon questionable legislative history.\u201d <em>Kanouse, </em>168 B.R. at 447.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
