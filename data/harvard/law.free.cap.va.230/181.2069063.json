Abbott Bus Lines, Inc., and Gibson Bus Line, Inc., the appellant-protestants, pray that the Commission\u2019s order \u201cbe reversed in full, or at least... in part, and remanded insofar as the same authorizes . . . special or charter party service from the City of Roanoke and the County of Roanoke to other points in Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The Commission based its award upon the threefold test defined in <em>Atlantic Greyhound </em>v. <em>Jones Bus Co., </em>216 Va. 255, 217 S.E.2d 857 (1975). There, we held that by enacting Code \u00a7 56-388.54,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the General Assembly intended the Commission\u2019s decision on an application for a special or charter party certificate to \u201cbe based upon a consideration of three factors, namely: (1) an existing public need for the proposed carrier\u2019s service; (2) the proposed carrier\u2019s ability to provide economical, comfortable and convenient service for the geographical area; and (3) the economic and competitive impact which the proposed carrier would have upon existing carriers providing similar service within the same territory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 217 S.E.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The protestants first contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the Commission\u2019s finding of public need. The evidence showed that George H. Ashwell, formerly employed as a bus driver by Abbott, decided to go into business for himself. Courtesy, of which Ashwell is president, sole stockholder, and principal driver, was incorporated in April 1984. The Interstate Commerce Commission granted the Roanoke-based company charter party authority for trips within the continental United States, and in May 1984, Courtesy filed an application with the State Corporation Commission for a class \u201cB\u201d certificate authorizing certain intrastate trips. Courtesy owns and operates two 1984 model motor coaches, each of which accommodates 47 passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">At the time of the October 1984 hearing conducted below, six carriers, three of which were based in Roanoke, offered intrastate charter service originating in the Roanoke metropolitan area. Witnesses representing a travel agency and senior citizens groups testified that the two largest carriers were \u201cmuch more expensive\u201d, \u201cquite a bit more expensive\u201d, and senior citizens \u201ccannot afford them\u201d. One carrier offered only commuter service and \u201cshort trips\u201d. Another operated \u201cmini-buses\u201d and owned only one larger coach. Gibson and Appalachian Coach Company, Inc. (an allied corporation based in Roanoke) jointly owned 13 full-sized buses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>and Abbott 23. In the two years preceding the hearing, Gibson had spent $600,000 \u201cto try to meet the public need, as far as updating the equipment.\u201d In the last six months, Abbott had added four units to its fl\u00e9et of buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">Courtesy introduced eight witnesses in support of its application. Ashwell testified that he had received \u201c[a]t least... a call a week\u201d requesting intrastate charter service. When he explained that Courtesy could not make intrastate trips and advised his callers to contact other bus lines, they usually told him \u201cthere is nobody else to call, they can\u2019t get the buses.\u201d Two of the three Roanoke-based charter carriers had contacted Ashwell seeking additional buses because their own coaches were fully committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Kathleen Simms, Courtesy\u2019s treasurer and office manager, testified that she had received requests for intrastate transportation from callers who told her \u201cwe can\u2019t get a bus unless we go . . . out of state ... to get one.\u201d She said that, in the week preceding the hearing, she had received \u201cat least 15 calls wanting a bus\u201d for intrastate trips planned for a weekend in November.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Commission heard the testimony of six public witnesses in support of Courtesy\u2019s application. Essie Doss, who has been organizing from 12 to 20 intrastate and interstate trips per year for senior-citizen groups in Rocky Mount and Franklin County, testified that she had been using Abbott transportation \u201cwhen I could get them\u201d but that \u201c[t]he last year or two, when I called to book them, they didn\u2019t have charter service for me on occasional trips\u201d. She said that Abbott \u201cdidn\u2019t have any buses available to me\u201d for trips she had arranged to \u201cTangier Island, Williamsburg and what have you\u201d in the spring of 1984. \u201c[B]ecause I have a problem with transportation,\u201d she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t run very many [intrastate trips] last year\u201d. Doss felt that there was a need for additional charter service in the area because senior citizens \u201cwould like to take trips, one-day trips, and they are looking for the cheapest way [and] the quality of the bus service\u201d. Beulah Davis, a tour-guide assistant to Doss, agreed that there is a need for Courtesy\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Donna Fox, who arranges trips for senior citizens in Covington and Alleghany County, usually employs Courtesy and Abbott. \u201cThis past spring,\u201d she said, \u201cwe had to call the second bus line because Abbott was not available in the spring.\u201d She explained that \u201c[w]e were going to go to a second carrier, but the trip didn\u2019t go through.\u201d Some trips she planned had to be rescheduled be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>cause buses were not available. Fox preferred to use Courtesy because its prices were \u201c[l]ower\u201d, its equipment was \u201c[g]reat\u2019\\ its service was \u201c[t]errific\u201d, and Ashwell was one of the senior citizens\u2019 \u201cfavorite\u201d drivers. The testimony of Shirley Pullen, Fox\u2019s superior, was to the same general effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">Elizabeth Hagood, a travel broker whose licensed area extends to Roanoke and Roanoke County, had recently opened her own travel agency in Bristol following eight years\u2019 experience with an agency in Richmond. She planned to organize \u201cmotor coach trips through Virginia and outside of the state.\u201d Hagood believed there \u201cis a demand for the Williamsburg area, the Yorktown area, the Northern Virginia area and . . . the southwest Virginia area\u201d. She said she supported Courtesy\u2019s application because she \u201ccould not work with Mr. Abbott\u201d and felt that Abbott\u2019s service \u201cwas not handled in a business-like way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Mary Garman arranges charter party trips for the Roanoke Fiddle and Banjo Booster Club. The club, which has several thousand members drawn from the Roanoke community and elsewhere, holds meetings and conducts concerts once a month at the Civic Center in Roanoke. Garman said that the group charters buses, sometimes as many as three, for \u201c[approximately 45 trips\u201d a year to points in Virginia and other states. \u201cWe do approximately [$45,000.00] to $50,000.00 worth of business a year with the bus company,\u201d she said, and \u201c[m]ost of my bus trips leave from Towers Mall\u201d, a shopping center in Roanoke. She testified that, in past years when the club was using Abbott buses, the club had \u201ctaken a lot of trips ... to Williamsburg and different places\u201d in Virginia. In the last two years, however, the group had not chartered Abbott and had taken only three intrastate trips arranged with other certificated carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Sam McConville, representing Gibson and Appalachian, acknowledged that, until he received last-minute cancellations of two coaches, his entire fleet of 13 buses had been fully committed for the Saturday following the hearing. Fred Abbott, president of protestant Abbott, acknowledged that all of its coaches were booked for two weekends later in the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On brief, the protestants challenge the probative value of Ash-well\u2019s testimony and that of his office manager concerning public need for additional intrastate transportation. They characterize it as self-serving, predictable, undocumented, and uncorroborated. But the Commission assesses the credibility of the witnesses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the probative weight to be given their testimony, and we accept its assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">The testimony of the witnesses from Covington and Franklin County, the protestants insist, was irrelevant because it \u201cis not evidence of a need in Roanoke.\u201d In order to prevail, they argue, Courtesy had the burden of producing \u201cthe Foxes and Dosses of Roanoke City and County to demonstrate the public need, via inadequacy of existing service\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We find two flaws in this argument. First, we do not agree that the testimony that intrastate service was unavailable to customers in Covington and Franklin County was irrelevant to the question of public convenience and necessity in Roanoke. When a carrier\u2019s buses are fully committed, they are unavailable to the public everywhere. Second, Courtesy produced a witness thoroughly experienced in the needs and preferences of charter travellers in the Roanoke community. Garman represented a Roanoke-based club which had spent more than $45,000 a year for charter trips, including \u201ca lot\u201d of intrastate trips, most of which originated at a shopping center in Roanoke. In the last two years, the club had taken only three intrastate trips. Although Garman did not expressly attribute this to unavailability of existing intrastate service, her testimony justifies the inference that the service available was unacceptable to the club. Moreover, in light of the club\u2019s former history of intrastate travel originating in Roanoke and Gar-man\u2019s support of Courtesy\u2019s application, the Commission could fairly conclude that the club needs and plans to utilize the new services authorized by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">As used in the statutes regulating motor vehicle carriers, the words in the phrase \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d are not semantically independent and distinct but conceptually interrelated. The word \u201cconvenience\u201d modifies and qualifies the literal import of the word \u201cnecessity.\u201d Considered contextually, the two words do not require a showing of imperative need rooted in public hardship. In applying the statutory phrase, the Commission is entitled to consider public convenience as well as an imbalance in supply and demand. See the judicial constructions of the phrase quoted with approval in <em>Seaboard Air Line Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 799, 806, 71 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Whether the service offered by Courtesy was justified by public convenience and necessity was \u201can issue addressed to the sound discretion of the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807, 71 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>151. Viewing the evidence and the reasonable inferences it raises in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, we hold that the record supports the Commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">In a second assignment of error, the protestants contend that the Commission \u201cerred in finding the evidence sufficient to establish the applicant as fit and capable of rendering the proposed service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In making a \u201cfitness\u201d determination, the Commission is required to consider, among other things, \u201cthe character of the applicant, and the kind and location of the equipment he proposes to use.\u201d Code \u00a7 56-338.54. While the protestants complain that Ash-well \u201chas little, if any, business experience\u201d, they do not challenge his character or the quality of Courtesy\u2019s equipment. Instead, they question the applicant\u2019s financial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Simms testified that, until Courtesy bought its second bus, it had operated at a profit. Although at the time of the hearing Courtesy had a deficit posture, it had set aside $16,000 in operating capital to supplement operating revenues. Furthermore, for the protection of the public, Courtesy had acquired $2.5 million in general liability insurance on each of its two buses\u2014coverage in excess of that required by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">As the Commission noted in its opinion, \u201cit is not unusual for a newly formed corporation to lose money in its first year of existence.\u201d Abbott\u2019s president testified that carriers \u201cmake more money on intrastate trips [than on interstate trips] because our costs are so much lower.\u201d Significantly, Courtesy had incurred its deficit while restricted to interstate operations. The Commission\u2019s fitness finding was a finding of fact, and we cannot say that it was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Finally, the protestants maintain that \u201c[t]he Commission erred in failing to deny the application . . . based on the economic and competitive impact upon . . . existing carriers providing similar service within the same territory.\u201d They argue that existing service is adequate to meet demand and that their equipment is already \u201cunderutilized\u201d. The current level of competition, they say, forces them to retain and invest a large share of corporate earnings in new equipment, and they fear that the entry into the market of another competitor would have \u201ca devastating effect\u201d upon their operations. They charge that the Commission ignored the statutory clause authorizing the Commission \u201cto protect any existing motor carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>We are aware that certificated carriers must make substantial capital investments, and we agree that they are entitled to rely upon the protection afforded by the statute. We do not agree, however, that the statutory protection is so broad as to guarantee existing carriers an exclusive license to operate indefinitely in a particular community. Although'Code \u00a7 56-388.54 empowers the Commission to \u201cplace such restrictions upon [new] certificates as may be reasonably necessary to protect any existing motor carrier\u201d, the statute expressly forbids the Commission to \u201cdeny a certificate solely on the ground that the applicant may render special or charter party service originating at the same point or points as [existing] motor carriers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">As we construe this language, the General Assembly, recognizing the public benefits of competition in the market place, authorized the Commission to deny a charter party certificate only when it finds that a grant will create competitive pressures so intense that existing carriers will be unable to earn a reasonable profit. By protecting certificated carriers from such ruinous competition, the statute protects the public from loss of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The Commission found that \u201cCourtesy\u2019s entrance into the market will not result in ruinous or unreasonable competition\u201d and that \u201c[d]enial of Courtesy\u2019s application would sacrifice the public interest to the self-interest of existing carriers.\u201d The evidence supports these conclusions. The protestants acknowledge that they have been turning away prospective customers, and the new certificate will add only two motor coaches to a market currently served by 36 buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Finding no error below, we will affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-12\"> \u00a7 56-338.54. When certificates granted.\u2014The public convenience and necessity to be served by special or charter party carriers is to provide economical, comfortable and convenient transportation for special or charter parties and in the issuance of all types of certificates authorized by this chapter the Commission shall consider all facts bearing on that purpose, including existing means of transportation, the character of the applicant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and the kind and location of the equipment he proposes to use. The Commission shall issue no more certificates than the public convenience and necessity require, and shall place such restrictions upon such certificates as may be reasonably necessary to protect any existing motor carrier, whether such carrier is operating under certificates issued by the Commission under this chapter or under chapters 12 (\u00a7 56-273 et seq.) or 12.3 (\u00a7 56-338.40 et seq.) of this title or otherwise, but the Commission shall not deny a certificate solely on the ground that the applicant may render special or charter party service originating at the same point or points as such other motor carriers. The Commission shall protect the private intercity charter industry to the extent reasonably practicable from carriers receiving grants from federal and State agencies where private operators are willing and able to provide such service.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
