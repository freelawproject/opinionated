The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the action on the ground that judicial immunity shields the defendants from civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Because of the narrow issue on appeal, we will state only those facts material to its resolution. Phillip A. Boyd, age 16, was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>guilty of assaulting a police officer by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Fairfax County. In accordance with former Code \u00a7 16.1-180 (now Code \u00a7 16.1-285), Boyd was committed on October 12, 1976, to the Department for an indeterminate period, not to extend beyond his 21st birthday. Based on its evaluation of Boyd\u2019s delinquent status and social needs, the Department assigned Boyd to Beaumont Learning Center (Beaumont), a medium security institution without locks or guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">At Beaumont, a team that included teachers, \u201chouse parents,\u201d a vocational instructor, and a rehabilitative counselor prepared a \u201ctreatment plan\u201d for Boyd. This treatment team regularly scrutinized Boyd\u2019s conduct and monitored his progress throughout his confinement at Beaumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In January, 1977, defendant Madyun became Boyd\u2019s rehabilitative counselor. Madyun observed Boyd\u2019s relatively good behavior and, accordingly, prepared a letter in May, 1977, recommending that Boyd be discharged directly to his home under the supervision of his mother. Madyun\u2019s letter outlined Boyd\u2019s social needs and delinquent status at the time of his commitment and noted the progress he made while at Beaumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Boyd\u2019s aftercare counselor in Fairfax County reviewed and concurred in Madyun\u2019s recommendation. Madyun\u2019s letter was then forwarded to defendant Voss, Beaumont\u2019s director, who agreed with the proposal to discharge Boyd directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Finally, Madyun\u2019s letter was forwarded to defendant Harlow, the Department of Corrections\u2019 aftercare supervisor, who was responsible for making the final decision regarding Boyd\u2019s proposed discharge. Harlow reviewed Boyd\u2019s record, including his \u201cneeds assessment\u201d developed at the time of his commitment, psychological test data, and progress reports prepared during his confinement. Additionally, Harlow compared Boyd\u2019s delinquency prior to his commitment with his conduct and performance while at Beaumont and determined the latter to be more significant. Based on his review, and after notifying the Fairfax County court, Harlow issued a discharge order for Boyd on June 8, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">About 12 weeks after his discharge, Boyd and four accomplices robbed and cut the throats of Clatterbuck and three others. All four victims survived. Boyd, together with his accomplices, was convicted of this crime and is currently serving 60 years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In her motion for judgment, Clatterbuck asserts that the defendants knew or should have known that Boyd presented a danger to members of the public. Accordingly, Clatterbuck alleges that the defendants were grossly negligent in discharging Boyd without aftercare supervision and that this negligence proximately caused her injuries. Alternatively, Clatterbuck claims that the defendants are liable for her injuries because they failed to perform certain ministerial duties imposed upon them by statute and Department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Although the defendants have assigned a number of errors, we need address only one. Defendants contend on appeal, as they did at trial, that they are shielded from civil liability under the doctrine of judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">It is clear that judges enjoy absolute immunity from civil liability, even when they act maliciously or corruptly or in excess of their jurisdiction. Judges can be held liable only when they act in \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Moorman, </em>80 Va. 131, 142 (1885). Compelling public policy in maintaining judicial independence is the basis for judicial immunity. A judicial officer must be able to exercise his judgment fully, freely, impartially, and without fear of being sued for damages by dissatisfied persons. <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Although judicial immunity, in its strictest sense, is limited to judges, quasi-judicial immunity may extend to other public officials acting within their jurisdiction, in good faith and while performing judicial functions. <em>See Yates </em>v. <em>Ley, </em>121 Va. 265, 270, 92 S.E. 837, 839 (1917); <em>Johnston, </em>80 Va. at 139, 141-42. In <em>Yates, </em>a notary public, in violation of applicable law, certified an acknowledgment on a deed of trust in which he was the trustee. Consequently, the acknowledgment was void, and the creditor was deprived of the lien represented by the deed of trust. In the creditor\u2019s action for damages against the notary, we held that the taking and certifying of an acknowledgment is a judicial act, and that because the notary acted within his jurisdiction and in good faith, he was absolutely immune from civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Similarly, in <em>Johnston, </em>a city mayor was sued for ordering the arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff. We held that, because the act complained of \u201cwas done in the discharge of a judicial function,\u201d the doctrine of judicial immunity shielded the mayor from civil liability. 80 Va. at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>We must decide, therefore, whether the defendants were (1) performing judicial functions, (2) acting within their jurisdiction, and (3) acting in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">First, we determine whether the defendants were performing judicial functions. In making this determination, we adopt the \u201cfunctional comparability\u201d test established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Butz </em>v. <em>Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478 (1978). Under this test, we must ascertain whether the procedure in question \u201cshares enough of the characteristics of the judicial process that those who participate in such adjudication should also be immune from suits for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Because Boyd\u2019s commitment was indeterminate, the length of his confinement at Beaumont was a matter resting solely within the discretion of the Department. In exercising that discretion, the Department was required to consider the \u201cwelfare of the child and the interests of the public.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 16.1-180. Thus, the Department\u2019s role \u201cshares enough of the characteristics of the judicial process\u201d that the members of the Department who make these judgments must be immune from civil liability. Indeed, we believe the defendants\u2019 functions in this case possessed more judicial characteristics and responsibilities than those of either the notary in <em>Yates </em>or the mayor in <em>Johnston. </em>Moreover, the judgments made by the Department\u2019s employees under former Code \u00a7 16.1-180 are similar to those made by a court when it imposes sentences or determines probation revocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Specifically, Harlow\u2019s function was to examine Boyd\u2019s pre- and post-commitment records, review the recommendations made by Boyd\u2019s counselor, and decide whether, and under what conditions, Boyd should be released. Harlow\u2019s judgments are similar to those made by parole board members who have been held immune from damages in civil rights actions based on their decisions on parole applications. <em>See Sellars </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>641 F.2d 1295 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1102 (1981); <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Muncy, </em>570 F.2d 499 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Chew, </em>521 F.2d 400 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Skelton, </em>502 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>403 F.2d 642 (9th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 990 (1969); <em>Siess </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>74 Mich. App. 613, 255 N.W.2d 2 (1977) (parole board members immune from suit arising out of discretionary act of releasing prisoner); <em>Jarrett </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>383 P.2d 995 (Ore. 1963) (superintendent of home for mentally deficient immune from liability based on temporary release of inmate); <em>Es</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>tate of Armstrong </em>v. <em>Pa. Bd. of Probation, </em>405 A.2d 1099 (Pa. 1979) (parole board members entitled to absolute immunity); <em>Reiff </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 A.2d 918 (Pa. 1976) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Likewise, Madyun and Voss were responsible for investigating and submitting recommendations regarding the appropriateness of Boyd\u2019s release. Madyun\u2019s and Voss\u2019 duties are similar to those performed by probation officers when investigating and submitting recommendations to a court. <em>See Burkes </em>v. <em>Callion, </em>433 F.2d 318, 319 (9th Cir. 1970) (probation officer immune from liability in submitting probation reports); <em>see also Spaulding </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>599 F.2d 728 (5th Cir. 1979) (probation officer immune from suit when investigating and preparing presentence report); <em>Acevedo </em>v. <em>Pima County Adult Probation Dept., </em>142 Ariz. 319, 690 P.2d 38 (1984) (same); <em>Hulsman </em>v. <em>Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Hawaii 58, 647 P.2d 713 (1982) (same). Additionally, their duties are similar to those made by parole board members when recommending to the Governor the granting or revocation of pardons. <em>See Pope, </em>521 F.2d at 405-06 (parole board members immune from liability because they \u201cperform a quasi-judicial function in making recommendations to the Governor regarding the granting or revocation of pardons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">It is in the interest of the public and of the committed child that the defendants, and other public officials who perform similar functions, be immune from suits for damages. The threat of such suits against these officials would have a chilling effect on their ability to perform their official duties. These officials must be free to discharge their duties fairly and impartially without fear of personal liability. If they were not shielded with quasi-judicial immunity, it is probable that their judgments would be always against a child\u2019s release. Indeed, the threat of civil suits would \u201cdampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.\u201d <em>Gregoire </em>v. <em>Biddle, 177 </em>F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Second, we determine whether the defendants acted within their jurisdiction in releasing Boyd from Beaumont. The statute governing the commitment of children to the Department provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">All commitments [of children to the Department] shall be for an indeterminate period having regard to the welfare of the child and interests of the public, but no child committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>hereunder shall be held or detained after such child shall have attained the age of twenty-one years ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Former Code \u00a7 16.1-180. Once a child is committed to the Department of Corrections, the committing court surrenders and the Department assumes jurisdiction. The Department alone determines the length of a child\u2019s commitment and, if released, the conditions thereof. Accordingly, we hold as a matter of law that the defendants acted within the jurisdiction conferred by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Finally, Clatterbuck does not allege that the defendants acted in bad faith in releasing Boyd from Beaumont. Indeed, the record would not have supported such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the defendants were performing judicial functions,.and that they acted within their jurisdiction and in good faith. Because the defendants were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, the trial court erred in failing to dismiss Clatterbuck\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter final judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-14\"> Clatterbuck also sued T. Don Hutto, former Director of the Department; Carlton Bolte, Assistant Director of Community and Prevention Services of the Department; William Weddington, former Assistant Director of the Department, Division of Youth Services; Vincent Picciano, Director of Court Services, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Fairfax County; and John Fekety and Robert Kabrich, probation officers for the court responsible for juvenile aftercare services and probation. The trial court dismissed the suit as to Bolte and the Fairfax County employees (Picciano, Fekety, and Kabrich), and at trial, the jury found in favor of Hutto and Weddington.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-13\"> At trial, Clatterbuck presented evidence that the defendants acted contrary to a Department guideline prohibiting a child\u2019s discharge without supervision unless the local aftercare officials refused to accept supervision. Although this evidence may have been germane to the issue of defendants\u2019 negligence had they not been immune from liability, it does not affect the Department\u2019s jurisdiction over Boyd\u2019s custody and release as prescribed in former Code \u00a7 16.1-180.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b514-9\">POFF, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIF\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">I agree that the decision below should be reversed, but I would reach the result by a different rationale. Applying the rules suggested in my concurring opinion in <em>Messina </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>228 Va. 301, 314-15, 321 S.E.2d 657, 664-65 (1984), I would hold that the defendants in this case are clothed with public-servant immunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b514-11\">COMPTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdQX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">In a result-oriented decision, the majority proceeds to create a new species of immunity for Virginia. I cannot join that endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The trial court ruled, correctly in my opinion, that these State employees were entitled to sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the trial court required the plaintiff to establish that the defendants were grossly negligent in the discharge of their discretionary duties and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries, sustained when her throat was slit by a juvenile delinquent who had been released from the State corrections system. The trial court\u2019s ruling was in accord with the body of law on the subject developed over the years in this State. The jury found, in a verdict confirmed by the trial court, that defendants\u2019 release of the juvenile delinquent was grossly negligent in view of the information concerning his history and propensity for violence and aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Nevertheless, the majority now extends a type of <em>judicial </em>immunity to persons outside the class of judicial officers that are described in the Virginia cases cited in the majority opinion. Until today, this class included \u201cthe highest judge in the State\u201d and extended \u201cto the lowest officer who sits as a court and tries petty causes.\u201d <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Moorman, </em>80 Va. 131, 139 (1885). Now, the Court adds to the class an aftercare supervisor, a rehabilitative counselor, and a learning center supervisor in order to insulate those persons from tort liability for grossly negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">I believe the trial court accorded these defendants all the immunity to which they were entitled. Thus, I would affirm the judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
