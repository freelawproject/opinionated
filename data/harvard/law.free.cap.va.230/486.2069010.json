Ivey, the claimant, was injured in a single-vehicle accident in King George County while employed as an ironworker for appellee Jerry P. Puckett Construction Company. The employer and its insurer stipulated the accidental injury and resulting incapacity but defended Ivey\u2019s claim under Code \u00a7 65.1-38, asserting the claimant\u2019s injuries resulted from intoxication due to consumption of alcoholic beverages. After a hearing, a deputy commissioner determined the employer had established its defense and denied the claim. Upon review, the full Commission unanimously agreed with the findings of fact of the hearing commissioner and likewise denied the claim, giving rise to this appeal by the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">On the day of the accident, a Friday, the claimant and two other workers left their job site in Bowie, Maryland, about 4:30 p.m. in a company-owned pick-up truck operated by the claimant. The trio was returning at the end of the work day to their homes in Virginia. After departing the work place, the claimant purchased a \u201c12 pack\u201d of beer containing 12-ounce cans. Snow was falling and the highways were wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">During the 60-mile trip to his home, the claimant \u201clet the other two fellows off\u2019 and continued to State Route 610, a paved secondary road. The road had snow on it and \u201cice in spots.\u201d According to the claimant, he \u201ccome up over a little hill and the rear of the truck started sliding.\u201d He testified that he \u201ccut the wheel and tried to get it back into the road and it just keep on sliding and sled off into the ditch and hit a tree.\u201d The accident occurred about 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The claimant stated he was travelling 30 to 35 miles per hour in a 55 mile-per-hour speed zone at the time of the incident, not because of the icy conditions but because \u201cI always drive that slow.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>He asserted that the rear tires of the truck \u201cwere slick, wore down\u201d and that this condition, together with the condition of the highway, caused him to lose control of the vehicle. The claimant\u2019s wife testified that two other members of her family had lost control of their vehicles at the location of the claimant\u2019s accident on the day of his accident. The claimant denied that consumption of alcohol \u201chad anything to do\u201d with his loss of control of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The claimant testified that he consumed four cans of beer during the trip before the accident. When admitted to the emergency room of a Fredericksburg hospital about three hours after the accident, claimant had the odor of alcohol on his breath. He stated to the attending physician that \u201che had had two six packs this evening prior to driving.\u201d An analysis of claimant\u2019s blood, conducted at 9:01 p.m. on the day in question, showed a concentration of alcohol equivalent to .215 per cent, according to the testimony of a toxicologist. The toxicologist further stated that at such level of alcohol concentration any person \u201cwould be too impaired to safely operate a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">On appeal, the claimant contends the Industrial Commission engaged \u201cin gross speculation\u201d regarding the proximate cause of the accident, asserting the employer failed to carry the burden of proof imposed by \u00a7 65.1-38. He argues: \u201cIn light of the evidence concerning slick tires, hazardous road conditions and other accidents at the same spot in the road, it cannot be said that the [employer] met its burden to prove that intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The decision below involved a pure question of fact. We repeatedly have noted that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact, when based upon credible evidence, are conclusive and binding upon us. Code \u00a7 65.1-98; <em>Seven-Up Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>230 Va. 245, 249, 335 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1985); <em>Sky Chefs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rogers, 222 </em>Va. 800, 805, 284 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1981). There is abundant, credible evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s findings, both as to willful misconduct by intoxication and causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Obviously, the Commission accepted the evidence offered by the employer of the claimant\u2019s .215 blood alcohol reading. The Commission plainly gave full credit to the testimony of the toxicologist who stated that anyone with a .215 reading would be too impaired to operate a motor vehicle safely. Indeed, the expert testified that \u201cit is generally considered that anyone who has a blood concentra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tion level above point 1 will be too impaired to perform any of the fine motor skills in operating a motor vehicle.\u201d Given this evidence of severe intoxication, still at a high level three hours after the accident, and considering the other evidence, including the admission made to the emergency room physician, the Commission was justified in giving little credit to the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding both the amount of beer ingested before the accident and the factors which caused him to lose control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. In sum, there was credible evidence that the claimant\u2019s ability to control the vehicle was impaired by consumption of alcoholic beverages and that such impairment and loss of control proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Accordingly, the decision of the Commission will be</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
