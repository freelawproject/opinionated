The parcels involved form a part of the Potomac Yard, a large railroad classification and marshalling area located partly in Arlington County and partly in the City of Alexandria. This is the fourth time an appeal to this Court has arisen from questions concerning the taxation of the Potomac Yard, <em>see Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 294, 124 S.E.2d 206 (1962); <em>RF&amp;P </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>219 Va. 301, 247 S.E.2d 408 (1978); and <em>City of Alexandria </em>v. <em>RF&amp;P, </em>223 Va. 293, 288 S.E.2d 457 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">RF&amp;P challenged the assessments on a number of grounds, but the SCC held that all except one ground had been litigated and decided adversely to RF&amp;P in the 1978 case and were subject to the bar of estoppel by judgment. The remaining ground raised by RF&amp;P was that the assessments violated the anti-discrimination provisions of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (the \u201c4R Act\u201d) \u00a7 306, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11503 (1976). After considering that contention, the SCC found no discrimination in the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The basis of RF&amp;P\u2019s challenge to the assessments is that RF&amp;P is the owner of easements for railroad purposes over the affected parcels of land, while the underlying fee remains in the United States pursuant to an indenture which settled a complex land dispute in 1938. RF&amp;P has the sole use of the affected land \u201cfor the construction, maintenance and operation of railroad tracks.\u201d If the land is abandoned or put to any other use, the easement will terminate and unencumbered title will vest in the United States. With the exception of the effect of the \u201c4R Act,\u201d all questions raised by RF&amp;P in the present case, were raised and decided adversely to RF&amp;P in our prior decisions, particularly <em>RF&amp;P </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>219 Va. at 318-20, 247 S.E.2d at 418-19. Upon <em>stare decisis </em>principles too familiar to require elaboration, we will give n\u00f3 further consideration to those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The \u201c4R Act\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce, and a State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a State or subdivision of a State may not do any of them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">(1) assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">(2) levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under clause (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">(3) levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">(4) impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title [49 USC \u00a7\u00a7 10501 <em>et seq.].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11503.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The record indicates that all real property in Arlington County, including the four parcels under consideration, was assessed in 1983 at 100% of fair market value. Thus, the first and second subparagraphs of the \u201c4R Act\u201d are inapplicable. The record shows that all commercial and industrial property in Arlington County, including the parcels under consideration, was taxed in 1983 at a rate of 99 cents per $100 of assessed valuation. Thus, the third subparagraph is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Finally, Arlington County has clearly not imposed \u201canother tax\u201d which discriminates against railroads so as to violate subparagraph 4. The only tax challenged here is the <em>ad valorem </em>real property tax regulated by the first three subparagraphs and imposed in full compliance with those provisions. We agree with the SCC that the fourth subparagraph does not refer to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes at all, but rather refers to other or different schemes of taxation not contemplated by the first three subparagraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Because we conclude that the assessments challenged by RF&amp;P do not offend the provisions of the \u201c4R Act, we will affirm the decision of the SCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
