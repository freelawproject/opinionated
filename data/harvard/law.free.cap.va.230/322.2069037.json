The trial court confirmed the four verdicts and imposed penitentiary sentences of life for robbery, two years for the use of a firearm, and 20 years for grand larceny. In a separate proceeding, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, the jury fixed the penalty for the capital conviction at death, and the court entered final judgment imposing the sentence. We have certified Wise\u2019s appeals in the non-capital cases to this Court, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 17-116.06(B)(1), combined those appeals with his capital appeal and the penalty review mandated by Code \u00a7 17-110.1, and accorded the several proceedings priority on our docket, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 17-110.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">We will consider the questions presented as stated on brief by the defendant. All but two are addressed to the conduct of the guilt phase of the consolidated trial. Wise challenges the selection of the jury, several evidentiary rulings, certain conduct of the attorney for the Commonwealth, and the sufficiency of the evidence. Concerning the penalty phase of the capital trial, Wise contends that the death penalty was the product of passion or prejudice and was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>SELECTION OF THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Prospective jurors were questioned individually and privately. The trial court seated three veniremen over Wise\u2019s challenge for cause. The court should have stricken John L. Tucker, Wise argues, because \u201che had a long standing friendship with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and [they] had been golfing buddies on many occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We have held that a prospective juror is not disqualified to sit on a criminal case solely because he has a familial or an attorney-client relationship with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 263, 307 S.E.2d 896, 900 (1983); <em>accord Elam </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 116, 326 S.E.2d 685, 687 (1985). It follows that a social relationship, standing alone, is no cause for disqualification. <em>See Lane </em>v. <em>United States, </em>321 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 936 (1964). Tucker\u2019s responses to questions from the bench clearly negate any danger of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Prospective juror Gladys McKinney should not have been seated, Wise says, because she \u201cgave vague answers\u201d, \u201cstated she was confused\u201d, and raised \u201cgrave questions about her ability to sit impartially as a juror.\u201d McKinney had read newspaper articles about the crimes and Wise\u2019s arrest. She thought \u201cit was a terrible thing that happened\u201d and \u201cjustice ought to be done\u201d. Asked by defense counsel if Wise \u201cshould have been arrested\u201d, she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Wise argues that McKinney\u2019s answer reflects an opinion that he was guilty because he was arrested. But the standard for arrest of a suspect is probable cause; the standard for conviction of an accused is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that McKinney thought Wise should have been arrested as a suspect does not show that she thought he deserved to be convicted. In unequivocal answers to searching inquiries by the court, McKinney declared that what she had learned from the newspapers would not affect her impartiality or ability to give Wise a fair trial, that she was not sensible of any bias or prejudice against the defendant, and that she could enter the jury box with an open mind and wait until the entire case was concluded before reaching a fixed opinion about the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Looking to the \u201centire <em>voir dire </em>rather than the single answer and question\u201d, <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 628, 292 S.E.2d 798, 805 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(1983), we uphold the trial court\u2019s finding that McKinney was qualified to sit on this jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Prospective juror Rebecca Hood stated that she believed in capital punishment. \u201cHow strong do you believe in it?\u201d defense counsel inquired. \u201cIf the evidence calls for it,\u201d she replied. Pressed further, Hood explained that she meant \u201c[t]he evidence presented in this courtroom.\u201d We find nothing in this dialogue or elsewhere in the <em>voir dire </em>to support the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that Hood\u2019s \u201cstate of mind is such that she could not give the defendant a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">THE EVIDENCE OF RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The victim of these crimes was William Ricketson, a superintendent at the Mecklenburg Correctional Center. About 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1983, Ricketson prepared to leave his home in Boydton to get a haircut and go deer hunting on property near Chase City. He laid $12.00 on a table for household expenses, but his wife told him he would need the money to pay for his haircut. Ricketson left in a white Ford pickup truck carrying a rifle and a shotgun. At Chase City, he got a haircut and bought a soft drink and a candy bar. He paid the bills with money taken from a wallet kept in his pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">At 1:00 p.m. the next day, Ricky Symmonds, a North Carolina deputy sheriff, stopped to investigate a white pickup parked on the shoulder of the southbound lane of Interstate Route 95. The defendant was adding oil to the engine. A service station attendant had informed the police that the driver of the pickup was armed. The officer recovered a .25 caliber pistol from Wise\u2019s pocket, arrested him for carrying a concealed weapon, and locked him in the county jail. The pickup was registered in Ricketson\u2019s name. During an inventory search of the vehicle, the police seized two shotguns. One was later identified as a gun Wise had taken to a gun shop for repairs and the other as a gun Ricketson used for hunting. On Wise\u2019s person, the police discovered two wallets. One contained Wise\u2019s driver\u2019s license; the other was empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">On the same afternoon, Ernest Mitchell, a resident of Middle-sex, North Carolina, reported to the Mecklenburg sheriffs department that Wise had told him and other friends that he had killed a man and \u201cput him in a hole\u201d behind the old excelsior plant in Chase City. The plant had been converted for use as a flea mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ket, and the office was used as a residence. Investigating officers found blood at a point on the shoulder of the road near the building. A trail of blood led from the road to the driveway, across a sidewalk, and then to the edge of a hole in the ground behind the building. The hole, which had been dug for use as an outdoor toilet, was filled with water, mud, and human feces. From this hole, the officers recovered Ricketson\u2019s body which had been completely submerged under the weight of a number of cinder blocks. Ricketson\u2019s trousers had been pulled down, inside out, to the top of his boots, and his wallet was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">An autopsy revealed multiple injuries resulting from blunt-force blows to the head, including scalp wounds and a skull fracture. Three fingers were broken, and flesh had been torn from the nose, chin, and forehead. A bullet fired at close range had perforated the right eyeball and lodged near the surface behind the left ear. A ballistics test showed that this bullet had been fired from the .25 caliber pistol taken from Wise when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Ricketson had also suffered a chest wound from a shotgun blast. The pellets were recovered from a point just beneath the skin. According to a forensic scientist, the shallow penetration supports the conclusion that the victim was under water when the gun was fired. The medical examiner found \u201cwater and clay and gritty sand\u201d in the nose, mouth, lungs, and stomach of the body which, he said, showed that the victim had \u201cbreathed and swallowed the muddy water with the sand and the grit when he was alive.\u201d The gunshot wounds and the skull fracture were lethal injuries, but drowning was the ultimate cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Called as a witness for the Commonwealth, Shirley Whittaker testified that Wise came to her trailer home in Middlesex between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. on December 2, 1983. Wise told her that \u201che had just killed a man\u201d, that \u201che shot the man in the eye\u201d, that \u201che took the man outside the house, around the house, he beat the man with the gun and broke the gun handle over the man\u2019s head\u201d, that he threw the man in a \u201chole that they had dug around the back of the house for a toilet\u201d, and that he \u201cthrew some dirt over him and bricks.\u201d Wise declared that \u201cthe man had only six dollars.\u201d Responding to a question posed by defense counsel, Whittaker added, \u201cHe said he got it out of the man\u2019s pocket.\u201d Wise was wearing a green coat stained with blood. \u201cHe pulled that off,\u201d Whittaker said, \u201cand carried it out and burned it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Before Wise left, Whittaker called her next-door neighbor, Mary Booth, to come to her trailer. Booth testified that Wise, her stepson, told her that he had shot an intruder when he reached for his pocket and that he took him outside and \u201cbeat him and then he put him in a hole.\u201d Booth saw a .25 caliber pistol, a shotgun with a broken stock, and a driver\u2019s license bearing Ricketson\u2019s name, all lying on the floor of the trailer. Ricketson\u2019s wife identified the shotgun as the one her husband carried the day of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In response to a telephone call from Mary Booth, Clarice Bowser drove to the trailer. Bowser testified that Wise told her that he had surprised a stranger at the excelsior plant, that \u201cthe man went for his pocket and he said he shot the man . . . [and] he drug him behind the house and put him in a hole\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Wise made eight statements concerning the crimes with which he was charged. In addition, while incarcerated awaiting trial, he requested, took, and failed a lie detector test, agreed to give testimony by deposition, and participated in a recorded telephone conversation with Whittaker. The results of the polygraph test, the contents of the statements and the deposition, and portions of the tape recording were admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Wise changed his story repeatedly. In some of his statements, he implicated third parties in one or more of the several offenses. In his first statement, he denied any knowledge of the crimes. Three days later, he said he had returned to the plant and found Ricketson \u201cout in the shop\u201d. Ricketson \u201cmade some kind of move toward his back pocket and I shot him with the .25 automatic. I drug him outside arid around the house. I left him on the side of the house. I didn\u2019t put him in no hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In his third statement, Wise admitted the shooting but said that a man named Frank Craddock had beaten Ricketson with a shotgun. According to his fourth statement, Wise was inside the building when \u201csome man pulled up in the yard in a white truck\u201d and \u201cused the yard for a bathroom.\u201d Wise went outside and confronted the man, and a fight ensued. Ricketson started towards the truck, Wise \u201cshot him at close range\u201d, Ricketson \u201cfell close to the road\u201d, and Wise \u201cpicked him up . . . and dragged him around the house.\u201d Contradicting his former account, Wise admitted that Frank Craddock \u201cwon\u2019t [sic] there,\u201d and that \u201cI did all this alone.\u201d Asked why he had \u201cput this man in a hole\u201d, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>On December 12, Wise asked for a fifth interview and signed a transcript of the dialogue. He told the police that he had struck Ricketson twice in the head with a shotgun, that he had put him in the hole because there \u201cwas water in the hole and I wanted to move the body out of sight in case someone came in the yard\u201d, that he shot Ricketson \u201c[w]hile he was in the hole\u201d, that \u201che won\u2019t [sic] dead when I shot him with the shotgun\u201d, and that he had acted entirely alone. Ricketson\u2019s billfold \u201cwas on the dashboard of the truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Wise\u2019s sixth statement was contained in two letters he wrote to a deputy sheriff later in December. His former statements were false, he said, \u201cbecause I was afraid and I was paid [$200.00] by one John Spruill to keep my mouth shut\u201d. Wise declared that Spruill shot Ricketson \u201cwith a .25 caliber pistol ... hit the man with the rifle . . . drug the man to a hole and then shot into the hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In January, Wise made a seventh statement in a telephone interview with the police. On this occasion, Wise said that Shirley Whittaker shot Ricketson with the pistol, that Ernest Mitchell beat him with the shotgun, that Mitchell and Ray Booth, Wise\u2019s father, \u201cpulled his pants down\u201d, \u201ctook his billfold\u201d, \u201cdragged him by the legs\u201d, and \u201cput the man in the hole\u201d, and that Ray Booth \u201cshot in the hole\u201d. Repeating this account in a formal deposition, Wise claimed that his earlier confessions had been made to protect his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Called as adverse witnesses by the accused, Shirley Whittaker and Clarice Bowser repeated the testimony they had given as witnesses for the Commonwealth. In addition, Whittaker said that Wise had told her that he knew that \u201cthe man didn\u2019t have but six dollars on him . . . [b]ecause I looked in his pocketbook and that\u2019s all the man had.\u201d Whittaker tape-recorded a telephone call Wise made to her in December while he was awaiting trial. She did so because she \u201cwas going to show this tape\u201d in the event \u201cJoe Wise would have got on the stand and implicated John Spruill and [Frank Craddock].\u201d The Commonwealth offered the tape as an exhibit, the defendant waived objection, and the recording was played for the jury. Wise admitted that he shot Ricketson with the pistol, that he \u201cbeat him with his shotgun . . . throwed him in the hole, shot in the hole\u201d and that no one else was present. \u201cI didn\u2019t have . . . but six dollars,\u201d he said, \u201cand I put that in the [gasoline] tank\u201d because it was half empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>EVIDENTIARY QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">A. <em>Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Commonwealth introduced three color photographs of the corpse as it was being lifted from the privy hole. The defendant argues that \u201c[although these photographs . . . may have had some probative value, it was outweighed by the prejudicial and inflammatory nature of the photographs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The pictures show the body covered with mud and other debris but no blood. The face is not shown, and the head and body wounds are not visible. The arms are positioned near the head in a defensive posture. While the pictures arouse one\u2019s pity, they are not inflammatory within the meaning of the rule Wise invokes. Compare photographs admitted in <em>Boggs </em>v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 501, 508, 331 S.E.2d 407, 419 (1985); <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth, 227 Va. 124, 144, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984); <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 74, 286 S.E.2d 162, 167, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982); <em>Waye v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 692, 251 S.E.2d 202, 207-08, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979); and <em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 445, 455, 61 S.E.2d 318, 323 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u201cWe have repeatedly held that the admissibility of photographs depicting the body of a murder victim is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 450, 323 S.E.2d 554, 566-67 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>105 S.Ct. 2713 (1985). We find no abuse of discretion. The circumstances reflected in the pictures at bar were clearly competent to show that the homicide was deliberate and malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">B. <em>Confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">An investigating officer testified that Ernest Mitchell had been the first to report Wise\u2019s admission that he had killed a man and that Mitchell had directed the police to the broken shotgun and other items introduced at trial. The Commonwealth did not call Mitchell as a witness, and Wise complains that he was denied his right to confront one of his accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u201cThe Commonwealth was not required to call every possible witness in proving its case\u201d, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 66, 69, 147 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1966) (instruction on absent-witness presumption properly refused), and evidence adduced by the defendant himself shows that Mitchell\u2019s testimony \u201cwould have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>merely cumulative and corroborative and, thus, unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel asked a deputy sheriff who had interviewed Mitchell to read his statement to the jury. In that interview, Mitchell repeated what he had reported to the police the day after the murder and added that Wise had left the shotgun at his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Moreover, Mitchell was in jail at the time of Wise\u2019s trial and subject to compulsory process, at Wise\u2019s request, as a hostile witness. Finding no reason to believe that Wise was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to call Mitchell to the stand, we reject the defendant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">C. <em>Exclusion of Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Before the court adjourned for the day on Friday, defense counsel reserved the right to recall Commonwealth witnesses Whittaker, Booth, and Bowser, and the trial judge recognized them for appearance on Monday. Before court convened that day, the witnesses, residents of North Carolina, informed the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney that they had no money to pay a babysitter while they were in Virginia and that their attorneys had advised them they were not legally obligated to appear. The trial judge granted Wise a continuance until Wednesday and authorized the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to use money from the sheriff\u2019s fund to pay babysitter fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Whittaker and Bowser appeared on Wednesday, and Wise called Whittaker as an adverse witness. Counsel attempted to ask why she had not appeared on Monday, and the court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. Assigning error to that ruling, the defendant argues that an answer to the question was relevant to the \u201cstate of mind and the credibility of a witness\u201d and that, given an answer, the jury might have assessed the witness\u2019 adverse testimony \u201cin a different manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">While Whittaker was still on the stand, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney explained to the jury, at the court\u2019s request, that the witnesses were absent on Monday because they had no one to care for their children and that, pursuant to the court\u2019s instruction, he had made a trip to North Carolina and given \u201cthese ladies twenty dollars apiece for babysitter fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Because the record shows that the jury was fully apprised of the reason for the witnesses\u2019 reluctance to appear and the circumstances under which they agreed to appear, we find no merit in the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>D. <em>Allegations of Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Wise contends that he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s questions concerning evidence which the trial court had excluded. The officer who conducted the interview with Wise on December 12 testified that, after Wise signed the transcript, he asked Wise if he had found any money in Ricketson\u2019s billfold. Wise replied, \u201cHell, man, it was only six dollars.\u201d Wise objected on the ground the <em>Miranda </em>waiver he had signed prior to the interview did not extend to the verbal admission. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In two questions posed later in his examination of this officer, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney inquired whether Wise had said anything about money in the billfold. Noting that the jury had been instructed to disregard the officer\u2019s testimony on that point, the trial judge denied Wise\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the <em>Miranda </em>question was correct. <em>But see Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 548-49, 323 S.E.2d 577, 586 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>105 S.Ct. 2347 (1985). We also accept Wise\u2019s view that the questions at issue were improper, and we consider whether the trial court committed reversible error in denying a mistrial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c[Ejrror arising from an improper question or improper conduct of counsel may usually be cured by prompt and decisive action of the trial court without granting a motion for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 277, 286, 288 S.E.2d 449, 454 (1982). The trial court must make an initial factual determination, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, whether the defendant\u2019s rights had been so indelibly prejudiced as to require a new trial. Unless we can say as a matter of law that this determination was wrong, it will not be disturbed on appeal. Unless the record shows the contrary, it is to be presumed that the jury followed an explicit cautionary instruction promptly given. <em>See Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 80, 84, 175 S.E.2d 236, 239 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\"><em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). <em>See also Saun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>ders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 294, 303, 237 S.E.2d 150, 156 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The officer\u2019s testimony that Wise had stated that his victim had only six dollars was merely cumulative. Whittaker had already testified that Wise told her the night of the crimes that \u201cthe man had only six dollars\u201d which he had taken \u201cout of the man\u2019s pocket.\u201d In light of that circumstance, we cannot say as a matter of law that the defendant\u2019s rights were so indelibly prejudiced by the questions posed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney as to require a mistrial, and we will uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Wise also charges that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made \u201can improper and misleading statement of evidence during closing argument.\u201d In the course of summation, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney quoted from a transcript of the testimony of deputy sheriff Symmonds concerning the two wallets found at the time Wise was arrested. Defense counsel objected on the ground that \u201cthe wallets were never brought into evidence.\u201d On appeal, he argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney \u201cwas creating an inference that one of the wallets may have been the victim\u2019s\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It is immaterial that the wallets were not introduced as exhibits, and we see nothing improper or misleading in the argument. Counsel is always entitled to quote evidence of record in support of an inference he urges the jury to adopt. Whether the inference is justified by the predicate is a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The trial court erred, Wise insists, in denying his two motions to strike and his motion to set aside the verdict on the ground the evidence was insufficient to prove any of the four offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The jury found Wise guilty of grand larceny in the theft of Ricketson\u2019s truck. On appeal, he argues that \u201che was not shown to have been in exclusive possession\u201d of the truck. The defendant did not raise that ground for the trial court\u2019s consideration, and he cannot assert it for the first time in this Court. Rule 5:25 (formerly, Rule 5:21); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 446, 247 S.E.2d 698, 703 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">The jury convicted Wise of capital murder for \u201c[t]he willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of any person in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d). Three witnesses, including Wise\u2019s stepmother, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>that Wise told them on the night of the murder that he had shot a man with a pistol, beat him with a shotgun, and put him in the privy hole. In the course of his several statements, Wise admitted all they had said and, in addition, explained that he had placed his victim, still alive, in the water to hide him from sight, that he had shot into the hole, and that he had acted alone. Except for Wise\u2019s inconsistent statements implicating third parties, this evidence stands unimpeached, and we hold that it was fully sufficient to prove that Wise was guilty of willful, deliberate, and premeditated homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Nor does the evidence leave room for any reasonable doubt that Wise robbed his victim while armed with a deadly weapon. Ricketson had $12.00 in his wallet when he left home, and he made two expenditures in Chase City. One of the two wallets seized in the inventory search was empty and Ricketson\u2019s driver\u2019s license was found in Whittaker\u2019s trailer. Finally, in statements made in the presence of several witnesses and in interviews with the police, Wise complained that he had found only $6.00 on the man. It is immaterial whether the wallet was in the victim\u2019s pocket or, as Wise said on one occasion, on the dashboard of the truck. Ricketson\u2019s personal property was taken with intent to steal from his presence; proof of such a theft, accomplished by violence or intimidation, satisfies the definition of robbery, a common-law crime. <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 559, 561, 303 S.E.2d 911, 912-13 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Nevertheless, Wise maintains that the evidence fails to show a nexus between the homicide and the armed robbery as required by the capital murder statute. We disagree. The jury properly could have found that the theft occurred during or sometime after the first shot was fired but before the victim was submerged in the water where he drowned. Even if the wallet was taken from the truck after Ricketson expired, the homicide was a capital offense because \u201cthe evidence supports the conclusion that the killing and the theft were interdependent objects of a common criminal design\u201d. <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 310, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813 (1985). <em>See also Linwood E. Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 544, 273 S.E.2d 48, 56 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981) (killing following robbery \u201cpart of the same criminal enterprise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>THE PENALTY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The jury based the death penalty upon the \u201caggravated battery\u201d leg of the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Clearly, the multiple assaults visited upon Ricketson constituted \u201ca battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Yet, Wise urges us to commute his sentence because, he claims, it was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) and (D)(2). He advances only one argument in support of his claim. The penalty, he contends, was the product of cumulative prejudice resulting from the alleged errors which he believes led to his conviction. \u201c[S]ince we have determined that there was no error in the conduct of the guilt trial or the finding of an aggravated battery, there is no foundation for the defendant\u2019s cumulative-effect argument.\u201d <em>Boggs, 229 </em>Va. at 522, 331 S.E.2d at 422 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The defendant asks us on brief to hold that the death penalty is excessive \u201cin relation to the crime\u201d of which he was convicted. He cites <em>Coker </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584 (1977), where the Supreme Court, observing that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment bars . . . punishments . . . that are \u2018excessive\u2019 in relation to the crime committed\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 592, held that a sentence of death for the crime of rape is cruel and unusual punishment. The <em>Coker </em>court also noted, however, that \u201cin <em>Gregg </em>[v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153 (1976)] . . . the Court\u2019s judgment was that the death penalty for deliberate murder was [not] ... a punishment grossly disproportionate to the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The General Assembly has decided that the death penalty for deliberate, premeditated murder in the commission of armed robbery is not disproportionate to the crime unless it is \u201cdisproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases\u201d. Code \u00a717-110.1(C)(2). In making the comparison mandated by the statute, we focus primarily upon cases in which the supreme penalty was based, as it was here, upon the vileness predicate. Those cases are assembled and annotated in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 450-51 n.3, 323 S.E.2d 554, 567 n.3 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>105 S.Ct. 2713 (1985). <em>See also Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra; Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>We have examined the records in all the capital cases presented to this Court, including those in which a life sentence was imposed, and we find that juries in Virginia generally impose the death penalty for crimes comparable to the crime at bar. <em>See Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Finding no error in the proceedings below, we will affirm the several convictions and uphold the penalties imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
