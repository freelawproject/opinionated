Bird\u2019s (Marguerite) residuary estate through Code \u00a7 64.1-64<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>so-called \u201canti-lapse statute\u201d) as the illegitimate child of Vance L. Bird (Vance), deceased. The appellees, W. B. Bird and others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively, Bird), respondents in the court below, filed a demurrer and a special plea to the bill of complaint, both of which the trial court sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Bird\u2019s demurrer asserts that under the law existing at the time of Vance\u2019s death (Code \u00a7 64.1-5),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marshall had no right of inheritance by or through her putative father. Bird\u2019s special plea avers that Marshall\u2019s claim is barred by the provisions of Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because Marshall did not file her bill of complaint and affidavit within the prescribed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">A demurrer admits as true all material facts that are properly pleaded, <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>State Bank of Keysville, </em>229 Va. 534, 536, 331 S.E.2d 797, 798 (1985), and the facts germane to Bird\u2019s special plea are undisputed. Marshall was born out of wedlock on April 11, 1939. She claims to be the biological daughter of Vance, who died testate on July 8, 1977. Vance devised and bequeathed his entire estate to Marguerite, his wife, in fee simple. Marguerite died testate on June 23, 1981. She devised and bequeathed her residuary estate to Vance, in fee simple. Because Vance prede<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ceased and Marshall survived Marguerite, Marshall invokes the anti-lapse statute and claims the residuary estate in Vance\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Although Code \u00a7 64.1-5 had not been repealed at the time of Vance\u2019s death, the Supreme Court of the United States, approximately 12 weeks before Vance\u2019s death, declared unconstitutional an Illinois statute virtually identical to Code \u00a7 64.1-5. <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762 (1977). In response to that decision, the General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7 64.1-5 and replaced it with Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-5.1 and -5.2, effective July 1, 1978. Thus, Code \u00a7 64.1-5 had been declared unconstitutional prior to Vance\u2019s death, but the General Assembly did not repeal it until after his death. The repeal of Code \u00a7 64.1-5 and the replacement legislation, however, took effect nearly three years before Marguerite\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Our primary inquiry focuses upon Bird\u2019s special plea. This presents the question whether, under these facts, the trial court erred in holding that the one-year limitation provision in Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(3) barred Marshall\u2019s claim as the substitute devisee and legatee in Marguerite\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Trimble </em>effectively invalidated former Code \u00a7 64.1-5. Thus, prior to Vance\u2019s death, Marshall no longer was precluded from inheriting by or through her putative father. This broadened right for illegitimate children, constitutionally mandated, was codified in Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(2), effective July 1, 1978. It follows, therefore, that unless Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(3) bars Marshall\u2019s claim, she also had the right of substitution prescribed by Code \u00a7 64.1-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(3) provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">No claim of succession based upon the relationship between a child born out of wedlock and a parent of such child shall be recognized in the settlement of any decedent\u2019s estate unless [an affidavit of parenthood and an action to establish parenthood] has been filed within one year of the date of the death of such parent ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Because Vance died on July 18, 1977, under a literal reading of this provision, Marshall\u2019s right of action would have accrued more than 11 months before the enactment of the statute creating it. The trial court recognized that this would be an invalid application of the statute, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The court ruled, however, that the limitation period in Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1(3) began to run on July 1, 1978 (the statute\u2019s effective date). Therefore, under this ruling, the one-year limitation expired almost two years before Marguerite\u2019s death in June, 1981. But a statute of limitations cannot begin to run until a right of action accrues. <em>See Boykins Corp. </em>v. <em>Weldon, Inc., </em>221 Va. 81, 85, 266 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Clearly, until Marguerite died, Marshall had no right to claim her inheritance in Marguerite\u2019s estate through her putative father pursuant to Code \u00a7 64.1-64. In other words, Marshall\u2019s right to claim her inheritance did not accrue until Marguerite\u2019s death, and the court\u2019s application of the statute effectively destroyed Marshall\u2019s right to sue. Therefore, under the facts presented, the one-year time period did not commence to run until the date of Marguerite\u2019s death, and thus Marshall\u2019s affidavit and suit were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We hold, therefore, that the court erred in ruling that Marshall\u2019s right of action was time-barred. Otherwise, there would be a statutory taking of Marshall\u2019s property without due process of law in violation of both the Federal and Virginia constitutions. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 11; see <em>also Potomac Hospital </em>v. <em>Dillon, 229 </em>Va. 355, 329 S.E.2d 41 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We also hold that the trial court erred in sustaining Bird\u2019s demurrer on the ground that, at the time of Vance\u2019s death, Marshall could not inherit by or through her putative father. Although the General Assembly had not repealed Code \u00a7 64.1-5 at the time of Vance\u2019s death, <em>Trimble </em>implicitly declared it unconstitutional almost three months previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Accordingly, because the trial court erred in sustaining both the demurrer and the special plea, we will reverse its decree and remand the cause for an adjudication of parentage pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-5.1 and -5.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-17\"> Code \u00a7 64.1-64 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-18\">If a devisee or legatee die before the testator, leaving children or their descendants who survive the testator, such children or their descendants shall take the estate devised or bequeathed, as the devisee or legatee would have done if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>survived the testator, unless a different disposition thereof be made or required by the will.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> The other appellees are: D.
