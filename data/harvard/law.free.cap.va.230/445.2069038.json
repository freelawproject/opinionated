At the heart of the controversy is Code \u00a7 43-16,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that if \u201cthe owner\u201d is compelled to complete a building because of the general contractor\u2019s default, the amount expended by \u201cthe owner\u201d for such completion shall have priority over all mechanics\u2019 liens placed on the building. The sole question for decision is whether the appellee, Patricia Ann Willis, was \u201cthe owner\u201d of the subject property within the meaning of Code \u00a7 43-16 so that the amount she expended to complete the building was entitled to priority over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>mechanic\u2019s lien filed by the appellant, E. E. Stump Well Drilling, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The record shows that by deed dated December 12, 1980, Raymond E. McDaniels and Marsha R. McDaniels acquired title to Lot 14, Section 2, Lake View Estates, Bedford County, Virginia, and that they gave the seller a promissory note secured by a purchase money deed of trust for the balance due on their purchase. Both the deed and the deed of trust were recorded among the land records of Bedford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">By contract dated February 16, 1981, Raymond McDaniels agreed in writing to complete the house then under construction on the lot and to sell the property to Willis for $84,500. This contract was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In March 1981, Raymond McDaniels engaged Stump to drill a well on the property. Stump performed this service and billed McDaniels $2,657 for the cost of the work. This bill was not paid, and, on June 23, Stump filed a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien against the property, naming Raymond and Marsha McDaniels as \u201cOwner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Raymond McDaniels failed to complete the house and abandoned his contract with Willis. On August 6, 1981, Willis filed a bill of complaint against Raymond and Marsha McDaniels, seeking specific performance of the February 16, 1981 contract. Stump was named a party defendant on the basis that its mechanic\u2019s lien constituted \u201can encumbrance against the real estate.\u201d Stump filed an answer and a cross-bill in which it prayed for enforcement of its mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Willis and the McDaniels settled their differences, with the latter giving Willis a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the property in question. Willis dismissed her bill of complaint with prejudice, and the case was continued with respect to Stump\u2019s cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The promissory note given Willis was not paid when due. As a result, the property was sold under foreclosure at public auction, and Willis became the successful bidder, receiving a trustee\u2019s deed to the property dated March 25, 1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, Willis completed the house, expending $7,500 in excess of the original contract price, plus agreed extras. The trial court ruled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>$7,500 figure was entitled to priority over Stump\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien and, accordingly, that Stump was not entitled to enforce the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Stump argued in the trial court, and argues here, that Code \u00a7 43-16 protects only owners of record and that, because Willis was not the record owner when the mechanic\u2019s lien was filed, the amount she expended to complete the house was not entitled to the priority granted by the Code section. A prospective lienor, Stump maintained, \u201cshould not have to go outside the record to determine ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The trial court rejected Stump\u2019s argument, saying the argument missed the point. The court stated that the result, denial of Stump\u2019s right to enforce its lien, would have been the same \u201cwhether Stump had named McDaniels, Willis, or both\u201d in the memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien. \u201cThe question,\u201d the court continued, \u201cis owner status[,] not title status,\u201d and \u201cSection 43-16 protects equitable owners as well as fee title owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Stump concedes that Code \u00a7 43-16 protects owners of equitable interests in land. Stump argues, however, that the mechanics\u2019 lien statutes and the recording statutes must be read together, with the result that the owner of an equitable interest is protected by Code \u00a7 43-16 only if the contract or other document evidencing his interest is recorded. Because Willis did not record her contract before the mechanic\u2019s lien was filed, Stump concludes, she was not eligible for the priority granted by Code \u00a7 43-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We agree with Stump. Its argument finds support in both Virginia statute and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Brumback, 177 </em>Va. 36, 12 S.E.2d 801 (1941), Wallace filed mechanic\u2019s liens against two lots which were shown of record in the name of Brumback at the time construction was begun and materials were furnished; however, the lots were titled of record in the name of Smith when the memoranda of liens were filed. The memoranda listed Brumback as the owner of the liened property. The question for decision, we said, was \u201cwhether the liens . . . were perfected in the manner prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 12 S.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>We noted the requirements of Code \u00a7 6427 (now Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-4, -4.1) that a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien must show \u201c\u2018the names of the owner of the property sought to be charged,\u2019 \u201d 177 Va. at 41, 12 S.E.2d at 803, and that the memorandum must be indexed in the general index of deeds in the name of \u201c \u2018the owner of the property,\u2019 \u201d <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We noted also that the registry act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 5184 <em>et seq. </em>(now Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-80 <em>et seq.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>required \u201cthe recordation of certain writings in order to give constructive notice thereof to interested parties.\u201d 177 Va. at 42, 12 S.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">We said that \u201cthe mechanics\u2019 lien statutes should be read in connection with the registry acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 12 S.E.2d at 805. We stated further that \u201cthe provision for indexing mechanics\u2019 liens in the general index of deeds was intended to conform the recordation or registration of such liens with the recordation or registration of deeds of trust and like liens which are required to be indexed in the same manner under the registry act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 12 S.E.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Refining the question to be decided, we stated the precise issue in these words: \u201c[W]ho is the \u2018owner of the property sought to be charged\u2019 intended by Code, \u00a7 6427? Is it the person who owns the property at the time the building is begun and the materials furnished, or is it the person who owns the property at the time the lien is perfected?\u201d 177 Va. at 41, 12 S.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The answer, we said, is \u201cthe person who owns the property, or the interest therein to be affected, at the time of the recordation of the memorandum of the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 12 S.E.2d at 804. We acknowledged that, under this rule, \u201cbefore a mechanic\u2019s lien is perfected the claimant must ascertain [from the land records] the name of the \u2018owner of the property sought to be charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 12 S.E.2d at 805. We said, however, that this imposed \u201cno undue hardship on [the claimant]\u201d because, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>purchases property or desires to take a deed of trust on the property to secure a debt, \u201cthe law places [the] duty on him [of ascertaining the record status of title].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that, because the liens in question did not name the record owner at the time the memoranda of liens were filed, the liens were invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 12 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The rule enunciated in <em>Wallace </em>must work both ways. In other words, if a claimant stands to lose his lien if he does not name the person who is the record owner at the time the memorandum of lien is filed, then an owner of land or an interest therein should not be entitled to protection from a mechanic\u2019s lien if he fails to record the contract or other instrument evidencing his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Here, at the time Stump filed its memorandum of lien, the land records showed that Raymond and Marsha McDaniels were the owners of the property sought to be charged, subject only to the purchase money deed of trust then recorded against the property. In its memorandum of lien, Stump listed Mr. and Mrs. McDaniels as the owners of the property. The record gave Stump no notice of Willis\u2019s claimed interest. Under these circumstances, Stump was entitled to enforce its lien against the interest of the McDaniels, as shown by the record. <em>See Loyola Fed. Savings </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>218 Va. 803, 241 S.E.2d 752 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court erred in ruling that the sum of $7,500, expended by Willis, was entitled to priority over Stump\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-12\"> \u00a7 43-16. What owner may do when contractor fails or refuses to complete building, etc.\u2014If the owner is compelled to complete his building, structure, or railroad, or any part thereof undertaken by a general contractor in consequence of the failure or refusal of the general contractor to do so, the amount expended by the owner for such completion shall have priority over all mechanics\u2019 liens which have been or may be placed on such building, structure, or railroad by such general contractor, a subcontractor under him, or any person furnishing labor or materials to either of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> The deed actually conveyed the property to Willis and Lillian K. Webster. They will be referred to <em>infra </em>as Willis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> Stump also argues that, because it dealt directly with McDaniels, the record owner, and its work was completed as agreed, Code \u00a7 43-16 is inapplicable. Stump also argues that Code \u00a7 43-16 is inapplicable because Willis\u2019s interest in the property was derived, not from her contract with McDaniels, but from the trustee\u2019s deed recorded after the filing of Stump\u2019s lien. Neither of these arguments appear to have been made in the trial court, and we will not consider them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> Code \u00a7 6427 (now Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-4, -4.1) dealt with mechanics\u2019 liens of general contractors, a status Stump claims it occupied because it contracted directly with the owner. Code \u00a7\u00a7 6428 and 6429 (now Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-7 and 43-9) dealt with subcontractors and sub-subcontractors, respectively, and contained provisions for notice \u201cto the owner of the property or his agent\u201d of the amount and character of the claim involved in a mechanic\u2019s lien.
