His appeal presents issues respecting sufficiency of the evidence, juror qualification, cross-examination of the prosecutrix, pretrial discovery, and jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Pursuant to established law, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On June 6, 1983, between 8:00 and 9:30 p.m., Peggy Forbes, the prosecutrix, was alone in her apartment in Albemarle County. She was dressed in a \u201cblue robe and a bikini bathing suit bottom.\u201d Shortly before 8:00 p.m., her boyfriend and her one-year-old daughter left the apartment. While watching television, Forbes heard a knock on the door of her apartment. She opened the door \u201cpart way,\u201d and Barker pushed it open farther and hit Forbes on the head with \u201ca hard object.\u201d She fell to the floor and Barker pulled her into the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">When Forbes offered resistance, Barker cut her left wrist and arm with a knife. He threatened to continue cutting her if she persisted in fighting and screaming. Barker then \u201cripped . . . off\u201d Forbes\u2019 clothes and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Thereafter, Barker ordered Forbes to \u201croll over,\u201d and when she protested, Barker cut her again and threatened to kill her. Forbes then \u201crolled over,\u201d and Barker sodomized her. Afterwards, Barker pulled her into a bedroom and then departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">When the boyfriend returned to the apartment and discovered the situation, he called Forbes\u2019 father and the police. When the police arrived, Forbes \u201cappeared to be in shock.\u201d The police found blood stains on the living room rug, on a bedspread, and on Forbes\u2019 robe.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Forbes was taken to a hospital and about 2:00 a.m. was examined by a doctor. A bandage on her left arm was partially saturated with fresh blood, and blood was in her hair. Forbes was extremely nervous and appeared distraught and disheveled. She had a bruise on her forehead above her right eye and another bruise and a fresh abrasion on her chest. There were \u201cnumerous lacerations\u201d on her left forearm. Two of the larger cuts were bleeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and required surgical stitches. In addition, blood was found on both of Forbes\u2019 thighs.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">A pelvic examination revealed that her \u201cexternal genitalia were caked with blood.\u201d The examination also revealed \u201cactively motile\u201d spermatozoa and blood in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Two lacerations were discovered between her anus and \u201cthe posterior part of the vagina.\u201d There was a \u201cfive millimeter tear\u201d in her anal opening which the doctor testified could have resulted from penetration by a foreign object.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On June 12, 1983, Barker called Forbes on the telephone and told her that he should have killed her the first time and that he would do it \u201cthis time.\u201d In August 1983, while Barker was incarcerated, he said to another prisoner: \u201cI wish I had killed the bitch, that way I wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d Also in August, when Barker was being treated for an unrelated injury, he said to a hospital nurse, \u201cI raped that nurse a month ago.\u201d The evidence suggests that Barker\u2019s statement was a reference to Forbes, who formerly was employed as a nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">First, we consider Barker\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction. O\u00fcr standards for reviewing sufficiency of the evidence are well established. We must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Davis </em>v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 201, 205-06, 335 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1985); <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 510, 323 S.E.2d 539, 549 (1984), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, All </em>U.S. 1096 (1985). Additionally, the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are questions exclusively within the province of a jury. <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252, 257 S.E.2d 797, 803 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Barker points to certain conflicts in the evidence and inconsistencies in Forbes\u2019 testimony and, relying upon <em>Willis &amp; Bell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 560, 238 S.E.2d 811 (1977), argues that Forbes\u2019 testimony is inherently incredible. <em>Willis &amp; Bell </em>is inapposite. In that case, the victim\u2019s testimony was wholly uncorroborated and her testimony on direct examination conflicted with her testimony on cross-examination and at the preliminary hearing. Moreover, without explanation, she waited nearly a month before reporting the. alleged offenses. She also tried to withdraw the arrest warrants. Her reputation in the community for truthfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>was \u201clow.\u201d For these reasons, we held that the victim\u2019s story was \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 238 S.E.2d at 813. In <em>Willis &amp; Bell, </em>we recognized the weight to be accorded a jury\u2019s verdict but stated that \u201cwe are not required to believe that which we know to be inherently incredible or contrary to human experience. . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In the present case, however, Forbes\u2019 testimony was corroborated substantially by physical and medical evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the alleged attack, she was nervous and distraught, and a prompt report of the crimes was made to the police. Moreover, Barker made two incriminating statements to disinterested witnesses. The jury resolved the conflicts and inconsistencies in the evidence against Barker, and we cannot say as a matter of law that the jury\u2019s determination was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Next, we consider whether the trial court erred in refusing to exclude a venireman for cause. The record discloses that Barker previously had been convicted on the same charges and sentenced to 120 years in the penitentiary. Upon discovery of exculpatory evidence not disclosed during the first trial, a new trial had been ordered. During jury <em>voir dire </em>in the new trial, a venireman stated that she knew of Barker\u2019s previous conviction and 120-year sentence. Although the venireman equivocated when questioned about how this knowledge would affect her judgment as a juror, the trial court concluded that she was qualified and refused to exclude her from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">An accused has a fundamental right to a trial by an impartial jury. U.S. Const, amends. VI and XIV; Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. To qualify as a juror, a venireman must \u201cstand indifferent in the cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358, and any reasonable doubt regarding his impartiality must be resolved in favor of the accused. <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 90 (1980); <em>Breeden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">If there be a reasonable doubt whether the juror [is impartial and free from prejudice], that doubt is sufficient to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>sure his exclusion. For ... it is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it should also flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879). This does not mean, however, that a trial court must exclude all veniremen who have any preconceived opinion of the case. <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 256, 258, 307 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1983); <em>L. E. Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 180, 185-86, 279 S.E.2d 151, 154 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Ordinarily, a determination whether a juror is qualified rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its finding will not be disturbed on appeal absent manifest error. <em>Calhoun, 226 </em>Va. at 258-59, 307 S.E.2d at 898. Some veniremen, however, are excluded for cause automatically, irrespective of a showing of impartiality during <em>voir dire. </em>Such automatic exclusions leave no room for judicial discretion. <em>See Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 591, 311 S.E.2d 409 (1984) (automatic disqualification of juror based on kinship to victim); <em>Salina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 92, 225 S.E.2d 199 (1976) (automatic disqualification of juror based on ownership of stock in victim corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We believe the venireman in the present case was subject to automatic exclusion. It is difficult to perceive of anything more prejudicial to an accused than to be tried by a juror who knows that another jury unanimously had determined his guilt of the same offense charged. We hold, therefore, that when a venireman knows of an accused\u2019s previous conviction of the same offense for which he is being retried, the venireman cannot qualify as a juror in the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>568 F.2d 464 (5th Cir. 1978), involved a similar issue. There, two jurors who knew of the defendant\u2019s previous conviction on the same charges were allowed to serve in the subsequent trial. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, stating that \u201cwe are hard pressed to think of anything more damning to an accused than information that a jury had previously convicted him for the crime charged.\u201d 568 F.2d at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in refusing to exclude the venireman for cause. Because this case must be remanded, we will consider Barker\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>One assignment of error pertains to the trial court\u2019s limiting Barker\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecutrix. In an effort to show Forbes\u2019 bias and motive to fabricate the offense, Barker sought to cross-examine her on three matters related to the instant crimes. One matter concerned Forbes\u2019 one-million-dollar civil suit pending against her landlord for maintaining unsafe premises. Barker also endeavored to cross-examine Forbes concerning her attempt to receive benefits under a victim-assistance program which required her cooperation with all law-enforcement agencies. Finally, Barker wanted to question Forbes concerning her worker\u2019s compensation claim which was based on the theory that she met Barker in the course of her employment as a credit manager. The trial court refused to allow this line of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Cross-examination is fundamental to the truth-finding process. It is an absolute right guaranteed by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Shanklin </em>v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 862, 864, 284 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1981). One purpose of cross-examination is to show that a witness is biased and his testimony unreliable because it is induced by considerations of self-interest. <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 967, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977). Indeed, we consistently have held that \u201cthe right of an accused to cross-examine prosecution witnesses to show bias or motivation, when not abused, is absolute.\u201d <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 621, 623, 311 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We believe that the matters Barker wished to explore were appropriate subjects of cross-examination to test Forbes\u2019 credibility. Clearly, these matters were relevant to establish the victim\u2019s possible bias and motive to fabricate. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in restricting Barker\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Barker filed a discovery motion to obtain all information in the possession of the Commonwealth which \u201ccould tend to exculpate [Barker] or reduce the penalty which he might suffer should he be convicted.\u201d The information Barker sought was set forth in five specific requests. In one, he requested \u201c[t]he opportunity to examine any and all medical and psychiatric records\u201d of the prosecutrix. He stated that his request was made \u201c[p]ursuant to <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963), <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 789, 180 S.E.2d 504 (1971), and other pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>authority.\u201d The trial court refused to order the production of these records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The record before us is not altogether clear, but it seems to suggest that these medical and psychiatric records were not in the possession, custody, or control of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If this is the case, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney could not produce them. On the other hand, if any of these records are discoverable pursuant to <em>Brady </em>and <em>Stover, </em>and in the possession, custody, or control of the Commonwealth, then, upon remand, the court should order their production by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The final issue is whether the trial court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s proffered Instruction E, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">You may find the defendant guilty on the testimony of the complaining witness alone if it is credible and you believe it beyond a reasonable doubt. But if her testimony is incredible, or so contrary to human experience or to usual human behavior as to make it unworthy of belief, it is not sufficient to support a finding of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">This is not a case resting upon \u201cthe testimony of the complaining witness alone.\u201d To the contrary, as previously discussed, Forbes\u2019 testimony was corroborated by other evidence. Moreover, in other instructions, the court fully informed the jury of its proper role in considering the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and as we have stated before:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">When a granted instruction accurately states a principle of law, the trial court does not abuse its discretion by refusing another instruction involving the same legal principle. . . . Moreover, when one instruction correctly states the law, multiple instructions upon the same legal principle are undesirable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\"><em>Tuggle, 228 </em>Va. at 508, 323 S.E.2d at 548 (citations omitted). Thus, we conclude that the court did not err in refusing Barker\u2019s proffered instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Because the court erred in failing to exclude the juror and in limiting Barker\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecutrix, we will rerverse the judgment and remand the case for retrial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> We do not mean to suggest here that corroboration of a victim\u2019s testimony is essential to a conviction of rape. To the contrary, \u201c[i]t is not essential in a rape case for the prosecutrix to be corroborated!,] and her testimony alone is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>Poindexter </em>v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 212, 217, 191 S.E.2d 200, 204 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> The trial court did grant Barker\u2019s request for all reports and hospital and medical records pertaining to the victim\u2019s examination and treatment performed on the night of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"> The record indicates that some records were in the possession of the University of Virginia Hospital and others were in the possession of Forbes\u2019 psychiatrist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
