Trial was by jury with verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"> One exception is to the exclusion of a duly certified copy \u201cof the appraisal of the real estate of George and Harold Ripley, of Ludlow, Vermont, for the years 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949 as shown by the grand list books of said town of Plymouth for these years.\u201d It was offered for the purpose of showing the value of the \u201cPond Lot\u201d and \u201cas showing that, its value was reduced only one dollar on the grand list after all this cutting had been done on it.\u201d The offered appraisal is a public document. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>78 Vt 290, 312, 63 A 146. Therefore, it was admissible in evidence if pertinent to the issue. <em>Ripton </em>v. <em>Brandon, </em>80 Vt 234, 238-240, 67 A 541; <em>Citizens\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Fire Ins. Co., </em>86 Vt 267, 275, 84 A 970; <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>92 Vt 47, 49, 101 A 1018. One issue in the case at bar was the value of the timber claimed to have been cut by the defendant on the \u201cPond Lot.\u201d The grand list was pertinent to that issue. The difference in the value of the \u201cPond Lot\u201d before and after the cutting was some evidence of the value of the timber claimed to have been cut. The weight of that evidence, however slight, was for the jury to determine. Its exclusion was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Numerous other exceptions were briefed; because none of the questions raised by them are likely to recur on a new trial of the case we shall not mention them except to point out two faults. Most of them are inadequately briefed and fail to show harmful error. Exceptions that are inadequately briefed merit no consideration. Bressett <em>v. O\u2019Hara, </em>116 Vt 118, 123, 124, 70 A2d 238; <em>Sears </em>v. <em>LaBerge, </em>116 Vt 168, 172, 71 A2d 687; <em>Trudo </em>v. <em>Lazarus, </em>116 Vt 221, 225, 73 A2d 306. The burden is on the excepting party to show harmful error, that if error was committed his rights were injuriously affected thereby, and the risk of failure is upon him. Supreme Court rule 9; <em>Meyette </em>v. <em>Canadian Pac. Ry. Co., </em>110 Vt 345, 356, 6 A2d 33; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>113 Vt 258, 262, 32 A2d 679; <em>Turner y. Bragg, </em>113 Vt 393, 400, 35 A2d 356; <em>Macauley </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>114 Vt 198, 203, 42 A2d 482. <em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
