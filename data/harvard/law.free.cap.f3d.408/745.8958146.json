Williams appeals his concurrent 262-month sentences imposed after he pled guilty .to six counts of commercial business robbery, in violation of 18 -U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Because we have determined that Williams failed to establish plain error in his sentence enhancement for brandishing or possessing a gun during the robberies or- clear error in the denial of a downward departure for acceptance of -responsibility, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b794-21\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Williams committed six robberies of fine jewelry counters at Dillard\u2019s, Sears, Rich\u2019s and Belk stores in malls in Savannah, Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In five out of the six robberies, the victim sales clerk behind the jewelry counter stated that Williams possessed a firearm when he robbed the jewelry counter. All six vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>tims reported that Williams threatened to shoot or kill them.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In an interview with a probation officer following his pleading guilty, Williams stated that he did not possess a firearm during the robberies but admitted that, during one of the robberies, he placed his hand in a black bag, which might have appeared to be a gun. He also stated that he never threatened to shoot or kill anyone. Williams pled guilty to six counts of robbery of a commercial business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the plea colloquy, Williams admitted to the essential elements of his offenses, but he maintained that he did not have or display a gun at any of the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The probation officer calculated Williams\u2019s base offense level at 20 for each of the six counts, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a) (2003). The officer increased this base offense level by 5, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), for Counts One-Three and Five-Six, since Williams brandished or possessed a firearm during those robberies as attested by the victim sales clerks. The probation officer also increased Williams\u2019s base offense level by 2 for all counts, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C), since the fair market value of the merchandise stolen was more than $50,000. For Count Four, the probation officer increased the base offense level by 2, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), because Williams issued a threat of death to the victim sales clerk during that robbery. Because the probation officer calculated the offense level cumulatively without counting any enhancement more than once for all six counts, the combined adjusted total offense level was 32. The officer also found that Williams was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because his denial of possessing a firearm amounted to a false denial of relevant conduct. The probation officer additionally classified Williams as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). With an offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of VI, Williams\u2019s applicable sentencing range was 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Williams objected to the five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) in his offense level for possession of a firearm as well as the denial of a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1 for falsely denying his possession of a firearm. He argues that his offense level should have been 29 instead of 32, which would have yielded 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. At sentencing, the district judge found that Williams had used a firearm during the subject robberies based on the evidence of (1) two credible witnesses, victim sales clerks who had testified that Williams had a gun during their respective robberies, R2 at 23; (2) a videotape of a subsequent robbery of a jewelry counter within a store showing that Williams had a gun, <em>id. </em>at 23-24; (3) Williams\u2019s prior convictions for armed robbery, <em>id.; </em>and (4) his possession of a gun at his arrest like the one \u201cdescribed by two very credible witnesses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 24. The district judge determined that, because Williams had used weapons during the subject robberies, as the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sales clerks attested, he was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Considering the counts cumulatively, the judge sentenced Williams to a-concurrent sentence of 262 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him based on his using a firearm during the robberies to which he pled guilty because that fact was not admitted by him or proved to a jury. Therefore, he argues that his sentence was impermissible according to the law established in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403(2004). Williams did not raise this issue in district court. He also argues on appeal that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, since he pled guilty to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Because Williams\u2019s <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>issue implicated the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the Supreme Court now has decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we requested that counsel file supplemental briefs concerning the applicability of the Sentencing Guidelines in this case under the plain-error review standard. We have considered counsel\u2019s responsive briefs and now explain our decision in view of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">II. DISCUSSION ,</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">A. <em>Enhancement for Gun Possession During the Robberies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Williams first argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) for brandishing or possessing a firearm during the robberies. Since Williams did not make this objection in district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, 73 U.S.L.W. 3531 (U.S. Jun. 20, 2005) (No. 04-1148). Under this review standard, we can correct an error only if there was \u201c \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). The defendant has the burden of persuasion as to prejudice regarding the third part of the analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Provided these three conditions are met, we have discretion to correct a forfeited error \u201c \u2018only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Concerning the first part of the analysis, the district judge, based on his factual findings from the evidence presented to him at sentencing, enhanced Williams\u2019s sentence by five levels under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) for brandishing or possessing a gun during the robberies, a fact not found by a jury because of Williams\u2019s pleading guilty. Since at the time of sentencing, the judge considered the Sentencing Guidelines to be mandatory, this was <em>Booker </em>error. <em>Id.; see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756. Because this error was plain \u201c \u2018at the time of appellate consideration,\u2019 \u201d the second part of the plain-error analysis is met. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299 (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">The task for Williams, who bears the burden of persuasion regarding the third part of the plain-error analysis, is that he must show that the error \u201c \u2018affected the outcome' of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299 (quoting <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 632, 122 S.Ct. at 1786). That is, , he must demonstrate \u201cthat the error actually did make a difference\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>in his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1300. If we have to speculate concerning the result in the district court without the error, then \u201cthe appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not met his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Importantly, <em>Booker </em>did not change the Sentencing Guidelines extra-verdict enhancements in any way: \u201cThe same extra-verdict enhancement provisions apply after <em>Booker </em>as before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300. While the Sentencing Guidelines after <em>Booker </em>are advisory rather than mandatory, we have recognized that a resentencing before the district court would involve \u201cexactly the same evidence presenting exactly the same factual issues that it has already resolved, and it would be required to at least consider exactly the same guideline enhancement provisions it has already applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300-01. Consequently, in deciding the third part of the plain-error analysis, \u201cwe ask whether there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. This analysis necessarily is a case-by-case determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In this case, which involves a guilty plea as opposed to a trial, we do not have to speculate concerning what the district court would do if we remanded this case for resentencing. At the sentencing hearing, two of the victim sales clerks who were robbed by Williams testified that he had a gun during their respective robberies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first victim sales clerk who testified, Shannon A. Lyon, described the gun that Williams possessed during the robbery and also threatened to use to shoot customers or her if she did not cooperate by giving him the jewelry that he wanted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">Assistant United States Attorney [\u201cAUSA\u201d]: Were you a sales associate at Fin[ ]l[a]y Fine Jewelry Store at Rich\u2019s in Oglethorpe Mall on March 2nd of 2002?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">LYON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">AUSA: Were you working on that day? LYON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">AUSA: What were you doing on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">LYON: I was working behind the jewelry counters to help customers buy jewelry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">AUSA: Did you come into contact with the defendant on March 2nd of 2002 while working for Findl[a]y Fine Jewelry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">LYON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>AUSA: Could you describe for the Court the circumstances surrounding your encounter with the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">LYON: I walked over to the counter. And he said he was looking ... for an anniversary ring for his wife. And I said, oh, that\u2019s a great selection. And he asked to see one of our large princess cut with bag[u]ett[e] diamonds on either side of the ring. So, I opened the case, and I pulled it out, and I handed it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">And he looked at it, and he said well, I think I m[a]y like that other one better. So, I took the first ring back and put [it] in the case, pulled out a second ring that he wanted to look at. And he said, no, I like the first one better. So, I put that one back in the case. Pulled out the original ring. He\u2019s holding this with his left hand. He stuck his right hand in his jacket pocket and removed a white bag and put it on the counter. He said this is a robbery and it is not a joke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">And I didn\u2019t think I really heard him right. And I was kind of like oh, yeah, whatever. And apparently, he knew\u2014 recognized that I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. So, he removed from the same pocket a revolver, because I could see the side of the barrel. And he said this is a robbery. And I said okay. AUSA: What did the revolver look like? .LYON: I remember it was stainless steel, shiny looking. And smaller, it was about that big [gesturing].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">At this time I realize what was going on. And he said for me to start removing the 14-car[a]t gold watches. So, I started picking them up off the pad one by one, and put them in the bag. And he said you\u2019ve got to move faster, you\u2019ve got to move faster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">And I said okay. And then he said, now go to [the] diamond bracelet counter, because the diamond bracelets are sitting right next to it. So, I started putting those in the bags. He said do the whole pad, pick up the whole pad, and dump it in there. So, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">And then he said, give me some of those rings over there. So I started picking up rings. I finally asked him, I said is this enough. And he goes yeah, that\u2019s fine. And he said give me the bag. And I handed him the bag. And he looked at me in the eye, and he said \u201cif you call security I will shoot you, and I\u2019ll start shooting customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">AUSA: What did he do to the revolver during this time period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-12\">LYON: It was in his \u2014 he had put his hand back in his pocket to kind of cover it up. And it was pointed at me. So, I could see it was in my direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">AUSA: And then after he told you that if you advised anybody he would shoot you and start shooting customers, what happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-14\">LYON: He proceeded to walk off to my left side around the case. And I thought he was leaving out of the east door. I went to shut my door, but there . was a diamond bracelet left in it. So, I picked it up and threw it in there, and I shut it. And at this point, I think that he\u2019s gone. I turned to go call security, and he\u2019s still standing there by the 14-ear[a]t gold earrings in the locked section, which is on that side. And he looked at me and again he pulled out the gun partially, and he said, \u201cI will shoot you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-15\">At this point, I realize the severity of the situation, and I turned around. I was freaking out. I didn\u2019t know if he was going to shoot me in the back. I didn\u2019t know anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-16\">AUSA: What happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>LYON: Two ladies were coming down the escalator who also work for Rich\u2019s. And I knew that I- couldn\u2019t say anything, because if he was still standing behind me, there was a possibility that he would shoot me or them. So, I had to get their attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">So, I started crying. And I got their attention, and they came over and asked me if everything was okay. And I asked them if there was a black gentleman standing behind me and they said no. And I said, I\u2019ve just been robbed. You need to call security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">And that\u2019s when I went to hit the panic button.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 8-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The second victim sales clerk witness, who was robbed and testified at Williams\u2019s sentencing, was Kevin Todd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">AUSA: Mr. Todd, let me direct your attention to May 6th of 2002. Were you employed during this time period? TODD: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">AUSA: Where were you employed? TODD: Fin[ ]l[a]y Fine' Jewelry at the Savannah Mall, Belks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">AUSA: And what was your job there? TODD: Full time salesclerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">AUSA: On May 6th of 2002, were you working that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">TODD: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-14\">AUSA: And on May 6th of 2002, did you come into contact with the defendant? TODD: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\">AUSA: Okay. Could you describe to the Court your encounter with the defendant on May 6th of 2002?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-16\">TODD: While I was preparing to enter sales into the computer, when out of the corner of my glasses I noticed someone was standing] behind me. I got up to ask if someone needed any assistance. At first he said no, he was just looking. So, I went to dusting off the counter, cleaning, just to look busy, and, you know, wait to see if he needed anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-18\">Then he asked to see a bracelet in the counter. It was a \u2014 if I remember correctly, it was a 10-car[a]t diamond bracelet. I took it out, showed it to him, and he said he was shopping for a Mother\u2019s Day gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-19\">When I handed him the bracelet, he put it in his pocket, handed me a bag with the other hand, and then produced a gun which he held at hip level and told me that this was a robbery and to start filling the bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-20\">AUSA: The gun that you saw, could you describe it for t[he] Court, please? TODD: It was a small \u2014 between a ta[n]nish to a copper color revolver. AUSA: And what did he do after he patted to his side, what did he do with the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-21\">TODD: He waited until I started putting jewelry in the bag. And then he put the gun back in his pocket. But he didn\u2019t take his hand off of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-22\">AUSA: Could you see the barrel pointing out of his clothes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-23\">TODD: No. The level of the counter was above his pocket line. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-24\">AUSA: Okay. After he put the gun back into his pocket, what happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-25\">TODD: I started putting the jewelry in the bag, the pieces that he had specific ]ed. At first, I, you know, tried to put the whole panel plates in the bag. He said, no, no, just the jewelry and the fingers that they [we]re on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-26\">He pointed out to the bracelets and the rings. I put those in there. Handed him the bag, and then he told me to get on the floor and not get up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-27\">AUSA: Did he make any threatening comments to you at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>TODD: The only comment he said is don\u2019t do anything stupid, and you won\u2019t get hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">AUSA: And after you laid on the floor, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">TODD: I gave him about \u2014 I\u2019d say three to five seconds. I got up and yelled, \u201cChris, someone just robbed me. See if you see him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 13-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Following this testimony, the court received into evidence and the government played a videotape of Williams\u2019s robbery of a Sears jewelry store in Jacksonville, Florida, on May 15, 2002, where it appeared that Williams proceeded as in five of the six robberies at issue in this case by displaying a gun. The prosecutor further noted that, when Williams was arrested in Indiana, a gun matching the description of the revolver described by the victim sales clerks in this case, was found in his car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on statements and testimony of the robbed victim sales clerks in this case, Williams\u2019s continued use of a gun matching the one described by the robbed victim clerks in subsequent jewelry robberies, and Williams\u2019s possession of apparently the same gun at the time of his arrest, the government contended that \u201cthe evidence is overwhelming, certainly beyond a preponderance that the defendant used a gun during five of the six of these jewelry store robberies here.\u201d R2 at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">Nevertheless, Williams has maintained that he did not us\u00e9 a gun during these robberies, which went against the evidence and testimony in the case and was recognized by the district judge, the AUSA, and the probation officer, who prepared Williams\u2019s PSI.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district judge\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>change with Williams at sentencing explains his reasons for sentencing Williams at the upper level of the Sentencing Guidelines, including the five-level enhancement for brandishing or possessing a gun during the robberies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">THE COURT: ... Mr. Williams, you understand what is at issue here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A13\">DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">THE COURT: <em>You have denied that you use[d] a handgun. And you made that statement to me here at that time of the Rule 11 proceeding while you were under oath. The probation officer said you, still contend that. And you have heard the testimony of two clerks. I have observed a videotape that it appears to me that you had a gun. </em>And I make note of your record and the number of robberies and other criminal charges and convictions you have had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>Do you still deny that you used a handgun in these robberies ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvR\">DEFENDANT: <em>Yes, Your Honor. I didn\u2019t have a handgun. </em>I\u2019ve always had my hand as though maybe I had a gun. And I told them that I would hurt them, and I might have said I would shoot them. But I never pulled out no gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">I couldn\u2019t see the one from Jacksonville. I wasn\u2019t indicted on it. But I couldn\u2019t see it. If I had anything in my hand, it was a black bag. It wasn\u2019t a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">THE COURT: Well, <em>the Court, </em>as I noted, <em>listened to two very credible witnesses. I have looked at the videotape. </em>And obviously, I can\u2019t tell but <em>it certainly appears that he had a weapon on that occasion. Then you look at his convictions for armed robbery and, the fact that at the time of his arrest in Indiana that he possessed a weapon that was similar to that weapon described by two very credible witnesses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-13\">\n<em>The Court has no hesitancy finding that the probation officer got it right and the factual statements contained in the Presentence Report are correct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-14\">[T]he question of guidelines application that arose as to the conclusions reached and contained in Paragraph 21, 28, 85, 49, 75, 76, and 136, <em>the Court has no hesitancy, none at all, to adopt the probation officer\u2019s conclusions </em>as stated in the addendum, <em>and find that the defendant did use weapons, </em>and therefore, loses the reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-15\">The Court determines the applicable guidelines are a Total Offense Level of 32, a Criminal History Category of VI, indicating 210 to 262 months imprisonment, two to three years of supervised release, [$]17,500 to $175,000 fine. Restitution in the amount of $516,807.61 that is for the lost jewelry is also an option. And $600 special assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-16\">Now, I have <em>denied </em>\u2014 I <em>have said I don\u2019t believe you, Mr. Williams. And I have not one shadow of a doubt that you have lied to the probation officer. You have lied to the police, and you have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>lied to me. So, that does not serve you well here. </em>But, I 'want to tell you that if you have any information in mitigation of this sentence, anything you want to tell me about yourself or adduce any evidence, the Court, of course, will listen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">DEFENDANT: Okay. Your Honor, the only thing that I would like to say that, you know, like I\u2019m very remorseful about it. Things just got out of hand. I did one, and then I just kept doing them. You know, I did this in the \u201970\u2019s as you can see. And I haven\u2019t had \u2014 you know, did no robberies or nothing like that. I\u2019ye been in trouble and I haven\u2019t been out much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">And they just got out of hand. I just got addicted to it, and I done them. But my intention wasn\u2019t to hurt anybody. I never hurt anybody in anything, never pulled out any weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">And like I said, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">THE COURT: Well, in reading the Pre-sentence Report and seeing the amount of research that went into it by the \u2022 government and by the probation office, <em>I am rather struck that no one got injured in any of these numerous robberies, and the great amount of proceeds of which owners were deprived, over a half million dollars that we know of.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">\n<em>It is a frightening episode and frightening conduct. Those various clerks will remember those incidents forever. And your record is abysmal. And as you said, I don\u2019t know why you did it.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, it is the judgment of the Court that the defendant,- <em>Edwin Williams, is </em>committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons <em>to be imprisoned for a term of 262 months as to each of Counts 1 through 6, to be serve[d] concurrently.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">This sentence shall run consecutively to the state sentence of imprisonment the defendant is presently serving. <em>The Court finds no reason to depart from the sentence called for by the application of the guidelines.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">Since that range exceeds 24 months, the Court must give its reasons for imposing the selected sentence. Among the other things I have said,\" I w[ill] readdress part of my reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">\n<em>As I told Mr. Williams, he has falsely denied relevant conduct to the instant offense, that is his possession of a firearm during those offenses. Why he persisted in that, I do not know since he was arrested with a weapon. Credible witnesses identified him and the weapon. And all of the evidence points to that fact.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-14\">\n<em>The amount of exposure to great and permanent harm or death to which he gratuitously imposed his will upon the various clerks makes him a frightening person.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-15\">\n<em>Now, because the defendant has falsely advised the Court and persisted, and his substantial criminal record is replete with violent offenses, the Court has sentenced the defendant at the upper end of the guideline range.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 23-28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">Because of the victim sales clerks\u2019 testimony at Williams\u2019s sentencing resulting from his guilty plea as well as the district judge\u2019s commentary, we know that there is not a reasonable probability that the Sentencing Guidelines would have been applied differently if the judge had known that they were advisory instead of mandatory. In fact, the judge stated that the highest imprisonment period given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines for Williams\u2019s offense level, plus his being a career offender, comported with his determination of an appropriate sentence and that a downward departure was not warranted. R2 at 27. Additionally, the judge\u2019s making Williams\u2019s sentence concurrent for the six robberies instead of consecutive further shows his discretionary consideration of the Sentencing Guidelines in determining Williams\u2019s appropriate sentence, which is proper and acceptable under <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Significantly, \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) is a single-incident enhancement, which means that, for each robbery to which Williams pled guilty and possessed a gun, this five-level upward adjustment was available to increase his offense level. From statements by victim sales clerks, the PSI reveals Williams brandished or possessed a gun during five of the six robberies. The district judge explicitly stated on the record at Williams\u2019s sentencing that he found the two victim clerks who testified were credible. Instead of applying the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement for each robbery where there was evidence that Williams brandished or possessed a gun, an option available to the judge at the time of sentencing which was unaffected by <em>Booker, </em>the district judge applied this five-level enhancement only once in Williams\u2019s total offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The district judge\u2019s in-court assessment of the testimony of the victim sales clerks is augmented by Williams\u2019s criminal history of armed robberies and the fact that Williams possessed a gun matching the one described by the victim sales clerks when he was apprehended in Indiana for yet another robbery. The judge additionally found it remarkable that neither the victim sales clerks nor other store personnel were injured because of Williams\u2019s possessing a gun during the robberies at issue in this case and noted the psychological harm that an armed robbery can cause a victim. Since the Sentencing Guidelines permit application of a \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement for each robbery in which a gun was brandished or possessed, the district judge made a discretionary determination to include this enhancement only once in calculating Williams\u2019s offense level.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Review of the sentencing transcript makes clear that the district judge gave Williams a five-level enhancement for brandishing or possessing a gun during the subject robberies not because he thought that the Sentencing Guidelines mandated the five-level, upward adjustment in his offense level but because he thought that it was warranted, and he elected to apply it only once. Remand for resentencing post-Roofcer is needless, because it is obvious from the district judge\u2019s statements and reasoning at Williams\u2019s sentencing that the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement would be applied again.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Consequently, remand for resentencing to consider <em>Booker </em>would be judicially inefficient, particularly, when Williams has not asserted any error in his guilty plea. The \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement is the only aspect of the components of Williams\u2019s offense level about which he complains that implicates <em>Booker. </em>The district judge\u2019s explanation of his reasons for Williams\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>tence included Williams\u2019s armed-robbery recidivism, which makes him a dangerous individual to be in society. The <em>pre-Booker, </em>discretionary calculation of Williams\u2019s sentence is evidenced by the judge\u2019s applying the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement only once for all the robberies to which Williams pled guilty, when there was evidence from the victim clerks that he brandished or possessed a gun in five of the six robberies, and in making Williams\u2019s 262 months of imprisonment concurrent for each robbery count to which he pled guilty instead of consecutive. Consequently, we are convinced that the district judge sentenced Williams at the upper end of the Sentencing Guidelines range, or 262 months of imprisonment, because he considered that to be the appropriate sentence and not because he thought that the Sentencing Guidelines mandated that sentence. Therefore, there is no <em>Booker </em>error to correct as to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) enhancement on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">B. <em>Denial of Accept'ance-of-Responsibility Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Related to his gun possession during the subject robberies, Williams also argues on appeal that the district court erred by not granting him. a downward departure in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, since he pled guilty to all counts. He contends that the probation officer\u2019s facts stated in the PSI and the district court\u2019s factfinding stated at sentencing regarding his possession of a firearm should not have had any effect on whether he received this reduction. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Calhoon, </em>97 F.3d 518, 531 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">A defendant bears the burden of showing entitlement to a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although a guilty plea \u201cwill constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility[,] .... this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, \u201ca defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 1(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Williams asserts that his guilty plea was sufficient to show his acceptance of responsibility. As we have explained, based on the testimony of the victim clerks at Williams\u2019s sentencing and his recidivism history of armed robberies, the district judge determined that Williams not only had been untruthful with the probation officer but also had testified falsely at his plea proceeding and at his sentencing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment, (n.5). Because the sentencing judge explained his reasons for concluding that Williams had testified- falsely in contrast to credible victim witnesses, Williams has failed to establish that it was clear error for the district judge to deny him a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility when the judge determined that Williams had falsely denied relevant conduct. Accordingly, we find no clear error in the sentencing judge\u2019s denying Williams a \u00a7 3E1.1 downward departure for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">Williams has challenged his 262-month sentence following his guilty plea because of the enhancement for brandishing or possessing a gun in committing the robberies at issue in this appeal as well as his not receiving a downward departure in his offense level for pleading guilty to the six robberies charged. As we have explained <em>post-Booker, </em>Williams failed to establish plain error concerning the five-level enhancement in his offense level that he received under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), and the lack of credibility regarding his statements and testimony that he did not possess a gun when he committed the subject robberies precluded his eligibility for a \u00a7 3E1.1 downward departure for acceptance of responsibility because of his guilty pleas. Accordingly, Williams\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-13\">.

Instead, the same language occurs in each count and describes the particular robbery of a victim sales clerk as being \u201cby means of threatened force, violence, and fear of injury; when the natural consequences of such act of robbery would be to delay, interrupt or adversely affect commerce and the movement of articles and commodities in commerce.\u201d Rl-1 at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">.

We note that, by specifically excluding robbery under \u00a7 2B3.1 from criminal counts that must be grouped in calculating an offense level, the Sentencing Guidelines permit a district judge not to group the counts or separate robberies and thereby make a consecutive calculation to determine the offense level or, as the judge did in this case, to group the counts in calculating the offense level so that an enhancement, such as gun possession during the robbery under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), would be included only once for all robberies in which a gun was possessed.
