App. 668, 414 S.E.2d 842 (1992). A dissenting opinion was filed in the panel decision. Lemons\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted and was argued on June 17, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">We hold that the issues presented in this case are controlled by our opinion in <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 99, 402 S.E.2d 692, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>13 Va. App. 284, 410 S.E.2d 412 (1991). Accordingly, we vacate the convictions and remand the case to the trial court for it to order the production of the verbatim statement of Randall Murray for an in camera inspection and inclusion in the record. The trial court shall determine the statement\u2019s \u201cmateriality\u201d as that term is defined in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). If it is found to be \u201cmaterial,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>in that there is a reasonable probability that its full disclosure would have resulted in a different outcome, Lemons should be granted a new trial. If not, the trial court shall reinstate the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">In accordance with these directives, the opinion previously rendered by a panel of this Court on February 25, 1992 is withdrawn and the mandate entered on that date is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">The trial court shall allow court-appointed counsel a total fee of $600 for services rendered the appellant, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Benton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinions in <em>Lemons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 668, 674-76, 414 S.E.2d 842, 846-47 (1992) (Duff, J., dissenting) and <em>Clodfelter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1831-89-2 (Unpublished, April 18, 1992) (en banc) (Benton, J., dissenting), I would vacate the conviction and grant a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record clearly establishes that the evidence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Commonwealth withheld was exculpatory. It bears repeating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>this Court has an obligation to thwart efforts to trivialize the clear mandate of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-9\"> Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 99, 402 S.E.2d 692, <em>affd en banc </em>13 Va. App. 284, 410 S.E.2d 412 (1991), we convened <em>en banc </em>in <em>Clodfelter </em>to consider again the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to disclose exculpatory material to a defendant. The Court issued an unpublished order which did not address the repetitive nature of the problem. At that time I wrote the following dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-10\">Donald M. Clodfelter was denied a fair trial when the Commonwealth failed to disclose, in response to a specific request, material that would have allowed impeachment of the Commonwealth\u2019s major witness. The Commonwealth is obliged to disclose to a defendant all evidence in its possession that is favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). The duty of disclosure includes information that has impeachment value. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 142, 150, 341 S.E.2d 159, 164 (1986). Because the Commonwealth erred in failing to disclose the impeachment evidence, I would reverse the conviction, and remand for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-11\">At trial, the Commonwealth relied primarily upon the testimony of Terri Spence, a convicted felon and informer, to implicate Clodfelter in the distribution of a controlled substance. Spence testified, however, that she was unable to specify the type and number of all the offenses for which she had been granted immunity through her cooperation with the prosecution. A police officer who had interviewed Spence prior to trial testified that he had written notes reflecting all of the crimes to which Spence had confessed and to which Spence was granted immunity. Despite a pretrial discovery request for exculpatory information, the prosecution failed to deliver the information to Clodfelter. Moreover, at trial, when the officer disclosed the existence of the notes, the trial judge, without explanation, denied Clodfelter\u2019s request for those notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Where \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,\u201d evidence relevant to truthfulness, reliability, and credibility is as constitutionally material as evidence which goes directly to the question of guilt. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>4 Va. App. 371, 385, 358 S.E.2d 576, 584 (1987) (quoting <em>Dozier v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1113, 1118, 253 S.E.2d 655, 658 (1979)), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>6 Va. App. 38, 366 S.E.2d 615 (1988), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>493 U.S. 945 (1989). \u201c[I]t is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959). The information the Commonwealth failed to disclose was exculpatory and should have been disclosed. <em>See Robinson, </em>231 Va. at 150, 341 S.E.2d at 164. Moreover, where, as here, an accused has made an express request for specific exculpatory evidence, there can \u201cseldom, if ever\u201d be an excuse for not complying with the request. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 106. The conviction must be reversed by this Court if the undisclosed impeachment evidence \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome\u201d of the trial. <em>Robinson, </em>231 Va. at 151, 341 S.E.2d at 164 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAN\">The majority correctly asserts that <em>Bagley </em>requires reversal only if \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d exists that the results of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been included, but it errs in remanding this case to allow the trial judge to determine the materiality of the evidence. <em>See People v. Morris, </em>46 Cal. 3d 1, 30 n.14, 756 P.2d 843, 861 n.14 (1988). When the informant testified that she did not know the extent of her confessed crimes and was unable to relate the crimes for which she has been granted immunity, Clodfelter was denied a <em>meaningful </em>opportunity to cross-examine and impeach the informant. A fair trial is not a mere abstraction satisfied by a trial ritual. Under the circumstances of this case, it is clear that \u201cthe [undisclosed] evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-8\">Further, by failing to submit the officer\u2019s notes for inclusion in the record, the Commonwealth has rendered it impossible for this Court to evaluate the full effect of the deprivation. Although the trial judge refused to order the prosecution to disclose the officer\u2019s notes to Clodfelter, the trial judge did \u201corder that [the notes] be filed and made a part of the record.\u201d In contravention of that order, the Commonwealth did not file the notes in the record of this case. The record contains no explanations for the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide exculpatory information to Clodfelter\u2019s counsel and to abide by the trial judge\u2019s order to deliver the information <em>in camera </em>for inclusion in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">In <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 99, 402 S.E.2d 692, <em>aff'd en banc </em>13 Va. App. 284, 410 S.E.2d 412 (1991), this Court vacated a conviction and remanded the proceeding to the trial court due to a <em>Brady </em>violation. This case arises from the same trial court and involves the same Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s office. Trial courts must be sensitive to \u201cpernicious trial tactics used as a subterfuge to circumvent required discovery.\u201d <em>Moreno v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 408, 416, 392 S.E.2d 836, 842 (1990). \u201cCourts have the responsibility to monitor the conduct of those attorneys who appear before them and assure adherence to professional standards.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Pt. 6, \u00a7 III Canon 3(B)(3). The <em>Brady </em>principles are not new; they were announced in 1963. This Court must insist that the obligation of the Commonwealth to divulge evidence favorable to an accused upon request not be trivialized. \u201c[Suppression [of that evidence] by the prosecution . . . violates due process.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">By allowing the prosecution to withhold evidence that may have tended either to exculpate the defendant or reduce his punishment, the trial court helped to \u201cshape a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>trial that . . . [bore] heavily on the defendant.\u201d It cast \u201cthe prosecutor in the role of an architect of a proceeding that [did] not comport with standards of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\"><em>White, </em>12 Va. App. at 103, 402 S.E.2d at 695 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87-88).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-8\">The purpose of the <em>Brady </em>rule is \u201cto ensure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 675. To allow routine, systematic non-disclosure of material exculpatory evidence at the trial level by affirming convictions simply because the defendant cannot establish on appeal that the non-disclosure adversely affected the outcome trivializes the clear mandate of <em>Brady </em>and the professional obligation of the prosecutor. <em>See </em>DR8102(A)(4). \u201c[T]he prosecution\u2019s duty of disclosure extends to <em>ail </em>evidence that reasonably appears favorable to the accused, not merely to that evidence which appears likely to affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>46 Cal. 3d at 30 n.14 756 P.2d at 861 n.14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-9\">I dissent.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1060-5\">Moon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlI\">with whom Coleman, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s action in this case because, notwithstanding the decision in <em>White v.

App. 668, 414 S.E.2d 842 (1992), I do not believe the facts of this case warrant remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
