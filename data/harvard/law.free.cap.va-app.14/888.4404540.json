The court\u2019s order recites that defendant \u201cpleaded guilty\u201d and was found \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d However, in accordance with the terms of a \u201cPLEA AGREEMENT\u201d (agreement), accepted by the trial court, \u201cthe finding of guilty\u201d was withheld, and defendant was placed \u201cunder the supervision of a probation officer ... for the term of one year,\u201d upon specified conditions. As also agreed, the order provided that, \u201c[i]f probation is successfully completed at the end of one year,\u201d the court \u201cshall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">At the conclusion of the probationary period and following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the trial court concluded that defendant had \u201cfailed to abide\u201d by the terms of the previous order and related probation, convicted defendant of the offense and imposed sentence. Defendant appeals, complaining that the trial court (i) erred in \u201cnot dismissing defendant\u2019s case\u201d in accordance with a \u201cprobation status report which recommended [her] release\u201d and (ii) violated defendant\u2019s \u201cdue process rights\u201d by \u201cnot giving her notice\u201d of the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201chostile position.\u201d We find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the trial court acted appropriately and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The original order of the trial court, in furtherance of the agreement, required that defendant submit to random \u201cdrug tests and screens,\u201d be of \u201cgood behavior\u201d and comply with the \u201crules of probation.\u201d It is uncontroverted that defendant provided a \u201curine specimen which tested positive for marijuana\u201d during the probationary period. Nevertheless, the probation officer reported that defendant had \u201cadjusted well\u201d to probation and recommended her release \u201cfrom supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The trial court, however, was neither persuaded nor limited by the recommendations of the probation officer and retained its full authority to independently evaluate defendant\u2019s compliance with its earlier order. Code \u00a7 19.2-306; <em>see Bassett v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 580, 582, 414 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1992). Probation is a disposition intended to \u201creform\u201d the offender, appropriate in \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d or to promote the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 219, 116 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1960); <em>see Singleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 575, 578, 400 S.E.2d 205, 207 (1991). It provides an \u201c\u2018opportunity\u2019 \u201d for an accused to \u201c \u2018repent and reform,\u2019 \u201d which may be withdrawn for <em>\u201creasonable cause,\u201d </em>determined in the \u201c <em>\u2018sound discretion </em>of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marshall, </em>202 Va. at 219-20, 116 S.E.2d at 273 (quoting <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 810-11, 109 S.E. 460, 462 (1921), and <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 367, 38 S.E.2d 479, 484 (1946)) (emphasis added); Code \u00a7 19.2-306. Therefore, the issue on review of a revocation is \u201csimply whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>202 Va. at 221, 116 S.E.2d at 274; <em>see Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 81, 86, 402 S.E.2d 684, 687 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Defendant\u2019s use of illegal drugs during the probationary period was inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the probation and evidenced her unwillingness to avail herself of the opportunity afforded by the court. Under such circumstances, the judgment of the trial court clearly constituted no abuse of discretion. <em>See Marshall, </em>202 Va. at 220-21, 116 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Defendant next contends that the dispositional proceedings violated her \u201cdue process rights.\u201d This issue, however, was not argued before the trial court and Rule 5A:18 requires that the trial judge be given \u201cthe first opportunity to rule on disputed eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>tiary and procedural questions.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 418, 423, 350 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1986). A matter not in dispute before the trial court will not be considered for the first time on appeal, Rule 5A:18; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991), with no exception afforded to \u201cdue process\u201d claims. <em>Superintendent </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>215 Va. 122, 123-24, 207 S.E.2d 823, 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">While this Court will \u201cnotice . . . error [] for which [there has been] no timely objection . . . when necessary to [satisfy] the ends of justice,\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989), the record must \u201caffirmatively [show] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not . . . that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Mounce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). Our review of the record discloses no miscarriage of justice in the instant case. <em>See Jimenez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 402 S.E.2d 678 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Baker, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-11\"> This disposition is expressly authorized by Code \u00a7 18.2-251 in certain circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
