In fact, Scafetta proffered the trial court \u201cthat the model KR-10SP is not the same as an earlier model manufactured by Kustom Electronics, the model KR-10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">This proffer tends to establish only that the radar device used to check the speed of Scafetta\u2019s automobile is not the model KR-10 included on the public notice from the Federal Communications Commission. It does, not tend to prove that the radar device is not one of the other radar devices listed on the public notice. Without evidence showing that the radar device used had not been approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>notice was not relevant and material. A showing of relevance and materiality is required before a party entitled to have evidence introduced may establish on appeal that a trial court erred by excluding it. <em>Toro </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>14 Va. App. 244, 416 S.E.2d 29 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The results of the use of a radar device to measure a motor vehicle\u2019s speed is prima facie evidence of the speed of the vehicle. Code \u00a7 46.2-882. While this prima facie evidence may be rebutted by showing that the radar device used is not approved by the Federal Communications Commission, it is not rebutted merely by showing that the devise used is not the same as one with a similar identification number which has been so approved. Therefore, the proffer in the record of this appeal is not sufficient to establish the materiality of the public notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Having found no error in the opinion of this Court, the stay of the mandate is ended, and the mandate entered on February 18, 1992 is reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
