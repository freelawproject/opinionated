An appeal bond was not posted when the order terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights was appealed from the juvenile and domestic relations district court to the circuit court. We hold that such a bond is not required because appeals from orders terminating parental rights are governed by the provisions of Chapter 7 (\u00a7\u00a7 16.1-123.1 et seq.) of Title 16.1, not Code \u00a7 16.1-107 governing appeals of certain civil cases from courts not of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">The juvenile and domestic relations district court granted a petition of the Hopewell Department of Social Services to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights to her child in order to place the child for adoption. The mother appealed to the circuit court. The circuit court, on the motion of the department of social services, dismissed the appeal because the mother had not posted an appeal bond within thirty days of entry of the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Appeals \u201c[f]rom any order entered or judgment rendered in a court not of record in a civil case in which the matter in contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>versy is of greater value than fifty dollars ... or when the case involves the constitutionality or validity of a statute ... or of an ordinance or bylaw of a municipal corporation\u201d are governed by the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-106 through 16.1-118.1. Code \u00a7 16.1-106. Appeals governed by these provisions are not \u201callowed unless and until the party applying for the same . . . shall give bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the [court].\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">However, these provisions do not apply to an appeal of a proceeding \u201cinvolving termination of parental rights brought under \u00a7 16.1-283.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-296. Appeals from these proceedings, like \u201cany final order or judgment of the juvenile court affecting the rights or interests of any person coming within its jurisdiction,\u201d are governed by the provisions of Chapter 7 of Title 16.1. Code \u00a7 16.1-296. Chapter 7 of Title 16.1 provides a right of appeal without requiring an appeal bond. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The department of social services relies on our opinion in <em>Scheer v. Isaacs, </em>10 Va. App. 338, 392 S.E.2d 201 (1990), to support its position that the provision in Code \u00a7 16.1-107 requiring an appeal bond applies to this proceeding. <em>Scheer </em>dealt with a judgment awarding child support arrearage, not with a termination of parental rights. <em>Scheer, </em>10 Va. App. at 339, 392 S.E.2d at 202. The opinion in <em>Scheer </em>expressly distinguished \u201can order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court terminating residual parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 392 S.E.2d at 203. Furthermore, although Chapter 7 of Title 16.1 relates to \u201c[\u00a1jurisdiction and [procedure in [cjriminal [m]atters,\u201d its provisions remain \u201cthe only vehicle for appeal from the juvenile court to the circuit court.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 562 n.2, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 n.2 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the mother\u2019s appeal; therefore, we reverse its order dismissing her appeal and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Koontz, C.J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
