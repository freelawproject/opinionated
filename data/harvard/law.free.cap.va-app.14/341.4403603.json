(now U.S. Air) and Twin City Fire Insurance Co. appeal from an award of temporary total disability benefits by the Industrial Commission. On appeal, appellants assert that the full commission erred: (1) when it failed to hold that principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred compensation, where an earlier claim for compensation based on the same injury but for different time periods was rejected; and (2) when it entered an award of temporary total disability benefits where there was no evidence of wage loss and claimant allegedly did not meet the statutory requirements for total disability. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Diane Collins Merillat, claimant, sustained shoulder and neck injuries on August 11, 1978, while employed as a flight attendant at an average weekly wage of $330. Allegheny Airlines has paid disability benefits for various periods following her injury. In a prior proceeding, claimant sought compensation for total work incapacity for various periods in 1988. On July 10, 1989, the deputy commissioner held that, because claimant\u2019s average weekly wage was in excess of that which existed at the time of the injury, she could show no wage loss, a prerequisite to any award for temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>This appeal arises from an award of temporary total disability benefits for various periods in 1989 and 1990. The records of claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Kent A. Peterson, were made a part of the record. They indicate that, prior to or during the periods for which claimant was later awarded compensation, Dr. Peterson advised claimant that she should not work. At a post-hearing deposition, Dr. Peterson indicated that claimant may have been capable of performing restricted work during the periods claimed; yet he also stated that \u201cwhen I saw her I told her to go off work and rest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In a September 26, 1990 opinion, the deputy commissioner awarded benefits for the periods in 1989 and 1990. The deputy commissioner held that the July 10, 1989 decision of the Industrial Commission was not binding and that principles of res judicata did not apply because \u201cthe periods of disability claimed and adjudicated are not the same.\u201d The full commission agreed with the deputy commissioner and affirmed. On appeal, appellants contend that the legal holdings in the commission\u2019s July 10, 1989 opinion have preclusive effect in the more recent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A judicially created doctrine, res judicata \u201crests upon considerations of public policy which favor certainty in the establishment of legal relations, demand an end to litigation, and seek to prevent the harassment of parties.\u201d <em>Bates v. Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 670, 202 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1974) (citations omitted). While the doctrine \u201c \u2018is firmly established in our jurisprudence and should be maintained where applicable,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Ward v. Charlton, 177 </em>Va. 101, 115, 12 S.E.2d 791, 796 (1941)), we find that in the present case the doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Of the four preclusive effects encompassed by the term \u201cres judicata,\u201d collateral estoppel is that which impacts \u201cin a subsequent action based upon a collateral and <em>different cause of action.'\u2019\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 671, 202 S.E.2d at 921 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action brought by claimant in this case is a \u201cdifferent cause of action\u201d than that decided by the Industrial Commission on July 10, 1989, as claimant\u2019s case rests on different proof. Even so, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar claimant\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cThe true test of the conclusiveness of a former judgment with respect to particular matters is identity of issues. If a particular point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of the particular point or question, a former judgment between the same parties will be final and conclusive in the second [action] if that same point was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Graham v. Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>230 Va. 273, 277, 337 S.E.2d 260, 263 (1985) (quoting <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>199 Va. 130, 134, 97 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1957)) (citations omitted). \u201c[A]n appropriate test for determining the identity of issues involved in former and subsequent actions is \u2018whether the same evidence will support both actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pickeral v. Federal Land Bank, 177 </em>Va. 743, 751, 15 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Because the periods of disability claimed are not the same, and because the medical evidence relied on for the more recent claims is different from that relied on for the earlier claims where different periods of disability were at issue, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not control determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Appellants also claim that the commission erred in entering an award of temporary total disability benefits where there was no evidence of wage loss and claimant\u2019s disability was allegedly not total.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">As a preliminary matter, we dismiss appellants\u2019 assertion that claimant was not totally disabled during the periods for which she claimed benefits. In making this assertion, appellants have relied on /)o,st-hearing testimony of claimant\u2019s treating physician. This testimony indicated that claimant could \u2018have performed light work during the periods of disability at issue. However, the doctor also stated that, contemporaneous with each period of disability, he told claimant not to work but instead to rest. The doctor did not at these times even discuss with claimant the possibility of light work. The evidence established that claimant\u2019s disability for the periods claimed was total.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Appellants further contend that Code \u00a7 65.1-54 requires wage loss. Appellants are presumably referring to the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>commission\u2019s July 10, 1989 decision, where the commission held that \u201ccompensation could only be awarded when the employee\u2019s weekly earnings are reduced below his pre-injury average weekly wage as a result of injuries sustained in the industrial accident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 65.1-54 contains no such requirement. The only precedent cited by appellants in support of their position is that found in <em>J. A. Foust Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Messer, </em>195 Va. 762, 80 S.E.2d 533 (1954). There, the Supreme Court interpreted Code \u00a7\u00a7 65-51 and 65-52, predecessors to Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-54 and 65.1-55, and held that \u201c[bjenefits awarded under \u00a7\u00a7 65-51 and 65-52 cover losses occasioned by the impairment of the claimant\u2019s earning capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766, 80 S.E.2d at 535. <em>Foust </em>does not hold that the earning impairment suffered by claimant must be considered in relation to pre-injury earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Finally, appellants argue that claimant\u2019s wage loss cannot be calculated on a daily basis. While it is true that Code \u00a7 65.1-54 requires that an employer compensate a totally incapacitated employee at a \u201cweekly compensation\u201d rate, there is no requirement of a minimum of one week\u2019s incapacity. As long as the manner in which the wage loss for a period of disability of less than one week is calculated as an appropriate fraction of the weekly compensation rate, the requirement of the statute is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Baker, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> The other three preclusive effects, merger, direct estoppel, and bar, are not applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> For reasons already discussed, principles of res judicata do not require that the July 10, 1989 decision of the Industrial Commission controls this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
