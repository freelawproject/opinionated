On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the drug. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The record discloses that Officer Julie Keene (Keene) observed defendant at approximately 11:25 p.m., seated on a bicycle \u201cnear a street light,\u201d \u201criffling through a wallet.\u201d Knowing that several \u201cwallets and purses had been taken\u201d in the \u201cgeneral vicinity\u201d during recent weeks, Keene approached defendant and inquired if the wallet belonged to him. Defendant \u201cresponded by saying that it was his wallet,\u201d and asked whether Keene \u201cwanted to look at it.\u201d As defendant \u201cwas handing [her] the wallet,\u201d Keene noticed that his left fist was tightly closed. Defendant twice refused Keene\u2019s request to open his fist, and, \u201cthinking that [defendant] might have a weapon in his hand,\u201d she \u201cgrabbed [his] arm directly above the wrist.\u201d Defendant then opened his hand, revealing the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Fourth Amendment jurisprudence \u201chas placed police-citizen confrontations into three categories.\u201d <em>Iglesias </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 93, 99, 372 S.E.2d 170, 173 (1988). \u201cFirst, there are communications between police officers and citizens that are consensual and, therefore, do not implicate the fourth amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, are \u201cbrief investigatory stops\u201d based upon \u201cspecific and articulable facts,\u201d and third, are \u201chighly intrusive, full-scale arrests\u201d based upon probable cause. Id.; <em>see also United States v. Alpert, </em>816 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">A consensual encounter occurs when police officers approach persons in public places \u201cto ask them questions,\u201d provided \u201ca reasonable person would understand that he or she could refuse to cooperate.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>953 F.2d 116, 121 (4th Cir. 1991) (quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 431 (1991)); <em>see also Richards </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 612, 615, 383 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1989). Such encounters \u201cneed not be predicated on any suspicion of the person\u2019s involvement in wrongdoing,\u201d and remain consensual \u201cas long as the citizen voluntarily cooperates with the police.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 121. Fourth Amendment scrutiny is triggered, however, the moment an encounter \u201c \u2018loses its consensual nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the Fourth Circuit considered \u201cthe effect of a person\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to terminate what began as a consensual encounter.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 121. The court opined that a voluntary police-citizen encounter \u201cshould be placed in the realm of [a] Fourth Amendment \u2018seizure\u2019 \u201d when \u201ca reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Richards, </em>8 Va. App. at 615, 383 S.E.2d at 270 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980)); <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 363, 365, 398 S.E.2d 690, 691 (1990); <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 305, 307, 373 S.E.2d 170, 171 (1988). The \u201cprinciple embodied by the phrase \u2018free to leave\u2019 means the ability to ignore the police and to walk away from them,\u201d to \u201c \u2018feel free to decline the officers\u2019 requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 122 (quoting <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The record in this case establishes that the initial meeting between defendant and Officer Keene was consensual and implicated no Fourth Amendment interest. Keene merely approached defendant and inquired if the wallet belonged to him. Defendant was cooperative and offered Keene the opportunity \u201cto look at it.\u201d The consensual aspect of this encounter disappeared, however, when defendant refused Keene\u2019s request to open his fist, and she \u201cgrabbed\u201d his arm. Under such restraint, a \u201creasonable person\u201d would not \u201cfeel free to leave,\u201d to \u201cignore\u201d the officer and \u201cwalk away,\u201d and, for Fourth Amendment purposes,- defendant was then \u201cseized\u201d by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees that an individual\u2019s liberty \u201cwill not be restrained without an objectively reasonable basis.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 127. A seizure must be \u201cjustified by reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>8 Va. App. at 617, 383 S.E.2d at 271; <em>see Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 494, 496, 412 S.E.2d 724, 725 (1992). A police officer may detain and search an individual for weapons provided he <em>\u201creasonably </em>suspects that the person is dangerous\u201d or \u201cintends to do him bodily harm.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1100, 1103, 407 S.E.2d 49, 52 (1991) (emphasis added); Code \u00a7 19.2-83. The officer, however, must identify \u201c \u2018particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 53, 66-67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 86 (1987) (quoting <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 64 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The facts in the instant case did not give Keene an objectively reasonable basis for suspecting that defendant was armed and dangerous. She observed no criminal behavior by defendant and had no information relating defendant to such activity. Defendant consented to the confrontation, answered her questions, offered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>wallet for her inspection and was passive and cooperative. Although his fist remained closed, defendant never held it in a threatening manner, and there was no indication that it contained or concealed a weapon. Under such circumstances, defendant\u2019s hesitancy to open his hand did not create a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that he possessed a weapon. A contrary view would invite the \u201cominous implication . . . that only guilty persons have anything to keep from the eyes of the police.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">This Court is conscious of the perils related to law enforcement and recognizes that police officers must always be vigilant. Nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment imposes \u201ca standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 \u201d on their interaction with the public in order \u201c \u2018to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018overbearing or harassing\u2019 police conduct.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>7 Va. App. at 308, 373 S.E.2d at 172 (quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1979)); <em>see Wilson, </em>953 F.2d at 126 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 15 (1968)). Without exaggerating the intrusive nature of the encounter now before the Court, we must take care not to compromise and erode such a fundamental and vital constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Barrow, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
