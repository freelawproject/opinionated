He was sentenced to ten days in jail and a fine of $250. The jail sentence and $200 of the fine were suspended upon the condition that Hershfield keep the peace and be of good behavior for twelve months. On appeal, Hershfield contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he violated Code \u00a7 18.2-416. He also contends that he was denied his right to a jury trial as provided by Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution, because the record does not show the consent of the defendant, the Commonwealth, or the trial court in the waiver of a jury trial. Because we find that the evidence was insufficient to support Hershfield\u2019s conviction under the abusive language statute, we do not reach the issue of whether he was unconstitutionally denied a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The facts are not in dispute. Hershfield and Mary Walker were neighbors on Horton Street in Colonial Beach, Virginia. On April 2, 1990, Walker and her sister-in-law, who lived next door, were talking outside of Walker\u2019s home. The two noticed Hershfield, who lived two houses away from Walker\u2019s house, standing in his yard looking at them. Walker testified that she was facing Hershfield and her sister-in-law had her back to the defendant; no one else was in the area. Walker saw Hershfield make a motion with his hand which she described as \u201cgiving me the finger,\u201d and heard him say, \u201cgo f_yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">When Hershfield made the comment and the hand gesture, he was standing fifty-five to sixty feet away from Walker and was separated from her by a chain-link fence. Walker then walked over to her sister-in-law\u2019s property and asked Hershfield why he was harassing her, but he refused to speak to her. Hershfield\u2019s conviction was based upon the testimony of Walker, who was the only witness to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-416 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">If any person shall, in the presence or hearing of another, curse or abuse such other person, or use any violent abusive language to such person concerning himself or any of his relations, or otherwise use such language, under circumstances reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, he shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In <em>Mercer v. Winston, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court considered a challenge to the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s abusive language statute. 214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724 (1973) (interpreting former Code \u00a7 18.1-255), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 988 (1974). Relying upon <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568 (1942), the Court found that the statute did not impair freedom of expression when applied to \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Mercer, </em>214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726. Thus, application of the statute is limited \u201cto words that have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With this narrow construction, the statute is neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">A conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-416 must be supported by evidence that abusive language is spoken to or about another in his presence or hearing and under circumstances reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of peace. Assuming, without deciding, that the language Hershfield used is prohibited by the statute, we must next consider whether that language was spoken in Walker\u2019s presence or hearing and under circumstances likely to provoke a breach of the peace.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Josephs </em>v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) (en banc), the record reflects that some neighborhood enmity had developed between Hershfield and the local government concerning the way Hershfield maintained his home. Walker\u2019s brother was on the town council. Walker testified that she was standing fifty-five to sixty feet away from Hershfield when she heard the comments. The evidence shows that the parties were separated by the front yard of Walker\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s house, a distance of fifty-five to sixty feet, and a chain-link fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The requirement that the abusive language be spoken in the presence or hearing of another contemplates a face-to-face encounter. As the Virginia Supreme Court stated, the statute \u201cis aimed at preventing personal, face-to-face, abusive and insulting language likely to provoke a violent reaction and retaliation.\u201d Mercer, 214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726; <em>see also Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 573 (statute does no more than prohibit \u201cface-to-face\u201d words likely to incite a breach of peace). The fact that the parties were separated by a distance of fifty-five to sixty feet and by a fence establishes as a matter of law that the language was not spoken \u201cface-to-face.\u201d Moreover, these circumstances also establish that the words were not reasonably likely to provoke an \u201cimmediate\u201d violent response or retaliation. Specifically, distance and the barriers between Hershfield and Walker precluded \u201can immediate. . . violent reaction\u201d by Walker. <em>See </em>Mercer, 214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The trial court found that the statements were made in Walker\u2019s presence as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-416 because Walker saw Hershfield\u2019s hand gesture and heard what he said. While Walker may, in fact, have heard the remarks, abusive words even if heard by another, must be spoken \u201cface-to-face,\u201d as contemplated by <em>Mercer. </em>In other words, although the abusive language may have been uttered in the \u201cpresence\u201d of another in the sense that the alleged victim could see and hear the offender, that fact does not establish that the encounter was \u201cface-to-face.\u201d Therefore, to the extent that Code \u00a7 18.2-416 proscribes abusive language literally uttered within the \u201cpresence or hearing\u201d of another when the parties are not \u201cface-to-face,\u201d it is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>with <em>Mercer </em>and, therefore, unconstitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The facts at issue in the present case are markedly different from those presented in <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Chaplinsky. Mercer </em>involved a public disturbance with racial overtones that \u201capproached near riot proportions.\u201d 214 Va. at 282, n.l, 199 S.E.2d at 724-25, n.l. Mercer was convicted under Virginia\u2019s abusive language statute for uttering the following language to a police officer: \u201cyou white son of a bitch,\u201d \u201cyou honky pig,\u201d \u201cyou white mother f[-]r,\u201d \u201cwhite bastard\u201d and \u201cpig.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was no evidence of any appreciable distance or barrier that would have prevented an immediate violent response.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In <em>Chaplinsky, </em>the defendant was convicted under New Hampshire\u2019s fighting words statute for saying to the City Marshal \u201cYou are a God damned racketeer\u201d and \u201ca damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists.\u201d 315 U.S. at 569. Chaplinsky, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, was distributing literature on a city street. When Chaplinsky began denouncing all religion as a racket, a crowd that had gathered became restless and a disturbance resulted. Chaplinsky was being taken to the police station when he uttered these statements to the City Marshal. The United States Supreme Court found that these words, spoken \u201cface-to-face,\u201d were plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace. <em>Id. </em>at 573. Here, in the context of a private incident between two neighbors separated by a front yard and a fence, the language was not uttered in a \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Our holding here is not inconsistent with <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>City of Virginia Beach, 9 </em>Va. App. 163, 385 S.E.2d 59 (1989). In <em>Burgess, </em>the defendant stuck his head out of his moving vehicle and yelled, \u201cF_cops,\u201d as he drove by a street corner where police were attempting to control a large crowd. 9 Va. App. at 165, 385 S.E.2d at 60. Burgess was convicted of using abusive language in violation of Virginia Beach City Code \u00a7 23-12, which parallels the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-416. Although we recognized that <em>Mercer </em>requires a face-to-face confrontation, the case was not de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>cided on those grounds. Rather, <em>Burgess </em>involved the issue of whether a police officer would be held to a higher standard of restraint than the ordinary citizen. Without addressing Burgess\u2019s contention that his conduct did not amount to a direct confrontation under <em>Mercer, </em>we held that the fact that the abusive language was addressed to a police officer was of no consequence. Thus, in <em>Burgess, </em>we did not decide whether the face-to-face requirement had been met. 9 Va. App. at 167, 385 S.E.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the charge against Hershfield is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"> We do not decide whether the hand gestures used by Hershfield fall within the proscription of Code \u00a7 18.2-416. Our holding is limited to the words spoken by him. Furthermore, we acknowledge that while these words were vulgar, insulting, offensive and disrespectful, they are not necessarily \u201cfighting words\u201d as contemplated by <em>Chaplinsky </em>and subsequently in <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518 (1972). Where, unlike here, it is necessary to determine whether specific language constitutes \u201cfighting words\u201d the bench and bar of this Commonwealth will find helpful guidance in the following additional cases. <em>Eaton v. City of Tulsa, </em>415 U.S. 697 (1974); <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130 (1974); <em>Organization for a Better Austin </em>v. <em>Keefe, </em>402 U.S. 415 (1971); <em>Ware </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver, </em>182 Colo. 177, 511 P.2d 475 (1973); <em>Rozier </em>v. <em>State, </em>140 Ga.

The distance, if any, at which an encounter becomes \u201cface-to-face\u201d under the statute depends, necessarily, on the circumstances in each case. We hold merely that the \u201cface-to-face\u201d requirement contemplated by <em>Mercer </em>has not been satisfied here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b434-8\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Decisions from the United States Supreme Court post <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568 (1942), have made it clear that legislatures may not criminalize on a per se basis the use of vulgar or offensive words. <em>See Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518 (1972); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15 (1971). In order for statutes such as Code \u00a7 18.2-416 to be valid, they may punish only those words that fall within a \u201c \u2018narrowly limited [class] of speech\u2019 . . . \u2018which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 522 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 571, 572). Those words have come to be known as \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 522. In <em>Gooding, </em>the accused was convicted under a statute which forbade the use of \u201copprobrious words or abusive language tending to cause a breach of the peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that \u201c[d]erisive and annoying words can be taken as coming within the purview of the statute . . . <em>only when they have this characteristic of plainly tending to excite the addressee to a breach of peace.'\u2019'\u2019 Id. </em>at 523 (quoting <em>State v. Chaplinsky, </em>91 N.H. 310, 313, 320-21, 18 A.2d 754, 758, 762 (1941)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">I agree with the majority that, in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>214 Va. 281, 199 S.E.2d 724 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 988 (1974), the Supreme Court of Virginia gave Code \u00a7 18.2-416 a narrowly drawn interpretation to save it from constitutional infirmity. <em>Compare Gooding, </em>405 U.S. 518 (1972), <em>with Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. 568 (1942). The <em>Mercer </em>decision determined that the statute \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>aimed at preventing personal, face-to-face, abusive and insulting language likely to provoke a violent reaction and retaliation.\u201d 214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726. Consequently, the Court \u201climit[ed] [the] application [of the statute] to words that have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with this limiting construction, and because the statute criminalizes the use of language, the Court further construed the statute to prohibit only <em>\u201cwords of a kind and nature </em>spoken under such circumstances <em>as by their utterance reasonably tend to provoke a breach of the peace.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Thus, in determining whether a violation has occurred it becomes necessary first to analyze the words spoken in order to determine whether they are \u201cfighting words.\u201d \u201cFighting words\u201d are personally abusive epithets that are inherently likely to induce the ordinary person to react violently. <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 20. The majority correctly explains that the constitutional application of this statute depends upon whether \u201cfighting words\u201d were spoken in Walker\u2019s presence and whether these words were spoken under circumstances likely to provoke a breach of the peace. I believe, however, that the majority\u2019s holding that the conviction cannot stand solely because the parties were separated by sixty feet and a fence, thus leaving the \u201cface-to-face\u201d requirement of the statute unsatisfied, leaves the impression that Hershfield\u2019s utterance was inherently within the category of \u201cfighting words.\u201d I would hold that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cFighting words\u201d are \u201c \u2018personally abusive epithets\u2019 and not merely [words that are deemed] a socially unacceptable mode of communication.\u201d <em>State v. Authelet, </em>385 A.2d 642 (R.I. 1978). The evidence must establish that the personally abusive utterance itself \u201ctends to incite an immediate breach of the peace,\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 132 (1974) (citation omitted); is \u201cinherently likely to provide violent reaction,\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 20; or is \u201clikely to provoke a violent reaction and retaliation.\u201d <em>Mercer, </em>214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726. \u201cIt is not enough that [the words] merely arouse anger or resentment.\u201d <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>City of Birmingham, </em>342 So. 2d 933, 937 (Ala. Crim. App. 1976). Rather, the words must \u201cby their very utterance provoke a swift physical retaliation and incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 936-37. Obviously, only a narrow class of words falls within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">When Hershfield said to his neighbor, \u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d he conveyed a message of disrespect to her. However, the statute may not be interpreted to prohibit a person\u2019s expressions merely because the words offend or anger an addressee. <em>See Lewis, </em>415 U.S. at 133-34; <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 523. Nor may the state use the statute as a device \u201cto cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 25. Indeed, almost twenty years ago Justice Powell observed that \u201c[ljanguage likely to offend the sensibility of some listeners is now fairly commonplace in many social gatherings as well as in public performances.\u201d <em>Eaton v. City of Tulsa, </em>415 U.S. 697, 700 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The words used by Hershfield were vulgar, insulting, and offensive, but they are not punishable under the statute unless they are \u201cfighting words.\u201d Hershfield\u2019s words offensively suggested to his neighbor a sexual activity; however, they did not suggest a challenge or an intimation of threatening contact. In <em>Rozier v. State, </em>140 Ga. App. 356, 231 S.E.2d 131 (1976), the court held as a matter of law that a vulgar sexual proposition made to a female in her presence \u201cdid not constitute \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Other courts have held that use of the words \u201cfuck you,\u201d even when addressed to another, are not punishable as fighting words \u201cin the absence of compelling reasons.\u201d <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 477, 451 A.2d 115, 122 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098 (1983). <em>See also Ware </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver, </em>182 Colo. 177, 511 P.2d 475 (1973); <em>Downs v. State, </em>278 Md. 610, 618, 366 A.2d 41, 46 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 974 (1977); <em>City of Bismarck </em>v. <em>Schoppert, </em>469 N.W.2d 808 (N.D. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The trier of fact could not reasonably find on this record that the words were inherently likely to cause violence. <em>See Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 528; <em>In re Welfare of S.L.J., </em>263 N.W.2d 412, 418-20 (Minn. 1978). While the words clearly are vulgar, they are not inherently likely to cause violence. No evidence established that Hershfield\u2019s comment has the inherent quality of causing visceral, reflexive violence. In construing the statute narrowly to meet constitutional standards, a Court may not read the statute to vest in the trier of fact the unfettered discretion to enforce an amorphous \u201csuitable\u201d level of discourse. <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>528. \u201c[S]o long as the means are peaceful, the communication need not meet standards of acceptability.\u201d <em>Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 </em>U.S. 415, 419 (1971). Moreover, reliance upon \u201ccommon understanding and practice\u201d as a measure of the likelihood of causing violence does not serve to limit the statute to \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Only if Hershfield\u2019s words were \u201cwords of a kind and nature ... as by their utterance reasonably tend to provoke a breach of the peace,\u201d <em>Mercer, </em>214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726, does it become necessary to analyze the \u201ccircumstances\u201d under which they were spoken. <em>Id. See also Lewis, </em>415 U.S. at 134; <em>In re Welfare of S.L.J., 263 </em>N.W.2d at 419; <em>Downs, </em>278 Md. at 617, 366 A.2d at 44; <em>City of St. Louis </em>v. <em>Tinker, </em>542 S.W.2d 512, 519 (Mo. 1976). If one assumes, as the majority implicitly does, that the words fall within the proscribed category, I find no evidence that the circumstances reasonably tended to cause a breach of the peace. There is no evidence that Walker\u2019s reaction was uncharacteristic of a reasonable person in a like situation. Although Walker heard the comment, the parties were separated by some twenty yards and a fence when Hershfield spoke. There is no evidence that Hershfield\u2019s tone was one of violence or severe agitation. Neither party had approached or spoken to the other prior to Hershfield\u2019s utterance of this phrase. The record does not show that Walker manifested a disposition to retaliate violently upon hearing Hershfield\u2019s comment. Rather, Walker chose to approach Hershfield and ask him why he spoke the words. Hershfield made no further response. Asking a question in response to vulgar speech is not the \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d anticipated under Code \u00a7 18.2-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u201cA word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanging, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.\u201d <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>245 U.S. 418, 425 (1918). Unseemly words which have become \u201cfairly commonplace in many social gatherings as well as in public performance,\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>City of Tulsa, </em>415 U.S. at 700 (Powell, J., concurring), may cause discomfort and anger but do not rise to the level of fighting words. \u201cWords are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 26.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>[C]urses, oaths, expletives, execrations, imprecations, maledictions, and the whole vocabulary of insults are not intended or susceptible of literal interpretation.

Their significance is emotional, and it is not merely immeasurable but also variable. The emotional quality of exclamations varies from time to time, from region to region, and as between social, cultural, and ethnic groups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>City of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>258 Minn. 467, 480-81, 104 N.W.2d 902, 910 (1960) (Loevinger, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 815 (1961). \u201cOne [person\u2019s] vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In order to sustain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-416, it is not sufficient that the words cause anger and resentment. To be fighting words, they must be inherently likely to cause an immediate violent response. Although I concur with the majority that the conviction is invalid, I do so because the words spoken by Hershfield were not fighting words. I agree, however, that the circumstances, viewed in toto, also do not constitutionally support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-416.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
