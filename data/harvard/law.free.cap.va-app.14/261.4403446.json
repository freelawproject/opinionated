We hold that credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that Crawley was an employee, not an independent contractor, in her employment as a domestic worker. For this reason, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision to include her earnings from similar employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">While employed as a custodian for Metropolitan, Crawley received a compensable injury. Metropolitan paid her benefits based on an average weekly wage of $109.32 per week, the amount she was paid by Metropolitan.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Crawley worked for Metropolitan at National Airport on Saturdays and Sundays where she cleaned and supplied ladies\u2019 rest rooms, swept and picked up trash in the public areas of the terminal, and dusted chairs and elevators. During the remainder of the week, she was a domestic, day worker in private homes where she \u201ccleaned, dusted, swept, mopped and vacuumed in addition to cleaning windows and washing cabinets.\u201d In one home, she also assisted an infirm lady in taking baths.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Crawley applied to the commission to include her earnings as a day worker in calculating her average weekly wage. Metropolitan contended that her other earnings should not be included because they were derived from work she did as an independent contractor, not as an employee. The commission found that Crawley was \u201cemployed as a day worker or a \u2018servant\u2019 rather than as an inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>pendent contractor\u201d and concluded, therefore, that her earnings from other, similar employment should be included in determining her average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201c[A]verage weekly wages\u201d include \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this purpose, \u201cearnings\u201d include not only earnings from the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the accident but also earnings from similar services from other employment. <em>First Virginia Banks, Inc. v. McNeil, </em>8 Va. App. 342, 344, 381 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1989). Earnings from other similar employment may include domestic employment even though domestic employees are excluded from coverage under the act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201c[T]he earnings of the injured employee\u201d for this purpose are not expressly limited to wages earned by an employee, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-6, and Crawley contends that whether she is an employee in her other employment is immaterial so long as her earnings from such employment resulted from performing similar services as those required by her covered employment. We need not address this issue because we conclude that the commission\u2019s finding that Crawley was an employee is supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cWhat constitutes an employee is a question of law\u201d; however, whether a specific person falls within that definition \u201cis usually a question of fact.\u201d <em>Intermodal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 600, 364 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1988) (quoting <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 298, 147 S.E. 246, 247 (1929)). Generally, \u201ca person is an employee if he works for wages or a salary and the person who hires him reserves the power to fire him and the power to exercise control over the work to be performed.\u201d <em>Richmond Newspapers v. Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 98, 294 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1982). \u201cThe right of control is the determining factor in ascertaining\u201d whether one is an employee or not. <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224. This right of control includes \u201cthe power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to specify the result to be attained [and] the power to control \u2018the means and methods by which the result is to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>A person is an employee if the person for whom he or she is working \u201chas the power to direct the means and methods by which [he or she] does the work.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The parties stipulated that Crawley was a sole proprietor while performing her domestic, day work. A sole proprietor, however, is not necessarily an independent contractor. A sole proprietor may have employees who are subject to the provisions of the act. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>3 Va. App. 379, 381, 350 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1986). A sole proprietor may also elect to be an employee covered by the act. Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2. Whether a sole proprietor who does not so elect is an employee or an independent contractor depends upon the nature of the relationship, particularly whether the person who hires him or her retains the right to control the work to be performed. <em>See Smith, </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224. Whether such a person is an employee under the act is usually a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 364 S.E.2d at 224. The stipulation that Crawley was a sole proprietor is not, therefore, conclusive in determining whether she is an employee or an independent contractor in her similar employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">As a sole proprietor, Crawley paid her own federal, state and social security taxes on the income she received from her domestic, day work. This fact, although persuasive, is also not conclusive in resolving whether she was an employee \u201cunder the control of [her] employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Crawley either reported to or was transported to each of the homes where she worked. She was not required to furnish her own tools or supplies. Furthermore, the commission found that \u201cthe nature of the employment in which [she] engaged ... is the kind of work over which each employer had direct control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">An administrative agency is expected to \u201capply expert discretion to the matters coming within its cognizance.\u201d <em>Virginia ABC Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>York St. Inn, Inc., </em>220 Va. 310, 315, 257 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1979) (quoting <em>Schmidt v. Board of Adjustment, 9 </em>N.J. 405, 423, 88 A.2d 607, 615-16 (1952)). Accordingly, we must \u201cgive deference to the expertise and knowledge of the agency in the area which it supervises and regulates.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Va. App. 441, 448, 382 S.E.2d 476, 479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As a fact finder, a commission established by the legislature to decide workers\u2019 compensation disputes \u201cacquires an expertise and accumulates an experience in [its] limited, specialized field often more extensive than that of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Dunton v. Eastern Fine Paper Co., </em>423 A.2d 512, 514 (Me. 1980) (quoting <em>Jacobsky </em>v. <em>D\u2019Alfonso &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 A.2d 511, 514 (Me. 1976)). The scope of a judicial review of the fact finding function of a workers\u2019 compensation commission is \u201cseverely limited, partly in deference to the agency\u2019s expertise in a specialized field.\u201d <em>Brown v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Transworld Airlines), </em>505 Pa. 35, 38, 476 A.2d 900, 902 (1984); <em>see also Szumski </em>v. <em>Dale Boat Yards, Inc., </em>48 N.J. 401, 410, 226 A.2d 11, 16, <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 944 (1967); <em>Tallman v. ABF (Arkansas Best Freight), </em>108 N.M. 124, 130, 767 P.2d 363, 369 (Ct. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>107 N.M. 785, 781 P.2d 305 (1988). Such deference to an administrative agency\u2019s fact finding because of its \u201ctechnical expertise [and] more extensive experience [is appropriate] so long as its decision is reasonable and rational.\u201d <em>Wright\u2019s Furniture Mill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n of Utah, </em>707 P.2d 113, 114 (Utah 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The commission\u2019s finding that Crawley performed \u201cthe kind of work over which each employer had direct control [is a finding within the commission\u2019s] expertise and knowledge ... in the area which it supervises and regulates.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>8 Va. App. at 448, 382 S.E.2d at 479. This finding was based on the commission\u2019s examination of the nature of Crawley\u2019s work as a domestic, day worker. The commission\u2019s finding was a reasonable and rational inference based on the evidence presented. We, therefore, defer to the commission regarding this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">An award of the commission is \u201cconclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-98. Although the evidence was conflicting, credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that Crawley was an employee. We cannot disturb this finding. Therefore, the commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Benton, J., Coleman, J., Elder, J., Moon, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> The decision of the panel is reported at 12 Va. App. 1167, 408 S.E.2d 570 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\"> Formerly the Industrial Commission of Virginia. Effective October 1, 1991, Title 65.1 was recodified as Title 65.2. All references in this opinion are to Title 65.1, in effect at the time the Commission\u2019s decision was rendered in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-6 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">Unless the context otherwise requires, \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d means the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by fifty-two.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Duff, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Am1q\">with whom Koontz, C.J., Baker, J., and Bray, J., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The record contains no evidence from which the commission could have found that the claimant was an employee for services performed in her housecleaning duties. Furthermore, the issue presented is neither complex nor technical; thus, the normal deference accorded to the commission\u2019s finding should not be applied to justify a ruling in this Court when there is no evidence in the record in support of the commission\u2019s finding. Therefore, I am unable to join in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In reaching its decision that claimant was an employee rather than an independent contractor, the commission considered the homeowners\u2019 right to control \u201cthe method and the means\u201d by which the work was performed. <em>See Phillips </em>v. <em>Brinkley, </em>194 Va. 62, 66-67, 72 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1952). The commission found from the evidence that claimant was employed as \u201ca day worker or a \u2018servant\u2019, rather than as an independent contractor.\u201d Further, citing <em>Phillips, </em>the commission held that she was an employee based upon the fact that \u201cthe nature of the employment in which claimant engaged ... is the kind of work over which each employer had direct control.\u201d The record supports neither of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The evidence in the record shows that claimant did not work for \u201cwages\u201d from the various homeowners. She contracted for a price per house of between forty-five to fifty dollars. Claimant\u2019s 1988 tax returns were introduced as exhibits and showed that she reported a profit of $11,440 as outside income from her \u201chousekeeping\u201d business. She paid self-employment tax on this amount, and she paid her own withholding and social security taxes. There was no evidence in the record that claimant was transported to the houses by the homeowners. As well, there was no evidence in the record that any of the homeowners retained or exercised the right to \u201ccontrol the methods or means of doing the work.\u201d Furthermore, claimant stipulated at the hearing that her housecleaning work was done as a sole proprietor. This, of course, is a form of business operation in which one person owns all of the assets of the business. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1392 (6th ed. 1991). The commission\u2019s opinion fails to consider the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>I would hold that the stipulation was a relevant, indeed necessary, consideration in determining whether claimant was an employee or an independent contractor. The stipulation may not have been binding, as a matter of law, on the issue presented. However, it was a highly probative admission that should have merited careful weighing along with the other evidence presented. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Turning to the issue of control exercised by the homeowners over claimant\u2019s work, I fully recognize that factual findings of the commission are binding on appeal. However, if no credible evidence exists in support of a factual finding, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence is one of law for this court to decide. <em>Spruill </em>v. <em>C.W. Wright Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 330, 333, 381 S.E.2d 359, 360 (1989). No evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that \u201cthe nature of the employment in which Crawley engaged. . . is the kind of work over which each employer had direct control.\u201d Claimant had the burden of proving that she is an employee within the definition of Code \u00a7 65.1-4. <em>See Behrensen </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>10 Va. App. 364, 366, 392 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1990). Neither claimant nor any other witness testified that any of the homeowners exercised or had the right to exercise control over how she did her work. The reasonable inference to be drawn from the record was that claimant contracted for a given result for a fixed price, a clean house for forty-five or fifty dollars, classic indicia of an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The majority opinion emphasizes the deference that the courts must give to the \u201ctechnical expertise and more extensive experience\u201d of the administrative agency. It is basic that the more technical and complex the issue, the more deference should be accorded to the finding of the agency. There is nothing esoteric, technical or complex about whether control of the methods and means of doing claimant\u2019s work was exercised by the homeowners. Either it was or it was not, and this finding depends on the evidence introduced. I would not give great deference to the finding of an administrative agency on a non-technical issue such as this, nor would I hold that such deference constitutes a proper substitute for evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The question whether a finding is supported by evidence is one of law subject to judicial review and independent determination by the court. The action of the administrative agency will be over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>turned where it lacks the requisite support in the evidence. 2 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 678 (1962). I do not find such support in the record before us and would reverse the findings and remand for the entry of an order disallowing the combining of the business profits with the wages earned with Metropolitan Cleaning Corporation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
