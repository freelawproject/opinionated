Cook was not estopped from or had not waived making an objection under Rule 13. We affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Cook suffered an injury to his back while working for Specialty Auto and was awarded temporary total disability compensation by the commission. On August 28, 1990, Specialty Auto filed an application for a hearing with the commission. In its application, Specialty Auto informed the commission that it suspended payments to Cook on August 26, 1990, based on a physician\u2019s report that Cook could fully resume his employment on August 27, 1990. On September 19, 1990, Cook\u2019s counsel objected to the application for hearing. Cook\u2019s counsel filed a September 11, 1990 report from Cook\u2019s physician stating that Cook was disabled at that time, and asked for reinstatement of Cook\u2019s temporary total disability compensation. At the January 16, 1991 hearing on Specialty Auto\u2019s application, Cook\u2019s counsel asserted that Specialty Auto had failed to conform to Rule 13 because benefits were suspended two days before Specialty Auto filed its application for a hearing. The deputy commissioner agreed and dismissed the application, holding that Specialty Auto\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 13 rendered the application facially void. Upon review, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The commission has&gt;the power to make and enforce \u201crules not inconsistent with [the Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act, for carrying out the provisions of this Act.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-18. When a challenge is made to the commission\u2019s construction of its rules, \u201cour review is limited to a determination whether the commission\u2019s interpretation of its own rule was reasonable.\u201d <em>Classic Floors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>9 Va. App. 90, 93, 383 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1989). In considering the interpretation of rules by other administrative agencies, we have \u201caccorded great deference\u201d to the agency and have said that the agency\u2019s interpretation of its rules \u201cwill not be set aside unless arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Clay, 9 </em>Va. App. 152, 159, 384 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1989), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>398 S.E.2d 78 (Va. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Rule 13 provides that, except in specifically defined circumstances, \u201c [compensation must be paid through the date on which the application is received in the . . . Commission offices.\u201d The record proves that Specialty Auto filed its application for hearing in the commission\u2019s office on August 28, 1990, but paid benefits to Cook only through August 26, 1990. Specialty Auto concedes these facts and does not contend that any of the exceptions to Rule 13 apply. Instead, Specialty Auto argues that the commission has adopted \u201can unduly technical and formalistic interpretation of Rule 13 which is contrary to the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.1- 54.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We conclude that the commission\u2019s construction of the rule is neither unreasonable nor inconsistent with the Act. Code \u00a7 65.1- 99 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-708) allows an employer to initiate a hearing before the commission in order to prove that an employee\u2019s benefits under an award should be extinguished due to a change in condition. Rule 13 allows the employer to suspend payments upon filing the application for a hearing and, thus, before the commission has the opportunity to make a decision on the evidence. Since an employer may not recover payments erroneously made before the commission\u2019s formal termination of benefits, <em>see Gray v. Underwood Bros., </em>164 Va. 344, 348, 180 S.E. 317, 319 (1935), it is in an employer\u2019s interest to terminate payment of benefits as soon as legitimately possible. The commission promulgated Rule 13 \u201cto police this tendency of employers and insurers to terminate first and litigate later.\u201d <em>Dillard </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>416 U.S 783, 789 (1974) (citing <em>Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co. v. Parker, </em>201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453 (1959)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Rule provides a reasonable mechanism to protect employees from possible abuse in the filing practices of employers. Thus, we cannot say that a strict interpretation of Rule 13\u2019s provisions is misplaced or unreasonable. Indeed, we have consistently required strict adherence to the Rules of Court. <em>See Long </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 7 </em>Va. App. 503, 375 S.E.2d 368 (1988); <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Department of Commerce, 4 </em>Va. App. 520, 358 S.E.2d 759 (1987); <em>Mayhood </em>v. <em>Mayhood, 4 </em>Va. App. 365, 358 S.E.2d 182 (1987); <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Price, </em>3 Va. App. 672, 353 S.E.2d 168 (1987); <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 96, 341 S.E.2d 400 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Specialty Auto correctly states that the commission, by statute, may not make rules inconsistent with the Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-18 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-201(A)). However, Rule 13(A)\u2019s prohibition against cessation of benefits is not contrary to any part of the Act. The Supreme Court of Virginia, \u201crecognizing the purposes of the rule and the necessity of preventing arbitrary cessation of compensation, upheld the provision!] as consistent with the Act.\u201d <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>Mead Paperboard Prods., 4 </em>Va. App. 182, 188, 355 S.E.2d 349, 351 (1987) (citing <em>Sargent Elec. Co. v. Woodall, </em>228 Va. 419, 424-25, 323 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1984), and <em>Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>201 Va. at 331-32, 111 S.E.2d at 456). Moreover, the General Assembly has never attempted to amend or remove the requirements of Rule 13. <em>Whitten, 4 </em>Va. App. at 187, 355 S.E.2d at 351. We have specifically held that \u201c[Rule 13] furthers the purpose of the Act with respect to both employers and employees without taking away substantive rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 355 S.E.2d at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Furthermore, we cannot say that the commission\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with Code \u00a7 65.1-54 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-500), which provides for temporary total disability benefits. Specialty Auto rightly states that temporary total disability benefits are to be awarded only when an employee cannot work due to total incapacity. According to Specialty Auto, this statutory requirement renders the commission\u2019s interpretation of Rule 13(A) inconsistent with the statute since there was \u201cuncontroverted evidence in the record\u201d that Cook could return to full duty work as of August 27, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Although Specialty Auto\u2019s application, if it had met the requirements of Rule 13, might have contained sufficient evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing to determine whether benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>should have been terminated, the determination whether benefits, in fact, should have been terminated could only have been made by the commission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">A suspension pursuant to Rule 13(C) is simply preliminary and temporary, intended to protect both parties\u2019 interests until the commission resolves the noticed matter on its merits. Rule 13 \u201cis not an authorization for an employer or insurer to suspend payments with assurance that [an employee] may not have them reinstated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\"><em>Telesystems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>12 Va. App. 466, 470, 404 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1991) (quoting <em>Dillard, </em>416 U.S. at 795-96). While Specialty Auto alleges that Cook never offered any evidence that his condition had not changed, the fact finder has not had an occasion to address that issue. Cook never had the opportunity to present evidence in any proceeding because the application was determined to be facially void. Specialty Auto\u2019s bare allegation of a change in circumstance does not suffice to establish that fact. Whether a change in circumstance existed and was sufficient to cause a change in the status of the award was dependent upon the proof adduced at the hearing before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We conclude that Specialty Auto\u2019s claim that Cook is estopped and has waived any procedural objection under Rule 13 is merit-less. The commission determined that Specialty Auto\u2019s failure to pay benefits through the date of filing its application for a hearing rendered its application void <em>ab initio. </em>It is immaterial that Cook did not alert Specialty Auto to the defect in its application prior to the hearing. Nothing in Rule 13 requires that the defect in the application be assailed prior to the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">For these reasons, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Baker, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-16\"> The portions of Rule 13 pertinent to this appeal are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-17\">A.

If so, the Commission will place the claim on the hearing docket and authorize the suspension of compensation as of the date for which compensation was last paid. If the preliminary evidence does not warrant placing the claim on the hearing docket, the parties will be so advised and the employer or its insurance carrier will be advised to continue compensation payments.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
