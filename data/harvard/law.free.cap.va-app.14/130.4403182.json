We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Although the Commonwealth prevailed at trial, the appropriate standard of review requires that we view the evidence with respect to the refused instruction in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 524, 526, 414 S.E.2d 401, 401 (1992) (citing <em>Blondel v. Hays, </em>241 Va. 467, 469, 403 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The evidence discloses that Joseph Trower (Trower) encountered defendant, a stranger, at the Virginia Beach oceanfront and requested defendant\u2019s \u201chelp . . . with [Trower\u2019s] wheelchair.\u201d Trower offered defendant a beer, and, while the two men drank in Trower\u2019s car, defendant expressed a need for \u201csome tools to get [his] car started.\u201d Trower responded that he \u201chad some tools at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>home\u201d and volunteered to \u201ctake [defendant] over there.\u201d Defendant accepted the offer, but, instead, Trower drove to a \u201cshed\u201d behind a \u201cfriend\u2019s house.\u201d *</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Defendant testified that after the two men entered the \u201cshed,\u201d Trower \u201cpulled out a gun\u201d and ordered defendant \u201cto drop [his] pants\u201d and engage in oral sodomy. Defendant recalled that he then \u201cjust lost [his] mind\u201d and began to beat Trower with \u201ca two by four\u201d board, severely injuring him. Defendant claimed, however, that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to hurt\u201d Trower, but \u201cpanicked\u201d when Trower \u201ccame onto\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Trower denied any homosexual advances and testified that defendant attacked and robbed him without provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant proffered an instruction on assault and battery, a misdemeanor. The trial judge refused this instruction, but approved an instruction on unlawful wounding. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Assault and battery is a lesser included offense of malicious wounding. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 111, 116, 279 S.E.2d 142, 145 (1981); Code \u00a7 18.2-54. If any credible evidence in the record supports a proffered instruction on a lesser included offense, failure to give the instruction is reversible error. <em>McClung v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 654, 657, 212 S.E.2d 290, 293 (1975); <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 587, 591, 43 S.E.2d 906, 908 (1946); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 649, 651, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1991); <em>Bellfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 310, 313, 398 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1990); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 22, 24, 359 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1987). Such an instruction, however, must be supported by more than a mere scintilla of evidence. <em>Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 409, 384 S.E.2d 757, 769 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063 (1990); <em>Miller, </em>5 Va. App. at 24, 359 S.E.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">An element necessary to both malicious and unlawful wounding is the \u201cintent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d the victim. Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Assault and battery, however, requires proof of \u201can overt act or an attempt . . . with force and violence, to do physical injury to the person of another,\u201d \u201cwhether from <em>malice </em>or from wantonness,\u201d together with \u201cthe <em>actual infliction of corporal hurt </em>on another . . . <em>wilfully or in anger.\" Jones </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 679, 681-82, 36 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1946); <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 658, 180 S.E. 395, 397 (1935); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 401, 404, 140 S.E. 114, 115 (1927). One cannot be convicted of assault and battery \u201cwithout an intention to do bodily harm \u2014 either an actual intention or an intention imputed by law,\u201d but an intent to maim, disfigure or kill is unnecessary to the offense. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>150 Va. 611, 617, 143 S.E. 641, 643 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In the instant case, defendant admitted beating Trower, but repeatedly denied any intent to injure him. The Commonwealth urged the jury to infer an \u201cintent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d from defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See Martin, </em>13 Va. App. at 527, 414 S.E.2d at 402; <em>Hargrave v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 436, 437, 201 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1974). From defendant\u2019s testimony, however, the jury reasonably could have concluded instead that defendant acted only with the intent \u201cto do [Trower] bodily harm,\u201d albeit with malice. <em>See Davis, 150 </em>Va. at 617, 143 S.E. at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We recognize that \u201can intent to maim, disfigure or kill may be presumed\u201d when an attack is \u201cattended with . . . violence and brutality.\u201d <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 636, 640-41, 166 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1969) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the jury was properly instructed that it could \u201cinfer that every person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\u201d This inference, however, is not conclusive, and the jury reasonably could have determined that it was inapplicable to these facts or overcome by defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The jury was instructed that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant wounded Trower with the \u201cintent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d him. They were not instructed, however, that defendant could be convicted of a lesser offense in the absence of this intent. The jury was thus \u201cgiven the impermissible choice of drawing the conclusion\u201d either that defendant intended to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill Trower, with or without malice, and was thus guilty of either malicious or unlawful wounding, or that he did not possess this intent \u201cand was not guilty of any offense.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>13 Va. App. at 529, 414 S.E.2d at 403-04. The jury was denied the opportunity to assess the evidence as it related to assault and battery, an offense that may be accompanied by malice, but does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>require the intent to maim, disfigure or kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The jury has the right to \u201creject that part of the evidence believed by them to be untrue and to accept that found by them to be true. In so doing, they have broad discretion in applying the law to the facts and in fixing the degree of guilt, if any, of a person charged with a crime.\u201d <em>Bellfield v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 310, 315, 398 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1990) (quoting <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986)). Credible evidence was before the jury that, if believed, supported an instruction on assault and battery, and \u201c[i]t is immaterial that the jury might have rejected the lesser-included offense.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>231 Va. at 107, 341 S.E.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and this case remanded to the trial court for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Barrow, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-13\"> Defendant was also convicted of robbery but does not appeal that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
