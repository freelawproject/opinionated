Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the panel\u2019s majority opinion, the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is affirmed. Accordingly, the stay of this Court\u2019s mandate issued October 8, 1991 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Judge Moon would reverse the commission\u2019s decision for the reasons stated in his dissent to the panel opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 225, 409 S.E.2d at 640.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-16\"> Formerly the Industrial Commission of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-17\"> This appeal did not raise the issue, and consequently we do not decide, whether a claimant is entitled to have compensation benefits reinstated effective from the date the suspension is declared by the commission to have been lifted or retroactively to the date that the employee cured his unjustified refusal of selective employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
