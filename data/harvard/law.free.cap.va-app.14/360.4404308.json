He argues that the order violated general principles of equity, was contrary to Code \u00a7 20-108, and violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The husband initially filed a bill of complaint for divorce in which he alleged that one child was born of the marriage. At all times during the divorce proceeding the husband was represented by counsel. The wife was initially represented by counsel; however, during most of the proceeding she was unrepresented because her counsel was permitted to withdraw after her answer was filed. The parties were divorced by decree entered January 8, 1990. The decree stated that'one child was born of the marriage and ordered the husband to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Eight months after the divorce decree was entered the husband filed a motion to terminate child support in which he alleged that \u201cthe infant born during the time of [the] marriage ... is not the child of [the husband].\u201d The motion cited Code \u00a7 20-74 as authority for relief. Five months after the motion was filed, the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>band filed a document styled \u201cNotice of Hearing to Set Aside a Decree A Vinculo Matrimonii for Fraud Upon The Court.\u201d The motion cited no authority for the relief it requested. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing held on these issues, the trial judge ruled that the child \u201cbiologically is not [the husband\u2019s], but the [husband] has not proven [by] clear and convincing [evidence] that fraud has been committed upon the Court.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The husband\u2019s first motion for relief relied upon Code \u00a7 20-74. That statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">Any order of support or amendment thereof entered under the provisions of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect until annulled by the court of original jurisdiction, or the court to which an appeal may be taken; however, such order of support or terms of probation shall be subject to change or modification by the court from time to time, as circumstances may require, but no such change or modification shall affect or relieve the surety of his or her obligation under such recognizance, provided notice thereof be forthwith given to such surety. No support order may be retroactively modified, but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Code \u00a7 20-74. By its express terms, Code \u00a7 20-74 applies only to support ordered pursuant to Title 20, Chapter 5 (Desertion and Nonsupport). Juvenile and domestic relations district courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over civil cases arising under Chapter 5. Code \u00a7 20-67. Code \u00a7 20-74 does not confer authority to the circuit courts to modify child support decrees entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The husband\u2019s motion does not address Code \u00a7 20-107.2, the statute in Chapter 6 that authorizes the trial judge to award support in divorce proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Code contains specific statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>authority that governs revisions and alterations \u201cafter decreeing as provided in [Code] \u00a7 20-107.2.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the trial judge\u2019s order does not contain a recitation of the statutory basis upon which the husband was allowed to proceed and upon which the trial judge ruled, we conclude that Code \u00a7 20-74 was not a statutorily permissible vehicle for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The second motion that the husband filed, eleven months after the divorce decree, sought to have a portion of the divorce decree declared void. The husband cited no statutory authority in support of the motion. It appears that the motion was filed in an attempt to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the divorce court for the purpose of having the court declare void a portion of the decree that the circuit court had jurisdiction to enter when it entered it. At the time the motion was filed, the decree had become final. The circuit court no longer had jurisdiction to modify, vacate, or suspend the decree absent a specific statutory exception. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1. Although the wife had counsel when these motions were filed in the circuit court, no pleadings were filed in opposition to either of the husband\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">When the husband\u2019s motions were heard at the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, the husband\u2019s counsel asked the trial judge \u201cto set aside that divorce decree as far as the paternity of the child goes and also the child support goes based upon the fraud that\u2019s been perpetrated on the court under the Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-428.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this appeal, the husband\u2019s brief cites as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>statutory authority Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.2 and 20-108. The brief makes no reference to Code \u00a7 8.01-428.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The procedural posture of this case is virtually identical to that in <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Slagle, </em>11 Va. App. 341, 398 S.E.2d 346 (1990), which was decided four months prior to the evidentiary hearing on the husband\u2019s motions. In <em>Slagle, </em>we held that a final decree could be set aside only by an independent action. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 398 S.E.2d at 350. <em>See also Charles v. Precision Tune, Inc., </em>243 Va. 313, 414 S.E.2d 831 (1992). However, at no time in these proceedings has the wife objected to the procedural posture of the case or the trial court\u2019s authority to proceed on the husband\u2019s motions. In particular, no issue has been raised concerning the right of the trial court to entertain the husband\u2019s <em>motion </em>to set aside a portion of the decree that has become final under Rule 1:1. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-428(A) and (C) <em>with </em>Rule 1:1. Althoughthe wife\u2019s counsel raised the question of estoppel at the evidentiary hearing, the husband\u2019s counsel countered that estoppel was not applicable because of fraud. <em>Cf. Slagle, </em>11 Va. App. at 348, 398 S.E.2d at 350. The trial judge in this case found that \u201cthe real issue involved in this case is that of the [existence of] fraud,\u201d and concluded that the husband had failed to meet the burden of proving fraud by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Because the husband invokes on this appeal Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.2 and 20-108 and the equitable power of the divorce court to relieve him from child support payments due to an alleged change in circumstances, we address that issue in the context of whether the trial judge erred in holding that the evidence did not prove fraud. The evidence before the trial judge, viewed in the light most favorable to the wife, <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>1 Va. App. 358, 361, 339 S.E.2d 198, 199 (1986), proved that on December 25, 1986, before the marriage, the wife had sexual intercourse at a motel with a man who was unidentified on the record. She testified that Aviles had knowledge of her affair, that she told him she was with another man, and that she refused to give him the man\u2019s name. After this incident at the motel, she and Aviles often had sexual intercourse. When she discovered that she was pregnant, she talked with Aviles about the possibility the child was not his. Although she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have the baby,\u201d she said that \u201che wanted [her] to have the baby.\u201d A week after that conversation, they became engaged to be married. They were married in April 1987. She testified that after their marriage they did not discuss the issue again until after the baby was born. The wife gave birth to the child on September 22, 1987. She testified that after the child\u2019s birth, the husband brought the issue up for discussion whenever they had an argument. She testified that during those arguments he would often say, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s mine anyway.\u201d Her testimony was corroborated in part by other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The husband\u2019s testimony contradicted the wife\u2019s testimony in respect to some of the events she described. He testified that he only suspected that she had the affair, but that he accepted her assurance that she had not. Significantly, the husband testified that he heard rumors both before and during the divorce proceedings that he might not be the child\u2019s father. However, he admitted that he did not inform his attorney of this issue. Indeed, the record reflects that the husband\u2019s attorney initiated the divorce proceeding by filing a bill of complaint that asserted the child was born of the marriage. By his own testimony, the husband was on notice at that time that the paternity of the child was doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Upon conflicting testimony, the trial judge accepted as credible the testimony of the wife and the witnesses who corroborated her testimony. We cannot say that the trial judge erred in so do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ing. \u201cThe credibility of witnesses was crucial to the determination of the facts, and the findings of the trial [judge] based upon the judge\u2019s evaluation of the testimony of witnesses heard <em>ore terms </em>are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Shortridge </em>v. <em>Deel, </em>224 Va. 589, 592, 299 S.E.2d 500, 502 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The wife\u2019s testimony and the other corroborating testimony amply negate fraud.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">The charge of fraud is one easily made, and the burden is upon the party alleging it to establish its existence, not by doubtful and inconclusive evidence, but clearly and conclusively. Fraud cannot be presumed. It must be proved by clear and satisfactory evidence. It is true that fraud need not be proved by positive and direct evidence, but may be established by facts and circumstances sufficient to support the conclusion of fraud. But whether it be shown by direct and positive evidence, or established by circumstances, the proof must be clear and convincing, and such as to satisfy the conscience of the chancellor, who should be cautious not to lend too ready an ear to the charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>Redwood </em>v. Rogers, 105 Va. 155, 158, 53 S.E. 6, 7 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Furthermore, although the DNA testing proved that the husband is not the child\u2019s biological father, the wife\u2019s testimony proved that he married her with knowledge that another man might be the child\u2019s father and convinced her to have the child. He treated the child as his own and supported the child during the marriage. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial judge\u2019s denial of relief is contrary to equitable principles. <em>See T. </em>. . v. <em>T. </em>. ., 216 Va. 867, 224 S.E.2d 148 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">On the evidence in the record, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in ruling that the husband did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the wife committed fraud on the court and that the evidence did not justify terminating the husband\u2019s support obligation. The husband did not assert in the trial court that his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>were violated. Accordingly, we will not consider those issues for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18.
