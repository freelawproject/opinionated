The decree, <em>inter alia, </em>ordered the husband to pay spousal support to the wife in the amount of $200 per month and $5,000 \u201ctoward [her] attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The husband appeals, complaining that the trial court erred when it \u201cgranted the divorce upon the ground of one year separation instead of . . . the wife\u2019s adultery\u201d and required him to pay both spousal support and attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree and affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The parties to this cause were married April 19, 1986 and separated October 1, 1988. Shortly thereafter, the wife instituted these proceedings, alleging cruelty and constructive desertion by the husband. The husband\u2019s responsive pleadings denied these claims, alleged desertion by the wife and also prayed for a divorce. Later, the husband filed an Amended Cross-Bill which added adultery by the wife as an additional ground for the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The record clearly disclosed that the wife became pregnant \u201cin approximately May, 1989\u201d and obtained a \u201ctherapeutic abortion\u201d the following month. Since the parties had no sexual contact subsequent to November, 1988, the husband argues that the \u201conly inference available\u201d is that this pregnancy \u201cresulted from [the wife\u2019s] adulterous conduct.\u201d The wife does not deny the pregnancy, but counters that the husband\u2019s evidence failed either \u201cto indicate . . . [the] circumstances\u201d of the pregnancy or the identity of the father and, consequently, did not sufficiently establish the consensual sexual intercourse necessary to prove adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The evidence was before the trial judge both on depositions and hearings <em>ore tenus. </em>While \u201ca divorce decree based solely on depositions is not as conclusive on appellate review as one based upon evidence heard <em>ore tenus,\u201d </em>it is nonetheless \u201cpresumed correct and will not be overturned if supported by substantial, competent and credible evidence.\u201d <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Collier, 2 </em>Va. App. 125, 127, 341 S.E.2d 827, 828 (1986). If the court \u201chears the evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>its finding is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Pommerenke v. Pommerenke, </em>7 Va. App. 241, 244, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>372 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1988) (quoting <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Pittsylvania County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>3 Va. App. 15, 20, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986)). In both instances, however, we must, on appeal, \u201cview [the] evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The record establishes that the parties had been separated in excess of one year when the trial court granted the divorce on this ground. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-91(9). Nevertheless, the husband asserts that his evidence proved the wife\u2019s adultery, and he was entitled to this determination by the court, with its attendant effect, if any, on the issues of spousal support and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that the husband sufficiently proved the wife\u2019s adultery, the trial court was not compelled \u201cto give precedence to one proven ground of divorce over another.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Robertson v. Robertson, </em>215 Va. 425, 426, 211 S.E.2d 41, 43 (1975). It is well established that \u201c[w]here dual or multiple grounds for divorce exist, the trial judge can use his sound discretion to select the grounds upon which he will grant the divorce.\u201d <em>Lassen </em>v. <em>Lassen, </em>8 Va. App. 502, 505, 383 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1989) (citing <em>Zinkhan </em>v. <em>Zinkhan, 2 </em>Va. App. 200, 210, 342 S.E.2d 658, 663 (1986)); <em>see Derby </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>8 Va. App. 19, 25, 378 S.E.2d 74, 77 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The no-fault ground selected by the trial court did not diminish any obligation of the husband to support the wife, absent proof that there existed in his favor some other ground of divorce under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-91 or 20-95. Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(c); <em>Dukelow </em>v. <em>Dukelow, 2 </em>Va. App. 21, 25, 341 S.E.2d 208, 210 (1986). The presence of \u201csome other ground of divorce\u201d is an express consideration to a spousal support analysis under Code \u00a7 20-107.1, which permits reduction or elimination of support to a party at fault, consonant with the intendment of Code \u00a7 20-91 (9) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">While the husband correctly argues that Code \u00a7 20-107.1 identifies adultery as the single fault ground for divorce which precludes \u201cpermanent maintenance and support\u201d to the offending spouse, this limitation is not absolute. Notwithstanding a finding of adultery, the court \u201cmay award\u201d spousal support, provided \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>court determines from clear and convincing evidence, that a denial of . . . [such support] would constitute a manifest injustice, based upon the respective degrees of fault during the marriage and the relative economic circumstances of the parties.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In his letter opinion to the parties, the trial judge did not address the adultery issue, but expressly noted his \u201cconsideration\u201d of \u201cthose factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.1.\u201d Thus, the wife\u2019s adultery, if proven to the satisfaction of the court, was implicitly considered in its determination of spousal support. Although the trial judge did not \u201cquantify or elaborate on what weight or consideration\u201d was given to this or any statutory factor, his opinion recited evidence clearly relevant to spousal support which, together with other \u201c[substantial credible evidence\u201d in the record, \u201csupported the award.\u201d <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>5 Va. App. 426, 435, 364 S.E.2d 518, 523 (1988). Moreover, it is presumed \u201cthat a trial judge properly based his decision on the evidence presented . . . and properly applied the law.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 126, 133, 380 S.E.2d 8, 12 (1989) (citations omitted). Under such circumstances, we will not disturb the court\u2019s decision. <em>Calamos </em>v. <em>Calamos, 4 </em>Va. App. 96, 100, 354 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">With respect to the partial award of attorney\u2019s fees to the wife, it is well established that this is also \u201ca matter submitted to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>4 Va. App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987) (citing <em>Ingram v. Ingram, </em>217 Va. 27, 29, 225 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1976)). Fault is not a bar to recovery of fees and costs, provided the court has first undertaken \u201ca consideration of the circumstances and equities of the entire case.\u201d <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>8 Va. App. 12, 17, 377 S.E.2d 640, 643 (1989); <em>see also Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Wilkerson, </em>214 Va. 395, 398, 200 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1973). Again, we find ample support in the record for the court\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Barrow, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\"> We expressly decline to hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove adultery as this finding is unnecessary to our disposition of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
