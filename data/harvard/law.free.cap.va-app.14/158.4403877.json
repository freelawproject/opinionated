Gosling (defendant) appeals a felony conviction of possession of marijuana while an inmate in a Virginia correctional facility. He contends that the trial court erred in (i) refusing to compel the testimony of a witness, (ii) denying him an opportunity to proffer for the record the anticipated testimony of the witness, and (iii) admitting into evidence several packages of the alleged drug and the related certificate of analysis. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The evidence disclosed that defendant was an inmate at the Buckingham Correctional Center (Buckingham) on January 31, 1990, the date of the offense. Sergeant D. W. Staton (Staton), then an \u201cInstitutional Investigator\u201d with the Virginia Department of Corrections, had received information from a \u201cconfidential source\u201d of unlawful activity within Buckingham and reported it to Captain Charlie T. Barksdale (Barksdale), a corrections officer at the institution. An investigation ensued and Barksdale ordered that several named inmates, including defendant, be \u201cescorted\u201d to the \u201cWatch Office\u201d by Sergeants Holman and Isaac (Isaac), also corrections officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">As defendant was accompanied to the office, Isaac observed him reach \u201cinto his right hip pocket,\u201d remove \u201ca pack of cigarettes\u201d and \u201canother small piece of plastic or cellophane,\u201d which he \u201cput ... in his mouth.\u201d Defendant repeated these movements \u201cseveral times\u201d and his actions were reported to Barksdale on arrival at the office. When Barksdale instructed defendant to \u201copen his mouth,\u201d defendant refused and \u201cstarted towards the exit,\u201d but was \u201cstopped . . . and wrestled to the floor.\u201d During the struggle, a small plastic \u201cbag fell out of [defendant\u2019s] mouth\u201d and he \u201cspit out three more bags.\u201d These bags were recovered by Barksdale and he noticed that they contained what \u201clooked like tobacco or grass type substance like marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Following the \u201caltercation,\u201d corrections officer Charles E. Johnston (Johnston) assisted in a \u201cstrip search\u201d of defendant and discovered \u201ca little packet of what appeared to be marijuana in [defendant\u2019s] right front pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Barksdale and Johnston placed the items which they recovered into separate envelopes, four packets in the Barksdale envelope and a single packet in the Johnston envelope. Barksdale and Johnston made identifying notations on their respective envelopes and delivered them to Staton. Staton testified that, without opening the envelopes or knowledge of their contents, he retained them in \u201cthe evidence locker\u201d until \u201cthe incident reports\u201d and \u201ceverything\u201d was \u201ctogether,\u201d and then forwarded them \u201cto the lab for testing.\u201d He further testified that this evidence, including the original two envelopes, was subsequently returned to him from \u201cthe lab,\u201d accompanied by a \u201ccertificate of analysis,\u201d all bearing the same \u201clab number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Although these items were thereafter retained by Staton in a secure area and identified by him at trial, one envelope, without explanation, had been \u201copened on the back.\u201d This envelope contained a single item and, upon defendant\u2019s objection, was not received into evidence. Four packets were found in the second envelope, three of which were marked \u201c1-B,\u201d \u201c1-C\u201d and \u201c2,\u201d respectively, and the fourth, unmarked. Barksdale identified both this envelope and \u201cthe four packs [of] material\u201d as those items he originally delivered to Staton, as well as a photograph of the four packages, also received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Defendant noted that the certificate of analysis referenced five items, marked \u201c1A-1C,\u201d \u201c1-D\u201d and \u201c2\u201d and received by the laboratory in two envelopes. He argued that the Commonwealth was unable to sufficiently correlate the items analyzed and identified by the laboratory with the contraband and envelopes offered into evidence, and objected to both the items and the report. In response, the trial court admitted the four remaining packets but carefully admonished the jury that the unmarked packet was introduced only for the \u201cpurpose of showing there were four packages in that envelope,\u201d and was not to be \u201cconsidered as evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Jimmy Hamrick (Hamrick), an inmate at Buckingham at the time of the subject offense, testified in behalf of defendant that another inmate had given \u201cwhat looked like ... a pack of cigarettes\u201d to defendant just prior to his apprehension, telling defendant to \u201cgive that to Joe.\u201d However, when defendant\u2019s counsel asked Hamrick if he was aware \u201cwhat the contents of the package was,\u201d Hamrick exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (the privilege)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and refused to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Defendant requested the trial court to advise Hamrick of that protection provided to witnesses by Code \u00a7 19.2-270,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> recited several additional questions he \u201cwould like to ask,\u201d and moved the court to \u201ccompel [Hamrick] to testify\u201d or be \u201cin contempt.\u201d The trial judge determined that Hamrick had \u201craised\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cclaiming\u201d his privilege, declined to \u201cinstruct him on what the law is,\u201d and overruled defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Defense counsel then represented to the court that he had previously spoken with Hamrick and wished to \u201cproffer what his testimony might be ... if he were compelled to testify.\u201d The Commonwealth objected and the proposed proffer was refused by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Hamrick shares with every American citizen the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Although the federal guarantee, with its accompanying standards, is impressed upon the states through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, <em>In re </em>Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 42 (1967); <em>Malloy </em>v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 29 (1964), the Virginia Constitution also expressly assures this privilege to an accused, as well as the right to confront the witnesses against him, the power of compulsory process for obtaining witnesses and the corresponding duty of such witnesses to testify. Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 337, 340, 404 S.E.2d 371, 372 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-270, and similar state and federal immunity statutes, represent legislative efforts to \u201cseek a rational accommodation between the imperatives of the privilege and the legitimate demands of government to compel citizens to testify.\u201d <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 446 (1972). These statutes recognize that \u201cmany offenses are of such a character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those implicated in the crime\u201d and, thus, are \u201cessential\u201d to the effective prosecution of criminal activity and the \u201ctruthfinding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446-47; <em>see Cunningham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 358, 362-63, 344 S.E.2d 389, 391-92 (1986); <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 624, 633-34 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">It is well established in Virginia, however, that the privilege may not be diminished or compromised by an immunity statute that affords less than \u201cfull immunity and assurance against any liability to prosecution for a disclosure\u201d compelled from a witness. <em>Flanary </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 775, 780-81, 75 S.E. 289, 290 (1912); <em>Kendrick v. Commonwealth, </em>78 Va. 490, 496 (1884); <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. 892, 898-900 (1881); <em>Cullen, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) at 635. Testimony may be compelled only \u201cwhere immunity is complete and there is no possibility of prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cution.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 69 (3d ed. 1988). This rule is in accord with the federal standard, articulated in <em>Kastigar, </em>that the \u201cimmunity granted\u201d must be \u201ccoextensive with the scope of the privilege\u201d and \u201cas comprehensive as the protection afforded\u201d by it. <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Although this concept of co-extensive immunity does not require absolute immunity from prosecution before testimony may be compelled, the witness must be provided nothing less than the protection guaranteed by the constitutional privilege. Use immunity, derivative use immunity and transactional immunity are species of immunity that have developed as government has attempted to balance constitutional safeguards with the needs of sound public policy. <em>Id.; Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 86, 88-89, 379 S.E.2d 368, 370-71 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Use immunity protects the witness only from \u201cthe use of the specific testimony compelled from him under the grant of immunity,\u201d but not from evidence obtained as a result of such testimony. <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 449-50; <em>Caldwell, </em>8 Va. App. at 88-89, 379 S.E.2d at 370-71. Courts have recognized that witnesses protected only by use immunity may be pursued by prosecutors with evidence indirectly derived from compelled testimony and, consequently, have found it inadequate to overcome an assertion of the privilege. <em>Counselman </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>142 U.S. 547, 585-86 (1892); <em>Temple, </em>75 Va. at 900; <em>Cullen, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) at 635-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Derivative use immunity prohibits use against the witness of evidence even indirectly obtained from his testimony, while transactional immunity accords complete immunity from prosecution to the witness for the offense related to compelled testimony. <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 453; <em>Caldwell, </em>8 Va. App. at 88-89, 379 S.E.2d at 370. Unlike use immunity, the protection against self-incrimination provided by each has been found consonant and coextensive with constitutional safeguards and, thus, sufficient to supplant the privilege. <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 453; <em>see Flanary, </em>113 Va. at 780-81, 75 S.E. at 291; <em>Kendrick, </em>78 Va. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-270 provides that \u201cevidence shall not be given against the accused of any <em>statement </em>made by him . . . upon a legal examination.\u201d (emphasis added). This statute, by its terms, confers only use immunity. A prosecutor, \u201cwithout using one word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of that statement,\u201d might \u201cbe led by the testimony of the witness to means and sources of information which might result in\u201d self-incrimination. Cullen, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) at 635. Such limited protection is obviously not co-extensive with the constitutional privilege and cannot overcome it, once validly asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 364 S.E.2d 491, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988), and <em>Cunningham v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 358, 344 S.E.2d 389 (1986), as authority that Code \u00a7 19.2-270 supplants the constitutional privilege, is misplaced. In <em>Cunningham, </em>the witness admitted that his refusal to testify did not result from any fear of selfincrimination. 2 Va. App. at 362-63, 344 S.E.2d at 391. The issue in <em>O\u2019Dell </em>arose when defendant excused a witness available to him at trial and later complained that the witness\u2019 privilege against self-incrimination, though neither asserted nor tested, would have prevented his testimony. 234 Va. at 704, 364 S.E.2d at 509. Here, the statutory immunity is directly tested by the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Immunity is an issue, however, only if the privilege is properly available to the witness. The privilege was intended to avoid the actual \u201c \u2018hazard of incrimination\u2019 \u201d and a witness is not free to frustrate the judicial process by simply asserting it, <em>ipse dixit. North Am. Mortgage Investors v. Pomponio, </em>219 Va. 914, 918, 252 S.E.2d 345, 348 (1979) (quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951)). When a witness</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">declares his belief that the. answer to the question would criminate, or tend to criminate him, the court cannot compel him to answer, unless it is <em>perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Temple, </em>75 Va. at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In this analysis, the court may not compel the witness to answer, and thereby violate the privilege, but must consider the proposed question and its incriminating implications. <em>Pomponio, </em>219 Va. at 919, 252 S.E.2d at 348; <em>Kendrick, </em>78 Va. at 493-94. If \u201c \u2018a prosecutor, building on [a] seemingly harmless answer, might proceed step by step to link the witness with some crime,\u2019 \u201d under a \u201c \u2018course and scheme of linkage\u2019 \u201d which is not \u201c \u2018incredible,\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>exercise of the privilege must be sustained. <em>Pomponio, </em>219 Va. at 919, 252 S.E.2d at 348. Once such circumstances are established, the privilege rests with the witness and its assertion must be honored by the court. <em>Kendrick, </em>78 Va. at 493-94; <em>see Johnson v. Riddle, </em>222 Va. 428, 431, 281 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The record discloses that the trial court properly heard and considered several questions that defendant proposed to ask Hamrick, recognized an incriminating dimension to the inquiries and honored the witness\u2019 silence. Since it is the question, and not the anticipated answer, that is relevant to a ruling on the privilege, defendant\u2019s proffer of expected responses was correctly refused by the court. <em>See Worrells </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 270, 271-72, 183 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Lastly, defendant argues that the integrity 'of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was so compromised by irregularities in the chain of custody that neither the marijuana nor the results of its analysis were admissible. Evidence of the \u201cphysical or chemical properties of an item . . . requires proof of the chain of custody\u201d to establish \u201c \u2018with reasonable certainty\u2019 \u201d that the material was not \u201c \u2018altered, substituted, or contaminated\u2019 \u201d prior to its analysis. <em>Reedy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 386, 387, 388 S.E.2d 650, 650-51 (1990) (quoting <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 550, 323 S.E.2d 577, 587 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1111 (1985)). Obviously, it is the period preceding the analysis that is crucial to this determination. <em>Id. </em>at 391-92, 388 S.E.2d at 650-51. Once reasonably certain that the evidence analyzed was the same evidence originally collected and submitted, the report in this instance was admissible \u201cas evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis . . . referred to therein.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-187.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">While the record reflects that some confusion may have occurred in the post-analysis repackaging and return of the evidence from the laboratory, this problem related to the articles themselves, not the certificate of analysis. The trial court properly addressed each item, admitted some for expressly limited purposes, and carefully admonished the jury in this regard. The weight, if any, to be accorded to such physical evidence was a matter for the jury to resolve after a consideration of all the circumstances. <em>Reedy, 9 </em>Va. App. at 391, 388 S.E.2d at 653. Without question, however, the chain of custody prior to analysis was clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lished by the Commonwealth and the analysis itself was properly received by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> U.S. Const. amend. V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-270 provides that: \u201cIn a criminal prosecution, other than for perjury, or in an action on a penal statute, evidence shall not be given against the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon a legal examination, in a criminal or civil action, unless such statement was made when examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b215-8\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">When Gosling\u2019s counsel asked permission to proffer for the record the witness\u2019 testimony, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney objected on the grounds that the witness\u2019 conversation with Gosling\u2019s counsel \u201cwasn\u2019t given under oath,\u201d that the Commonwealth \u201cwould not have a chance of cross examination,\u201d and that by making a proffer, Gosling\u2019s counsel \u201cputs himself in the position ... of actually becoming involved as a corroborative witness\u201d in a future prosecution of the witness. In response, Gosling\u2019s counsel advised the court that he had no lawyer-client relationship with the witness and that a proffer was appropriate. Apparently, however, the trial judge believed that if Gosling\u2019s counsel proffered the witness\u2019 testimony for the record, Gosling\u2019s counsel would have to be removed from the pending case. Based on the view that the Commonwealth would use the proffer against the witness and on a misapprehension of the function of the proffer, the trial judge ruled as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">You know the rule. When a lawyer starts being a witness, he has got to get out of the case at that point and I\u2019m not going to let you out at this point for the purpose of saying what the witness may or may not have told you. I don\u2019t know what you would put on but I\u2019m not going to let you do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">The rule has long been established that when an objection is sustained and evidence is excluded, the content of the excluded testimony may be included in the record by a proper proffer. <em>Driver </em>v. Hartman, 96 Va. 518, 520, 31 S.E. 899, 899 (1898). Thus, whenever \u201ca question is asked and the witness is not permitted to answer it,\u201d the proponent of the evidence must make a proffer of the expected answer in order to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 845, 846-47, 36 S.E. 487, 488 (1900). This procedure must be followed because \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977). On numerous occasions, the Supreme Court and this Court have invoked the rule to bar consideration of issues on appeal. <em>See Wyche </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 839, 842, 241 S.E.2d 772, 775 (1978); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 624, 630-31, 136 S.E. 765, 767 (1927); <em>Klein v. Klein, </em>11 Va. App. 155, 160, 396 S.E.2d 866, 869 (1990); <em>Lowery v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va. App. 304, 307, 387 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1990); <em>Stultz v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 439, 444, 369 S.E.2d 215, 218 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In the absence of abusive conduct by counsel, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which the trial judge appropriately may categorically deny counsel the right to proffer for the record testimony that the trial judge has refused to admit or that has otherwise been excluded by a ruling of the trial judge. Any such action by the trial judge has the effect of frustrating the very rule designed to ensure review of the trial judge\u2019s ruling. Solely because of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow the proffer, this Court is now unable to determine on this appeal whether the trial judge erred in refusing to compel the witness to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[T]he privilege against self incrimination ... \u2018is purely a personal privilege of the witness\u2019 . . . [and] a refusal to answer cannot be justified by a desire to protect others from punishment.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 U.S. 367, 371 (1951). Moreover, the privilege against self-incrimination protects the witness \u201cagainst real dangers, not remote and speculative possibilities.\u201d <em>Zicarelli </em>v. <em>New Jersey State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, </em>406 U.S. 472, 478 (1972). \u201c[The] protection [against self-incrimination] must be confined to instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">To sustain a witness\u2019 invocation of the privilege, it is not enough that the witness merely utter the words or have a subjective belief that the answer may tend to incriminate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">The witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself \u2014 his say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination. It is for the court to say whether his silence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>justified, and to require him to answer if \u201cit clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 486 (citations omitted). Obviously, the trial judge in deciding whether the witness could properly invoke the privilege must consider the broad scope of the case and the facts. <em>Id. </em>An important ingredient of that determination is the scope of the questions. <em>See Worrells </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 270, 271-72, 183 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1971). Equally as important, however, is an inquiry into \u201cwhat a truthful answer might disclose.\u201d <em>Zicarelli, </em>406 U.S. at 480. \u201cTo sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 487-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">An examination of the record establishes that the trial judge neither relied on the facts of this case nor the witness\u2019s circumstances when he allowed the witness to invoke the fifth amendment. Rather, the record indicates that the trial judge considered nothing more than the witness\u2019 claim that his answers might incriminate him in finding that the fifth amendment was properly invoked. Nowhere in the record does the trial judge actually appraise the witness\u2019 claim. When Gosling\u2019s counsel attempted to proffer the witness\u2019 expected testimony, the trial judge merely stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you would put on but I\u2019m not going to let you do it.\u201d There is no indication, beyond the witness\u2019s subjective belief, that the witness was entitled to invoke the fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow Gosling\u2019s counsel to proffer on the record the full scope of the inquiry as well as the responses he expected to elicit precluded the trial judge from making an informed appraisal of the witness\u2019 right to invoke the protection of the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. More importantly, the ruling has deprived this court of the basis upon which to determine whether the trial judge erred in not compelling the witness to testify. That the witness has invoked the protection of the fifth amendment is not a sufficient basis upon which to deny counsel the right to place on the record a proffer of expected testimony. Indeed, in <em>Worrells, </em>where the factual setting was analogous to the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>dressed the dilemma that an appellate court faces on appeal when no proffer is made on the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">The defendant\u2019s assignments of error present . . . questions which merit discussion. The first is whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to question Allen Guill after the latter, who had been summoned, called, and sworn as a defense witness, had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. Guill, who was under indictment in connection with the incident at Briar Patch Inn, was excused as a witness upon his general assertion \u201cthat any testimony that he might give\u201d might tend to incriminate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">The defendant contends that he should have been permitted to pose individual questions to the witness and if Guill asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against answering any such questions, then the court could have determined whether the answers thereto would have been incriminating. With this contention, as a general proposition, we would agree. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the failure of the trial court to follow such a course in this case constituted reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The defendant did not proffer to the trial court the individual questions he desired to pose to the witness. We are unable to determine, therefore, whether such questions would have been relevant and, if so, whether the witness should have been required to answer them. Given the evidence, as previously outlined, of Guill\u2019s alleged participation in the events at Briar Patch, it is conceivable that any relevant question could have elicited an answer which might have tended to incriminate the witness. In the absence of proffer of a relevant question calling for a nonincriminating answer, we will not reverse for the alleged error in excusing Guill as a witness upon the general assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">212 Va. at 271-72, 183 S.E.2d at 724 (citations omitted). <em>See also Johnson </em>v. Riddle, 222 Va. 428, 431, 281 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1981) (testimony of witness who invoked the privilege against self-incrimination \u201cwas proffered out of the presence of the jury to. determine its extent and character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201cThe test to be applied by an appellate court where an offer [of proof] has been denied is whether any conceivable answer to the question would have been admissible.\u201d <em>Frisone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>270 F.2d 401, 403 (9th Cir. 1959). Here, the possibility of an admissible answer is immediately obvious. The evidence before the trial judge suggested that the witness was a mere bystander who observed an occurrence between Gosling and another inmate. Certainly, the witness might have been in a position to testify truthfully that he did not know the contents of the cigarette package or that he saw another inmate put contraband in the package while standing in the line or that he learned of the contents of the package after Gosling\u2019s arrest. While it is also possible that the witness may have had guilty knowledge and, thus, was in fact entitled to invoke the privilege, that possibility is no more probable than the hypothesis that the witness had knowledge that would have incriminated another inmate, but not himself, and, thus, inappropriately invoked his right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">What we do know from the record is that Gosling\u2019s counsel had spoken with the witness twice prior to trial and was capable, if permitted, of placing on the record the questions that he intended to ask the witness and the expected responses. Only if that had occurred could the trial judge have made an informed decision whether counsel should have been appointed for the purpose of consulting with and advising the witness or whether the witness should have been allowed to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. These were matters that should have been determined only after an appropriate inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without jeopardizing the witness\u2019 right not to incriminate himself, the trial judge should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>have attempted to determine whether the witness had a legitimate privilege. <em>See People v. Poma, </em>96 Mich. App. 726, 732, 294 N.W.2d 221, 223 (1980). In any event, that determination should have been prefaced by an adequate explanation of the self-incrimination privilege so the witness would have been informed that the privilege could not be invoked to protect third parties and the witness could have made \u201ca knowledgeable choice regarding assertion\u201d of the privilege. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in denying Gosling\u2019s counsel the right to proffer for the record the anticipated testimony of the witness. In the absence of the proffer and an inquiry, the trial judge could not determine whether the witness was privileged not to answer. The refusal to allow Gosling\u2019s counsel to make the proffer by an appropriate avowal of expected testimony should not be sanctioned by this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> In the absence of the proffer and an appropriate inquiry, I believe it is premature to reach the issues concerning the scope of Code \u00a7 19.2-270 and the trial judge\u2019s authority to grant, sua sponte, Code \u00a7 19.2-270 immunity to the witness. Although the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 704, 364 S.E.2d 491, 509 (1988), cites favorably <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 358, 344 S.E.2d 389 (1986), for the proposition that Code \u00a7 19.2-270 is available to compel testimony from a witness who has invoked the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, it should be noted that in <em>Cunningham, </em>this Court did not approve or disprove the trial judge\u2019s grant of Code \u00a7 19.2-270 immunity to the witness. Neither Cunningham nor the Commonwealth raised that issue or complained of the manner in which the witness was granted immunity. Although the majority opinion in <em>Cunningham </em>recited the grant of immunity in discussing the factual and procedural posture of the case, <em>id. </em>at 363, 344 S.E.2d at 392, we had no occasion to address the scope or propriety of the grant of immunity under the circumstances which were existing in <em>Cunningham.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
