Henrico County, </em>13 Va. App. 251, 260-61, 410 S.E.2d 689, 694 (1991), which held that Code \u00a7 19.2-294<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> bars multiple convictions arising from the \u201csame act,\u201d even where the convictions are obtained in a single trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not bar multiple convictions for the \u201csame act\u201d when those convictions are obtained in a single trial. Multiple convictions and punishments for the \u201csame act\u201d may be precluded by the double jeopardy clause, even though obtained in a single trial. <em>See Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359 (1983). Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bars the Commonwealth from securing multiple convictions for the \u201csame act\u201d through successive \u201cprosecution [s] or proceeding [s]\u201d after having previously obtained a conviction. Unlike the double jeopardy clause, the statute operates only to successive prosecutions following a conviction. We further hold that the trial judge did not err regarding the evidence he considered in determining the role which Hall played in committing the crimes, and the court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Anthony Hall, the appellant, was convicted in a single bench trial of two counts of armed robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, unlawfully stabbing during the commission of a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53, two counts of malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51, and one count of aggravated mali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>cious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2. Hall was sentenced to a life term in the penitentiary plus consecutive terms aggregating sixty-six years. He raises three issues on appeal. First, he contends that the former jeopardy protection of the fifth amendment and Code \u00a7 19.2-294 prohibit several of the multiple convictions which arose out of the \u201csame act\u201d committed against the same victim. Second, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to identify him as one of the perpetrators of the crimes. Third, he contends that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial when the prosecutor improperly gestured toward him to assist a witness in identifying him as the perpetrator. We find the contentions to be without merit and affirm Hall\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">On October 24, 1988, at 6:30 p.m., Lottie Goodman and the other employees of Dailey\u2019s Supermarket were preparing to close. Three men entered the market. One of the men was noticeably shorter than the other two. The two taller men approached Lottie Goodman\u2019s register, and one handed her a beer for purchase. The other pointed a handgun at her and removed approximately $500 in cash from her register.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">At that time, Christopher Dailey, the twenty-one-year-old son of one of the owners, came to the front of the store where the register was located. The first of the two men in Goodman\u2019s register line, later identified as Anthony Hall, opened a long pocket knife and stabbed Christopher Dailey three times in the lower chest area. Judy Dailey, Christopher\u2019s mother and co-owner of the store, witnessed the stabbing and ran to help her son. When she intervened, Hall cut her, severing the end of Mrs. Dailey\u2019s nose. The man who was second in Goodman\u2019s line then shot Christopher Dailey in the back, causing a spinal injury that rendered him a paraplegic. The three criminals then fled from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Later, Anthony Hall was arrested. Christopher Dailey identified Hall from a lineup as the man who had stabbed him. Hall was indicted and prosecuted in a single bench trial for the various offenses; however, significant for purposes of this appeal are the offenses of malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 (two counts, stabbing Christopher Dailey and cutting Judy Dailey), and stabbing in the commission of a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53 (two counts for the stabbing and cutting of Christopher and Judy Dailey). These convictions for malicious wounding and stabbing arose out of the same acts of stabbing Christopher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Dailey and cutting Judy Dailey. Also relevant is the offense of aggravated malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2 (as a principal in the second degree for shooting Christopher Dailey).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">At trial, Robert Wright testified that he lived near Dailey\u2019s Market and that shortly before the robbery, Anthony Hall, Clinton Powell, and Donald Norman were at his residence playing cards. He testified that Norman is substantially shorter than the other two men. He testified that just before 6:30 p.m. on October 24, 1988, the three men left his home to buy beer. While the men were gone, Horace Simon, Jr., arrived at Wright\u2019s home. Soon thereafter, Hall, Powell, and Norman returned. Simon testified that when the three men returned, Hall told him to turn off the stereo and television and to pull the shades, that he (Hall) \u201chad just cut a man and woman and Clinton Powell had just shot a man at Dailey\u2019s.\u201d Simon testified that the three men went into a bedroom. He further testified that two days later, he and Wright found a knife that Hall regularly carried. The knife was found under the mattress in the bedroom where the three men had gone. Christopher Dailey identified Hall as the person who had stabbed him and who had cut off his mother\u2019s nose. Lottie Goodman described the man who stabbed Christopher and cut Judy Dailey as the first man in her register line and the one middle in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Hall contends that the trial court erred by convicting him in a single bench trial for two counts of unlawful stabbing in the commission of a felony after having already found him guilty of two counts of malicious wounding of the same victims. He argues that he could only have committed one offense by the same act of stabbing each victim. Hall asserts that multiple convictions for the same act are barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and the double jeopardy protections in the fifth amendment. Additionally, Hall contends that his convictions in a single trial for malicious wounding of Christopher Dailey caused by the stabbing and for the aggravated malicious wounding of Christopher caused by the shooting also violate Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and the double jeopardy clause. He contends that the infliction of multiple wounds on the same victim, even if by separate means, constitutes only one offense when it arises out of a single, continuous act.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>We reject the argument that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applies to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial. Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is \u201ca bar to a prosecution or proceeding\u201d where one \u201cact [may] be a violation of two or more statutes,\u201d and when there has been a \u201cconviction under one of such statutes.\u201d By its terms, the statute only bars \u201cprosecution [s] or proceeding [s]\u201d after there has been a \u201cconviction.\u201d A \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d after a \u201cconviction,\u201d by definition requires multiple or successive proceedings or prosecutions. Thus, we reject Hall\u2019s contention that his multiple convictions for the \u201csame act\u201d offenses committed upon Christopher Dailey and Judy Dailey are barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 or by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, . . . conviction under one of such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d Hall\u2019s contention that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applies to convictions obtained in a single trial presents a question that was recently considered for the first time in Virginia by a panel of this Court in <em>Lash, </em>13 Va. App. at 260-61, 410 S.E.2d at 694, and in this case. Previous cases which have considered Code \u00a7 19.2-294 have found it necessary only to decide whether the multiple offenses being prosecuted arose out of the \u201csame act.\u201d Thus, earlier cases never addressed the \u201csingle trial\u201d versus \u201csuccessive trial\u201d question because the multiple convictions did not arise out of the \u201csame act,\u201d <em>see Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 720, 273 S.E.2d 778 (1981) (held robbery and grand larceny were not the \u201csame act\u201d where different sums of money were stolen); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 (1978) (robbery of money and larceny of automobile are not the \u201csame act\u201d); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 370, 157 S.E.2d 907 (1967) (breaking and entering and attempted robbery not the same act); <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 625, 401 S.E.2d 208 (1991) (breaking of door as offense of destruction of property is not \u201csame act\u201d as breaking and entering for burglary offense), or because the statute applies only to statutory offenses and not common law crimes, <em>Blythe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 284 S.E.2d 796 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">We turn to the issue whether Hall\u2019s multiple convictions for malicious wounding and stabbing satisfy the threshold requirement that they must arise from the \u201csame act\u201d to implicate Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-294. In determining whether the conduct underlying the convictions is based upon the \u201csame act,\u201d the particular criminal transaction must be examined to determine whether the acts are the same in terms of time, situs, victim, and the nature of the act itself. <em>See </em>Martin, 221 Va. at 723-25, 273 S.E.2d at 780-82; <em>Jones, </em>218 Va. at 760-61, 240 S.E.2d at 661-62; <em>Fitzgerald, </em>11 Va. App. at 628, 401 S.E.2d at 210-11; <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va. App. 359, 363-65, 388 S.E.2d 277, 279-80 (1990). Hall\u2019s act of stabbing Christopher Dailey clearly was the identical act that was used to convict him of malicious wounding and of stabbing in the commission of a felony. Also, Hall\u2019s act in cutting Judy Dailey was the same act used to convict him of malicious wounding and of stabbing in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The wounding and stabbing of Christopher Dailey could not in any rational manner be viewed as separate or distinct acts. The same is true with regard to the wounding and cutting of Judy Dailey. Therefore, multiple convictions arising out of the \u201csame act\u201d were obtained and, accordingly, we must decide whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applies to multiple convictions for the \u201csame act\u201d obtained in a single trial. If Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bars multiple convictions for the same act obtained in a single trial, two of Hall\u2019s four convictions based on his acts in stabbing Christopher Dailey and cutting Judy Dailey would be barred by the first \u201cconviction\u201d arising out of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bespeaks a legislative intent that it applies only to multiple or successive prosecutions. The statute provides that a \u201cconviction\u201d for the \u201csame act\u201d under one statute <em>\u201cshall </em>be a bar to a <em>prosecution </em>or <em>proceeding </em>under the other.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-294 (emphasis added). A \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d must follow a \u201cconviction\u201d in order for the statute to apply. In a single trial, there would be no subsequent \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d following a \u201cconviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Moreover, if the legislature had intended that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 apply to multiple convictions for the same act obtained in a single trial, it clearly could have so provided. It did not do so. The statute\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the terms \u201cconvictions\u201d and \u201ca prosecution or proceeding\u201d were carefully chosen to define the scope of the statutory bar. The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 first appeared as \u00a7 4775, Code 1919 and originally read, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>. . . a <em>prosecution </em>or <em>proceeding </em>under one of such [statutes] . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution under the other or others.\u201d <em>Sigmon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 258, 263, 105 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1958) (emphasis added). The statute was amended in 1920 by deleting \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d and adding <em>\u201cconviction\" </em>so that a prosecution or proceeding not resulting in a conviction did not bar another prosecution or proceeding. <em>Id. </em>The legislature carefully considered the statute and could have amended it at that time, if it had intended to do so, to provide that a \u201cconviction\u201d for an offense arising out of one act shall bar another \u201cconviction\u201d for any other offense arising out of the same act. It did not do so. Instead, the legislature barred only another \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d following a conviction. Furthermore, the 1920 amendment makes clear that the statutory bar was intended to be narrow in scope, since the General Assembly rewrote the statute and restricted its breadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294, while not precisely a defense of former jeopardy, \u201camounts to such a defense in purpose and desired effect.\u201d <em>Epps </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 150, 155, 216 S.E.2d 64, 68 (1975); <em>Sigmon, </em>200 Va. at 263, 105 S.E.2d at 175-76. Consequently, even though the statutory bar differs in some respects from the constitutional double jeopardy protections, it was intended to address similar and related problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The General Assembly, by enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-294 and its predecessors, effectively redressed some of the same concerns that the United States Supreme Court addressed in <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990). The statute, like the constitutional former jeopardy protection announced in <em>Grady, </em>was designed to prevent the prosecutorial practices of subjecting an accused to the hazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions. Code \u00a7 19.2-294 prevents a prosecutor from subjecting an accused through successive prosecutions to \u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him [or her] to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.\u201d <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 518. Additionally, the statute, by limiting its reach to successive prosecutions for multiple offenses for the same act, prevents prosecutors from using the prosecution of a minor offense as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for a more serious, later prosecution. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 protects against a second prosecution or proceeding for separate statutory offenses based on the same act after there has been a conviction for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>offense. <em>See North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969) (double jeopardy bars second prosecution for same offense after conviction or acquittal, in addition to multiple punishments for same offense). Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-294, based upon the similar policy considerations as those expressed in <em>Grady, </em>prohibits multiple convictions for separate offenses arising out of the same act, except where the convictions are obtained in a single prosecution. <em>But see Freeman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 126, 414 S.E.2d 871 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Accordingly, because Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not bar multiple convictions for the same act when those convictions are obtained in a single trial, Hall\u2019s contentions that his multiple convictions in a single trial for malicious wounding and stabbing in the commission of a felony and malicious wounding and aggravated malicious wounding as a principal in the second degree are barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Hall alternatively contends that double jeopardy protections bar his convictions for stabbing/cutting Judy and Christopher Dailey after he was convicted of malicious wounding of these same victims. Since these convictions were obtained in a single trial, the rule announced in <em>Grady </em>is inapplicable. Consequently, the constitutional inquiry focuses on whether the imposition of multiple punishments for these offenses offends the constitution. In the single trial context, \u201cthe question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 698 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring). The test announced in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932), is merely a rule of statutory construction to determine legislative intent when it is not otherwise clear. In enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-53, the legislature intended to impose additional punishment over and above the penalty prescribed for the primary felony of malicious wounding in order to deter the specific form of violence delineated in the statute and to lessen the risk of harm to potential victims of felonies. <em>Blythe, </em>222 Va. at 727, 284 S.E.2d at 798-99. Accordingly, Hall\u2019s punishment for two counts of malicious wounding resulting from the stabbing of two victims and for two counts of stabbing/cutting the same victims during the commission of a felony does not offend the double jeopardy clause because the General Assembly intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>impose multiple punishments when enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Hall\u2019s contention that his convictions for malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and aggravated malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2, both stemming from injuries inflicted upon Christopher Dailey, violate the double jeopardy clause is also without merit. The rule announced in <em>Grady </em>is inapplicable because Hall was convicted of all offenses in a single proceeding. Therefore, the sole issue is whether the punishments imposed for the malicious wounding and aggravated malicious wounding convictions offend the constitutional prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. Pursuant to <em>Blockburger, </em>no double jeopardy problem exists where each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304. Hall was convicted as a principal in the second degree to the offense of aggravated malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.2 based on the fact that his confederate shot Christopher Dailey. Hall\u2019s conviction for malicious wounding of Christopher Dailey in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 is a separate and distinct offense in which the Commonwealth was required to prove that Hall maliciously shot, stabbed, cut, or wounded Christopher Dailey. Each offense requires proof of facts not required by the other and, consequently, Hall\u2019s conviction for each comports with the dictates of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Hall next argues that the trial judge erred in finding him guilty of all the charges because the judge relied on facts not in evidence, in the form of the testimony of Lottie Goodman that Christopher Dailey\u2019s assailant was \u201cmiddle in size,\u201d and because there was insufficient evidence to identify him as the perpetrator of the offenses. Hall\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">The trial judge did not rely on facts outside the record to substantiate Lottie Goodman\u2019s account that the individual who stabbed Christopher Dailey was the second tallest of the three men. The trial court did not err in considering the relative sizes of the perpetrators as a means of identifying the role each played in the crimes. In addition to Goodman\u2019s testimony, which corroborated Hall\u2019s identity as the perpetrator, Christopher Dailey specifically identified Hall as his assailant. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless it is plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) (en banc) (citations omitted); Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Robert Wright and Horace Simon testified as to the events immediately preceding and following the robbery at Dailey\u2019s, and they, too, corroborated Hall\u2019s identity as one of the perpetrators of the offenses. Based on this evidence, the convictions are supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Hall\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial when the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney gestured toward him [Hall] while attempting to elicit an identification of the perpetrator from Christopher Dailey upon direct examination. Whether to grant a mistrial rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and his or her decision may not be overturned unless a manifest probability exists that the denial of a mistrial was prejudicial. <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984); <em>Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 468, 478, 364 S.E.2d 511, 516 (1988). Furthermore, in a bench trial, the trial judge is presumed to disregard prejudicial or inadmissible evidence, <em>see Eckhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981), and this presumption will control in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, <em>see Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 126, 133, 380 S.E.2d 8, 12 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">At trial, the judge overruled Hall\u2019s motion for a mistrial and expressly found that there had been no prejudice caused by the actions of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. Hall adduced no evidence to the contrary. Dailey identified Hall as his assailant, and the record does not support the inference that the identification was made at the suggestion of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. The evidence identified Hall as the one who attacked Dailey. We presume that the trial judge disregarded any inappropriate actions of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. No manifest probability has been shown that Hall was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to declare a mistrial. Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>For the reasons stated, we affirm Hall\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Barrow, J., Duff, J., Moon, J., Willis, J., Elder, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, . . . conviction under one of such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the same or others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-12\"> Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D), after this case was argued to a panel, the Court granted an <em>en banc </em>hearing to address whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applied to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial and in order to reconsider the panel decision in <em>Lash. </em>The decisions of a panel are binding on the entire Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 757, 105 S.E. 531 (1921). This statute relates to matters of a penal nature and is remedial in character; accordingly, under familiar principles, it must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and favorably to the accused. <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 383, 164 S.E.2d 676 (1968). Although amended from time to time by the General Assembly, the thrust of this statute was and continues to be a prohibition against multiple convictions arising from \u201cthe same act,\u201d even though that act may violate separate statutory offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">The majority concludes that \u201cthe plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2- 294 . . . bespeaks a legislative intent that it applies only to subsequent prosecutions.\u201d It reaches this conclusion by reasoning that \u201cin a single trial, there would be no subsequent \u2018prosecution or proceeding.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the majority bolsters its conclusion of the legislature\u2019s intent by suggesting that the legislature has not clearly provided that this Code section apply to multiple convictions for the same act prosecuted in a single trial. The majority suggests that the legislature could have accomplished this by pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>viding that \u201ca \u2018conviction\u2019 for an offense arising out of one act shall bar another conviction for any other offense arising out of the same act.\u201d In my view, the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is clear and unambiguous. While the language used by the legislature is different from that suggested by the majority, it accomplishes the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">This Code section, by its express terms, does not exclude its application to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial. Because it relates to matters of a penal nature and is remedial in character, it must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and favorably to the accused. Viewed in this context, it is true that the statute refers to a \u201cconviction\u201d being \u201ca bar to a prosecution <em>or </em>proceeding\u201d following a conviction.-(Emphasis added). Thus, the majority correctly concludes that in a single trial there would be no subsequent \u201cprosecution.\u201d This is so because the prosecution has already commenced. The majority, however, overlooks the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the words \u201cor proceeding\u201d within the phrase \u201cprosecution or proceeding.\u201d We must assume that the legislature intended both terms to have meaning. I agree with the majority that the legislature carefully considered this statute when it chose this phrase. In doing so, I believe the legislature intended to give meaning and effect to the language \u201cor proceeding\u201d separate and apart from \u201cprosecution.\u201d Multiple criminal convictions obtained in a single trial cannot occur simultaneously. When one conviction is obtained in a single trial involving multiple offenses, necessarily there must be a further \u201cproceeding\u201d with respect to a second offense. Thus, in such cases, there will always be a \u201cconviction\u201d creating a \u201cbar\u201d to any further \u201cprosecution or proceeding\u201d for the same act. Accordingly, in my view, the language used by the legislature in Code \u00a7 19.2-294 evinces an intent that this statute apply to single trials as well as successive or subsequent trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Our Supreme Court, on at least four occasions, has had the opportunity to address the applicability of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial but has not restricted the application of this Code section to successive or subsequent trials.Rather, the Court based its decision in each of those cases on the issue whether the \u201csame act\u201d was used to prove a violation of two or more statutes. Whether multiple convictions were obtained in a single trial is a matter readily determined and beyond dispute. If the statute simply is not applicable to such cases, it is difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>perceive why the Court would undergo the more difficult \u201csame act\u201d analysis which is not readily determined and is always in dispute. Implicit in these decisions, I believe, is the conclusion that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is applicable to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial as well as to successive or subsequent trials. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 720, 273 S.E.2d 778 (1981); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 (1978); <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 23, 181 S.E.2d 622 (1971); <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 69 S.E.2d 336 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">For these reasons and because Hall\u2019s multiple convictions arose from the same act, I would reverse the decision below and remand the case with directions that the trial court impose sentence in only the appropriate convictions and dismiss the others.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
