On appeal, defendant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney improperly commented on his exercise of his right to remain silent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court erred by denying his resulting motion for a mistrial. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The record discloses that Thomas Hudson (Hudson), while \u201cturning right to go into the bank,\u201d noticed a \u201cman walking along the street with a briefcase under his arm.\u201d As he entered the bank moments later, Hudson \u201clooked back out the door\u201d and the same man was \u201ccoming up the driveway of . . . the bank\u2019s drive-in.\u201d Hudson testified that the man then \u201ccame through the door with [a] gun\u201d and proceeded to rob the bank. The man was wearing a mask at the time of the robbery, but Hudson recognized \u201cthe same clothes\u201d and \u201cthe same briefcase in his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Immediately after the robbery, Hudson followed the man, who \u201cdidn\u2019t have a mask on then,\u201d and observed him \u201cgetting in the getaway car.\u201d At trial, Hudson identified defendant as the robber and Debbie Falden (Falden) as \u201cthe lady driving the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Another witness had seen defendant \u201cpitch the briefcase\u201d into her front yard before being \u201cpicked up\u201d by a car. The police retrieved the briefcase, which contained \u201csome bullets\u201d and $909, the \u201cexact amount of money missing from the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Falden admitted that she drove defendant to the bank and next \u201csaw [him] running down the street,\u201d \u201cwith a briefcase,\u201d and \u201c[s]omeone in a car . . . was like following him.\u201d Falden \u201ckept riding around,\u201d \u201cfound\u201d and \u201cpicked up\u201d defendant, who immediately stated, \u201cit didn\u2019t work.\u201d Falden denied any prior knowledge of defendant\u2019s intention to rob the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Following his arrest, defendant made no statement to the police, but testified at trial that he had been out of town on business at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>In closing argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney commented to the jury that defense counsel had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">started talking about Debbie Falden and the fact that she said she would lie to keep from going to prison. . . . [Y]ou really can\u2019t judge her by that standard because . . . [e] very thing she said here today is after she has been charged. . . . Kevin Robinson stands in different shoes. Because you see, Kevin Robinson stands to go to the penitentiary and everything he said today is the first time and everything he said today determines whether he goes or not, so to suggest \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">At that point, defendant made a motion for mistrial, arguing that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had improperly commented upon defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976), the Supreme Court considered the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cat the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. In <em>Doyle, </em>the defendants claimed for the first time at trial that they had been framed. <em>Id. </em>at 613. The trial court, over objection, permitted the prosecutor to cross-examine the defendants concerning their failure previously to relate this account to police. <em>Id. </em>Relying upon <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Supreme Court held that the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence, following <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619. The Court noted that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings carry an implicit assurance that a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent \u201cwill carry no penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Subsequently, in <em>Durant v. Commonwealth, 7 </em>Va. App. 454, 375 S.E.2d 396 (1988), this Court found that references by the Commonwealth \u201cto [Durant\u2019s] post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings silence both during cross-examination of Durant and in closing argument\u201d violated <em>Doyle </em>and required reversal of the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 460, 375 S.E.2d at 398. The Commonwealth had asked Durant \u201cwhy she did not tell the whole story to the police,\u201d and referred during closing argument to Durant\u2019s \u201cdecision to speak with an attorney rather than telling the police the whole story,\u201d both obvious references to her exercise of her constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 375 S.E.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Similarly, in <em>Williams v. </em>Zahradnick, 632 F.2d 353 (4th Cir. 1980), the Fourth Circuit concluded that <em>Doyle </em>was controlling on the issue of whether \u201cthe raising of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence invaded his constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 357, 360. There, the prosecutor asked the defendant \u201ca series of questions concerning why he had not related [his] story to the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. In closing argument, the prosecutor again referred to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, commenting, \u201cWhen did [defendant] come forward with [this story]? Today in Court. Use your common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357. The court determined that these repeated references to the defendant\u2019s silence were impermissible under <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Fourth Circuit again considered prosecutorial comments in the context of <em>Doyle </em>in <em>Gaskins v. McKellar, </em>916 F.2d 941 (4th Cir. 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 961 (1991). There, the prosecutor stated in closing argument \u201cthat he wished to talk to the jury \u2018about what is not in dispute in this case.\u2019 \u201d He then proceeded to discuss \u201cpieces of evidence\u201d which <em>only </em>the accused \u201ccould have disputed,\u201d a subtle reference to the silence of the accused before and during trial. <em>Id. </em>at 951. The court found this argument \u201cdid not constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation,\u201d explaining that the critical inquiry in a <em>Doyle </em>analysis \u201cis whether the disputed statement so infected the trial and sentencing with unfairness that the ultimate conviction and sentence constituted a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Against this standard, a single comment, which only vaguely and indirectly referenced the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, does not violate <em>Doyle. </em>In both <em>Durant </em>and <em>Williams, </em>defendants were repeatedly questioned with respect to their failure to relate an exculpatory story to the police prior to trial, conduct which was then argued to the jury. In contrast, the prosecutor in <em>Gaskins </em>alluded to the accused\u2019s silence only indirectly and in a single remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In the instant case, defendant was not cross-examined with respect to his failure to relate any alibi to police. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney merely argued to the jury that Falden had al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ready admitted her participation in the crime and had \u201cbeen charged,\u201d while \u201ceverything [defendant] said today is the first time.\u201d The jury may not have even related this isolated comment to defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Clearly, however, it did not \u201cso infect\u201d the trial with \u201cunfairness that the ultimate conviction\u201d constituted a denial of due process. <em>Gaskins, </em>916 F.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\"> U.S. Const. amend. V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\"> Factors which the court considered material to this determination include: (1) the use to which the prosecution puts the post-arrest silence; (2) who elected to pursue the line of questioning; (3) the quantum of other evidence indicative of guilt; (4) the intensity and frequency of the reference; and (5) the availability to the trial judge of an opportunity to grant a motion for mistrial or to give curative instructions.
