(Extras), Gerald G. Carter (claimant) applied to the Virginia Employment Commission (Commission) for unemployment benefits. Extras reported to the Commission that claimant was \u201cDischarged\u201d for misconduct, and he was denied benefits by both the deputy commissioner and, on appeal, an appeals examiner. Claimant appealed to the Commission, which reversed the previous decisions and approved the claim. Extras thereafter petitioned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>trial court for \u201cJudicial Review.\u201d Following consideration of the \u201cadministrative record, legal memoranda and oral argument,\u201d the court found claimant \u201cguilty of misconduct in connection with work\u201d and \u201cnot qualified for benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Claimant appeals the trial court\u2019s decision, complaining that the court (1) erred in its finding of misconduct, (2) erred in its analysis of the factors material to that conclusion, and (3) failed to properly consider the \u201cmitigating circumstances.\u201d We find no error and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Code \u00a7 60.2-625 assures \u201cjudicial review\u201d in \u201cthe circuit court\u201d to \u201cany party aggrieved\u201d by a decision of the Commission. Further, an appeal \u201cmay be taken from the decision of the court\u201d to this Court. Code \u00a7 60.2-625. In such \u201cjudicial proceedings,\u201d the \u201cfindings of the Commission as to facts, if supported by the evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive,\u201d and the court\u2019s review is \u201cconfined to questions of law.\u201d <em>Id.; Lee </em>v. <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Va. App. 82, 85, 335 S.E.2d 104, 106 (1985). Thus, on appeal, we \u201cmust consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding by the Commission.\u201d <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Peninsula Emergency Physicians, Inc., </em>4 Va. App. 621, 626, 359 S.E.2d 552, 554-55 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The record discloses that claimant began employment with Extras as an \u201celectronics technician\u201d on April 1, 1989. All .employees were then subject to written \u201cCONDUCT RULES,\u201d a provision of which prohibited \u201calcoholic beverages or controlled or restricted drugs, unless prescribed by a doctor ... on [Extras] property.\u201d The \u201cRules\u201d further provided that a violation \u201cwill be grounds for dismissal.\u201d Claimant admitted his awareness of this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">After claimant was hired, Extras became concerned that illegal drug activity threatened its welfare and the welfare of its employees. An armed \u201cdrug distributor\u201d had \u201can altercation\u201d with an employee \u201con company property,\u201d and \u201cusage\u201d and \u201cpresence\u201d of drugs in the workplace were \u201ccausing problems.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In response, Extras developed a \u201cnew drug and alcohol abuse policy\u201d as \u201ca condition of continued employment with the company.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This policy was presented to all Extras employees at \u201ca corporate wide meeting\u201d and everyone was requested \u201cto sign\u201d an \u201cACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY EMPLOYEE\u201d or confer with Extras\u2019 officials to discuss \u201cconfidentially\u201d any \u201cproblems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">At this meeting, claimant complained that his wages did not include submission of \u201cbodily fluids for drug testing\u201d and inquired, \u201cWhat are you paying us to be tested?\u201d His objections apparently were not resolved and, at the conclusion of the meeting, he submitted an altered acknowledgment form, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Later, at a private meeting with his supervisor and Extras\u2019 president, claimant demanded $100 for each urine sample, \u201ctake it or leave it.\u201d This proposal was rejected by Extras, and claimant was advised \u201cto agree with the policy\u201d or \u201cresign.\u201d Claimant declined both options and \u201cwas fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">After Extras protested claimant\u2019s subsequent application for unemployment benefits, claimant explained that he had refused to execute the required acknowledgment form because he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d the new rules, was \u201cpanicked\u201d and wanted \u201cto do something to stall.\u201d He denounced the policy as \u201can invasion of privacy,\u201d and would not \u201cgive away [his] personal liberties for nothing.\u201d Claimant described his demands for payment as an effort to \u201ccut out a negotiating position,\u201d an \u201copening position,\u201d to \u201cgive.....plenty of time to pedal\u201d and invite a \u201ccounter offer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also stated that he \u201cwanted to keep private\u201d his regular and lawful use of a prescription drug which \u201crelieves anxiety and allows [him] to work,\u201d although he understood that disclosure would not have resulted in discharge under the new rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Code \u00a7 60.2-618 provides that \u201c[a]n individual shall be disqualified for benefits\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if \u201csuch individual is unemployed because he has been discharged for misconduct connected with his work.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2). Misconduct contemplated by the statute occurs when an employee <em>\u201cdeliberately </em>violates a company rule reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of his employer,\u201d or manifests \u201ca <em>willful </em>disregard of those interests and the duties and obligations he owes his employer.\u201d <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Virginia Employment </em>Comm\u2019n, 219 Va. 609, 611, 249 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1978). Absent \u201ccircumstances in mitigation of such [mis] conduct, the employee is \u2018disqualified for benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 249 S.E.2d at 182. Although bound by the Commission\u2019s factual findings, we have previously held that \u201canalyzing an employee\u2019s behavior with the disqualification provisions of the statute is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Sutphin, </em>8 Va. App. 325, 327, 380 S.E.2d 667, 668 (1989); <em>see also Israel </em>v. <em>Virginia Employment </em>Comm\u2019n, 7 Va. App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988) .</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Manifestly, the \u201cpurpose of the Unemployment Compensation Act is \u2018to provide temporary financial assistance to [employees] who become unemployed through no fault of their own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Gantt, </em>7 Va. App. 631, 634, 376 S.E.2d 808, 810, <em>aff'd en banc, 9 </em>Va. App. 225, 385 S.E.2d 247 (1989) (quoting <em>Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Tomko, </em>192 Va. 463, 469, 65 S.E.2d 524, 528 (1951)). Consonant with this purpose, the \u201cemployer bears the burden of showing\u201d misconduct. <em>Barkley </em>v. <em>Peninsula Transp. Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Va. App. 317, 320, 398 S.E.2d 94, 95 (1990). However, \u201c[o]nce the employer has borne [this] burden . . . [it] shifts to the employee to prove circumstances in mitigation of his or her conduct.\u201d <em>Gantt, 1 </em>Va. App. at 635, 376 S.E.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The adoption of a rule by an employer \u201cdefines the specific behavior considered to harm or to further the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634, 376 S.E.2d at 811. Thus, <em>\"[b]y </em>definition,\u201d the rule establishes that conduct determined by the employer to be consistent with its legitimate business interests, and a deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>violation creates \u201ca prima facie case of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 376 S.E.2d at 811 (emphasis added). Absent evidence to \u201cexplain or justify\u201d such misconduct and \u201cshow mitigating circumstances, the commission must find that benefits are barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 376 S.E.2d at 811; <em>Robinson v. Hurst Harvey Oil, Inc., </em>12 Va. App. 936, 940, 407 S.E.2d 352, 354 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In the instant case, the opinion of the Commission recognizes that claimant was expected to unconditionally acknowledge the new drug policy as a part of his continued employment, that he \u201cdeclined\u201d to comply and was discharged. Nevertheless, the Commission found claimant \u201cqualified\u201d for benefits. Its opinion noted that \u201cevery employer has a legitimate business interest in trying to maintain a workplace . . . free from the dangers and distractions ... of alcohol and drugs,\u201d but the Extras policy was characterized as an \u201cunreasonable violation of [claimant\u2019s] right to privacy and the presumption of innocence,\u201d an \u201coverbroad rule which was being arbitrarily imposed without adequate notice.\u201d In this context, the Commission excused claimant\u2019s \u201cerror in judgment\u201d as an appropriate, but \u201cmisguided protest\u201d to an offensive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We agree with the trial court, however, that claimant\u2019s refusal to execute the required acknowledgment of the policy and his related conduct, and not the policy itself, is the dispositive issue in this case. Prior to his discharge, claimant only demanded compensation in exchange for compliance. Despite ample opportunity, he attempted no resolution with Extras of any privacy or other substantive issues. <em>See Lee, </em>1 Va. App. at 85, 335 S.E.2d at 106. Instead, he tried to bargain with Extras, evincing a mind obviously motivated by personal gain rather than constitutional concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">While we \u201cgive great deference to the expertise of the administrative agency\u201d in the resolution of factual issues, such \u201cspecialized competence\u201d is not indispensable to all disputes. <em>Robinson, </em>12 Va. App. at 940, 407 S.E.2d at 354. Further, the \u201cnature of the issue, legal or factual,\u201d or mixed, also affects \u201cthe degree of deference\u201d and \u201creviewing courts should not abdicate their judicial function\u201d to a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va. App. 231, 243-44, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">In this instance, we find that the evidence fails to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s misconduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>prompted and thus mitigated by any unreasonableness in Extras\u2019 drug policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without proper excuse, he refused to execute the acknowledgment in violation of a company rule and this constituted misconduct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court disqualifying claimant for benefits is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\"> Absenteeism, diminished employee performance, loss, theft and damage to property, quality control, customer relations and employees\u2019 safety and security were specific concerns expressed in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> The written policy was five and one-half pages in length, prohibited the presence of alcohol or drugs on Extras\u2019 property, any work-related activity while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and any criminal charges associated with drugs. It specifically required, <em>inter </em>alia, that employees submit to body fluid screenings for alcohol or drugs and searches of work areas, including.\u201cpersonal articles\u201d and vehicles on company property. Refusal to cooperate in the execution of the policy or a violation of its provisions subjected employees to \u201cdiscipline\u201d or \u201cdischarge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\"> Claimant attributed this posturing to his \u201cbackground in the Orient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em> </em>\u201c \u2018Benefits\u2019 means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this title [Title 60.2, Unemployment Compensation], with respect to his unemployment.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-11\"> We express no opinion with respect to the constitutional or other legal issues raised by provisions of the new drug policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b589-8\">Barrow, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">While acknowledging that the factual findings of the commission are conclusive and that judicial review at the trial or appellate level is confined to questions of law, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 60.2-625, the majority makes its own factual finding, in conflict with that of the commission, in order to affirm the trial court\u2019s reversal of the commission. The majority finds that Carter\u2019s initial attempt to obtain money for his compliance with the new drug policy evinces \u201ca mind obviously motivated by personal gain rather than constitutional concerns.\u201d The commission, on the other hand, found that Carter\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot an act of extortion; rather, it was basically a misguided protest of an overbroad rule which was being arbitrarily imposed without adequate notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The commission recognized that, while \u201cevery employer has a legitimate business interest in trying to maintain a work place which is free from the dangers and distractions caused by the abuse of alcohol and drugs,\u201d certain businesses are justified in imposing more stringent requirements than others. It explained that inherently dangerous occupations, such as those involving the manufacture of dangerous chemicals, the operation of dangerous machinery, the operation of motor vehicles, and other businesses whose work is \u201chighly visible to the public or sensitive in nature, such as . . . law enforcement or [those] requiring a security clearance,\u201d are businesses that can justify more stringent requirements. However, the commission found that the work of this employer did not justify the stringent requirements \u2014 random searches and drug testing \u2014 of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Undoubtedly, an employer has the right to impose rules intended to deter the use of drugs and alcohol at the work place. That, however, is not the question in this case. Rather, the question is under what circumstances may an employee be denied unemployment benefits after being discharged for declining to accept the new conditions of his employment. If his refusal constitutes misconduct, he bears the full financial burden of such refusal. If his refusal does not constitute misconduct, unemployment compensation benefits must be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The commission found that the employer\u2019s new drug policy, while permissible, was not required by the nature of its business. This conclusion was reasonable and within the commission\u2019s authority. Consequently, the commission found that Carter\u2019s refusal to comply with the new policy was not misconduct, but only \u201ca misguided protest of an overbroad rule which was being arbitrarily imposed without adequate notice.\u201d In my opinion, the trial court, and now this court, have erred in superimposing their judgment over that of the commission. I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
