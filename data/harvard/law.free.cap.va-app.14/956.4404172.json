Moten, the appellant, was found guilty by a jury of possession of cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and distribution of cocaine within one thousand feet of a school zone. On appeal, Moten contends that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse a juror for cause. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">During jury selection, defense counsel asked the venire whether the allegations of possession and distribution of cocaine caused a problem with anyone. He asked,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">Does that particular subject matter cause a problem with a juror based upon a \u2014 some like experience either they, or relative, or a close friend may have had, such as they will not be able to listen to this case and decide this case based solely upon the evidence. . .?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">Ms. McCarthy, a venireman, gave an inaudible response, and defense counsel moved that she be excused for cause. The court inquired into Ms. McCarthy\u2019s response and she explained that her husband was a recovering drug addict and that the subject of drugs was very \u201ctouchy\u201d with her. When asked if she could keep an open mind, she said she could try. Defense counsel then asked, \u201cI would like to ask if you feel that the drug history might make it difficult to set aside your personal feelings and work just totally upon the evidence?\u201d She responded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Finally, the court asked, \u201cCan you stand indifferent?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to strike this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">On appeal, Moten contends that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse juror McCarthy for cause, because the totality of her voir dire examination revealed that she could not stand indifferent in the case. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-6\">An accused has a fundamental right to a trial by an impartial jury. U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. To qualify as a juror, a venireman must \u201cstand indifferent in the cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358, and any reasonable doubt regarding his impartiality must be resolved in favor of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\"><em>Barker v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 374, 337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985) (citations omitted). Moten was entitled to be tried by jurors who did not have \u201cany reason to believe [they] might not give a fair and impartial trial to the Commonwealth and the accused based solely on the law and the evidence.\u201d Rule 3A: 14(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">On appeal, we give deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude a venireman, because the trial court \u201csees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 246, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391 (1990). A trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a showing of manifest error. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe standard to be applied by the trial court in determining whether to retain a venireman on the jury panel is whether his answers during <em>voir dire </em>examination indicate to the court something that would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Id. See also Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 220, 223, 397 S.E.2d 539, 540 (1990). Where there is reasonable doubt whether a juror is qualified, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused. <em>See Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 208, 415 S.E.2d 856 (1992). In determining whether a juror is free from prejudice, nothing should be left to inference or doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 415 S.E.2d at 859. Ms. McCarthy\u2019s responses clearly indicated to the court that due to her husband\u2019s drug problem, her performance as a juror might be impaired by her personal feelings regarding drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">The Commonwealth argues that a juror\u2019s responses during voir dire should be considered as a whole rather than as individual re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>marks. <em>See Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 548, 364 S.E.2d 483, 486, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988). The Commonwealth contends that the totality of Ms. McCarthy\u2019s responses reveals that she concluded ultimately that she could stand indifferent in the trial. We disagree. Ms. McCarthy stated that her husband was a recovering drug addict. When asked if she could keep an open mind, she responded, \u201cI can try.\u201d When the defense counsel asked if she could put her personal feelings aside she responded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d The court then asked \u201cCan you stand indifferent?\u201d to which she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Viewed as a whole, these statements make clear that Ms. McCarthy was unsure whether she could stand impartial. She should have been excluded from the jury for cause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">Using or permitting the use of leading questions, those which suggest a desired answer, in the <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror may taint the reliability of the juror\u2019s responses. Merely giving \u201cexpected answers to leading questions\u201d does not rehabilitate a prospective juror. Proof of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality \u201cshould come from him and not be based on his mere assent to persuasive suggestions.\u201d When asked by the court, a suggestive question produces an even more unreliable response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\"><em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 237, 242, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and this case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Duff, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
