Defendant denied the charge and, on appeal, contends that (1) the original certificate of analysis (certificate) was not \u201con file with the Clerk\u2019s office seven days immediately prior to trial\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187 and, thus, a photocopy of the certificate was improperly admitted into evidence, and (2) the trial court erred in refusing evidence of defendant\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity and for \u201cnot using drugs.\u201d We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">The record discloses that police officers observed defendant \u201ccrouched down\u201d on the passenger side of a pickup truck, holding a can in his hand, and \u201clighting\u201d and smoking \u201cwhat was ... on the can.\u201d Defendant was seen passing the can to the driver, who did \u201cthe same thing.\u201d The officers then approached the vehicle, removed its occupants, and discovered a \u201cbeer can . . . shaped into a crack pipe\u201d \u201cunder the seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>The original certificate, which identified a residue in the can as cocaine, was filed with the clerk of the trial court on January 23, 1990, and defendant was advised of the filing at his preliminary hearing on April 3, 1990. This certificate, however, was destroyed by a fire at the courthouse on May 22, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">When the Commonwealth offered a photocopy of the certificate into evidence at defendant\u2019s subsequent trial, he objected, complaining that, although previously provided a copy, he had \u201cnever been given access to the original certificate.\u201d The court, noting that \u201cthe original was available for public inspection from January 23, 1990, until approximately May 22, 1990,\u201d overruled the objection and received the photocopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Defendant, a corporal in the United States Marine Corps, called his superior officer, Master Sergeant Willis Frazer, Jr., as a witness and defense counsel questioned Frazer on defendant\u2019s \u201creputation for truthfulness.\u201d Before Frazer responded, however, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>made several inquiries of the witness relating to his sources of information in the preparation of \u201cfitness reports.\u201d When Frazer explained that he relied on both his \u201cown\u201d judgment and that of \u201cothers,\u201d the trial judge declared that, \u201cNo witness can say that another witness is either truthful or untruthful. That\u2019s for the jury.\u201d Defense counsel did not pursue this issue further and proffered no evidence for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Counsel next asked Frazer to specifically relate defendant\u2019s \u201creputation regarding the use of drugs,\u201d explaining that he was \u201ctrying to establish [defendant\u2019s] character as not using drugs.\u201d The trial judge again interrupted and refused to permit the witness to express an \u201copinion as to whether the man (defendant) was or was not using a certain substance on a certain date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">We turn first to defendant\u2019s contention that Code \u00a7 19.2-187 mandates that the original certificate be lodged in the clerk\u2019s office \u201cwithin the seven days prior\u201d to trial. Although we must \u201cconstrue Code \u00a7 19.2-187 strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused,\u201d the \u201cstatute only requires that the certificate be <em>filed.\" Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 156, 158, 403 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1991) (emphasis added). \u201cThe first paragraph of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 sets forth a specific statement of admissibility of certificates of laboratory analysis subject to provisos expressly stated and numbered (i) and (ii). When those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>provisos are satisfied, the statement of admissibility is complete, and a certificate thus qualified is properly received into evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 550, 552, 399 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">This Court has recognized that the purpose of the statute \u201cis to ensure that the certificate ... is lodged timely in a secure and appropriate place, accessible to the accused, and available to him upon request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no indication that the legislature intended that the filing requirements of the statute relate only to the seven consecutive days immediately preceding a hearing or trial. <em>See Mullins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App 372, 373, 404 S.E.2d 237, 238 (1991); <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 657, 664, 353 S.E.2d 162, 166 (1987). As the trial judge observed, the certificate was filed and available to the defendant from January 23, 1990, until its destruction on May 22, 1990, \u201cat least seven days prior to . . . trial.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-187. Thus, the conditions of the statute were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Defendant next argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-187 references only the original certificate, and the trial court erred in admitting the photocopy. This Court considered \u201cwhether a copy of the certificate of analysis qualifies as an original\u201d in <em>Myrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 333, 338, 412 S.E.2d 176, 179 (1991). Myrick complained that \u201cthe filing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 had not been met because the certificate filed with the trial court was a copy and not the original.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 412 S.E.2d at 177. We addressed this objection as \u201ca \u2018best evidence\u2019 question,\u201d and noted that the best evidence rule requires that, to prove the contents of a document, the \u201coriginal must be produced unless it be shown that the original is unavailable, in which case secondary evidence may be introduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 412 S.E.2d at 179; <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 816, 133 S.E. 764, 769 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">In the instant case, the original certificate was clearly \u201cunavailable\u201d and, like Myrick, defendant did not contend that \u201cthe copy was not an accurate photocopy or was not a replica of the original,\u201d or make any \u201cassertion . . . that the photocopy contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>any omissions, additions, deletions or inaccuracies.\u201d <em>Myrick, </em>13 Va. App. at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 179. He complained only that there had been no \u201caccess to the original.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 179. Moreover, an officer involved in the investigation testified that he had seen the original certificate and filed it himself with the \u201cclerk\u2019s office\u201d and identified the photocopy as \u201cthe certificate of analysis\u201d that related to defendant\u2019s prosecution. Under such circumstances, the best evidence rule was satisfied and the trial court did not err in admitting the photocopy in lieu of the original certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">We next address defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in declining to admit evidence of his \u201creputation for truthfulness.\u201d \u201cWhen . . . evidence is rejected, it is incumbent upon the proponent of the evidence to make a proffer of the expected answer.\u201d <em>Speller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 437, 440, 345 S.E.2d 542, 545 (1986). An \u201cappellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977). As the record now before the Court does not reflect a proffer by defendant of the excluded testimony, we are precluded from a consideration of this issue on appeal. <em>See O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 697, 364 S.E.2d 491, 505 (1988); <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 108, 341 S.E.2d 190, 194 (1986); <em>Speller, 2 </em>Va. App. at 440, 345 S.E.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Lastly, defendant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of his reputation for \u201cnot using drugs.\u201d It is well established that a criminal defendant has the right to introduce evidence of his good character \u201con the theory that it is improbable that a person who bears a good reputation would be likely to commit the crime charged against him.\u201d <em>Zirkle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 871, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, a defendant may not prove \u201cgood reputation\u201d through evidence of \u201cspecific acts, custom or course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id.; Fields v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 300, 306, 343 S.E.2d 379, 383 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>This Court recently examined such evidence in <em>Chiles </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 12 Va. App. 698, 406 S.E.2d 413 (1991). There, the trial court had \u201crefused to allow [Chiles\u2019 witnesses] to answer whether they had \u2018ever heard anyone say that Chiles deals drugs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699, 406 S.E.2d at 414. We acknowledged that a witness may testify \u201cto the reputation of the accused for possessing traits . . . related to the crime charged,\u201d as evidence of the \u201c \u2018consensus of opinion of the people of the community,\u2019 which is created by the <em>\u2018sum </em>total\u2019 of [the accused\u2019s] specific acts, custom, and conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 406 S.E.2d at 414 (quoting <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29) (emphasis added). However, testimony of Chiles\u2019 reputation for \u201cdealing] drugs\u201d improperly invited evidence of \u201cspecific acts, customs, or course of conduct,\u201d behavior that may have only been a part of the sum total of his reputation and, thus, was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>Defendant\u2019s reputation for \u201cnot using drugs\u201d contemplated similar evidence and was correctly refused by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Moon, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cprovided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered ... to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial upon request of such counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\"> The record discloses that defendant requested the clerk to provide a copy of the certificate pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187, and he does not argue noncompliance. <em>See Mullins, </em>12 Va. App. at 374, 404 S.E.2d at 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\"> In legal \u201cparlance,\u201d character and reputation are often used interchangeably, but \u201ccharacter is what one really is; reputation is what others believe him to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29 (quoting Henry Ward Beecher).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
