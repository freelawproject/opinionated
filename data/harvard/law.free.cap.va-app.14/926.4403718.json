The defendant contends that, while he is guilty of one of the offenses, conviction of the other is barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294. We conclude that, because conviction for each offense was based on acts separate and distinct from those involved in the other offense, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not apply. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The charges against the defendant arose out of a traffic stop. A Henrico County police officer stopped the defendant and issued him a summons for driving on defective tires and for failing to have a front license plate. The officer told the defendant that his automobile was unsafe and that he would have to park it. The defendant responded by telling the officer that he could not tell him what to do, ran back to his vehicle, and drove away. When he left, he accelerated so quickly that his automobile left sixty to seventy feet of tire marks on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">A high speed chase followed. The officer, using his siren and blue lights, followed the defendant at speeds of sixty to seventy miles per hour in a posted thirty-five mile per hour speed zone. Finally, the defendant drove through a red stop signal and into a supermarket parking lot where he' drove through the lot at speeds of thirty to forty miles per hour. Upon apprehending the defendant, the officer charged him with eluding a police officer and reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant is barred under Rule 5A:18 from asserting on appeal that the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bar his conviction of both offenses. At trial, the defendant moved to strike the evidence of the two offenses or, \u201cin the alternative, requested that the court merge the two offenses into one violation.\u201d In this appeal, the defendant, while not referring to Code \u00a7 19.2-294 in his brief, argued that the trial court impermissibly convicted him of reckless driving and eluding a police officer based on the same act.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Rule 5A:18, a codification of the contemporaneous objection rule, prohibits a ruling of a trial court from being the basis of a reversal unless an objection is stated \u201ctogether with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to obtain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18. The goal of this rule is \u201cto avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials by allowing the trial judge to intelligently consider an issue and, if necessary, to take corrective action.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, (1991) (en banc). Judicial economy is the product of Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The contemporaneous objection rule requires only that a party inform the trial court of the action it wishes the court to take or its objection to the action of the court and the \u201cgrounds therefor.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-384; <em>see also </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. at 480, 405 S.E.2d at 2. This rule does not prohibit reliance on statutes or cases not presented to the trial court to support, on appeal, a position otherwise adequately presented at trial. R. Martineau, <em>Modem Appellate Practice </em>\u00a7 3.8 (1983). Nor does it prevent this court, on its own initiative, from relying on statutory or judicial authority that was not presented to the trial court or referred to in the briefs submitted by the parties. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 3.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">At trial, the defendant requested the court to \u201cmerge the two offenses into one violation.\u201d Merger, a common law principle, recognizes that certain offenses arising from the same occurrence may merge into a single offense. <em>See Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 643 (1946). For example, \u201csimple assault is ordinarily held to merge into the offense of assault with a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 686 (1980); <em>Spickard </em>v. <em>City of Lynchburg, </em>174 Va. 502, 505, 6 S.E.2d 610, 611 (1940) (reckless driving does not merge with driving while intoxicated); <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 265, 272, 343 S.E.2d 465, 470 (1986) (Wharton\u2019s Rule not a \u201cmerger\u201d rule). Similarly, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bars prosecution of one offense by virtue of a conviction of another offense based on the same act. Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 performs a similar function statutorily that merger does at common law. <em>Cf. Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 1, 8-9, 406 S.E. 2d 15, 18-19 (Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not apply to common law offenses), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 S. Ct. 388 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Consequently, the contemporaneous objection rule does not prevent us from considering the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 in determining if the defendant\u2019s conviction of reckless driving bars his conviction of eluding a police officer. Therefore, we will address the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">If the \u201csame act\u201d is a violation of two or more statutes, conviction under one of the statutes is \u201ca bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-294.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This prohibition is dependent upon \u201cthe identity of the <em>act.\" Jones v. Common</em>wealth, 218 Va. 757, 760, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661 (larceny of an automobile in which to escape from robbery is not \u201csame act\u201d as robbery), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 (1978). If the statutory violations involve different acts, the prohibition is not applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 761, 240 S.E.2d at 661. The prohibition only \u201cforbids multiple prosecution of offenses springing from the <em>same </em>criminal act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if two offenses involve \u201ctwo separate and distinct acts,\u201d conviction of one does not bar a prosecution for the other. <em>Id:, Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 625, 628, 401 S.E.2d 208, 210-11, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>13 Va. App. 281, 411 S.E.2d 228 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Code \u00a7 19.2-294 are different. Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 provides that if a person is charged with driving while intoxicated and reckless driving, both \u201cgrowing out of the same act or acts,\u201d a conviction of one of the charges requires dismissal of the remaining charge. This provision deals only with the offenses of driving while intoxicated and reckless driving; it applies to no other criminal offenses. <em>Id. </em>This statute is applicable where these two offenses grow \u201cout of the same act or acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he same act or acts\u201d means the act \u201cof driving\u201d and contemplates \u201ca continuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>vehicle.\u201d <em>Padgett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 758, 761, 263 S.E.2d 388, 389-90 (1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294, on the other hand, applies to violation of any two or more statutes, not just driving while intoxicated and reckless driving. It is applicable only if \u201cthe same act\u201d is a violation of two or more statutes, not to offenses \u201cgrowing out of the same act or acts.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-294. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not contemplate \u201ca continuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-294; <em>see also Fitzgerald, </em>11 Va. App. at 629, 401 S.E.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, enacted after Code \u00a7 19.2-294, does not mimic Code \u00a7 19.2-294. It effects a different purpose. Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 prohibits conviction of both driving while intoxicated and reckless driving growing out of the \u201csame act or acts,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted course\u201d of operating a motor vehicle; Code \u00a7 19.2-294 prohibits the prosecution of a criminal offense after one has been convicted of another offense arising from the \u201csame act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In this case, at least two separate and distinct acts supported the two different offenses with which the defendant was charged and convicted. The manner in which the defendant drove away from the police officer and the manner in which he drove through the red traffic signal and through the supermarket parking lot were acts upon which the charge of reckless driving could have been based. The defendant\u2019s failure to stop in response to the police officer\u2019s flashing light and siren after he drove away and before he reached the supermarket intersection was a separate and distinct act upon which the offense of eluding a police officer was based. Therefore, because two or more separate and distinct acts constituted two or more offenses, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is not a bar to the prosecution of either offense. Having so concluded, we need not address whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applies to multiple convictions in a single trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The convictions are, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Coleman, J., Duff, J., Moon, J., Willis, J., Elder, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\"> The decision of the panel is reported at 13 Va.

The majority concludes, however, that Lash committed \u201cat least two separate and distinct acts\u201d which constituted two statutory offenses and, thus, that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is not a bar to the convictions for both offenses. In my view, to reach this conclusion the majority has focused on the elements of the offenses charged against Lash rather than on the \u201cact\u201d or conduct of Lash. Because, on the facts of this particular case, this approach defeats the plain meaning and intent of Code \u00a7 19.2-294, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">In the original panel decision in this case, reported <em>Lash </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 251, 410 S.E.2d 689 (1991), I reviewed the legislative history of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-294 and 19.2-294.1 and the principal prior cases that have interpreted and applied these Code sections. I will not repeat that review here. However, because the majority compares and distinguishes these Code sections and, specifically, holds that \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-294 does not contemplate \u2018a continuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor vehicle\u2019 \u201d as the basis for its conclusion that this Code section is not applicable to this case, I will emphasize here a portion of my prior discussion. In doing so, I contend that the proper analysis of a Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claim requires that a court focus on the \u201cact\u201d or conduct of the accused as established by the facts, rather than on the elements of the offenses charged against the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The General Assembly enacted the original version of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 in response to the decision in <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>87 Va. 96, 12 S.E. 224 (1890). There, the Supreme Court upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction for the sale of ardent spirits without a license following her prior conviction for the sale of the identical ardent spirits on Sunday. The Court acknowledged that only one act \u2014 the sale of ardent spirits \u2014 was involved, but concluded that one act violated two separate statutes. After a subsequent amendment not pertinent to the present appeal, Code \u00a7 19.2- 294 now provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, . . . conviction under one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 69 S.E.2d 336 (1952), the Court held that the predecessor to Code \u00a7 19.2-294 was not a bar to convictions for driving while under the influence of intoxicants and reckless driving arising from one occurrence of driving. In <em>Hundley, </em>the defendant was driving while intoxicated and drove his vehicle at excessive speeds around curves and in such a manner as to endanger the police officer who was attempting to stop him. The Court found that this evidence disclosed two separate acts resulting in the commission of two separate offenses and, consequently, the statute was not applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 69 S.E.2d at 337. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-6\">It is conceivable for a person under the influence of intoxicants to drive properly. Many people not under the influence of intoxicants drive recklessly. A test of the identity of <em>acts or offenses </em>is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them; if not, then the fact that several charges relate to and grow out of one transaction or occurrence does not make a single <em>act or offense </em>where two separate <em>acts or offenses are defined by statute, </em>as in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Subsequent to the <em>Hundley </em>decision and apparently in response to it, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever any person is charged with [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] and reckless driving growing out of the same act or acts and is convicted of one of these charges, the court shall dismiss the remaining charge.\u201d To the extent the <em>Hundley </em>decision contains language which refers to \u201cwhere two separate <em>acts or offenses </em>are <em>defined by statute\u2019'\u2019 </em>there is a blurring of \u201cacts\u201d with \u201coffenses\u201d because \u201cacts\u201d are not defined by the statute. <em>See </em>195 Va. at 451, 69 S.E.2d at 337 (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, however, resolves any questions left unclear by <em>Hundley. </em>This Code section recognizes that driving under the influence and reckless driving are separate offenses and expands its bar past that of Code.\u00a7 19.2-294 to include \u201cact or acts\u201d rather than only the \u201csame act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>In <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 23, 181 S.E.2d 622 (1971), the Court held that the predecessor to Code \u00a7 19.2-294 was not a bar to convictions for driving under the influence and driving on a suspended license arising from the same occurrence of driving. The Court found that the defendant\u2019s driving constituted separate acts that supported his convictions of separate offenses because he could be convicted of driving under the influence without evidence of the suspension of his license and vice versa. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 181 S.E.2d at 624. Implicit in the Court\u2019s analysis is a focus on the elements of the offenses charged rather than the act or conduct of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Standing alone, <em>Estes </em>supports the elements of the offenses analysis adopted by the majority in the present case. However, in <em>Padgett, </em>decided subsequent to <em>Estes, </em>the Court held that the language, \u201csame act or acts,\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 means \u201cthe same act or acts of driving\u201d and contemplates \u201ca continuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Padgett, </em>220 Va. at 761, 263 S.E.2d at 389-90. In that case, the defendant was charged with reckless driving in Lynchburg and driving while intoxicated in Bedford following a high speed chase by the police which began in the former jurisdiction and ended in the latter. The Court held that the defendant\u2019s conviction for the Lynchburg offense was a bar to his subsequent conviction for the Bedford offense. Significantly, the Court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that because the Lynchburg reckless driving charge required proof of venue different from the venue required to sustain the Bedford driving while intoxicated charge, the two charges did not grow out of the \u201csame act.\u201d Moreover, the Court acknowledged that under a constitutional double jeopardy claim, both convictions would stand because the Lynchburg charge could have been established without proof that the defendant was intoxicated and the Bedford charge could have been sustained without proof that the defendant drove recklessly. <em>Cf. Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932); <em>see also Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\"><em>Hundley </em>and <em>Estes </em>illustrate the particular difficulty in applying Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to cases in which the \u201cact\u201d involved is the operation of a motor vehicle. Obviously, the act of driving a motor vehicle inherently involves the movement of the vehicle in terms of time and space and affords the possibility of multiple offenses oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>curring in that process. Thus, in the present case, the majority is able, as with an imaginary stop watch and high speed camera, to isolate portions of Lash\u2019s act of driving into separate acts such as \u201c[1] the manner in which he drove away from the officer, and [2] the manner in which he drove through the red traffic signal and [3] through the supermarket\u201d to support a reckless driving charge and also Lash\u2019s \u201c[4] failure to stop in response to the police officer\u2019s flashing light and siren\u201d during that process to support the offense of eluding a police officer. The majority has focused on particular parts of Lash\u2019s continuous and uninterrupted act of driving and determined that these support separate offenses. Factually, however, Lash\u2019s conduct is not divisible into distinct separate acts of driving. The majority then essentially applies the traditional double jeopardy claim test of whether one offense requires proof of a fact which another offense does not require. Under that test, Lash could be convicted of reckless driving without proof that he eluded a police officer and he could be convicted of eluding a police officer without proof that he drove recklessly. However, this is not the test applicable to a Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claim. Our Supreme Court in <em>Jones </em>v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 (1978), clearly distinguished the analysis applicable to constitutional double jeopardy claims from the analysis applicable to Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claims. There, both claims were asserted. The Court upheld the defendant\u2019s convictions of robbery involving larceny of money and grand larceny of an automobile involving the same victim and arising from one incident at a motel. The Court stated: \u201c[I]f the offenses are different and one is not lesser-included in the other, the constitutional guarantee [established in <em>Blockburger] </em>does not apply. If the acts are different, the statutory mandate [of Code \u00a7 19.2-294] does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760-61, 240 S.E.2d at 661 (citations omitted). <em>Accord Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va. App. 359, 365, 388 S.E.2d <em>277, </em>280 (1990)(holding that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 \u201cspeaks to \u2018acts\u2019 of the accused, not elements of the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The present appeal illustrates that the distinction between the constitutional claim analysis and the statutory claim analysis may be critical to the proper determination of a Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claim on the facts of a particular case. In my view, <em>Jones </em>and <em>Padgett </em>provide the guidance for the proper resolution of Lash\u2019s statutory claim. <em>Jones, </em>decided after <em>Estes, </em>unequivocally requires an analysis of the act or conduct of the accused to determine the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>a Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claim. Thus, <em>Jones </em>has, at least implicitly, overruled <em>Estes, </em>which used an element of the offense analysis in a Code \u00a7 19.2-294 claim. <em>Padgett </em>is consistent with <em>Jones. </em>Moreover, while <em>Padgett </em>involved a Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 claim, I find no reason to distinguish its analysis of \u201cthe same act or acts\u201d language of that Code section from the analysis of \u201cthe same act\u201d language of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. Certainly nothing in the legislative history or the language of either statute suggests a distinction. For these reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-294 does not contemplate \u2018a continuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d When the act or conduct of Lash is viewed with the <em>Jones </em>and <em>Padgett </em>focus, it amounts to a single, continuous and unaltered act of dangerous driving in defiance of Officer Count\u2019s command to park the car. Despite the fact that Officer Counts pursued Lash with his siren and blue lights in operation, Lash\u2019s conduct remained continuous and unaltered. Though Lash\u2019s conduct amounts to both reckless driving and eluding a police officer, his conduct giving rise to both offenses flowed from the \u201csame act\u201d and, therefore, can support only one conviction in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">I do not suggest that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 affords a blanket bar to multiple convictions where one occurrence of driving a motor vehicle is involved. The determination of whether the conduct of an accused amounts to \u201cthe same act\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is a factual determination and will rest upon the facts of a particular case. In my view, the facts of the present case suggest only one \u201cact\u201d of driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Although the majority does not reach the issue of whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applies to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial, in my view, that is the dispositive issue in Lash\u2019s case. For the reasons that I have expressed in the panel opinion, <em>Lash, </em>13 Va. App. at 259-61, 410 S.E.2d at 694-95, I would hold that this Code section applies to multiple convictions obtained in a single trial as well as to multiple convictions obtained in consecutive trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision below and remand the case with directions that the trial court impose sentence in only one of the two convictions and dismiss the other.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
