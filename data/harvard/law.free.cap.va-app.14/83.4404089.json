He was sentenced in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict to forty years in the penitentiary and fined $50,000 for each count. He contends that the trial court erred in failing to sustain his objection to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper rebuttal argument and in failing to set aside the verdict and grant him a new trial. Because Moore\u2019s counsel failed to move for a mistrial or request a cautionary jury instruction, we hold that Moore is procedurally barred from challenging on appeal whether the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">During rebuttal argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cYou hear people say, \u2018What can I do about drugs in Martinsville.\u2019 Ladies and Gentlemen, you have the power to do something in these cases today. The focus is on you. I\u2019ve done my job, now it\u2019s up to you to do your job. Thank you.\u201d Immediately, defense counsel stated, \u201cI\u2019ve got an objection. I know he\u2019s sat down. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt him mid-sentence. But the last statement . . . .\u201d The court overruled counsel\u2019s \u201cmotion.\u201d The jury retired and returned with a verdict, convicting Moore. Defense counsel moved to set aside the verdict \u201cas being influenced by the remarks of the prosecutor, to which I made an objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The Commonwealth contends that Moore is procedurally barred from challenging on appeal the propriety of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks because he failed to move for a mistrial or request a cautionary instruction to the jury. Moore\u2019s counsel contends that the issue should not be procedurally barred, arguing that the purposes of Rule 5A:18 were met because he timely objected to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and the trial court had the opportunity to consider and rule on the issue. He argues that to require counsel to move for a mistrial or request a cautionary instruction after the trial court has ruled that the argument was proper and not objectionable would be folly, would be an exercise .in form over substance, and would probably invite the ire of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The applicable rule of law is clear. Bound by principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>we are required to apply that rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">It is well-settled that errors assigned because of a prosecutor\u2019s alleged improper comments or conduct during argument will not be considered on appeal unless an accused timely moves for a cautionary instruction or for a mistrial. The motions must be made timely if the accused desires to take advantage of his objection on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 38, 393 S.E.2d 599, 605-06 (1990). <em>See also Martinez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 557, 559 n.2, 403 S.E.2d 358, 359 n.2 (1991). Even though Moore\u2019s counsel objected to the purportedly improper remarks of the prosecutor, he did not timely move for a mistrial or request a cautionary instruction to the jury. Consequently, Moore is procedurally barred from contesting on appeal whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Moore\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Koontz, C.J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
