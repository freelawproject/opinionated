Harris, Assistant Attorney General (Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b197-9\">ELDER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0P\">Dana Lynn Flaherty, appellant, appeals from a final order of the Circuit Court of Clarke County adjudicating her an habitual offender, revoking her privilege to operate a motor vehicle for ten years, and ordering her to surrender her operator\u2019s license. On appeal, she asserts: (1) that a 1985 conviction for driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.15 percent or more by weight by volume, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i), should not be considered a qualifying conviction for habitual offender status under Code \u00a7 46.2-351; and (2) that a 1983 conviction was for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-388 and should not be considered a qualifying conviction for habitual offender status under Code \u00a7 46.2-351. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Appellant\u2019s 1983 conviction was pursuant to a warrant charging her with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-388 (the \u201cdrunk in public statute\u201d) and not Code \u00a7 18.2-266 (the \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d statute). Although the warrant cited Code \u00a7 18.2-388, the description of the offense was \u201coperate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d The trial court marked this warrant \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d The 1985 conviction was pursuant to a warrant charging appellant with driving while her blood alcohol concentration was by weight by volume 0.15% or more, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i), which was in effect at the time of the offense in December 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">At trial, appellant argued that Code \u00a7 46.2-351, being penal in nature and effect, should be strictly construed. Consequently, she asserted, neither the 1983 nor the 1985 conviction fell within its requirements. The court ruled that the habitual offender statute was remedial in nature and thus should be construed broadly. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>court found that both the 1983 and 1985 convictions counted toward appellant\u2019s habitual offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-351 details the requirements for finding a person an habitual offender. A court must determine that a person has accrued on his driving record:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Three or more convictions . . . singularly or in combination, of the following separate offenses arising out of separate acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">b. Driving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs in violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or subsection A of \u00a7 46.2-341.24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Appellant\u2019s position with regard to her 1985 conviction is that Code \u00a7 46.2-351 does not include violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) as predicate convictions for a finding of habitual offender status. Her argument is based on the contention that Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) is distinguishable from the balance of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 both because the elements that go to prove a violation of it set it apart and because the critical phrase \u201cunder the influence\u201d is missing from its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">This Court discussed the nature of inquiries under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) in <em>Davis v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 291, 381 S.E.2d 11 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">[T]he inquiry under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) is not whether a driver was in fact \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d to a degree that his ability to drive safely was affected; rather, the issue is whether <em>at the time he was driving </em>his blood alcohol concentration was at least .10 percent as measured by a subsequently administered chemical test. It is for this reason that subsection (i) and similar statutes in our sister states have come to be known as \u201cper se\u201d statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 298, 381 S.E.2d at 15 (emphasis in original). Appellant suggests that, because a defendant could possibly prove that he or she was not driving under so great an influence of alcohol that his or her driving ability was affected and yet still be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i), a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>be considered a predicate conviction for purposes of the habitual offender statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Appellant correctly cites to <em>Hoye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 12 </em>Va. App. 587, 405 S.E.2d 628 (1991), for the proposition that, although an habitual offender adjudication brought pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-351 \u201cis a civil proceeding, its effect is to impose a forfeiture. Therefore, the operative statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 405 S.E.2d at 629. Construing the statute strictly against the Commonwealth, appellant argues, this Court must reject a conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) as a predicate conviction for a finding of habitual offender status, because Code \u00a7 46.2-351 requires a violation for driving \u201cunder the influence.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) does not proscribe driving \u201cunder the influence;\u201d rather, it proscribes driving with \u201ca blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266(ii)-(iv), on the other hand, all proscribe driving \u201cunder the influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We believe that appellant\u2019s argument ignores the plain language of Code \u00a7 46.2-351, the provision defining an \u201chabitual offender.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1) lists the types of convictions which, when numbering three or more, justify a finding of habitual offender status. Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1 )(b) describes one such conviction as being for \u201c[d] riving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs in violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or subsection A of \u00a7 46.2-341.24.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-351 (1)(b) does not describe such a conviction as being for driving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs in violation of <em>Code \u00a7 18.2-266 except for subsection(i).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We do not believe the legislature intended the result urged by appellant. It is unreasonable to assume the General Assembly intended courts to exclude the offense described in Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) when applying Code \u00a7 46.2-351 (l)(b). While this Court has a duty to interpret Code \u00a7 46.2-351 strictly against the Commonwealth, that duty does not require this Court to ignore the legislative intent that inspired Code \u00a7 46.2-351 (1 )(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Our reading of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 is based on more than a fair-minded reading of the statute and the obvious legislative intent that inspired it. In October 1985, approximately one year after the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-266 to include sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>section (i), the Attorney General concluded that the predecessor to Code \u00a7 46.2-351 \u201cshould be read to include a conviction of any offense in violation of \u00a7 18.2-266,\u201d and that \u201ca conviction for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266(i) may be used as one of the three convictions required to bring an-individual within the definition of an habitual offender.\u201d 1985-86 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 204-05 (1985). Subsequent to this 1985 opinion, the General Assembly amended the Habitual Offender Act in 1989, Acts 1989 cc. 705, 727, without altering the Attorney General\u2019s construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">The legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statutes, and its failure to make corrective amendments evinces legislative acquiescence in the Attorney General\u2019s view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\"><em>Deal &amp; Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 618, 622, 299 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1983)(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We hold, therefore, that a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i) is a predicate conviction to a finding of habitual offender status under Code \u00a7 46.2-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">With respect to her 1983 conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-388, appellant correctly asserts that a conviction for Code \u00a7 18.2-388 lies outside the purview of Code \u00a7 46.2-351. However, appellant is incorrect in arguing that her 1983 conviction, allegedly for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-388, may not stand as a predicate conviction to the trial court\u2019s determination that she is an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The warrant with which appellant was charged in 1983 incorrectly cited the code section at issue as Code \u00a7 18.2-388, which goes to public drunkenness. However, the incorrect citation of a Code section in a warrant does not control determination of what offense was charged when the defendant plainly had notice of the true nature of the charge against him or her. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 514, 516-17, 365 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1988). Here, not only was the description of the actual offense in the warrant correct (\u201cOperate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol\u201d), but the summons involved in the 1983 conviction accurately identified the statute at issue as Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Appellant had sufficient notice of the actual crime with which she was charged notwithstanding the misrecital of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ute in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The court\u2019s disposition of the 1983 case merely adds further proof that appellant was not convicted of public drunkenness, a Class four misdemeanor punishable by no more than a $100 fine. Appellant was fined $200 and her license was suspended pending completion of ASAP, punishments that clearly follow a driving while intoxicated conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The record leaves no room for doubt that appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in 1983. The trial court\u2019s ruling that the 1983 conviction was for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 is supported by the record, and we will not disturb it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In light of the foregoing analysis, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Bray, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
