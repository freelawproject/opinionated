Baugh (defendant) was convicted in the circuit court of criminal contempt in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to ten days in jail. He contends that (1) the admission into evidence of a certificate prepared by the general district court judge, which detailed the circumstances of the offense, violated his constitutional right of confrontation and his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo, </em>(2) the trial court- improperly denied his right to a trial by jury, and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Defendant, an attorney, had been appointed in the general district court (district court) to defend George Gonzalas (Gonzalas) on a charge of petit larceny. During defendant\u2019s cross-examination of a witness at trial, someone in the courtroom whispered, \u201cObject, he\u2019s badgering.\u201d Perhaps in response to this prompt, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney objected and was sustained by the district court judge. Defendant then \u201cturned his back on the Court\u201d and remarked that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know that the court read lips\u201d and \u201cwe have the audience to thank for the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The trial proceeded and defendant requested that Gonzalas be permitted to place the wine bottles subject of the larceny into his pants to disprove testimony that the pants could accommodate both the bottles and Gonzalas. When the district court judge denied the motion, defendant suggested that the demonstration be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>conducted with Gonzalas handcuffed so he could not \u201churt\u201d the court, but this request was also refused. Defendant then argued that he was \u201cbeing deprived of his ability to represent his client;\u201d however, the court noted that \u201cit had ruled\u201d and instructed defendant to \u201cmove along.\u201d Instead, defendant asked leave to withdraw from the case and his motion was granted. Immediately following this ruling, defendant commented to the district court judge, \u201cGood, now you can appoint somebody that will plead him guilty,\u201d and the court found him in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Defendant appealed the conviction to the circuit court and, in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-459, a \u201ccertificate\u201d prepared by the district court judge, which detailed the circumstances of the offense, was transmitted to the circuit court. Defendant\u2019s motion for a jury trial was denied and, following a bench trial during which the certificate was admitted into evidence, defendant was convicted of contempt and sentenced to ten days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We first address defendant\u2019s complaint that the certificate violated his constitutional right of confrontation and his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court. The right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to confront his accusers is guaranteed by both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. This right, however, is \u201cnot absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295 (1973); <em>see Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 407 (1965). It must be assured in a fashion \u201csensitive to the necessities of trial and the adversary process\u201d and \u201cmust occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 848 (1990) (quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63 (1980), and <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 243 (1895)). Nevertheless, it remains a constitutional right compromised \u201conly where . . . necessary to further an important public policy and only where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 850; <em>Bilokur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 467, 471, 270 S.E.2d 747, 751 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>We find the circumstances of the instant prosecution sufficiently unique to raise these public policy considerations necessary to warrant departure from the traditional concepts of trial confrontation. \u201c \u2018Contempt is defined as an act in disrespect of the court or its processes, or which obstructs the administration of justice, or tends to bring the court into disrepute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 2 Va. App. 392, 396, 345 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1986) (quoting 4A Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence <em>Contempt </em>\u00a7 2 (Repl. vol. 1983)); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). It includes any act \u201cwhich is calculated to embarrass, hinder, or obstruct the court\u201d in the discharge of its responsibilities. <em>Carter, 2 </em>Va. App. at 396, 345 S.E.2d at 7-8; <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 855, 859, 36 S.E.2d 529, 530 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">A district court judge has the power to punish summarily for contempt. Code \u00a7 18.2-458. It is a power \u201cessential and inherent . . . [to] the very existence of our courts,\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 610, 615 (1960), indispensable to \u201cthe proper administration of the law . . . [and necessary] to preserve the confidence and respect of the people without which the rights of the people cannot be maintained and enforced.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>2 Va. App. at 395, 345 S.E.2d at 7 (quoting <em>In re Chadwick, </em>109 Mich. 588, 596, 67 N.W. 1071, 1072 (1896)). Contempt is a singular proceeding in our jurisprudence which implicates the trial court itself in both the offense and its adjudication and requires treatment suitable to this anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-271 prohibits the testimony, \u201cin any criminal or civil proceeding,\u201d of a judge \u201cas to any matter which came before him in the course of his official duties.\u201d Oftentimes, however, the district court judge is an indispensable witness to the contemptuous event and his or her testimony is essential to prosecution of the offense on an appeal. Code \u00a7 18.2-459 resolves this dilemma by requiring that the district court judge submit a \u201ccertificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense.\u201d The circuit court \u201cmay hear the case upon the certificate and any legal testimony adduced on either side.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-459. This statutory scheme at once accords proper deference to the district court and ensures the preservation and availability of relevant evidence, the reliability of which is enhanced by the judge\u2019s certificate. In all other respects, ordinary trial procedures are undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Thus, while the right of an accused in contempt proceedings to traditional face-to-face confrontation yields to more compelling public policy considerations, the integrity of the factfinding process is diminished little and the procedure is constitutionally sound. We thus reject defendant\u2019s contention that his right to confrontation was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-132 grants to any person convicted of an offense in the district court the right of appeal to the circuit court and Code \u00a7 16.1-136 provides that such appeal shall be heard <em>de novo, </em>as a new trial. <em>Gaskill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965); <em>Gravely v. Deeds, </em>185 Va. 662, 664, 40 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1946). The issue before the circuit court is not the disposition of the matter in the lower court, but the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Royals </em>v. <em>City of Hampton, </em>201 Va. 552, 556, 111 S.E.2d 795, 798 (1960); <em>Gravely, </em>185 Va. at 664, 40 S.E.2d at 176; <em>Malouf </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, 177 </em>Va. 846, 856, 13 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1941). In this determination, the judgment of the district court must be ignored. <em>Royals, </em>201 Va. at 556, 111 S.E.2d at 798; <em>Gravely, </em>185 Va. at 664, 40 S.E.2d at 176; <em>Malouf, 177 </em>Va. at 856, 13 S.E.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In the appeal of a contempt citation, however, those events which occurred in the district court comprise the evidence of the offense before the court of record. The occurrence, circumstances and perceptions of the district court judge are relevant and necessary direct evidence in the appellate proceeding, the admission of which does not effect the <em>de novo </em>nature of the trial. The defendant, therefore, was not denied his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We next address defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court improperly denied his right to a jury trial. He argues that the right to trial by jury in Virginia attaches to any offense that is punishable by imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">At common law, no right to a jury trial existed in summary contempt proceedings. In <em>Yoder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the general rule was, that no person could be deprived of his property or his liberty except by the judgment of his peers. To this rule, however, there was an exception, and in cases of contempt the offender could be attached, brought at once before the court and punished without the intervention of a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">107 Va. 823, 827-28, 57 S.E. 581, 583 (1907). In <em>Nicholas v. Commonwealth, </em>the Court again observed that \u201c \u2018[t]here has been general recognition of the fact that the courts are clothed with [the power to punish for contempt], and must be authorized to exercise it without referring the issues of fact or law ... to a jury.\u201d\u2019 186 Va. 315, 321, 42 S.E.2d 306, 309 (1947) (quoting <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., </em>221 U.S. 418, 450 (1911)). We recognize, however, that the unbridled authority of courts to punish for criminal contempt in the absence of a jury is limited to \u201cpetty contempts,\u201d with a penalty not exceeding six months. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 495 (1974); <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 210 (1968); <em>see Greene v. Tucker, </em>375 F. Supp. 892 (E.D. Va. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1), the General Assembly has limited the maximum punishment to a $50 fine or ten days in jail, \u201cwithout a jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-457. As defendant\u2019s sentence was comported with Code \u00a7 18.2-457, and the petty contempt mandate of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Bloom, </em>his request for a jury trial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Finally, defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of contempt. Our standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is firmly established. We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears to be plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The trial court found that defendant intended to use the <em>G\u00f3malas </em>case \u201cas a forum ... to attack\u201d the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>judge, that defendant \u201cknew what he did\u201d and \u201cmeant to do it.\u201d Based upon our review of the record, we find the evidence adequate to support this determination and find that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cmisbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-13\"> This provision addresses \u201c[m]isbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto, as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b423-8\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">David P. Baugh, an attorney licensed to practice in Virginia, was summarily convicted of contempt by a trial judge in the general district court for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-456 and sentenced to ten days in jail. Neither the trial judge\u2019s certificate nor the circuit judge\u2019s order affirming the conviction recites the specific provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-456 that Baugh was convicted of violating. Based upon the circuit judge\u2019s finding \u201cthat [Baugh\u2019s] behavior in the presence of the Court was such that it did obstruct the administration of justice,\u201d we must conclude that the conviction was based upon a finding of violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) (\u201cMisbehavior in the presence of the court . . . as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice\u201d). For the reasons that follow, I would hold that Baugh\u2019s conduct was overzealous and impertinent but that the record did not provide sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he obstructed or interrupted the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Summary contempt is a criminal proceeding and occurs without the procedural due process rights associated with criminal prosecutions; thus, it may be invoked only under limited circumstances. <em>In re Michael, </em>326 U.S. 224, 227 (1945). Misbehavior can only be punishable as contempt when it \u201cconstitute^] a clear and present danger or obstruction to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 175, 184, 77 S.E.2d 405, 410 (1953). Moreover, because a summary contempt proceeding \u201cis criminal and punitive in character, . . . the guilt of the alleged contemner must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-456 requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of (1) misbehavior, (2) in the presence of the court, (3) done with intent to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice, which (4) obstructs or interrupts the administration of justice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201c[F]or conduct to be an obstruction of the administration of justice, it must interfere with and disrupt the orderly process of a court.\u201d \u201cMere aifront to the trial judge is not enough.\u201d \u201cAn obstruction of the administration of justice is a significant disruption of judicial proceedings.\u201d \u201c[T]hat remarks are injudicious ... an affront to the dignity or sensibility of the court ... or even disrespectful or insulting . . . will not, without more, justify conviction for summary criminal contempt.\u201d Inappropriate and ill-mannered conduct that \u201cdid not obstruct or delay the hearing . . . falls short of that misbehavior which may be punished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubright, </em>489 Pa. 356, 364, 414 A.2d 106, 110 (1980)(citations omitted). I believe it is not \u201c \u2018clearly . . . shown\u2019 on this record that [Baugh\u2019s] statements . . . actually obstructed the district judge in \u2018the performance of judicial duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re McConnell, </em>370 U.S. 230, 234 (1962). <em>See also Salyer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 662, 664-65, 166 S.E.2d 110, 111-12 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The record shows a hotly contested proceeding which apparently began with some friction when Baugh, who was appointed to represent an indigent, objected to the trial judge\u2019s role in presenting the prosecution\u2019s case against his client. When the case was called, the Commonwealth attorney was in the courtroom but did not participate in presenting the evidence. Without the participation of a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, the trial judge began questioning the prosecution witness to elicit evidence against Baugh\u2019s client. The trial judge\u2019s certificate states that the trial judge \u201cnormally proceeds without a Commonwealth Attorney in misdemeanor cases.\u201d When Baugh objected, the trial judge \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the objection and asked the Commonwealth attorney to present the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">During direct testimony, the prosecuting witness testified that Baugh\u2019s client secreted two bottles of wine in his pants while in his store. During this testimony, Baugh made several objections to the testimony, which were sustained. Baugh thoroughly cross-examined the witness about his observations. The trial judge\u2019s certif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>icate states that during Baugh\u2019s cross-examination, \u201csomeone, as yet unidentified, said in a staged whisper from the audience \u2018Object, he\u2019s badgering the witness.\u2019 \u201d The trial judge\u2019s certificate does not reflect that the trial judge admonished the person who made the comment. The certificate states, \u201cWith this prompting the Commonwealth Attorney noted his objection and the Court sustained the objection.\u201d Baugh, who apparently did not hear an objection by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, took exception to the comment from the audience and the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">When Baugh resumed his cross-examination of the witness, he attempted to demonstrate, using his client, that two bottles could not be secreted in his client\u2019s pants. The certificate states that \u201c[a]t this point the bailiffs in accordance with standard security instructions in the Court intervened and would not allow the defendant to take the bottles.\u201d After this occurred, the trial judge advised Baugh that the demonstration could not proceed. An exchange ensued between Baugh and the trial judge, in which Baugh argued \u201cthat he was \u2018being deprived of his ability to represent his client\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthat his client was being denied due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">After the trial judge again refused Baugh the opportunity to demonstrate that his client could not have secreted the two bottles in his pants in the way suggested by the prosecution\u2019s witness, Baugh made a motion to withdraw from representing his client. The trial judge granted Baugh\u2019s motion. Presumably, Baugh believed that he could not continue to represent his client effectively under the circumstances then prevailing. The record does not reflect why the trial judge granted the motion; however, it is reasonable to assume that the trial judge shared Baugh\u2019s belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The certificate then describes the following action which led to the conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">Upon being relieved as counsel Mr. Baugh turned his back on the Court and in what can only be described as a grandstand gesture of spreading his arms wide to the ceiling saying in a very loud audible sarcastic tone of voice, \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m out of this case, now you can appoint someone who will come in and plead the defendant guilty quicker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) requires that the charged conduct must \u201cobstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u201d The evidence does not prove an actual obstruction or interruption of the administration of justice. While the trial judge alludes to Baugh\u2019s \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d in the certificate as contributing to his finding of contempt of court, he focuses on Baugh\u2019s \u201csarcastic tone of voice\u201d and \u201clack of courtesy,\u201d as leading to his conclusion that Baugh\u2019s behavior was \u201ccontemptuous, condescending and servile.\u201d The record, thus, provides ample evidence of Baugh\u2019s impertinence. However, the certificate does not explain how Baugh\u2019s behavior actually obstructed or interrupted the administration of justice, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). Merely recounting the events leading to this charge does not suffice. Remarks and conduct that are an affront to the dignity or sensibility of the court do not, without more, justify a conviction for summary criminal contempt. <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 555 (1972). <em>See also Salyer, </em>209 Va. at 664-65, 166 S.E.2d at 111-12. Indeed the Supreme Court has often stated that \u201c[tjrial courts . . . must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 153 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The case of <em>In re McConnell </em>involved essentially the application of the same standard found in Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). The Supreme Court clearly addressed the need to prove, rather than merely assume, the existence of an obstruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">[BJefore the drastic procedures of the summary contempt power may be invoked to replace the protections of ordinary constitutional procedures there must be an actual obstruction of justice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201cAn obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is, then, the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest. This being true, it follows that the presence of that element must clearly be shown in every case where the power to punish for contempt is exerted. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">370 U.S. at 234 (quoting <em>Ex parte Hudgings, 249 </em>U.S. 378, 383 (1919)). Furthermore, \u201cthe obstruction has to be imminent and not remote.\u201d <em>State v. Boyd, </em>166 W. Va. 690, 695, 276 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The vehemence of the language used is not alone the measure of the power to punish for contempt. The fires which it kindles must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Baugh\u2019s comment clearly was a continuation of his strenuous efforts to prove his client\u2019s innocence. His comments were directed to the circumstances that culminated in the judge allowing him to withdraw after the judge refused to give him latitude to prove that his client could not have concealed two bottles in his pants as alleged by the witness. Obviously, the comment was irritating and disrespectful; however, it was not shown to obstruct justice or to have been said with the intent to do so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201cIt has been stated that <em>intent </em>is a necessary element in criminal contempt, and that no one can be punished for a criminal contempt unless the evidence makes it clear that he intended to commit it.\u201d The record in such cases must contain more than the bare <em>conclusion </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct was insolent, insulting, boisterous or the like. The actual facts upon which the court based its final conclusion must be set out. Such <em>conclusions </em>alone will not support a criminal contempt adjudication. The record must show facts to support proof that the contempt was committed <em>willfully.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"><em>Carter v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 392, 397, 345 S.E.2d 5, 9 (1986) (quoting 17 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contempt </em>\u00a7 8 (1964)) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Impertinent conduct of a momentary nature which does not impede a proceeding does not amount to criminal contempt. There may be occasions in the heat of advocacy when conduct occurs that is injudicious. Such conduct warrants firm disapproval; however, it does not constitute contempt. <em>See McConnell, </em>370 U.S. at 235 (reversal of contempt conviction where attorney persisted in questioning a witness after the judge ordered him to cease and attorney insisted he had a right to continue \u201cunless some bailiff stop[ped] [him]\u201d); <em>In re Carrow, </em>40 Cal. App. 3d 924, 927, 115 Cal. Rptr. 601, 604 (1974) (reversal of contempt conviction for attorney\u2019s statement, \u201cyour honor, I submit this trial is becoming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>joke\u201d); <em>In re Meizlish, </em>72 Mich. App. 732, 741, 250 N.W.2d 525, 528 (1976)(reversal of contempt conviction where attorney told trial judge, \u201cI maintain that you have conducted yourself in a manner which is disgraceful to the administration of justice\u201d); <em>In re Johnson, </em>467 Pa. 552, 557, 359 A.2d 739, 742 (1976)(reversal of contempt conviction where attorney told the jury that the trial judge acted in collusion with the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney by passing signals); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>478 Pa. 356, 390, 386 A.2d 971, 982 (1978)(reversal of contempt conviction where attorney resisted trial judge\u2019s order to be seated and remarked, \u201cMay my client be seated as well, or is he to be flagellated in front of the jury?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">When the evidence, as here, proves conduct that is \u201con the border line[,] we cannot say that beyond a reasonable doubt it oversteps the line and meets the essential requirements of the statute and constitutes contempt.\u201d <em>Weston, </em>195 Va. at 186, 77 S.E.2d at 410. Ill-chosen words and ill-considered conduct in the heat of courtroom debate are sometimes the unfortunate byproduct of zealous advocacy. Admittedly, the line between zealous advocacy and obstruction cannot be strictly defined. However, conduct that is \u201cpersistent, vociferous, contentious, and imposing, even to the point of appearing obnoxious\u201d is regrettable but not sufficient alone to prove contempt. <em>In re Dellinger, </em>461 F.2d 389, 400 (7th Cir. 1972). \u201c[Sjince our adversary system encourages vigorous advocacy to the point where lawyers sometimes forget themselves in the heat of combat, trial judges are not allowed to use the contempt power to ensure an atmosphere of decorous understatement. Disrespectful conduct is not contemptuous.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lowery, </em>733 F.2d 441, 446 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Wolfson v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 932 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The recitation of the facts in the certificate fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Baugh\u2019s conduct led to a \u201cmaterial disruption or obstruction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>461 F.2d 345, 369 (7th Cir. 1972) (citing <em>McConnell, </em>370 U.S. at 236; <em>Michael, </em>326 U.S. at 227; <em>Ex parte Hudgings, </em>249 U.S. 378 (1919)). I would hold, therefore, that insufficient evidence was presented to convict Baugh of contempt of court under Code \u00a7 18.2-456. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
