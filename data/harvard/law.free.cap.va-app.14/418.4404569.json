On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the opinion of an accident reconstruction expert. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The record discloses that Henrico County Police Officer Brian Cook (Cook), while on routine patrol, noticed an automobile \u201cdrifting over the center line\u201d of the roadway and decided to \u201cstop the vehicle ... for a possible D.U.I.\u201d Cook activated his blue lights, high beams and spotlight, but the suspect vehicle only slowed, without stopping. As Cook followed, the vehicle increased speed and Cook pursued, with his siren on.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">During the chase, both vehicles passed another automobile at speeds estimated by that driver at \u201c85 or 90 m.p.h.\u201d Moments later, Cook \u201clost sight\u201d of the fleeing car in a curve and, as he \u201ccame around the corner,\u201d \u201csaw a large amount of debris coming from the roadway.\u201d Cook \u201cimmediately ... hit the brakes,\u201d but collided with the suspect vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Subsequent investigation revealed that defendant was the operator of the automobile and had been accompanied by a. passenger. The passenger\u2019s body was found approximately twenty feet from defendant\u2019s vehicle, and he died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented Officer J. T. Cipolla (Cipolla) as \u201can expert in the field of crash reconstruction.\u201d Over defendant\u2019s objection, Cipolla was allowed to relate his findings at the scene of the accident and to state his resulting opinion that defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cimpacted the tree on the left front grill area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>on the left hand side of the vehicle\u201d and then \u201crotated to the right re-entering the roadway in front of the police vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is well settled in Virginia that the opinion of an expert witness is admissible \u201cwhere \u2018the jury, or the court trying a case without a jury, is confronted with issues\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018cannot be determined intelligently merely from the deductions made and inferences drawn on the basis of ordinary knowledge, common sense, and practical experience gained in the ordinary affairs of life\u2019 \u201d and thus require \u201c \u2018scientific or specialized knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 716, 726, 250 S.E.2d 749, 755-56 (1979) (quoting 31 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Expert and Opinion Evidence </em>\u00a7 16 (1967)); <em>see also Swiney </em>v. <em>Overby, </em>237 Va. 231, 233, 377 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1989); <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 250, 254, 403 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1991), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>243 Va. 1, 413 S.E.2d 875 (1992). Conversely, \u201cwhere the facts and circumstances shown in evidence are such that men of ordinary intelligence are capable of comprehending them, forming an intelligent opinion about them, and drawing their own conclusions,\u201d expert opinion \u201cfounded upon such facts is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Venable v. Stockner, </em>200 Va. 900, 904, 108 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1959); <em>see also Bond v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 538, 311 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1984); <em>Grasty v. Tanner, </em>206 Va. 723, 726, 146 S.E.2d 252, 254 (1966); <em>Hubbard, </em>12 Va. App. at 254, 403 S.E.2d at 710; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 135, 138, 379 S.E.2d 476, 478 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The Supreme Court considered facts much like those now before us in <em>Venable. </em>There, plaintiffs sued to recover for injuries suffered in a collision between their automobile and a tractor-trailer. 200 Va. at 901, 108 S.E.2d at 381. Plaintiffs contended that the tractor-trailer \u201ccame across the center line\u201d of the road, causing the accident, and offered the opinion of a \u201c \u2018safety engineer, accident analyst\u2019 \u201d in support of this theory. <em>Id. </em>at 902-03, 108 S.E.2d at 382-83. Based upon an examination of physical evidence and photographs, the expert opined that the tractor-trailer had entered plaintiffs lane of travel by \u201c \u2018at least a foot and a half \u201d and that the \u201cleft front wheel of the tractor passed over the left front wheel of the Stockner car,\u201d which caused \u201cthe automobile to move in a counterclockwise direction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904, 108 S.E.2d at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The Supreme Court noted that, while \u201ca witness may describe tire marks, skid marks, or cuts which he has observed ... at or near the place of an automobile accident,\u201d the \u201cinference to be drawn from such testimony \u2018is solely the province of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 905, 108 S.E.2d at 383-84 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Lovvorn, </em>199 Va. 688, 693, 101 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1958)). The Court regarded the jury \u201cas capable as the proffered witness\u201d to evaluate such evidence and ruled the opinion inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 905, 108 S.E.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Similarly, in <em>Grasty, </em>the Supreme Court held that an expert opinion of the speed of an automobile, which resulted from an \u201cexamination of [the] damaged vehicle and surrounding conditions,\u201d was improperly admitted. 206 Va. at 726, 146 S.E.2d at 254. Once again, the Court concluded that \u201c[reasonable men were capable of drawing their own conclusions\u201d from the facts presented, and that the expert \u201cinvaded the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727, 146 S.E.2d at 254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In <em>Callahan, </em>this Court held that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of a fire marshal concerning the origin of a fire. While we recognized that an expert witness \u201cmay detail the facts and observations which came to his attention while investigating the fire ... the court must \u2018permit the jurors to draw their own conclusions as to the cause\u2019 of the fire.\u201d 8 Va. App. at 139, 379 S.E.2d at 479 (quoting <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 245, 250, 105 S.E.2d 155, 159 (1958)); <em>see also Llamera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 414 S.E.2d 597 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Although we recently countenanced expert opinion testimony as to the speed of an automobile in <em>Hubbard, </em>we emphasized that the \u201cmeasurements and computations\u201d utilized by these witnesses \u201cwere dependent upon particular and specialized scientific training and experience,\u201d \u201cmatters . . . not within the realm of ordinary observation and assessment.\u201d 12 Va. App. at 257, 403 S.E.2d at 711. The \u201cmatters\u201d related to the instant case, however, required no \u201cscientific or specialized knowledge,\u201d, but were susceptible to determination \u201con the basis of [the] ordinary knowledge, common sense, and practical experience\u201d of lay persons. <em>See Compton, </em>219 Va. at 726, 250 S.E.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Cipolla was properly permitted to describe the paint discovered on a tree, damage to the vehicles and the length and location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of the skid marks. <em>See Venable, </em>200 Va. at 905, 108 S.E.2d at 383. However, the inferences to be drawn from such testimony belonged solely to the factfinder. <em>Id. </em>at 905, 108 S.E.2d at 383-84. We recognize that the trial court has wide discretion with respect to the admission of expert opinion testimony, but such evidence in this case was both unnecessary and inadmissible. <em>See Thorpe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 609, 614, 292 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1982); <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. </em>v. <em>Keatley, </em>211 Va. 507, 510, 178 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b470-8\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdI\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">I join in the opinion except for that portion which favorably emphasizes the holding of this Court in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 250, 403 S.E.2d 708 (1991). Although <em>Hubbard </em>was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court, <em>see </em>243 Va. 1, 413 S.E.2d 875 (1992), I believe that we and the trial court must acknowledge (1) that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the reconstructed opinion evidence, and (2) that a separate concurring opinion \u201cmake[s] explicit that which is implicit in the opinion, that is, the Court is not endorsing the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling approving the use of reconstructed opinion evidence of speed in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 413 S.E.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">I believe it is sufficient to say that the expert\u2019s opinion concerning speed, rotation, and movements of the vehicle at issue in this case is prohibited by <em>Bond v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 538, 311 S.E.2d 769, 771-72 (1984), and <em>Grasty v. Tanner, </em>206 Va. 723, 726, 146 S.E.2d 252, 255 (1966). The discussion of <em>Hubbard </em>is best left for another day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
