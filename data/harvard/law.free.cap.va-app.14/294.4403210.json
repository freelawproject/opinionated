The Commonwealth argues that such a restricted construction is not justified by precedent or logic and does not reflect the legislative intent in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-435. We agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s position and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>On December 17, 1989, Teresa Ann Scott and her minor daughter, Dianna, were at Pratt\u2019s grocery store, owned by Mrs. Joyce Payne. The daughter purchased beer on this occasion and made payment by a check that was returned unpaid. Subsequently, Mrs. Payne sought a criminal warrant against Scott\u2019s daughter for the unpaid check. On March 27, 1990, the daughter was tried and convicted in the general district court of the bad check charge. That same day Scott appeared before a magistrate in Madison County and swore out a criminal complaint against Mrs. Payne, accusing her of having sold beer to Scott\u2019s underage daughter in the transaction upon which the bad check charge was based. The criminal complaint to which she swore stated that Scott \u201cstopped at Pratt\u2019s grocery\u201d with her daughter, Dianna. She described the purchase of four six-packs of beer by Dianna and stated that Mrs. Payne never asked for her daughter\u2019s identification. The charge was later dismissed when the appellant failed to appear at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Dianna Scott appealed her bad check conviction to the circuit court. On June 22, 1990, Scott appeared at trial as a witness in her daughter\u2019s defense. After being duly sworn, she testified that her daughter had not been in Pratt\u2019s grocery store at any time and had not cashed the check in question. Dianna was nevertheless convicted. Subsequently, appellant was charged with having committed perjury pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-435, by giving conflicting testimony on March 27, 1990 and June 22, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The principles of statutory construction are clear. First, a court must give effect to the legislative intent. Second, the plain, obvious meaning of a statute is to be preferred over a narrow or strained construction. Finally, a penal statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and applied only in those cases falling clearly within the language of the statute. <em>See Graybeal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 736, 739, 324 S.E.2d 698, 699-700 (1985); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 336, 381 S.E.2d 361 (1989), we held that Code \u00a7 18.2-435 defined a separate and distinct perjury offense from that proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-434, in that the elements of proof under the two statutes are significantly different. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 381 S.E.2d at 364. Under Code \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>18.2-434,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commonwealth must prove that a statement of the defendant was false. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-435, however, the Commonwealth need only prove that sworn testimony was given on two separate occasions, that the testimony on one occasion contradicted the testimony on the other, and that the acts were done with the intent to testify falsely. We observe that while the two statutes contain different elements of proof, they are concerned with the same issue \u2014 perjury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Perjury is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">[T]he willful assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief, or knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial proceeding as part of his evidence, either upon oath or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, whether such evidence is given in open court, <em>or in an affidavit, or otherwise, </em>such assertion being material to the issue or point of inquiry and known to such witness to be false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1025 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-435 was to eliminate the requirement of <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 1025, 1028-1029 (1876) and its progeny. <em>Schwartz </em>held that when a defendant deliberately gives contradictory sworn testimony on separate occasions, the Commonwealth must prove which statement was false in order to obtain a conviction for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-434 nor Code \u00a7 18.2-435 expressly restricts \u201ctestimony\u201d to testimony given in judicial proceedings. In fact, Code \u00a7 18.2-434 provides that it is perjury to swear falsely when an oath is lawfully administered \u201con any occasion.\u201d Reading Code \u00a7 18.2-435 in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-434, we believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the legislative intent was the same and the \u201con any occasion\u201d concept is implicit in Code \u00a7 18.2-435.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Related sections of the Code using the same phraseology may be consulted in determining the meaning of a statute. The Code of Virginia is one body of law. <em>King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986). The words, \u201ctestimony\u201d and \u201ctestify\u201d are used throughout the Code to refer to solemn legal declarations under oath in <em>ex parte, </em>as well as adversary, proceedings before a variety of authorities and tribunals. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 2.1-169 (testimony in examinations by Auditor of Public Accounts); Code \u00a7\u00a7 6.1-294, 296, and 297 (testimony in Consumer Finance Act investigations by State Corporation Commission); Code \u00a7 3-70 (testimony in public hearings before Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission); Code \u00a7 32.1-320 (testimony in medical services investigations by the Attorney General); Code \u00a7 32.1-324.1 (testimony in investigations by Director of Department of Medical Assistance Services); Code \u00a7 38.2-1320 (testimony in insurance investigations by State Corporation Commission); Code \u00a7\u00a7 40.1-6 and 10 (testimony in investigations by Commissioner of Labor and Industry); Code \u00a7 40.1-131 (testimony in public hearings by Commissioner of Labor and Industry); Code \u00a7 9-6.14:8 (testimony and evidence in public hearings for adoption of regulations by state agencies in accordance with Administrative Process Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In addition, the Code provisions relating to grand jury proceedings, be they regular, special, or multi-jurisdictional, repeatedly refer to \u201ctestimony\u201d given in such proceedings, although such communications are not made in open court and not subject to cross-examination. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-192, -201, -202, -208, -209, -212, -215.5, -215.6, -215.7, -215.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We hold that when enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-435, the legislature did not intend to restrict the meaning of the term \u201ctestimony,\u201d as urged by appellant. The use of the words, \u201ctestimony\u201d and \u201ctestify\u201d in the various sections of the Code enumerated above, lead us to conclude that the term, \u201cgive testimony,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-435 encompasses any material declaration made under oath, whether <em>ex parte </em>or in an adversary proceeding subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Accordingly, because the record shows that the appellant swore to a criminal complaint before a magistrate that her daughter had purchased beer in Pratt\u2019s grocery store, and later swore in open court that her daughter had never been in Pratt\u2019s grocery store, and because both statements constituted \u201ctestimony\u201d within the intendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-435, she was properly convicted of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Barrow, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-12\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-435 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">It shall likewise constitute perjury for any person, with the intent to testify falsely, to knowingly give testimony under oath as to any material matter or thing and subsequently to give conflicting testimony under oath as to the same matter or thing. In any indictment for such perjury, it shall be sufficient to allege the offense by stating that the person charged therewith did, knowingly and with the intent to testify falsely, on one occasion give testimony upon a certain matter and, on a subsequent occasion, give different testimony upon the same matter. Upon the trial on such indictment, it shall be sufficient to prove that the defendant, knowingly and with the intent to testify falsely, gave such differing testimony and that the differing testimony was given on two separate occasions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-434 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">What deemed perjury; punishment and penalty. - If any person to whom an oath is lawfully administered on any occasion willfully swear falsely on such occasion touching any material matter or thing, or if a person falsely make oath that any other person is eighteen years of age in order to obtain a marriage license for such other person, he shall be guilty of perjury, punishable as a Class 5 felony. Upon the conviction of any person for perjury, such person thereby shall be adjudged forever incapable of holding any office of honor, profit or trust under the Constitution of Virginia, or of serving as a juror.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\"> The penalties provided for perjury under both Code sections are identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
