Code \u00a7 1401 (1967) set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\">His first contention is that, assuming the Government proved that the signatures on the money order had not been placed there by the person whose signatures they purported to be, there was a failure of proof that this person had not authorized the signatures. State v. Gorham, 87 Utah 86, 48 P.2d 447, and State v. Phillips, 256 N.C. 445, 124 S.E. 2d 146, are cited. We think the testimony and the manner in which it was given, with defendant\u2019s acquiescence, support the inference that the signatures were not authorized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">The only other contention grows out of testimony of the manager of the store. On cross-examination he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>asked to explain how he recalled certain details of the incident. In response he testified to a policy the store had adopted in the effort to catch people who had been stealing money orders and checks. While his explanation went somewhat beyond the range of relevance to the issues on trial we find, in light of all the evidence, that any error of the court in permitting this was harmless within the meaning of Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-15\">.
