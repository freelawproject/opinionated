At the trial, an informer testified as to transactions between appellant and himself and w\u2019as corroborated by a policeman, who, with the informer\u2019s permission, overheard one transaction by means of an electronic transmitting device concealed on the informer\u2019s person and another by means of an extension phone. The argument that the use of an electronic transmitter or extension phone in this manner is forbidden by Katz v. United States, 1967, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, has been considered and rejected. Dryden v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 214 [March 22, 1968]; Handsford v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 373, cert, denied, 88 S.Ct. 810, (U.S. May 20, 1968); Dancy v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 370. Appellant\u2019s remaining contention that he was entrapped as a matter of law is also without merit. Examination of the record convinces us that under the standards of Beatty v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 181, 186, the district court correctly submitted the issue to the jury and further that the jury could reasonably have concluded there was no entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
