The record indicates that one Laughrey, a Papermakers\u2019 steward, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>threatened to go to the Board to file a decertification petition, whereupon the Papermakers\u2019 business agent and the president of the local responded with certain threats of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The Board described these thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cThe Trial Examiner found, and we agree, that Respondent violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act by the threats of its agent, Hendershott, to the Charging Party, Laughrey, made in the presence of other employees, that Hendershott would \u2018fire\u2019 Laughrey and that Hendershott would \u2018bring in the big boys from New York\u2019 and \u2018chop up\u2019 Laughrey if Laughrey tried to obtain Board decertification of Respondent\u2019s local union.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Respondent contends that all of the threats, if read in context, amounted to threats to \u201cfire\u201d Laughrey from his union post and not from his job with Continental Can. Respondent asserts that the \u201cbring in the big boys from New York\u201d to \u201cchop up\u201d Laughrey represented a threat of union political reprisal rather than a physical threat, and, hence, was no violation of section 8(b) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">On this record respondent\u2019s interpretations are permissible ones. But, of course, the drawing of legitimate inferences from disputed facts is the function of the Board and not of this court. NLRB v. Local Union No. 369, IBEW, 341 F.2d 470, 472 (6th Cir. 1965); NLRB v. Superex Drugs, Inc., 341 F.2d 747, 749 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Here the length of this union\u2019s bargaining relationship with Continental Can, the use of the word \u201cfire,\u201d and the totality of circumstances (including the interpretation of the hearers) represent support on the total record for the findings and order of the Board to the extent that they refer to threats to cause Laughrey\u2019s discharge from his company employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">We find no support, however, for the Trial Examiner and the Board interpreting the language \u201cI\u2019ll bring the big boys in from New York and I\u2019ll chop you into little pieces\u201d as a physical threat. Such a threat literally read would be an extraordinary one. This record presents no pattern of violence, let alone chopping \u201cinto little pieces.\u201d There were three, other men present with Laughrey at the disputed conversation. The testimony of Laughrey and his three associates makes clear that they construed the disputed language employed at the meeting by the Paper-makers\u2019 representative as a threat to Laughrey\u2019s job \u2014 but not as a threat to his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">The Board\u2019s order will be amended to exclude reference to threatening \u201cphysical violence\u201d or bodily harm. Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order, as amended, is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-27\">. United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers, AFL-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b200-13\">McCREE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AMW\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">I concur in the determination of my colleagues to enforce the Board\u2019s order insofar as it is concerned with a threat to cause Laughrey\u2019s discharge from his company employment. Although I would not interpret the language \u201cI will bring the big boys in from New York and I will chop you into little pieces\u201d as a threat of physical violence if I were permitted to make a finding <em>de novo, </em>I cannot conclude that the Board\u2019s literal interpretation of the language is impermissible.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
