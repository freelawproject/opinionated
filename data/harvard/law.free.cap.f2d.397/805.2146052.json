The district court\u2019s order of dismissal was proper and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\"> In view of the changed conditions, the petitioner would be entitled to file a new petition under Chapter X. In order to save time and the preparing of new schedules, etc., our order of affirmance is stayed for thirty days after the date of this opinion, and leave granted to appellant, if it sees fit, to file within the thirty day period an amendment or supplement to its petition under Chapter X, setting forth what properties remain after foreclosure, the amount of the encumbrances against remaining parcels of real property, and the status as to each of the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">If an answer is filed as provided in Section 144 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544, the court shall promptly set the matter for hearing and promptly decide whether or not the petition as amended or supplemented complies with the Act and has been filed in good faith, Section 141 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541, and whether \u201cit is unreasonable to expect that a plan of reorganization can be effected,\u201d Section 146(3) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">We do not indicate what decision the district court should make in the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
