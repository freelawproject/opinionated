Real, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b839-13\">REAL, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Action was brought in the United States District Court by the United States against the appellee, Kenyon Farms, a corporate farm in Idaho, for conversion of potatoes and other crops on which the Farmers Home Administration held a crop and chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">Crop and Chattel Mortgages were properly recorded by the Farmers Home Administration in March 1960, and March 1962, with Mr. and Mrs. Blaine P. Martindale as mortgagors. The mortgages covered the Martindales\u2019 interest in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-20\">\u201call crops now standing, planted, sown, growing, or grown and all crops that may be standing, planted, sown, growing, or grown within two (2) years after the date hereof, on the land described hereinafter, and on any other lands owned, leased or controlled by the Borrower in the county(ies) identified hereinafter or in any other county(ies) in the State of IDAHO; * * <em>-*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-21\">At the time of the execution of the crop and chattel mortgage in question upon this appeal, the borrowers Blaine P. Martindale and Rachel 0. Martindale were tenants on a farm owned by W. B. Whiteley. Whiteley\u2019s farm was located in Cassia County.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-22\">During the year 1960, Blaine P. Martindale and Rachel O. Martindale became tenants on a farm owned by appellee also located in Cassia County. The Martin-dales had a one-half interest in crops grown on appellee\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-23\">The lease interest in appellee\u2019s farm was shared equally between the Martin-dales and W. B. Whiteley. W. B. Whiteley was an officer and held a large interest in appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-24\">During the years 1960 and 1961, the crops from appellee\u2019s farm were sold to appellee. Rather than pay the Martin-dales the proceeds from their one-half interest in those crops, the proceeds were credited to the Martindales\u2019 otherwise unsecured indebtedness to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-25\">After trial, the District Court concluded that the crop and chattel mortgage, because of the nature of the printing and wording of appellant\u2019s crop and chattel mortgage, did not give constructive notice to appellee of any claim of crop mortgage by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-26\"> The clause relied upon by appellant appears on the first page of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>standard printed form denominated FHA 30.10. Its pertinent language creating the after acquired application of the mortgage is in the same type size as are all the other standard provisions provided in each of the four pages of the document denominated crop and chattel mortgage (Idaho). The language clearly covers \u201call other lands, owned, leased or controlled by the Borrower.\u201d Such provisions are fully sanctioned by the laws of the State of Idaho. Idaho Code 45-1101. Livestock Credit Corp. v. Corbett, 53 Idaho 190, 22 P.2d 874 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The judgment is reversed and remanded to the District Court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
