After the afternoon siesta, customary on ships with Greek crews, \u201cDecedent\u2019s body was found hanging from the rail of the starboard wing of the poop deck, a rope noose around his neck.\u201d After careful consideration of the record, we are unable to find that the following conclusions of the trial judge are erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-22\">\u201c2. Libellant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the death of Georgios Tsangarakis aboard the SS. Nikolos was caused by intentional or wilful act of members of the crew of the SS. Nikolos, or that the death resulted from the fault or neglect of the respondents either through the negligence of the Master, officers or members of the Crew of the Nikolos, or by reason of any unseaworthy condition of the Nikolos or its crew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-23\">\u201c3. Libellant has failed to establish a basis for the recovery of damages either under the maritime law of the United States or under Greek law.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-24\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that a certificate of the Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>County Coroner is \u201cto the effect that the decedent herein was \u201cmurdered\u201d. The record justifies this sentence of Finding 23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">\u201cThe Coroner\u2019s physician was unable to determine the cause of death, and because of lack of medical evidence, the Coroner\u2019s jury was unable to reach a verdict as to the cause of death.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The trial judge had the opportunity to observe the doctors and qualified embalmers who testified concerning the possible movement of the larnyx, part of the bronchial tube, and part of the lower trachea into the chest cavity during the embalming process and his evaluation of this testimony is certainly not clearly erroneous. See McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L. Ed. 20 (1954). Similarly, the trial judge was not required to accept the confused testimony of Mr. Zafiratos, who conceded seeing appellant \u201ctwo or three times a week\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Any presumption either against suicide or in favor of the exercise of due care for his own safety by the decedent may be dissipated by evidence indicating suicide or showing lack of such due care by the decedent. Cf. Sowizral v. Hughes, 333 F.2d 829 (3rd Cir. 1964) ; Smith v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, 254 F.Supp. 622 (W.D.Pa. 1966) ; Gatenby v. Altoona Aviation Corporation, 268 F.Supp. 599 (W.D.Pa. 1967) ; and cases cited in those cases. In this case, the defendant came forward with evidence which the fact finder could find negatived the applicability of the presumption against suicide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">The January 23, 1967, judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-14\">. As to the applicability of this Act to this admiralty action, see Fernandez v. Linea Acropostal Venezolana, 156 F.Supp. 94 (S.D.N.Y.1957), and authorities there cited; cf. Romero v. International Term. Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 79 S.Ct. 468,. 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959); Scott v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., et al., 399 F. 2d 14 (3rd Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-16\">. Finding of Fact 25 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-17\">\u201c25. Libelant has not established the Decedent was murdered or that Decedent\u2019s death was caused by any other fault of respondents, either by the negligence of the Master, officers or members of the crew of the Nikolos, or by any unseaworthy condition of the vessel or its crew. The evidence preponderates to the conclusion, and the court finds, that Decedent committed suicide by hanging.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. The Delaware County Coroner\u2019s physician testified that at the time of the disinterment of the body and autopsy, \u201cThe skin * * * was like leather, couldn\u2019t tell a thing. * * * There was no way of me telling whether it [death] was done by hanging or any other way.\u201d Exhibits L-4 and L-5 contain no findings on the cause of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\">. In this record, there is a death certificate showing \u201csuicide\u201d and death due to \u201cstrangulation by hanging,\u201d as well as oral testimony consistent with such certificate. It is noted that McCormick on Evidence, at p. 643 (fn. 21), makes this comment on the presumption against suicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-17\">\u201cThis presumption not being based on specific facts proven, but constituting rather a make-weiglit consideration, where the circumstantial inferences are in doubt, can seemingly have little practical usefulness except as an admonition to the jury in the instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-18\">See, also, Hines v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, 235 F.Supp. 695, 697 (E.D.Tenn.), aff\u2019d 357 F.2d 726 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
