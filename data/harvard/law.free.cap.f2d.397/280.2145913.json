The district court dismissed the action, relying on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Section 1332(c), conferring federal court jurisdiction in diversity suits, originally provided only that \u201cFor the purposes of this section * * * a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business\u201d. Interpreting this section in a suit between a citizen of New York and a British Corporation, the district court in New York held that diversity jurisdiction existed \u2014 although the foreign corporation had a principal place of business in New York \u2014 since 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c) did not apply to a corporation incorporated in a foreign state. Eisenberg v. Commercial Union Assurance Co., S.D.N.Y.1960, 189 F.Supp. 500. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-24\">It is to be noted that the statute differentiates between States of the United States and foreign states by the use of a capital S for the word when applied to a State of the United States. Subdivision (e), therefore, in dealing with the <em>place of incorporation </em>refers only to a corporation incorporated in a State of the United States. When subdivision (c) goes on to deal with <em>principal place of business </em>it refers to the same corporation and thus only to a corporation incorporated in a State of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-25\">This decision has been followed in subsequent cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But neither <em>Eisenberg </em>nor its progeny involved a direct action against an insurer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the application of the 1964 proviso to section 1332(c). The proviso reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-26\"><em>Provided further, </em>that in any direct action against the insurer of a policy or contract of liability insurance, whether incorporated or unincorporated, to which action the insured is not joined as a party-defendant, such insurer shall be deemed a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen, as well as of any State by which the insurer has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-27\">The purpose of the 1964 amendment is clear: a \u201cdirect action\u201d statute is not to be used as a vehicle to get an insurer into federal court where both the plaintiff and the insured are residents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>same state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress placed no artificial restraint concerning foreign or alien states with a big <em>S </em>or a little s in its directions relating to insurers. The proviso applies to <em>\u201cany </em>direct action against an <em>insurer </em>* * * whether incorporated or unincorporated\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Applying the proviso to section 1332 (c&gt; \u2014 according to its literal meaning and legislative history \u2014 we conclude that federal diversity jurisdiction does not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-16\">.
