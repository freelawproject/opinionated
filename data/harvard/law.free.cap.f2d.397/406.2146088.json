The contention on appeal is that the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the sale as being the product of an illegal entrapment, and secondly in the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal since the facts established as a matter of law an unlawful entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">The district judge submitted to the jury the issue of entrapment as a fact question with proper instructions. We agree that the defense of entrapment was a fact question and should have gone, and did go, to the jury who resolved it against the defendant. See Hannah v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 785 [May 2, 1968]; Suarez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 709; Kivette v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 230 F.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-24\">No error appearing, the judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
