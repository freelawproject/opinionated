He filed a Complaint under the Act in the Western District of Pennsylvania for injuries allegedly sustained during his employment by the defendant in Charleston, West Virginia. The Complaint alleged that the defendant maintained an office at 3 Gateway Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was doing business in the Western District of Pennsylvania. Service of the Complaint was made at the stated office of the defendant, in the manner provided by Rule 4(d) (3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-22\">The defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint and for Summary Judgment, alleging that the District Court lacked jurisdiction for the reasons that (1) defendant is a Virginia corporation with its principal office in the City of Richmond, Virginia; and \u201cis not doing business within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania within the meaning of the due process requirements of the Federal Constitution, nor under the applicable Pennsylvania law\u201d; and (2) \u201cneither the plaintiff nor the defendant are residents of the Western District of Pennsylvania; and this <em>action, being based solely on the diversity of </em>citizenship, is therefore not properly brought in the said Western District of Pennsylvania under the venue provisions -of the Act of Congress, 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1391\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-23\">The defendant filed two affidavits in support of its Motion, one by T. H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Keelor, its corporate Secretary, and the other by Roland L. Schilke, in charge of its office at 3 Gateway Center, Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Keelor\u2019s affidavit stated, inter alia, that the defendant \u201chas no railroad lines or tracks nor does it operate any trains, cars or other equipment in, on or across the State of Pennsylvania, nor has it so operated same at any time\u201d, and \u201chas no office, agents, or representatives in the State of Pennsylvania, nor has it had at any time, <em>except offices located in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, with person or persons located at these offices for the purpose of soliciting business to be transported over the Company\u2019s lines in interstate commerce, said Railway Company participating only in such interstate commerce insofar as the same may be routed over said Railway Company\u2019s lines outside of the State of </em>Pennsylvania\u201d. (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Schilke\u2019s affidavit stated that he is employed by the defendant in charge of its Pittsburgh office; that he and his assistants \u201care employed by said defendant for the sole purpose of inducing persons to ship or cause to be shipped over the road of said defendant in states other than Pennsylvania, said office being maintained and said persons employed to solicit business for said defendant to be transported over its lines wholly outside of * * * Pennsylvania. * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the District Court erred in refusing to direct defendant to answer plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories designed to elicit the range of operations of defendant\u2019s offices in Pennsylvania, in view of defendant\u2019s statements in its affidavits that such offices were maintained \u201cfor the purpose of soliciting business\u201d. The range of activities of defendant\u2019s offices was critical to ascertaining whether they were of sufficient dimension to constitute \u201cminimum contacts\u201d or \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania, with consequential establishment of <em>in person-am </em>jurisdiction in the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">The relevance of the scope of activities of a non-resident corporation in the forum state in determining whether it is subject to <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction of the forum is well-settled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">It is further settled that such a corporation is subject to the forum\u2019s <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction if it has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d, and that \u201ccontinuous systematic\u201d activities, as distinguished from \u201csingle or isolated items of activities\u201d are a significant factor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">It must be noted that while the principles stated were announced by the Supreme Court in diversity jurisdiction cases they are now generally regarded as applicable in cases grounded on a federal claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">It has been held that \u201c * * * insofar as cases are governed by federal law, the question of whether they are to be tried in one locality or another is now to be tested * * * simply by basic principles of fairness\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-20\"> We must here observe that the District Court by its reference to Pennsylvania statutory and decisional law in its Opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicated that it regarded Pennsylvania law as controlling in determining the question of its jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It erred in this respect since federal law is applicable in determining the issue of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction where the complaint, as here, asserts a federal right,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and personal service of process was made in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4(d) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">It should further be noted that the parties on this appeal agree that federal law is controlling in determining the question as to whether defendant was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the Western District of Pennsylvania so as to establish <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction and venue. It should also be observed that the parties have mistakenly treated section 6 of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as a jurisdictional statute instead of a venue provision, in disregard of the explicit ruling in Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. v. Kepner, 314 U.S. 44, 52, 62 S.Ct. 6, 9, 86 L.Ed. 28 (1941) that \u201cSection 6 establishes venue for an action in the federal courts\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">This too, must be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On this appeal plaintiff contends that, standing alone, the soliciting of business, disclosed by defendant\u2019s affidavits, constitutes \u201cdoing business\u201d, thus establishing the District Court\u2019s <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. We do not deem it necessary to consider that contention at this time in view of our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to require defendant to answer plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories insofar as they relate to the range and scope of operation of defendant\u2019s Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania offices, and to further proceed in accordance with this Opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-15\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-16\">. The second stated point of defendant\u2019s Motion disregards the fact that the Complaint explicitly stated that jurisdiction was based on the Act. It must also be noted that the District Court did not advert to it in dismissing the Complaint, and the defendant has not raised it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">.
