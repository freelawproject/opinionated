The decision, he says, effects an impermissible construction of the statute and an unconstitutional discrimination against watches and movements imported from foreign countries. The statute is assailed on the ground that it undertakes an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Alleging injury in his business relations, appellant sought from the District Court an injunctive annulment of the Bureau\u2019s ruling and a declaration that the statute is invalid. The District Court dismissed his suit, being of opinion that appellant had no standing to bring it. We hold that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">Federal district courts \u201chave original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress providing for * * * revenue from imports or tonnage except matters within the jurisdiction of the Customs Court.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Customs Court has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review on protest the decisions of any collector of customs * * * as to the rate and amount of duties chargeable and as to all exactions of whatever character within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury; * * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These provisions invest only the Customs Court with the'jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-20\">In Eastern States Petroleum Corp. v.

But as we concluded in Boston Wool Trade Ass\u2019n v. Snyder,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> an importer\u2019s action to compel the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct customs officials to collect duties on imported commodities falls exclusively within the purview of the Customs Court<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We think it clear that appellant must make his plea there.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-17\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202, General Headnote 1.

This industry was first established in the Virgin Islands late in 1959 and since then has shipped virtually its entire output of watches to the United States free of duty. * * * These watches are assembled from parts and subassemblies obtained principally from Japan, West Germany and France. An increasingly large volume of Soviet parts are also utilized in the assembly process. * * * Tlle method of assembly used in the islands does not vary greatly from plant to plant. A concern usually obtains all parts for a particular type of movement from the same, foreign supplier; the parts are received both as unassembled parts and as subassemblies. Generally the major share of the parts are already assembled. The subassemblies and other parts are assembled into a complete movement which is then sold in the United States either to a parent organization or to retailors of private brands or other importers at prices ranging from $4 to $8 per movement * * S.Rep.No. 1679, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 4 (1966); U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News 1966, p. 4392.
