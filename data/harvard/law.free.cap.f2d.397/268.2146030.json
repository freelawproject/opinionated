Plaintiff asserted in his amended complaint that the defendants illegally made copies of his records but he did not specifically request their return. We do not view the absence of such a request decisive because, assuming it had been made, it would not affect our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">Defendants contend that the order of the district court is not appealable. Plaintiff says that the order is appeal-able because there were no criminal proceedings pending against him when he filed his complaint and when the matter was heard. He also emphasizes that the issue of the return of the copies of the record was before the court. We think the whole tenor of the amended complaint makes it abundantly clear that the prime, if not sole, purpose of the amended complaint was to prevent the use of such records in potential criminal or civil proceedings against plaintiff. In this context it constituted, as the district court noted, an impermissible attempt to obtain a premature ruling on the legality of the use of the records in such later proceedings. The fact that the original records were returned to plaintiff before the entry of the order in question tends only to reinforce our conclusion. The arguments advanced by plaintiff are decisively answered in Smith v. United States, 377 F.2d 739 (3rd Cir. 1967). We think that DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L. Ed.2d 614 (1962) and Smith v. United States, above, speak decisively against the appealability of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">The appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
