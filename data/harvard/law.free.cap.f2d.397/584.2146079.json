McRAE, Jr., District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">This appeal is from a jury conviction on all but three counts of a forty-count indictment. Appellant was convicted for willfully making false entries in bank records (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005), embezzlement and misapplication of bank funds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The sole issue raised on appeal is the propriety of the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of Appellant\u2019s first character witness, Haywood Watts. The pertinent part of the examination follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. TUNNELL, DEFENSE COUNSEL: (R. 783, 784)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Q. Mr. Watts, referring to the period of time that Mr. Aaron resided in Mine\u00f3la; he left about five years ago the evidence shows\u2014 during the time he lived there were you acquainted with Mr. Aaron\u2019s reputation for honesty and fair dealing in that community?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">Q. Was that reputation good or bad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">A. Good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BUMSTEAD, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY: (R.784-786)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">Q. Mr. Watts, you testified that he had a good reputation there in the community ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">Q. Do you know why he was asked to leave the Mine\u00f3la Bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">MR. TUNNELL: We object, Your Honor, to that as not being a proper impeachment cross-examination on this character witness. He can ask what he heard, but he can\u2019t relate * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">THE COURT: I sustain that objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-19\">MR. BUMSTEAD: Very well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-20\">Q. Have you heard, Mr. Watts, that Mr. Aaron was asked to resign from the First National Bank in Mine\u00f3la by reason of his illicit affair with Miss Tommy Linley (phonetic) ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-21\">MR, TUNNELL: We object to this as improper questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-22\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-23\">MR. TUNNELL: Not relating to the trait or character involved ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-24\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-25\">MR. TUNNELL: I ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-26\">THE COURT: All right; you will disregard the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-27\">MR. TUNNELL: Your Honor, we</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-28\">further move for a mistrial based upon that highly inflamatory and prejudicial question of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-29\">THE COURT: Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-30\">Character witnesses may be cross-examined to determine the credibility and accuracy of their testimony. As a general rule, however, this inquiry is limited to questions concerning knowledge of rumors involving character traits connected with the crime for which the defendant is on trial. See Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948). Appellant was on trial for a crime which involved the question of his honesty and fair dealing. The direct examination of his character witness was properly limited to these areas. Rumors of an illicit affair with a woman, even if these rumors were true, were wholly immaterial to the character traits involved in this case. The question was therefore improper, and the defense objection was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-31\">Appellant contends that the Court should have declared a mistrial or granted his motion for new trial on the basis of this improper cross-examination. The trial judge is in the best position to determine the effect that such improper evidence may have had on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>jury, and except where there is a clear abuse of discretion in this regard a new trial will not be granted. Brown v. United States, 380 F.2d 477 (10th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">After sustaining the objection of defense counsel the trial judge promptly instructed the jury to disregard the improper question. Normally such an admonition will cure improper evidence of this kind. Beatty v. United States, 357 F.2d 19 (10th Cir.1966). This principle is applicable where substantial rights of the defendant are not affected; that is, where guilt is clear and the error is harmless. Conner v. United States, 322 F.2d 647 (5th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We have carefully reviewed the testimony presented during the five days of trial and find that the substantial rights of Appellant were not affected by the prosecutor\u2019s question. His guilt is clear and the error was harmless. Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b632-7\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">(specially concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The prosecution\u2019s effort to try the appellant as an adulterer was not confined to the testimony quoted in the majority opinion. There were repeated questions, many of them improper, going to extreme lengths, implying another illicit relationship between the appellant and a female co-defendant (not the woman referred to in the quoted testimony). The prosecution tactic was unjustified and indefensible. Nor do I have much faith in the instruction to the jury to disregard, as a ground for affirmance. For the appellate court to thus insulate the prosecutor from the effect of offers of patently illegal evidence is but an invitation to him to repeat the process in the next case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In this case the prosecution is not saved by any curative instruction from the trial court but by the character of evidence against the appellant on the matters for which he was charged. The evidence of guilt was overwhelming, in fact many of the charges were substantially admitted by appellant in his own testimony. Thus I concur in the result on the sole ground that evidence of guilt was so great that the prosecutor\u2019s attack on the appellant\u2019s moral character, though not curable by instructions, could have had but slight effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557, 1566 (1964).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
