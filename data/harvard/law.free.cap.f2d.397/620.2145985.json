Pagano, a Radarman First Class in the United States Navy, claims damages from his superior officers, Commander Samuel A. Martin and Lieutenant-Commander Howard E. Miniter, Jr., who were respectively the commanding officer and executive officer of the USS Robert A. Owens, the plaintiff\u2019s ship. The alleged defamation appears in a Report of Enlisted Performance Evaluation issued on February 2, 1967 by the defendants upon Pagano\u2019s detachment from the Owens. In substance it downgraded him sharply and recommended he not be re-enlisted in the future. Dismissal of the complaint was ordered by the District Court on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, 275 F.Supp. 498, and Pagano appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-20\">We affirm. The report authorized by the Bureau of Naval Personnel Manual, was made by the defendant officers as part of their official duties. With the trial court, we think the suit, as a matter of law, cannot be maintained. Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959); Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
