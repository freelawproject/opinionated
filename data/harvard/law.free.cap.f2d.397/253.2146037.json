Patton, 390 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 818, 19 L.Ed. 871 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In this appeal, the State of North Carolina frankly asks us to reconsider our decision in <em>Patton </em>in the light of cases considered therein which reached a contrary conclusion and subsequent decisions which have failed to follow it. This we decline to do; and because the issue on appeal is so narrow, we concluded to dispense with oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On the authority of <em>Patton, </em>the order of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
