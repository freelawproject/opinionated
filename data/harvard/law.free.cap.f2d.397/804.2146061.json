They acquired a new home a few hundred miles away and moved to it, never intending again to use the Arcadia property as a residence. It was put up for sale, and the Tax Court found that the taxpayers, during the period of time from when they vacated the home until its eventual sale, held it \u201cfor the production of income\u201d within the meaning of sections 167(a) (2) and 212(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Upon the basis of this finding, it was held that the taxpayers properly deducted maintenance expense, as well as depreciation, for that period. See Mitchell v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 120 (1966), acq., 1967-1 Cum.Bull. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">The Government makes a strong case for reversal. See Recent Developments, Hulet P. Smith, 66 Mich.L.Rev. 562 (1968). Unusual circumstances are present, however, and we are not persuaded that the Tax Court\u2019s factual finding and its consequent conclusions are clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
