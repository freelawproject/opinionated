B. Goins. The Deputy Commissioner has voluntarily dismissed his appeal, but J. B. Goins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>who intervened now prosecutes the appeal alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Appellant suffered physical injuries in \u00e1n accident on April 3, 1961, in the course and scope of his employment by Noble Drilling Corporation, for which he was paid compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. On April 2, 1962, his employer and its compensation insurer ceased compensation payments on the basis of medical reports which indicated that appellant was able to return to his previous employment at that time. However, the Deputy Commissioner found that appellant continued to be disabled subsequent to that date and issued an order which awarded additional compensation. On review of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order, the District Court held that there was no substantial evidence and no reasonable basis in the record for the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding of disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The record in this case consisted of the testimony of Goins, by personal appearance, and the written medical reports of eleven doctors who examined and treated him. Goins\u2019 employer provided six of the doctors; the other five were recommended by his attorney. The parties stipulated that if the doctors were called to testify they would testify in accordance with their respective written reports contained in the file. None of the physicians appeared in person, therefore, to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact (including his supplementary findings) contained <em>no </em>reference <em>to </em>the medical reports and no analysis of the respective medical findings of these physicians, but spoke only of the facts surrounding the accident, the resulting injury, and the expenses incurred. However, the Deputy Commissioner made an award of compensation, as we have already indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In a well-reasoned opinion the Court below made an extensive and detailed analysis of the medical reports of the eleven physicians and determined that the record as a whole lacked substantial evidence to support the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">The District Court\u2019s analysis shows that nine of the eleven doctors concluded that Goins was in good physical condition, that his shoulder had healed, and that he could and should return to the work he was doing before the injury. Some of the reports indicated that although Goins apparently favored his right arm, he showed no difficulty in performing such tasks as removing his shirt. When he was conscious of his arm movements he acted as if he was in pain, but when he was not aware of his movements he was not affected by his injury. The Trial Judge found from the medical reports that all of the first six doctors who were provided by the employer, and who examined and treated Goins, were firmly of the opinion that there was nothing physically wrong with him. These doctors consisted of a general practitioner specializing in industrial medicine, two orthopedic surgeons, a neurosurgeon, another general practitioner, and a specialist in physiotherapy. Five physicians, recommended by Goins\u2019 attorney, then examined claimant, and the Trial Court found from their reports that three of these doctors, an orthopedic surgeon, a neurosurgeon and a neuropsychiatrist, clearly supported the employer\u2019s contention that there was nothing physically wrong with Goins. One of the doctors (the neuropsychiatrist), recommended by Goins\u2019 attorney, suggested that Goins would be much better off if he were to return to his former employment and found that he is suffering from an emotional disturbance. He wrote, \u201cThe physical pain is necessary to prevent a more serious emotional disturbance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The two remaining doctors, a general surgeon and a non-board certified orthopedic surgeon, who were recommended by Goins\u2019 attorney, submitted reports that told of pain and discomfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>suffered by Goins after April 2, 1962, the date when the compensation payments ceased, but neither report contained definite statements that Goins could not or should not return to his. former employment. Of one of these the District Judge found that \u201cA less concrete and conclusive report could hardly be imagined.\u201d 226 F.Supp. at 924. As to the other medical report, the Trial Court said it was the only one which \u201cpresents any evidence that Goins was disabled subsequent to March 1962.\u201d 266 F.Supp. at 924. But the Court found this report \u201ccompletely at odds\u201d with the other examining physicians, and held that this doctor\u2019s use of \u201cmedical jargon * * * does not obscure the obvious fact that his report is nothing more than a collection of medical terms woven around the thread of the patient\u2019s own statements about the nature of his accident and his persistent complaints.\u201d 266 F.Supp. at 925. The Trial Court cited several Louisiana appellate decisions where the diagnoses of this physician have been criticized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The scope of judicial review of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact in a Longshoremen\u2019s Act ease is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., and this standard is that \u201cthe findings are to be accepted unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., 340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 472, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951), (citing Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Rel. Bd., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The review, however, is not to be a mere rubber-stamping of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order when the reviewing Court is unable to conscientiously conclude that the evidence supporting such decision is substantial. N. L. R. B. v. O. A. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., 5 Cir., 1967, 374 F.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">In our view the Trial Court was able to evaluate the several medical reports, in the absence of personal appearances by all the physicians, as well as the Deputy Commissioner. His finding that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order was not supported by substantial evidence is not clearly erroneous, and we believe it is correct. Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-13\">.
