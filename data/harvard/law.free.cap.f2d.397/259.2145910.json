The amended complaint predicates jurisdiction of the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">Basically, the amended complaint alleges that appellant\u2019s rights, conferred by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, and by the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">It is to be borne in mind that the appeal before us is not one from a final judgment after trial, or from a summary judgment finally disposing of the case. It is here on an appeal from an order denying appellant\u2019s prayer for a preliminary injunction pendente lite, following a hearing on an order to show cause issued to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">The law is well-settled that the granting or withholding of a preliminary injunction rests in the sound judicial discretion of the trial court. See Maas v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 251, 371 F.2d 348 (1966); Dymo Industries, Inc. v. Tapeprinter, Inc., 326 F.2d 141 (9th Cir. 1964); B. W. Photo Utilities v. Republic Molding Corporation, 280 F.2d 806 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">We have examined the record and cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s prayer for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court, and suggest that the trial of the cause on the merits be expedited. We further suggest that court and counsel give consideration to the applicability of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 to this cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
