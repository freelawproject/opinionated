In 1962 the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was amended to provide an investment credit for manufacturing machinery. The investment credit was to apply to such machines when \u201cacquired after December 31, 1961.\u201d Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 48(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The machine which is the subject of this dispute was invoiced by the manufacturer and seller on December 29, 1961. It was physically picked up by a rigging company at the manufacturer\u2019s plant on December 29, 1961, and it was delivered to the taxpayer\u2019s plant on January 2, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">The contract under which the machine was sold called for it to be delivered to the purchaser f. o. b. carrier, Gilead, Ohio, the site of the manufacturer\u2019s plant. It called for both transportation and erecting to be done by the purchaser, who is the taxpayer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">The statutory language which we have cited above has been interpreted by a Treasury Regulation upon which the taxpayer here relies. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.48-2(b) (6) (1964): \u201cProperty shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession, or control.\u201d Taxpayer contends with great vigor that the word \u201cphysical\u201d in this regulation should be read as amending both the word \u201cpossession\u201d and the word \u201ccontrol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">We find no need to pass on that contention. The taxpayer (as required by the contract) hired the rigger who transported and erected the machine. The machine was in the taxpayer\u2019s physical possession and physical control through his agent from December 29 on.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
