Where a judgment has been recovered against a man in his lifetime, it may be revived after his death, for the purpose of lien and execution, by a scire facias to revive, <em>et quare execuiionem non, </em>issued against his personal representatives alone. In such case it is unnecessary to bring in the widow and heirs by a scire facias against them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b266-9\">2. It is immaterial that at the time of the defendant\u2019s death the judgment was more than five years old, and that a scire facias to revive, which ' had been issued against the defendant within the five years, was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Ms death pending and undetermined. The judgment as between the original parties having been a valid subsisting lien on the land at the time o\u00ed the defendant\u2019s death, it was unnecessary to warn the widow and heirs in addition to proceeding against the administratrix for revival and execution. Nor was it necessary to issue a sci. fa., under the 27th section of the Act of February 24, 1834, to require the administratrix to become a party to the pending sci. fa. to revive, issued against the defendant in his lifetime, and undetermined at Ms death.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-6\">3. A judgment entered against an administratrix by default for want of an appearance in a sci. fa. to revive a judgment obtained against her intestate in his lifetime, is a valid judgment, and a sheriff\u2019s sale under an execution thereon wdll, if otherwise valid, pass a good and marketable title to land of which the decedent was seised.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-7\">4.

An error in the described courses of land conveyed by a sheriff\u2019s deed, which can be corrected by other descriptive matter in the deed, so as to locate with reasonable certainty the land intended to be conveyed, is immaterial, and does not prevent the deed from vesting in the grantee a good and marketable title.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b267-9\">April 7, 1884.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AbVG\">Before Mercur, C.

And thereupon plaintiffs on March 1, 1883, duly executed, acknowledged, and tendered to defendants a deed in due form for said tracts of land, and demanded payment of the said price of thirty thousand dollars. Defendant refused to accept the deed, or pay the money, on the ground that such deed would not pass a good and marketable title in fee simple to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-13\">One John W. Middleton was in his lifetime seised of said lands in fee simple subject to the lien of a judgment entered in the District Court for the city and county of Philadelphia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>at the suit of plaintiffs\u2019 testator, Allen Middleton, against the said John W. Middleton to December Term, 1872, No. 1911. Said judgment was entered February 26, 1873, for $35,841.63, and was the fifth judgment of revival of a confessed judgment entered in the same court March 29, 1853, to March Term, 1853, No. 91.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">Afterwards Allen Middleton died, and plaintiffs, his executors, having been substituted, on December 1, 1877, issued a sci. fa. against John W.

Wright executed deeds for the same to plaintiffs, which deeds were acknowledged in open Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, for the county of Philadelphia, July 12,1879, and entered among the records thereof. The grant in said deeds was in the following words, to wit: \u201c Plave granted, bargained and sold, and by these presents according to the directions of the said writ and by force and virtue thereof, and the Constitution and laws of this Commonwealth in such case made and provided, do grant, bargain and sell unto the said Charles Middleton, Allen Middleton, William de Cou, and Howard W.

It appears that a judgment was obtained on February 26,1873, against a certain John W. Middleton. On Dec. 1877, a sci. fa. was issued against him to revive it; to this defendant pleaded payment, and issue was joined, which, at the time of his death, Dec. 1878, was pending and undetermined. On February 26, 1879, a sci. fa. was issued against Sarah Middleton, administratrix, which was not in form a sci. fa. to bring in the personal representatives, but a soi. fa. to revive, and on this a money judgment was taken. As the only prior judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>inent bore date in 1878, it was clearly too late for this process to revive it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\">\u201cThe most favorable construction on the proceeding is to regard it as intended to bring in the personal representatives, and to consider the judgment as valid against the administrator. This the plaintiff contends is all that can be required. That when there is a valid, unimpeached judgment existing at the death of the defendant, the bringing in of heirs by sci. fa. is not necessary: McMillan <em>v. </em>Red, 4 W. &amp; S., 237. But can this judgment be so considered? Its revival was contested by the defendant, and his plea of payment on his death left undetermined. Was this not, in the words of the Act of 1834, \u201can action or legal proceeding depending\u201d at the death of the defendant, and' was it not the duty of the plaintiff, if he wished to charge the lands, to bring in the heirs? They clearly have had no day in court. Their ancestor was resisting this claim in a proper legal forum to the day of his death, after which a judgment was entered against an administrator, and the only notice taken of the heirs was to sell their property under it. Certainly this is the'very evil the Act of 1834 was intended to prevent. Entertaining these views on the main objection to the title, we do not think it necessary to discuss the minor ones. The title, in oiir opinion, is not so free from doubt as to the rights of the heirs of John W. Middleton as to compel its acceptance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">\u201c Judgment for defendant on case stated, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">\u25a0 The plaintiffs took this writ of error and filed the following specifications of errors:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">1.

In the ease of descriptive errors, where no one is shown to have been injured thereby, the same rules of construction applicable to deeds inter partes apply to sheriffs\u2019 deeds: White <em>v. </em>Luning, 93 U. S., 514; Martz <em>v. </em>Hartley, 4 Watts, 263; Cox <em>v. </em>Couch, 8 Barr, 154; Petts <em>v. </em>Gaw, 3 Harris, 218; Quinn <em>v. </em>Heart, 7 Wr., 337; Wood <em>v. </em>Appal, 13 P. F.

The error the court fell into was consequent upon the assumption that the sci. fa. of 1879 was intended as a sci. fa. to bring in personal representatives to defend a pending litigation, whereas in form and in fact it was a sci. fa. under the 33d section of the Act of 24th of February, 1834, to show cause why execution should not issue on the judgment obtained against the decedent in his lifetime, in 1873. Also, in not adverting to the effect <em>of the </em>sci. fa. of 1879 as an abandonment of the pending sci. fa. of 1877. That such was its effect is clearly decided in Meason\u2019s Estate, 4 Watts, 341.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-11\"><em>E. Copp\u00e9e Mitchell (Horace E.

Middleton was originally entered in 1853; it was revived several times, the last judgment of revival in defendant\u2019s lifetime being entered. February 26,1873. He died in December, 1878. Prior to his death, to wit, December 1, 1877, a sci. fa. to revive the judgment was issued against him, which was contested at every step, by affidavit of defence, pleas, petition to remove to United States Circuit Court, bill of discovery, etc., and which was pending and undetermined when the defendant died. Upon his death being suggested of record that contest oeased, and a new sci. fa. was immediately issued against his administratrix, who, failing to appear, permitted judgment to be taken by default, and at the sheriff\u2019s sale, under that judgment, the defaulting administratrix herself bought two properties for $50, and the execution plaintiffs bought the rest for $100, which the latter, within two years, sold to defendant in error for $30,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">On the same day that the sci. fa. was issued against the administratrix a sci. fa. was issued to bring in the heirs of the decedent, but it was only partially served, and no further proceedings were had thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">We have then the following state of facts disclosed by the record : (1.) The validity of the judgment was actually contested by the defendant in his life time. (2.) After his death the proceedings in which this contest was going' on were ignored and abandoned. (3.) Ho defence whatever Avas made by defendants\u2019 administratrix. (4.) She bought part of the property in her own right, and apparently for her oavii benefit, at the sheriff\u2019s sale. (5.) Property of great value Avas bid in by plaintiffs at the sheriff\u2019s sale for a nominal sum: $30,000 worth for $100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">These facts Avere quite enough to excite suspicion and were ample warning to put a purchaser on inquiry as to the rights .of the heirs, who have had no day in court, and suggest the language of Woodwakd, J., in Riland <em>v. </em>Eckert, 11 Har., 215 \u2014 \u201ccollusive judgments, Avhich are sometimes concocted between faithless administrators or executors and pretended creditors, and which have been used for stripping families of their inheritance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">At the time of the decedent\u2019s death an \u201c action or legal proceeding was depending,\u201d to wit, the sci. fa. against the defendant to revive the judgment; this brings the ease directly within the 27th section of the Act of February 24, 1834, which provides: \u201c The court in which <em>any action or legal proceeding may be depending </em>as aforesaid shall have power to require, by a writ of scire facias, such executors or administrators, within twenty days after the service thereof, to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>come party to such action or proceeding, or to show cause, at the next succeeding term, why they should not be made party thereto by judgment of the court, and further proceedings be had in such action or proceeding.\u201d The sci. fa., then, ought to have been a sci. fa. to require the administratrix to become a party to the proceeding pending at the decedent\u2019s death. The 33d section of that Act, providing that after the death of a judgment debtor no execution shall issue on the judgment, without a prior sci. fa. against his personal representatives, is prohibitory, not permissive, and it cannot apply to a case like the present, where the plaintiff, at the time of defendant\u2019s death, could not have had execution himself, if living. For the same reason McMillan <em>v. </em>Red, and the other cases relied on by plaintiff in error, are inapplicable. Suppose that this judgment had been opened on the motion of the defendant, in his lifetime, showing <em>prima facie </em>a good defence to it, and he had died after issue joined and before his defence had been determined, will it be contended that the plaintiffs could then have ignored this defence and taken judgment by default against the administratrix? And yet that would not have been more entirely a \u201c proceeding depending \u201d than this case as it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">But it is said by plaintiffs that the court below fell into error \u201cin not adverting to the effect of the sci. fa. of 1879 as an abandonment of the pending sci. fa. of 1877.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">The only cases in which it has been held that a plaintiff may, for his own advantage, abandon a sci. fa. to revive, are where, in his first sci. fa. he has failed to make the t\u00e9rro tenant a party, hut has obtained a judgment of revival against the defendant alone; he may, (if in time) have another sci. fa. upon the original judgment, against the defendant and the torre tenant, to continue the lien against land which the defendant has aliened since the judgment: Fursht <em>v. </em>Over-deer, 3 W. &amp;. S., 470; Little <em>v. </em>Smyser, 10 Barr, 381. It had been previously determined in several cases that a recovery in a sci. fa. to revive a judgment was a bar to any further sci. fa. on the same judgment: Collingwood <em>v. </em>Carson, 2 <em>W. &amp; </em>S., 220; Custer <em>v. </em>Detterer, 3 W. &amp; S., 28; and the exception was established to enable a plaintiff to correct his mistake by a new writ including the terre tenant. It is submitted that no case can be found where a plaintiff has, by the device of abandoning a sci. fa. issued against a defendant in his lifetime, rid himself of a substantial defence pending and undetermined at the time of defendant\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">There was, in the early cases, some difficulty in laying down the principles upon which the sci. fa. to revive a judgment should be regarded \u2014 whether as a common law writ of scire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>facias, or as an action of debt upon the judgment. The result was, after a good deal of litigation, that with respect to the right to judgment upon two sheriff\u2019s returns of \u201c nihil,\u201d the action should be assimilated to a common law sci. fa., in which two returns were equivalent to garnishment (which even quite recently has not been free from doubt: See Taylor <em>v. </em>Toung, 21 P. F. S., 81), and that as to the form of the judgment, it should be.the same as in an action of debt \u201c quod recuperet,\u201d which is entirely different from the judgment on a sci. fa. at common law. So that where the defendant is living, a judgment on a sci. fa. is a new judgment, and has a lien on all estate owned by defendant at the time of its entry, without regard to the lien of the original judgment: Duff <em>v. </em>Wynkoop, 24 P. F. S., 300; Fursht <em>v. </em>Overdeer, 3 W. &amp; S., 470; Stewart <em>v. </em>Peterson, 13 P. F. S., 230. But the judgment \u201c quod recuperet,\u201d is given only in cases where the defendant is living. When he is dead, and the sci. fa. is against his personal representatives, the judgment is prescribed in each case by the statute which directs and regulates the sci. fa. Under the 33d Section of the Act of 1834, by virtue of which the plaintiff claims to have proceeded, the judgment is an award of execution, inasmuch as that section requires that the executor or, administrator be warned \u201c to show cause against the issuing thereof.\u201d Hence such a judgment has a lien only on the land bound by the lien of the original judgment which has been revived. The new judgment is but a continuation of the original lien, and not a new judgment, \u201c <em>quod </em>recuperet: \u201d Shaeffer <em>v. </em>Child, 7 Watts, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-4\">\u25a0 The deed from the sheriff to the plaintiffs \u201cexecutors of Allen Middleton, deceased, <em>their successors and assigns,\" </em>Avas not a sufficient deed to vest in them an estate of inheritance: 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com., 104, 107; Gray <em>v. </em>Packer, 4 W. &amp; S., 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">. The error in the description of the thirty-three acre tract in the fi. fa. vend. ex. and sheriff\u2019s deed was a fatal error. By protracting the description it appears that a large piece of the land, included in the sale to defendant, is not included in that which, was levied on, and sold by the sheriff. There is nothing to amend the sheriff\u2019s deed by, inasmuch as both the condemnation in the fi. fa. and the vend. ex. contain precisely the same description as the sheriff\u2019s deed.' It was competent for the sheriff to have taken in execution a part only of the land pf John.W. Middleton; and who can say that he did not mean to do so, in face of the fact that that is just what he did.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-V\">October 6, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-6\">Mr. Justice Stekrett</author>\n<p id=\"A-S\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The general question presented by the case stated is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>whether the plaintiffs\u2019 title to certain real estate, of which John W.

Within five years thereafter, a <em>scire facias </em>to revive, &amp;c., was issued against the defendant in the judgment, to which he pleaded payment, and the issue joined thereon was pending and undetermined at the time of his decease in December, 1878. No further proceedings were had in that case; but, in February, 1879, a <em>scire </em>facias, to revive <em>et quare executionem non </em>was issued on the original judgment, served on Sarah Middleton, administratrix of John W. Middleton; and, in default of appearance, judgment was entered and amount liquidated at $&gt;49,282.23. By virtue of a <em>fieri facias </em>issued on the judgment the real estate in question was levied on, condemned and afterwards sold by the sheriff on a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>and by him conveyed to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">It is claimed by the plaintiffs, on the authority of Fetter-man <em>v. </em>Murphy, 4 Watts, 424, Brobst <em>v. </em>Bright, 8 Id., 124, Wells <em>v. </em>Baird, 3 Barr., 351, Konigmaker <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 Harris, 269, Baxter <em>v. </em>Allen, 27 P. F. Smith, 468, and a long line of kindred cases, that the judgment on the <em>scire facias </em>against the administratrix and subsequent sale by the sheriff were sufficient to invest the purchasers with a good marketable title. It is virtually conceded by the learned counsel for defendant that this would be so, were it not for the fact that an issue on the former <em>scire facias </em>was pending and undetermined at the death of the defendant in the original judgment. We are of opinion, however, that this feature of the case can make no difference \u2014 that it is insufficient to distinguish the case in principle from those above cited. Notwithstanding the pendency of the issue in the first <em>scire facias </em>and the fact that more than five years had elapsed since the entry of the original judgment, as between the judgment creditor and his debtor, the judgment was a valid, subsisting lien on the land at the date of the defendant\u2019s death in December, 1878: Brown\u2019s Appeal, 10 Norris, 485. According to well settled principles it was therefore unnecessary to make his widow and heirs parties before proceeding to execution against the real estate of the intestate bound by the lien of the judgment recovered in his lifetime: Shearer <em>v. </em>Brindley, 26 P. F. Smith, 300, and cases there cited. The administratrix might have appeared and defended the issue on the <em>scire facias </em>against her intestate, but she did not do so: nor did she appear to the <em>scire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>faeias </em>issued against herself. The judgment in default of appearance and the, subsequent proceedings were not irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The estate conveyed by the sheriff\u2019s deed was not limited by the omission of words of inheritance. The Act of June 16, 1836, provides that real estate sold by the sheriff shall be held and enjoyed by the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, as fully and amply, and for such estate or estates as the defendant had therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The error in describing the land sold and conveyed by the sheriff is immaterial. The erroneous courses may be corrected by the description contained in the deed, and thus the land intended to be conveyed may be readily located with reasonable certainty. In the case of descriptive errors, where no one is shown to be injured thereby, the rules of construction, applicable to deeds <em>inter </em>partes, apply also to sheriffs\u2019 deeds: White et al. <em>v. </em>Luning, 93 U. S., 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Upon due consideration of the facts presented in the case stated we are of opinion that the deeds therein referred to, in connection with the proceedings resulting in the sheriff\u2019s sale, vested in plaintiffs a good and marketable title in fee simple to said tracts of land, and hence they are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Judgment reversed, and judgment on the case stated is now entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for thirty thousand ($30,000) dollars with interest from March 1, 1883, and costs; said judgment to be satisfied of record upon the defendant paying the amount thereof, with costs, and plaintiffs giving him a deed, in fee simple, clear of all incumbrances, for said tracts of land.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
