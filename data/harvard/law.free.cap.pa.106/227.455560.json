It is in these words: \u201cWhenever a deed or other instrument of writing conveying real estate, shall be made, wherein shall be contained a reservation of ground-rent to become perpetual upon the failure of a purchaser to comply with the condition therein contained, no such covenant or condition shall be so construed as to make such ground-rent a perpetual incumbrance upon said real estate; and it shall or may be lawful for the purchaser at any time after the said ground-rent shall have fallen dne to pay the full amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the same, and such payment shall be a complete discharge of, such real estate from the incumbrance aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\">In the present case, after reserving a yearly ground-rent of forty-five dollars to be paid in equal half-}rearly payments \u201c in every year hereafter <em>forever,\u201d </em>it was further provided that if, at any time within ten years, the said Nathan Smedley shall pay the said sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars, and the arrearages of said rent to the time of payment, then- the same shall forever thereafter cease and be extinguished, and the covenant for the payment thereof shall become void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">It may be true that there is no direct prohibition in our law against creating perpetual ground-rents, and there is certainly nothing in the section we have quoted which forbids it. But it is very clear to our minds that the legislature did not intend that they should be created from any failure or inahilit}r on the part of the tenant to avail himself of a privilege which the deed afforded him. That while the parties might, if they chosej make a perpetual rent by so expressing it in unmistakable words, they would not permit the court to do so by the construction of any condition which would produce that result. This rent at its creation was clearly not marketable as an irredeemable ground-rent. Certainly for ten years no one could truthfully designate it \u2014 it could only become so by the failure to pay on the day the sum designated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">Of the legislature\u2019s intent there can be no doubt, for subsequently, April 15, 1869, P. L., 47, they passed an Act entitled an Act for the extinguishment of irredeemable ground-rents, reciting that the policy of this Commonwealth has always been to encourage the free transmission of real estate, and to remove restraints on alienation, so that it is and is hereby declared necessary for the public use to provide a method of extinguishing such irredeemable ground-rents, having a due regard to private rights. This purpose, as to extinguishment of ground-rents, was defeated by the decision of Palairet\u2019s Appeal, 67 Pa. St., 488, which declared the law unconstitutional. The fact, however, remains that in the opinion of the legislature, these rents were contrary to public policy and should not be permitted to exist, and when then we come to consider these enactments in this regard we should not endeavor to defeat, by narrow technical construction, their obvious meanings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">The defendants took this writ of error, assigning for error said judgment for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-9\"><em>Angelo T. Freedley </em>and <em>William Henry Rawle, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQu\">It may be that the legislature intended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Act of 1850 to embrace ground-rents such as the one in question. It was so considered by some at that time, and attention was at once called to it in an able article in 2 American Law Register, 589. But whether it <em>has </em>done so, is another question. The rules of construction of statutes which merely give or increase a remedy, are different from the rules applicable to those which affect a right, or, still more, an estate; \u2018 an estate whose market value is taken from one to be given to another. In tire latter case, and especially where there is no ambiguity as to the words of the statute, no argument is permitted as to \u201c the spirit of the statute,\u201d or \u201c the equity of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">In this case the owners of the land conveyed the same to Nathan Smedley, in consideration of the payment of an annual rent of forty-five dollars, <em>\u201cin each and every year theraafter for </em>ever,\u201d and they further gave the said Nathan Smedley an option of extinguishing the said rent by paying a lump sum of $750 before September, 1861. The option was not obligatory upon him. He did not covenant to pay the lump sum. On the contrary, lie declined to exercise this option, and it expired over twenty-two years ago. The plaintiffs below who were not the original vendees, now demand that this unilateral option shall bo indefinitely extended for their benefit, and that the defendants shall be deprived of their estate in the rent against their consent, and that they shall convey such estate to the said plaintiffs. The vendor and his assigns have an estate in the rent, and the vendee and his assigns have an estate in the land subject to the rent. Each estate is of the same dignify iu the law as the other, and of neither can the <em>owner </em>be deprived against his assent, and each estate is, as was said in Palairet\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith, 487, \u201c an estate in fee simple, descendible, devisable, alienable.\u201d Apart from certain rules of law which have no application to this case, there is none which dictates or prescribes the duration or quantify of estate which one man may sell to another. No rule of law exists which prohibits a vendor from parting with his property in consideration of an annual rent. Thus, leasehold estates for long term of years are very common in England, in New York, and are not unknown here. Cadwalader <em>v. </em>App, 31 P. F. Smith, 194, was a case of a lease for ten thousand years at an annual rent of thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents. And no legal distinction can be suggested between a lease for one or ten thousand years with a <em>reddendum, </em>and the grant of an estate in fee with a <em>reddendum. </em>And the insertion of a provision whereby the <em>reddendum </em>can be capitalized and paid off is, like a clause of re-entry or the like, merely one of the incidents of the contract. It may bo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>altogether omitted, and if so the duration of the estate granted and the duration of the <em>reddendum </em>will be co-existent. They will begin and end at the same time. Hence, where the vendor has given the vendee a mere option to extinguish the rent within a given time by the payment of a lump sum, there is no rule which compels him to indefinite!]\u2019 extend that option to the assigns of the vendee, against the vendor\u2019s will. An owner may impose any lawful condition as the consideration of parting with his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-4\">There were and are three classes of ground-rent deeds in Pennsylvania:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">1. Those in which the rent is perpetual, and no provision is made for capitalizing the <em>reddendum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">2. Those in which the <em>reddendum </em>is perpetual, but provision is made at the option of the purchaser, for capitalizing it by payment of a gross sum before, at, or after a certain named time. If the option is not exercised according to its terms, the <em>reddendum </em>continues to be perpetual,</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\">3. Those in which the <em>reddendum </em>is not perpetual, but, like the principal of a mortgage debt, falls due and is demandable by the grantor within a certain time, and in default of payment, thereafter becomes perpetual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">Over fifty years ago, certain vendees attempted to do precisely what the present defendants in error now attempt, but their petition was dismissed by the court as being \u201c manifestly inequitable: \u201d Shoemaker\u2019s Estate, 1 Rawle, 89. To produce this \u201c manifestly inequitable \u201d result, the defendants in error base their application solely upon the Act of 22d April, 1850, section 21, P. L., 553, Purdon, 748.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">Evidently the first class of cases does not come within the statute. As to the second class of cases. The value of an investment ordinarily depends largely upon its length of life. A loan which lacks twenty or thirty years of its maturity is worth a fourth or a third more in the market than one which may be paid off next year. The market value of a <em>reddendum </em>which cannot be compulsorily paid off at all is, equally, enormously greater than one which can. Hence the effect contended to be given to the statute is to take the market value of the rent away from its owner and give it to the owner of the land. No plea of convenience or even of public policy can justify this, as was decided by this court in Palairet\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith, 479, where an Act of the legislature having declared that it was \u201c necessary for the public use to provide a method of extinguishing irredeemable ground-rents, having a due regard for private rights,\u201d it was held that this could not be done \u2014 that it was a taking of private property for private use, and that no legislative declaration could make that public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>which was simply private, irrespective of general public convenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">Now in the present deed, the <em>reddendum </em>has four qualities which take it out of the application of the Act of 1850.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">1. The deed does <em>not- </em>contain any \u201c reservation of ground-rent to become perpetual upon the failure of the purchaser to comply with the conditions therein contained.\u201d On the contrary, a perpetual rent was stipulated and expressly contracted for. The rent was <em>nob </em>to become perpetual upon noncompliance with any condition. It was in its <em>origin </em>perpetual, and this was the essence of the contract. To this was super-added a mere option for a limited time, not compulsory on the purchaser, but merely permissive. No \u201c condition \u201d was imposed upon the \u201c purchaser.\u201d There was, no penalty imposed for liis \u201cfailure to comply.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">2. There is here <em>no </em>\u201c covenant or condition to be construed to make the rent a perpetual incumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\">3. The ground-rent never has <em>\u201cfallen due.\u201d </em>It is not a lien, \u2014 it is an estate. No time was fixed within which it <em>must </em>be redeemed, nor did the purchaser covenant that he would pay it in a definite time, or at any time; he had merely an option to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">4. The ground-rent is not an \u201cincumbrance.\u201d It has none of the qualities of an incumbrance \u2014 the arrears may be, but the <em>reddendum </em>itself is <em>an </em>estate, not susceptible of discharge by a sheriff's sale or any process known to the law. Any attempt to make it otherwise has always failed : <em>In re </em>Shoemaker, 1 Rawle, 89; <em>JEx parte </em>Huff, 2 Barr., 227. The only decision upon the Act of 1850 favors our view: Skelly\u2019s Appeal, 11 W. N. C., 11, which decides that the Act of 1850 can only bo applied to cases falling within its terms, and does not prevent a postponement of redemption by the contract of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-12\">But the third class of ground-rents does literally and exactly fulfil every provision of the Act; and it is to this class that the Act of 1850 solely relates. There, the evident intent of the parties is to fix a time for redemption. They contract not for an estate, but for a mere security \u2014 a lien or incumbrance. Of this species of rents, Springer <em>v. </em>Phillips, 21 P. F. Smith, 60, is an example. There are also others, see Recorder\u2019s Deed-book, Philadelphia county, G. W. C., No. 89, page 434; Id., page 439, &amp;c. Thus, in the language of the statute: (1.) The ground-rent <em>does </em>become perpetual <em>solely </em>by reason of the failure of the purchaser to comply with the conditions. (2.) There <em>is </em>a \u201ccovenant or condition tobe construed.\u201d (3.) As the purchaser covenants to pay, a definite time is fixed for redemption, after which the rent has <em>\u201cfallen due.\u201d </em>(4.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ground-rent is a mere <em>incumbrance. </em>Such ground-rents were in reality in the nature of mortgages, with a superadded limitation in the nature of a penalty in case of breach of the covenant to pay within the specified time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-4\">It may be greatly doubted whether the application of the Act of 1850 to this species of rents would not render the statute unconstitutional within Palairet\u2019s Appeal, 17 P. F. S., 479.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-5\"><em>John Bethell </em>Uhle, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvF\">The following dates contain the key to the correct solution of this controversy :</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">1849, May 5.

Tender and refusal of the redemption moneys, and of the deed for the extinguishment of this rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-12\">This ground-rent is within the provisions of the Act of 1850. A deed or indenture, \"in the usual form, was made, conveying certain premises in fee, and expressly reserving the rent. The purchaser named in the deed, \u201c his heirs or assigns,\u201d were given, by express covenant, the right to pay the redemption moneys, on condition that such payment be made \u201c at any time within ten years from the date \u201d of the deed. As soon, therefore, as this deed was made, the redemption moneys had \u201cfallen due \u201d or become payable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-13\">The Act of 1850, having been enacted prior to the creation of this ground-rent, must be read into the deed, and the argument as to taking away a vested right of the covenautees is, therefore, inapplicable to the case. If there were any doubts as to the right to redeem under the Act of 1850, it is removed by the supplement of April 19, 1864,- P. L., 487 ; Purd. Dig., 749, pi. 5. The plaintiffs in error admit that the legislature intended to effect the result we contend for, but found, technical arguments upon the literal term \u201c fallen due,\u201d \u201c incumbrance,\u201d etc., as applicable to a lien merely, whereas they are equally applicable to a rent reserved, subject to extinguish1 ment by payment of the redemption money. There are, practically no ground-rents in existence such as plaintiffs in error describe in their third classification, and to confine the Act to such theoretical rents will render it wholly illusory. For thirty years since the passage of the Act the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>it lias been as we now maintain it should be, and very many similar ground rents have been extinguished under the advice of able counsel.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ABj\">October 6, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-4\">Mr. Justice Sterrett</author>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It may Ido that the twenty-first section of the Act of April 22, 1850, was intended to apply to ground-rent deeds such as that under consideration; but, in our opinion, the language employed will not admit of that construction. The Act declares, \u201cWhenever a deed or other instrument of writing conveying real estate shall be made, wherein shall be contained a reservation of ground-rent to become perpetual, upon the failure of the purchaser to comply with the conditions therein contained, no such covenant or condition shall be so construed as to make the said ground-rent a perpetual incumbrance upon the said real estate; but it shall and may be lawful for the purchaser thereof, at any time after said ground-rent shall have fallen due, to pay the full amount of the same, and such payment shall be a complete discharge of such real estate from the incumbrance aforesaid: \u201d Purd., 748, pl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The deed, recited in the ease stated, after reserving a yearly ground-rent of forty-five dollars, payable in half yearly instalments of twenty-seven dollars each \u201c in every year hereafter forever,\u201d contains a provision that if the grantee \u201chis heirs or assigns shall and do at any time, within, ten years from the date hereof, pay or cause to be paid to the grantors, or survivors or survivor of them, their or his heirs or assigns the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars and the arrearages of such yearly rent to the time of such payment, then the same shall forever thereafter cease and be extinguished, and the covenant for payment thereof shall become void; \u201d and the grantors shall then execute and deliver to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, a sufficient release and discharge of the said 3'early rent. It will be observed that this instrument differs from an ordinary irredeemable ground-rent deed only in this, that it secures to the grantee an option which he may or may not, according to his own pleasure, exercise within the time specified in the deed. It contains no covenant on his part to pay the capitalized sum, within the time named, or at any time. In this respect it differs widely from the deed under consideration in Springer <em>v. </em>Phillips, 21 P. E. Smith, 60. The ground rent reserved is in terms perpetual, subject only to the unilateral privilege given to the grantee which must be exercised by him, if at all, during the ten years and not thereafter. It contains no condition, upon the failure to comply with which by the grantee, the ground-rent becomes perpetual, and hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>it does not possess tlie distinguishing feature that appears to have been contemplated by the framers of the statute. If the language they employed means anything, they must have had in view an instrument containing, as the Act itself expresses it, a reservation of ground-rent, not perpetual in its inception, but to become perpetual upon the failure' of the vendee to comply with a covenant or condition, to that effect, contained in the instrument; and, hence it is provided that no such covenant or condition shall be so construed as to make such ground-rent a perpetual incumbrance, and it shall be lawful for the purchaser, at any time after the ground-rent shall have fallen due, to pay the full amount thereof, etc. In the deed before us there is no provision, express or implied, that the ground-rent therein reserved shall become perpetual upon the failure of the vendee to comply with any covenant or condition therein contained. On the contrary, it contains an express covenant for the payment, perpetually, of the rent reserved. It is to be paid semi-annually, \u201cin every year hereafter forever; \u201d and this is the very essence of the contract. To this is superadded a naked, unilateral option, limited as to time long since expired, wholly permissive, and in no sense whatever obligatory on the grantee, his heirs or assigns ; and \u25a0hence there is no covenant or condition to be broken, or so construed as to make the rent a perpetual incumbrance. In its very inception the rent reserved was perpetual and continued to be so. We are therefore of opinion that the Act does not apply to ground-rent deeds of the class to which the one before us belongs. But there is a class of ground-rents to which it is perhaps applicable, viz: those in which the annual rent is not perpetual, but the capitalized rent, like the principal of a mortgage debt, falls due and is demandable by the grantor, at or within a certain time, and in default of payment, the rent thereafter becomes perpetual. The only question with which we are now concerned, howevei\u2019, is whether upon a fair and reasonable construction of the Act, the deed before us is within its provisions. For reasons that have been briefly suggested and others that might be added, we think it \u2022is not; and hence the defendants in the case stated were entitled to judgment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Judgment reversed, and judgment on the case stated is now entered in .favor of the plaintiffs in error defendants in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
