The parties submitted the following case stated for the judgment of the court as upon a special verdict:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">1. James Dundas died in the city of Philadelphia, on the fourth day of July, 1865, leaving a will, a copy of which is annexed hereto, which said will was duly admitted to probate in the office of the Register of wills for Philadelphia county, and letters testamentary thereon were granted to Joshua Lippincott, Richard Smethurst, and James Dundas Lippincott, the executors in the said will named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">2.

At the time of his death James Dundas was seised in fee of thirteen undivided thirty-second parts of a certain tract of land situated partly in Branch and partly in Norwegian townships, Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, the same being more particularly described in a deed from William Wag'!ier and wife, and Benjamin Nehf and wife, to James Dundas, William Richardson, Joshua Lippincott, and Benjamin W. Richards, bearing date March 30, 1847, and recorded in the office for recording deeds, etc., in Schuykill county, in Deed-book No. 27, page 278.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-10\">4. At an Orphans\u2019 Court for Philadelphia county, held on the seventeenth day of March, 1888, the petition of J. Dundas Lippincott, sole surviving executor of James Dundas, deceased, was presented, setting forth, among other things, that under the powers contained in said will said petitioner, as surviving executor aforesaid, was about to sell at public sale certain coal lands belonging to said estate, situate in the county of Schuylkill, and also certain unproductive real estate situate in the city of Philadelphia; that said petitioner was, under'the provisions of said will, the owner of sixteen equal fortieth parts or shares of the residuary estate of said testator, including the real estate then about to be sold; that said petitioner was desirous of becoming a bidder at the proposed sale of said lands for the purpose of protecting his interests therein, which he was advised as executor he could not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>perly do without the authority of said court, and he further desired, for the benefit and protection of all parties interested in the said real estate and the sale thereof, that the same be had and conducted under the direction and control of a Master to be appointed for the purpose by said court. The said petitioner therefore prayed said court to make an order that he be authorized and permitted to bid at the sale or sales of said lands, and that a Master be appointed for the purpose of conducting- said sales. Whereupon the said court granted leave to said petitioner to bid at any and all sale or sales of said real estate referred to in said petition, and ordered that Henry C. Olmsted, Esq., be appointed Master to conduct the said sale or sales to be made as aforesaid. And at an Orphans\u2019 Court, hold on the seventh day of July, A. D., 1883, the said Henry G. Olmsted, Esq., Master aforesaid, made report that said properties were exposed at public sale by the Messrs. Freeman at the Philadelphia Exchange, on Wednesday, June 6, 1888, at twelve o\u2019clock, after due notice being given of the time and place of sale, and that parcel No. 1, being an undivided interest in the coal lands known as the Leonard Head Tract, containing twenty-nine acres, more or less (being the premises in question), was sold to the Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company, at the rate of $1,000 per acre, whereupon the said court, upon consideration of said report, ratified and confirmed said sale (inter alia), and authorized the said surviving executor of James Dundas, deceased, to execute the necessary and proper conveyances and assurances of the interest of the said Jamos Dundas, deceased, at the time of his decease of and in the said real estate as to parcel No. 1 thereof aforesaid, to the said The Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">The said J. Dundas Lippincott, sole surviving executor and trustee under the last will and testament of James Dundas, deceased, the plaintiff, has offered to execute and deliver to the Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company, trustees as aforesaid, a fee simple deed in the usual form for the said premises, but the said defendant has refused to receive the same, alleging that the said plaintiff does not, under the will of the said James Dundas, show in himself the lawful authority and power to convey the title to the said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">If the court shall bo of opinion that under the will of James Dundas, deceased, the said J.

We do not regard item 17 of the will as such a direction.\u201d The defendants took this writ of error, assigning for error the said judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>Samuel Dickson </em>(72. <em>D.

It is difficult to imagino a stronger mode for the testator to express his intent that the power should not be exercised by a surviving executor than in the words of the seventeenth item. viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-4\">\u201cIf any of my executors shall die, or decline the executor-ship, <em>it shall be the duty </em>of the acting executors to appoint another <em>in the place </em>of the executor so dying or declining, and to make such conveyances and do such acts as may invest the said substituted executor <em>from time to </em>time, as occasion may arise, with the same rights and powers which are given to the <em>executors named </em>in this my will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">The words \u201cit shall be the duty\u201d are mandatory; they impose a trust which would be compelled by the court: Doed. Dupleix <em>v. </em>Roe, 1 Aust., 86; Caswell <em>v. </em>Allen, 7 Johns., 63. In Hulmo <em>v. </em>Hulme, 2 My. &amp; K., 682, the intent that there should continue to be two trustees was not nearly as strong as in this case, yet a retiring trustee was held liable Tor the acts of the continuing trustee. So in Massachusetts Gen. Hospital <em>v. </em>Amory, 12 Pick., 445 ; Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Lehigh Nav. Co., 12 Cas., 212. The Orphans\u2019 Court has power to fill the vacancies, under the provisions of the Act of April 10, 1849, (P. L., 597), there being active trusts in the will to be administered by the executors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>John G. Johnson </em>and <em>George W. Biddle, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMb\">It is clear, under the Acts of March 12, 1800, see. 1 (Purd. Dig., 417, pl. 64), and February 24, 1834, secs. 18, 14 (Purd. Dig., 418, pl. 71, 72), that the surviving executor can convey a good title unless the testator has directed otherwise; we submit he has not done so in the seventeenth item, or elsewhere in his will. It will be noticed that he has not, in any instance, given any powers to any of the executors by name, nor has he said that the surviving executor alone shall <em>not </em>exercise them. He lias said in the sixteenth item that a majority of the executors shall be competent. But this is enabling, and merely dispenses with the concurrence of all the executors, and meets the possibility of all three not concurring in any act requiring discretion. The direction contained in item seventeen to appoint another executor cannot now be complied with, because it requires the appointment to be made by the testator\u2019s executors (in the plural), and only one executor is now living. And the suggestion made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>argument of the plaintiffs in error, that the Orphans\u2019 Court can now appoint an executor, is fallacious, for the Orphans\u2019 Court can never appoint an executor, although an administrator might be appointed by the Register, but the power to sell is not one which an administrator is authorized by the testator to exercise. He says that his executors (i. e., those known to and appointed by him), and their appointee may do so, but expressly directs them not to apply to court. It is really a trust, and, therefore, if the seventeenth it\u00e9m is to be construed as forbidding the action of the surviving executor, the further administration of the estate must come to a standstill forever; for only one executor survives, and the will expressly requires the executors to appoint another, that is, another executor in the place of an executor so dying or declining. Thus, in the seventeenth item, he requires the survivors \u201c to make such conveyances and to do such acts as may invest the said substituted executor from time to time,\u201d etc. Besides, an administrator could not exercise the power which is not within the scope of the duties of one while any executor survives, and the testator is far from saying that a trustee appointed by court may exercise a power which he expressly states is to be performed without the intervention of a court by his executors. It is perfectly clear, however, from a perusal of the various passages of the will that it was the testator\u2019s intention to facilitate the administration of his estate without recourse to anjr court for further authority, and not in any way to limit the power of the surviving executor given by existing laws. The seventeenth item should really be read as permitting the executors to do that, which, without that clause, it might have been necessary to apply to the court to effect, and not as requiring an additional person, not known to the testator, to assist the surviving executor chosen by him in carrying out the objects of his will. If such had been the design, the disability of the surviving executor would have been clearly expressed in the same paragraph. The probable object of the testator was to guard against the possibility of having an administrator appointed by the Register in case the estate was not fully wound up prior to the death of the last executor, and was not made to secure a plurality of agents as a condition of their acting at all.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3u\">April 21, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-6\">Chief Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"A8u\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We concur in opinion with the court below, that the sole surviving executor has lawful power and authority to convey title to said premises. When a devise of real estate is made to executors for the purpose of sale or otherwise, and in gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>eral terms they are authorized to sell the same, the Act of 24th February, 1834, in clear and explicit language, gives power to the survivor or survivors to execute that power as fully as all of them might have done, when the testator has not directed otherwise. The will of James Dundas contains no language of a special character sufficient to indicate an intention to restrict the right to convey to all of his executors, nor to prevent the sole surviving executor from executing the power, in pursuance of the Act of 1834. To hold lie cannot so do, would defeat the main purpose and object of the Act. While the Act of 1849 does authorize the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia, when the will has there been admitted to probate, on application of a party in interest, with the consent of the continuing executor, to appoint a trustee or trustees, in the place of those dying or ceasing to act, with the same power as those in whose stead they were appointed, yet this action is not essentially necessary to a proper exercise of the power given to the executors by the testator. Unless such appointment be actually made, the surviving executor may exercise the whole power under the Act of 1884. It follows the court correctly entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs below on the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
