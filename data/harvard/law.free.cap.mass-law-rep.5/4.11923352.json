(\u201cEIC\u201d) seeks a declaration that it is not obligated to indemnify or defend the defendant David G. Zuzeio (\u201cZuzeio\u201d), in a civil action brought by Zuzelo\u2019s three children against him. This matter is now before this Court on EIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, EIC\u2019s motion is ALLOWED.</p>\n<p id=\"b8-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b8-19\">On April 20, 1982, EIC issued a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy no. 5A19994H1 (\u201cPolicy\u201d) to Marjorie Zuzeio, now Marjorie Quinn (\u201cQuinn\u201d). The Policy insured the Zuzeio residence at 127 Hamilton Street, Saugus, Massachusetts, and its residents, including David A. Zuzeio (Zuzeio). The Policy provides that \u201cIf a claim is made or suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we will: (1) pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and (2) provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d The Policy also contains an intentional harm provision, which states that the above personal liability coverage \u201cdoles] not apply to bodily injury or property damage: (a) which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b8-20\">In 1992, Zuzelo\u2019s three adult children, David A. Zuzeio, Brian Zuzeio, and Jennifer Zuzeio (\u201cthe children\u201d), brought claims of assault and battery, intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>negligent infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, breach of fiduciary duly, and invasion of privacy, against their father. <em>Zuzelo v. Zuzelo, </em>Middlesex Superior Court, Civil Action No. 92-7105. These claims arose from allegations that Zuzelo had physically, emotionally, and sexually abused his children in theyears 1978 through 1989. In response to the action against him, Zuzelo sought coverage under the Policy. EIC denied any obligation to defend or indemnify Zuzelo. On June 7, 1993, EIC brought the instant action seeking declaratory judgment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-4\">Subsequently, the underlying complaint was amended to add a claim by Zuzelo\u2019s former wife, Quinn. In Count 19 of the amended complaint, Quinn asserts a claim of loss of consortium, charging that Zuzelo\u2019s abuse of their children has caused her to lose their love, affection, services, and companionship. The children\u2019s claims, comprising counts 1-18 of the underlying amended complaint, remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b9-6\">Summary judgment shall be granted where there are no genuine issues as to any material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Kourouvacilis v. General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991); <em>Cassesso v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 419, 422 (1983); <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank v. Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976); Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating the absence of a triable issue \u201cand [further] that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Pederson v. Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 16-17 (1989). Where the situation is such that \u201cin essence there is no real dispute as to the salient facts or if only a question of law is involved,\u201d summary judgment shall be granted to the party entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cassesso, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b9-7\">In this case, EIC argues that the claims raised by the children, counts 1-18 of the underlying complaint, arise from the intentional acts of Zuzelo and are therefore excluded from coverage by the intentional harm provision in the Policy. See <em>Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acre Day School, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 393, 400 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zuzelo does not dispute this point, and this Court so holds. Zuzelo argues, however, that Quinn\u2019s claim for loss of consortium does not fall within the intentional harm provision of the Policy, and that EIS is therefore required to provide coverage with respect to that claim. See <em>id. </em>at 413-14. Moreover, Zuzelo contends that if this Court finds that EIS has a duty to defend with respect to Quinn\u2019s loss of consortium claim, then EIS also has a burden to defend all the remaining counts in the underlying complaint. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety v. Continental Casualty, </em>413 Mass. 730, 732 n.1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b9-8\">Since EIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment is limited to the children\u2019s claims, i.e. counts 1-18 of the underlying complaint, this Court does not address whether EIC has a duty to provide coverage with respect to count 19, Quinn\u2019s loss of consortium claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, because Zuzelo concedes that the intentional harm provision excludes counts 1-18, only one issue remains before this Court: Assuming that EIC has an obligation to defend against Quinn\u2019s loss of consortium claim, would such an obligation impose a duty upon EIC to defend against the children\u2019s claims as well?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the answer is no, then this Court would have no reason to deny EIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-10\">It is well-established in Massachusetts and generally elsewhere that \u201cif the allegations of the complaint . . . state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\u201d <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Gilbane Building Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146 (1984). However, there is a split among the state and federal courts as to the extent of this duty to defend. The Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged that \u201c[a]lthough Massachusetts law does not yet provide an answer, the weight of authority places the duly to defend all counts on an insurer which has a duty to defend at least one count of a complaint.\u201d Aetna, <em>supra </em>at 732 n.1 (citing 7C J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a74684.01, at 102 (rev. ed. 1979 &amp; 1991 supp.)). A minority of courts, however, have held that where a complaint contains several causes of action or theories of recovery, the insurer\u2019s duty to defend extends only to those causes of action that would be covered under the policy if they were proved true. See <em>White Mountain Construction Co. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>631 A.2d 907 (N.H. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b9-11\">This Court need not decide this issue. Even in jurisdictions applying the maj ority rule, this Court has found no cases in which the duty to defend against one plaintiffs claim created an obligation to defend against the claims of a <em>different </em>plaintiff. Thus, even if the majority rule controlled in Massachusetts, this Court would decline to extend the rule in such a manner. This Court holds that any obligation that EIC may have to defend against Quinn\u2019s loss of consortium claim creates no duty to defend against the children\u2019s intentional torts claims. There remains, therefore, no basis upon which this Court can conclude that EIC must provide coverage with respect counts 1-18 of the underlying complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-12\">Finally, Zuzelo argues at length that this Court should refrain from deciding this motion until Quinn is joined in the present action as an indispensable party, since her interests would otherwise be affected. See G.L.c. 231A, \u00a78; Mass.R.Civ.P. 19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the contrary, this Court\u2019s holdings focus only on EIC\u2019s obligations to Zuzelo with respect to the children\u2019s claims against Zuzelo. Allowing EIC\u2019s motion has no bearing on Quinn\u2019s rights with respect to her underlying suit against Zuzelo and does not affect her ability to recover under the Policy if she is successful. This Court finds no reason to delay judgment in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Accordingly, EIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment declaring that it as no duty to defend or indemnify Zuzelo with respect to counts 1-18 of the underlying complaint, i.e. the children\u2019s intentional torts claims, is ALLOWED.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-4\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b10-5\">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff Electric Insurance Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment declaring that it has no duty to defend or indemnify defendant David G. Zuzelo from the claims of Jennifer Zuzelo, Brian Zuzelo, and David A. Zuzelo comprising counts 1-18 of the underlying complaint, <em>Zuzelo v. Zuzelo, </em>Middlesex Superior Court, Civil Action No. 92-7105, is ALLOWED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b10-7\">This includes the children\u2019s claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress arising from allegations of abuse by Zuzelo. See <em>Fells Acre, supra </em>at 410 (negligence claims arising from the same conduct giving rise to the assault and battery claims are excluded by policy\u2019s intentional harm provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b10-8\">It appears that the original underlying complaint was amended to add count 19 after EIC filed this action for declaratory judgment and moved for summary judgment. Neither EIC\u2019s complaint nor its brief in support of this motion address count 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b10-9\">While an issue with respect to the broader duly to defend remains, there is no qu\u00e9stion with respect to the duty to indemnify. Under the intentional harm provision of the Policy, EIC has no duty to indemnify Zuzelo with respect to the children\u2019s claims in the underlying complaint. The suggestion in <em>Aetna, supra, </em>that a single covered claim may impose a broader duty to defend all claims in the complaint has no bearing on EIC\u2019s duty to indemnify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b10-10\">G.L.c. 231A, \u00a78 provides: \u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b10-11\">Mass.R.Civ.P. 19(a) provides: \u201cA person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if ... (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest... If he has not been so joined, the court shall order that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
