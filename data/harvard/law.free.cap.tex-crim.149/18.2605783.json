R. Barber did then and there unlawfully, while operating an automobile upon a street, within the City of Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas, fail to display an operator\u2019s license upon demand to do so by a peace officer, against the peace and dignity of the State.\u2019 This complaint was apparently brought under the provisions of Article 6687b-13 of the Civil Statutes of Texas, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-19\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 13 \u2014 License to be carried and exhibited on demand\u2014 Every licensee shall have his operator\u2019s, commercial operator\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>or chauffeur\u2019s license in his immediate possession at all times when operating a motor vehicle and shall display the same, upon demand of a magistrate or any officer of a court of competent jurisdiction or any peace officer. It shall be a defense to any charge under this Section that the person so charged produce in court an operator\u2019s commercial operator\u2019s, or chauffeur\u2019s license theretofore issued to such person and valid at the time of his arrest.\u2019 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">\u201cIt will be noted that the statute provides that every licensee shall have his operator\u2019s, commercial operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license in his immediate possession at all times when operating a motor vehicle. It therefore occurs to us that it is absolutely necessary for the State to allege and prove that the accused was, on the date of the alleged offense, a licensee, for, as we construe the statute above quoted, it applies specifically to a licensee and unless the person accused was a licensee, we fail to understand how he could be guilty of violating the provisions of this portion of the statute in failing to display same upon demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In holding the complaint insufficient to charge an offense under the statute mentioned, we are not to be understood as passing upon the validity of the statute. That question is not before us and is not decided. What we hold is that the instant complaint does not charge an offense under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
