C. P., para. 6. We find tht such a complaint relative to the information is borne out by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">We think the case of Cobb v. State, 139 S. W. (2d) 272, in the opinion on rehearing, to be decisive of this matter, and we quote therefrom:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">\u201cAppellant files a motion calling attention to a matter which makes it necessary to change our order reversing and remanding of date April 24, 1940, to an order reversing and ordering a dismissal of the prosecution under the present information. The defect in the information was pointed out in appellant\u2019s brief but was overlooked on original submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cThe offense was alleged to have been committed on December 9, 1939. Both the complaint and information were filed that same day. It is averred in the complaint that the offense was committed \u2018before the making of this complaint,\u2019 but no such averment is found in the information. The statute, Art. 414, C. C. P. (1925) Subdivision 6, requires that the time alleged in the information be \u2018some date anterior to the filing of the information.\u2019 It is held in Kennedy v. State, 22 Tex. App. 693, 3 S. W. 480, that the requisite mentioned must be apparent from the information itself, and that the complaint cannot be resorted to for supplying the omission from the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The cause is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed under the present information.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
