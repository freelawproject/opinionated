Sec. 11, Art. 1, State Constitution; Art. 5, C. C. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It should be borne in mind that although the confession of Johnnie Andrew Butler was introduced herein, he did not testify in this hearing. In an effort to show the guilt of relator as an accomplice, such extrajudicial confession was admissible only for the purpose of showing the guilt of Butler, and should be limited to such purpose. It could not be introduced for the purpose of showing the guilt of relator. See Branch's. Penal Code, p. 43, Sec. 71, for list of authorities; also Art. 80, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C.; Millner v. State, 72 Tex. Cr. R. 45, 162 S. W. 348; Millner v. State, 75 Tex. Cr. R. 22, 169 S. W. 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">This court has consistently held that the phrase \u201cWhen the proof is evident,\u201d as used in the Constitution, and the statute, Art. 5, C. C. P., relative to bail in capital cases, means that the evidence would lead a well guarded and dispassionate judgment to the conclusion that an offense has been committed; that the accused is the guilty party, and will probably be punished capitally if the law is properly administered. See Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C. P., Art. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">From the testimony presented to us herein we are unable to reach the conclusion that the relator will probably be punished capitally.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">So believing, this cause is reversed and bail granted in the sum of $7,500.00, conditioned as required by law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
