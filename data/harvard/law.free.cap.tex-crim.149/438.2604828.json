However, one witness testified that appellant\u2019s wife handed the pistol to him after taking it from her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">There is no testimony showing that appellant left the night club with the pistol. As to what became of the pistol after the display, the record is .silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Appellant insists that if he obtained the pistol from his wife, as testified by the witness, he would not be guilty of unlawfully carrying the pistol, even though he might have violated some other statute relative to the display of the pistol. In support of this contention, he cites: Hicks v. State, 66 Tex. Cr. R. 176, 145 S. W. 938; Davis v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 156, 237 S. W. 925; Pyka v. State, 80 Tex. Cr. R. 644, 192 S. W. 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The authorities cited support appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">By special charge, as well as exception to the court\u2019s charge, appellant sought to have the jury instructed in accordance with this defensive theory. Such an instruction was by the trial court refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">In so doing, the conclusion is expressed that the learned trial judge fell into error, which requires a reversal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
