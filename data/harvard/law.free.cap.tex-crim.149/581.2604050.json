A short distance away they passed his, Jack Clark\u2019s, wife who was walking along the street. They stopped for a short time to tell her that these men were taking him to work. He then recounted their movements for the rest of the evening, the robbery of the place at about one o\u2019clock in the morning, detailing specifically the incidents of the robbery and the return to Lubbock.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">.. There are circumstances corroborating his story as to the commission of the offense and the participation of sufficient help to handle a five hundred pound safe, place it in the car, convey it some distance and break it open. Th\u00e9 only evidence corroborating his story of the connection of appellant was that of Clark\u2019s wife, who said she saw them together at the time and place stated by Jack Clark. This was at least six hours before the robbery, and some twenty miles distant from Abernathy. There is no other evidence of any kind or character to connect appellant with the robbery, and nothing else to corroborate the testimony of Clark, who had \u201cturned state\u2019s evidence\u201d and was an accomplice witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Disregarding entirely the evidence of appellant\u2019s witnesses as to an alibi, still, we think the evidence is wholly insufficient to corroborate the accomplice witness, Jack Clark, whose evidence, under Article 718 Vern. Ann. C. C. P., must be corroborated before a conviction can be had. This question has been passed on many times. More recent cases which may be cited are: Smith v. State, 67 S. W. (2d) 277, opinion by Judge Krueger; Randall v. State, 103 S. W. (2d) 743, opinion by Presiding Judge Hawkins; and Smith v. State, 144 S. W. (2d) 542, opinion by Judge Christian, from which we quote the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\u201cArticle 718, C. C. P., provides that a conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, and further provides that the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>If it should be conceded that it was shown that appellant and the accomplice witnesses had been seen together prior to the commission of the offense and shortly after its commission it would not follow that the corroboration should be held sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Having concluded that corroboration in this case is insufficient to meet the requirements of the statute, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the other questions raised by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
