Said county was a dry area, within the meaning of the Liquor Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s affirmative defense or alibi supported by other witnesses, the jury accepted Russell\u2019s testimony and we are bound thereby. Appellant\u2019s contention that the conviction should be reversed upon the facts is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Bills of exceptions appear complaining of argument of State\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">The argument complained of violated no statutory or mandatory rule and was not inherently vicious or prejudicial. In view of the assessment by the jury of the minimum punishment, we are unable to reach the conclusion that appellant was injured thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">The other matters which appear have been examined and are overruled without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
