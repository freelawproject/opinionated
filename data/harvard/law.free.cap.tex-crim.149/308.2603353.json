He fixed the place and date of the sale as appellant\u2019s home in Nolan County on the 9th day of August, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Nolan County was shown to be a dry area within the meaning of the Liquor Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">His wife testified, upon direct examination, that she was at home the entire day of August 9, 1945; and that the witness did not come to their home that day and buy whisky; but that on the 11th day of August, 1945, the witness Russell came to their home in an intoxicated condition and gave her husband a drink of whisky out of a bottle which looked like the one which Russell identified as the one he purchased from appellant. She further testified that appellant was a carpenter by trade and a member in good standing of the carpenters\u2019 union, and that he did not sell whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Upon cross-examination, and over appellant\u2019s objection, she testified that:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\">(a) on August 11, 1945, two days after the commission of</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">the offense here involved, officers searched appellant\u2019s and her home but found nothing; \u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">(b) twice before that, the sheriff had searched their premises for whisky;</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(c) she had heard that her husband had been suspicioned as a bootlegger; and</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(d) upon being asked what her husband\u2019s reputation was for being a bootlegger, she replied that she did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Appellant neither testified nor placed his character or reputation in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Upon such circumstances, the State was precluded from attacking the character or reputation of the appellant, and his objection on such grounds should have been sustained. 42 Tex.
