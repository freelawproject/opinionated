Subsection (c) of Section 4 of Article 911A and Subsection (b) of Section 4 of Article 911B, Revised Civil Statutes, is hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Sec. 44 of Art. VI of the Act provides the penalty for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">It is by these statutes made unlawful for any person to drive or operate a motor vehicle over a highway of this State without having a license, either as an \u201coperator,\u201d a \u201ccommercial operator,\u201d or a \u201cchauffeur.\u201d One holding a license as a \u201ccommercial operator\u201d or \u201cchauffeur\u201d is not required to have an \u201coperator\u2019s\u201d license.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Certain exemptions and exceptions from the operation of the Act are provided in Sec. 3 of Art. II. thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The information upon which this conviction was predicated alleged that appellant \u201cdid then and there unlawfully operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway, to-wit, State Highway No. 24, without a Driver\u2019s License.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">It is insisted that the information charges no offense, because a \u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d is neither recognized nor authorized to be issued under the Act and, by reason thereof, it constitutes no offense to drive a motor vehicle without such a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Only three types of licenses are authorized or required under the Act. These are operators\u2019, commercial operators\u2019, and chauffeurs\u2019, and they are specially defined in the Act. The term \u201cdriver\u201d \u2014 as used in the Act \u2014 is defined to be: \u201cEvery person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\u201d In view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of this particular definition of the term \u201cdriver,\u201d it cannot be said that such term may be used interchangeably with or given the same meaning as the term \u201coperator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In view of- this particular definition of the term \u201cdriver,\u201d it cannot be said that such term may be used interchangeably with or given the same meaning as the term \u201coperator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">There being no such license as a \u201cdriver\u2019s\u201d license known to the law, it follows that the information, in charging the driving of a motor vehicle upon a public highway without such a license, charges no offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Because of the defect in the information, the judgment is reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
