See Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 1340, sec. 2478, and many cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Bill of Exceptions No. 1 complains because the fan alleged to have been stolen was not shown to have been found in appellant\u2019s home. The record does not bear this out. Mr. Duncan, the officer who testified as to the finding of the fan, stated that he found it in appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Bill of Exceptions No. 2 complains of many questions, all in the same bill, and most of his objections were sustained; and where requested, it seems that the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the question. Suffice it to say that we do not think that any error is manifested in said bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
