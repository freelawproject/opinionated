No complaints were made of the court\u2019s charge, and no special charges were requested by appellant. Therefore, the only question presented for our consideration is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. Without setting out the facts in detail, we deem them sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
