His motion is too general in that it does not point out wherein the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>is contrary to the law and the facts. However we have again examined the record and remain of the opinion that the case was properly disposed of on the original submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The motion for rehearing is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
