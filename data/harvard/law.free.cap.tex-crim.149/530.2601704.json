Jones \u2014 who was then under separate accusation for an offense growing out of the same transaction as that charged against appellant \u2014 be first tried. The motion complied with the statutory prerequisites. (Art. 651, C. C. P.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Appellant\u2019s exception to the action of the trial court in overruling the motion is preserved by a proper bill of exception, unqualified and unexplained by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Under the facts stated, appellant was entitled to the severance and the motion should have been granted.
