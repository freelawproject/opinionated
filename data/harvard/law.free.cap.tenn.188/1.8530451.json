He was so reluctant in answering questions on cross-examination that the jury may have concluded from this fact alone that he was entitled to little, if any, credibility. In his brief defendant complains of the fact that the trial court found it necessary to instruct the husband of the prosecutrix to answer questions which it had ruled competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201c. . . it is well established that in order to clarify matters which appear in doubt, or which are not brought out by counsel or made clear by the witness and would otherwise remain obscure, and to develop the facts fully when essential to the administration of justice, the trial court, at any stage of the examination, may put questions to the witness for the purpose of eliciting facts bearing on the issue; . . . Although an extended examination by the court is essentially unfair, unless skilfully and tactfully conducted, it is generally within its province to ask pertinent and properly framed questions to clear up the record when it appears that they will not be asked by counsel. Indeed, it is his duty, as well as his right, to do so whenever he deems it essential in order to elicit truth or to obtain a clear understanding of the testimony. (Section 1264, pp. 2131-2132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u201cWhether or not the trial court shall question a witness, and the extent of its examination, are within its sound discretion. The trial court should, however, exercise its right to call and examine a witness with great care, and should do so only when without such examination there may be a miscarriage of justice, lest the jury, because of such intervention, indulge in adverse inferences and conclusions from the testimony of the witness. Therefore, the trial judge should examine witnesses only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>in rare instances and then only by a few questions necessary to clear up the situation, it being better to suggest to counsel tbe additional information desired and let him ask the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u201cWhile it has been held that the examination of the court should be confined within the limits applicable to the examination by counsel, it is generally held that the court is not, as to evidence, bound by the rule excluding questions of a leading nature, and may ask any questions designed to clarify the record, as long as they do hot indicate the court\u2019s opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, although an answer not in itself evidence, brought out by a question from the court, may be ground for reversal, The court, must, however, be scrupulously careful not to indicate to the jury its opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, especially in examining the accused himself, which would be not only improper, but prejudicial error. He must not, by his questioning, exhibit bias or prejudice, or take sides, discredit the witness\u2019s truthfulness, comment on the testimony, or improperly influence the jury in any way. (Sec. 1265, pp. 2132-2133.)</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u201cThe propriety, scope, manner, and control of the examination of witnesses is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, which will not be interfered with in the absence of an abuse thereof. A wide discretion in this matter is necessarily left to the court.\u201d (Sec. 1266, p. 2133) Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence (11th Ed.), Vol. 3, secs. 1264-1266, pp. 2131-2133.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We are of opinion that the trial judge did nothing prejudicial to the defendant in instructing the witness to answer questions relative to his guilt. This case is typical of the many cases coming to this Court the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>termination of which, depends upon the credibility of the witnesses. The jury has passed on the credibility of the witnesses, and we cannot say that the evidence preponderates in favor of the innocence of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">It results that all assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
