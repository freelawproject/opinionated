Justice Pbewitt</author>\n<p id=\"ARB\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">This is a Workmen\u2019s Compensation case. The trial judge dismissed the petition on the ground that the injuries complained of had not diminished petitioner\u2019s earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On September 3, 1946, petitioner\u2019s hack was injured when he fell off the roof of a building. He was paid temporary total disability until about December 20,1946. At that time he resumed light work for the defendants at $31 per week and was paid $18 per week compensation until. March 8, 1947, after which time he was paid his regular wages of $65 per week and his compensation was stopped.. Petitioner was paid the total sum of $468, and doctors\u2019 bills were paid for him amounting to $531.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em> </em>On September 2, 1947, petitioner filed this suit in the circuit court of Hamilton County, to recover further compensation of the defendants. The trial judge found that petitioner had not lost his earning capacity within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Code, sec. 6851 et seq., but had continued his carpenter work with no reduction in his wages up to within a few days of the time of the filing of this suit. There is material evidence to support this finding; therefore petitioner is not entitled to recover further compensation.. In such a case, where there is material evidence to support the finding of the trial judge, this Court will not disturb the judgment below. <em>Milne </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>143 Tenn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>602, 228 S. W. 702; <em>Hedges-Walsh-Weidner Co. </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>165 Tenn. 486, 55 S. W. (2d) 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Standard Surety &amp; Casualty Co. of New York et al. </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>180 Tenn. 220, 224, 225, 173 S. W. (2d) 436, 437, 149 A. L. R. 407, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201c \u2018The general purpose of the Compensation Acts is to provide compensation for loss of earning power or capacity sustained by workmen through injuries in industry.\u2019 Schneider Vol. I, at p. 5. As said in <em>Devine\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 588, at page 592, 129 N. E. 414, at page 415, \u2018The general purpose of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was to substitute in cases to which it is applicable, for common law or statutory rights of action and grounds of liability, a system of money payments <em>based upon the loss of wages </em>by way of relief,\u2019 etc. (Italics ours.) And see 71 Corpus Juris, p. 232, where it is said that, \u2018the Compensation Acts are based on a new theory of compensation, as distinguished from previously existing theories of damages,\u2019 etc., citing numerous cases. One may he physically injured and suffer damages, for which he could recover in an action of tort, but unless the injury to his person affects and diminishes his earning power, he can not recover an award under Compensation Acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u201cSubsection (c) of Code Section 68, as amended by Pub. Acts 1941, Chap. 90, sec. 5, deals with permanent partial disability and carries a schedule fixing the compensation to be paid for the loss of the various members of the body. The concluding paragraph of this subsection, as amended, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201c \u2018In all other cases of permanent partial disability not above enumerated the compensation shall be sixty per centum of the difference between the wage of the workman at the time of the injury and the wage he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>able to earn in bis partially disabled condition subject to a maximum of eighteen dollars per week. Compensation shall continue during disability, not, however, beyond three hundred weeks. (Ib.; 1927, ch. 40.)\u2019 We have here a case of permanent partial disability as to which this paragraph applies, this being a case \u2018not above,\u2019 that is, in this subsection, \u2018enumerated\u2019. The award provided for in such a case, is \u2018sixty per centum of the <em>difference between the wage of the workman at the time of the injury and the wage he is able to earn in his partially disabled condition. </em>\u2019 The measure of the award is prescribed by the language we have italicized. If there is no \u2018difference,\u2019 then there can be no award of compensation. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-5\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
