The chattels mentioned in tire declaration were the tools of the plaintiff, and necessary for his occupation as a husbandman.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-14\"><em>Todd, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1n\">said that a statute, which is to take away a remedy given by the common law, is to be construed strictly <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. But it must be a liberal construction indeed, which should suppose the tools of a farmer necessary to his occupation, when it must be presumed, from the case itself, that his farm was already gone from him.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b249-17\"> 4 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. <em>Title </em>Statute, 1. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b249-15\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ4\">The question submitted by the case [ * 314 ] is, whether or not the chattels mentioned in the * plaintiff\u2019s writ are by law protected from seizure on execution issued against the plaintiff. The law relied on is the statute of 1805, c. 100., in which it is enacted that, among other articles, the tools of any debtor, necessary for his trade or occupation, shall be exempted from attachment and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The chattels in this case are the wheels of a cart, and part of the gear to be used in moving it with oxen. The case does not state that they were the tools of the plaintiff, necessary for his trade or occupation. Very clearly, the case as stated does not bring the plaintiff within the provisions of the statute; and the defendant must have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">If the Court could presume that the chattels seized were implements of husbandry necessary for the plaintiff in tilling his land, yet the plaintiff must fail; for tools of a man\u2019s trade or occupation do not include the implements of husbandry, used by the husbandman in tilling his farm. For in no correct sense can oxen or horses be considered as husbandry tools; and it would be preposterous to admit that the legislature would extend the protection of the statute to the cart and plough, and their gear, and leave the cattle, without which they would be of no use, to be seized upon execution <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"><em> Buckingham vs. Billings, </em>13 <em>Mass. 82. </em>\u2014 Howard <em>vs. Williams, </em>2 <em>Pick. </em>80.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
