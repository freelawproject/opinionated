Walker.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-16\">The defendants, by their said attorney, plead to the jurisdiction of the Court, because they are inhabitants of * the state of <em>New York, </em>and at no time have been resident within [ * 363 ] this state, and that no estate of theirs has been attached on this writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-17\">To this plea the plaintiff demurs, and the defendants, by the same attorney, join in demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Hutbert, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-7\"><em>Dewey, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">As a plea in abatement to the jurisdiction, the plea is unquestionably bad, as it gives jurisdiction to no other Court of this state.
