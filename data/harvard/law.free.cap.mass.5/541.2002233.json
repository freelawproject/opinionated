Upon oyer, the condition is spread upon the record, and it ' recites that the plaintiff, as constable of the town of <em>Plympton, </em>had taken one <em>Seth Bisbee </em>as a prisoner, by virtue of a warrant granted by <em>Nehemiah Cobb, </em>Esq., and therefore if the defendants or either of them shall deliver up to the plaintiff the said <em>Seth Bisbee </em>on the \u2014 day of, &amp;c., or sooner, if the defendants or either of them shall see cause, the bond shall be void.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">The defendants demur to the declaration, and the plaintiff joins in demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-8\"><em>Baylies, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atd\">cited 1 <em>Sound. 61. </em>\u2014 2 <em>Lev. </em>17. 98.\u2014 <em>Peake's N.

But we think this presumption is not to be made, when the condition has no recital of any party entitled to the bail-bond, or at whose suit the arrest has been made; or the amount of the debt or damages demanded, or when or where the supposed process was returnable ; circumstances essential to be stated, or which must appear, substantially at least, in a lawful bail-bond <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. And it may be added here, that the permission by the officer to his prisoner, to go at large aftei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>his arrest, amounted to a.voluntary escape; and that the bond, which may be considered as intended to protect him against the consequence of his own malfeasance, is void at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">And upon the whole, the opinion of the Court is, that the plaintiff had no legal title to the bond declared on, in exercising the office, by which it was obtained, and that the same is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Declaration adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Thomas, for the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\"> <em>Com.
