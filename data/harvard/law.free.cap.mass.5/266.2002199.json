To this plea there was a general demurrer and joinder, but no judgment was rendered on the plea. The defendant went on and pleaded <em>nil debet </em>to the action. To this latter plea there was also a demurrer, with a reservation to waive it and join the issue tendered on the appeal. Judgment on this demurrer was given for the defendant. On the appeal, the plaintiff waived his demurrer, and joined the issue. And on trial of this issue at the last October term in this county, a verdict was found for the plaintiff for fifteen dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\">After the verdict, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment for the following causes:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-10\">1. Because it does not appear that any judgment was given by the Court below, on the plea in abatement, although an issue in law was joined thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-11\">* 2. Because the action is not maintainable, as every [ * 268 ] citizen of the commonwealth of common right has the privilege of taking every kind of fish in the sea, in such manner aa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>he pleases; and if any statute has been, or shall be made in derogation of this right, the common law will control it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">3. Because the statute on which the action is brought, entitled an act for the preservation of the fish called bass, in <em>Dunston </em>river,</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">in Scarborough, in the county of Cumberlandbeing a private statute, ought to have been set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, or so much thereof, that the .Court might judge of it, and determine whether the plaintiff had pursued the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">4. Because the plaintiff has declared for four different penalties, at different times, in the same count, when there ought to have been four different counts in the declaration for the said penalties; and no day in particular is mentioned when three of the said penalties were incurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">5. Because it appears from the pleadings in the case that the debt was incurred, if any were incurred, by the defendant jointly with other persons, who ought to have been joined in the action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The cause stood continued upon this motion to the present term; and now <em>King, </em>of counsel for the defendant, enforced the causes of arresting the judgment, and was answered by <em>Mellen </em>for the plaintiff, after which the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b214-10\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIt\">As to the <em>first </em>objection, the defendant was not obliged, after pleading this plea in abatement, to answer further, without a judgment of <em>respondeas ouster. </em>But without any such judgment, he voluntarily pleaded to the action, and on demurrer to his plea, he prayed judgment in chief, and it was rendered for him. This we are satisfied amounts to a waiver of his plea in abatement, which must now be considered as if it had not been filed. [ * 269 ] * There is no weight in the <em>second </em>objection. That part of the sea, in which the fish were taken, was within the town of <em>Scarborough. </em>And the legislature may unquestionably regulate the taking of fish within the state, and oblige all the citizens to conform to the regulations, by inflicting penalties for the violation of them <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Neither can the <em>next </em>objection prevail. We are of opinion that the statute referred to is a public statute. It is obligatory on all the citizens, and they must notice it at their peril. We must, therefore, <em>ex officio, </em>take notice of it. Indeed, all the laws regulating the taking of fish are made for the public benefit, to preserve the fish, and are public statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">Had the <em>fourth </em>exception been taken on demurrer, it might have prevailed. But as one offence is properly laid, and the jury have found but one penalty forfeited, we must, after verdict, presume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that the jury have convicted the defendant of the offence rightly laid, and that the judge did not permit evidence of any other of-fence to be given. This is settled law in <em>trespass, </em>where several trespasses are laid to be committed at divers days and times between two certain days, where, from the generality of the verdict of guilty, it is not certain but the jury might have found the defendant guilty of, and assessed damages for all the trespasses. But <em>a fortiori </em>judgment ought not to be arrested in this case; for the jury cannot be presumed to have found the defendant guilty of more than one offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The truth of the allegation, on which the <em>last </em>exception is predicated, does not appear on the record. The plea in abatement making it, we consider as waived; and if it was not, no resort to it could be had on a motion to arrest judgment, where the allegations of the plea are a cause only of abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">As a matter of practice, we have considered this point; and we \u25a0are satisfied that the plea would not have been sufficient to abate the writ. When an offence created by statute may be committed by one alone, but in fact is * committed by [*270 ] several, the offence is not in the nature of a joint contract, but of a trespass, although the penalty be sued for in a <em>qui tam </em>action of debt or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In an information against several defendants, the plea is that they are, and each of them is not guilty. And in an action of debt <em>qui tam, </em>not guilty is also a good plea. But if debt <em>qui tam </em>be sued against several, demanding a joint forfeiture, on a plea of <em>nil debet, </em>all the defendants ought to be found indebted, because the form of the action and plea is on a joint contract, although the debt arises from a tort. But unquestionably the action might have been sued against any one or more of the defendants; for the tort being several as well as joint, the debt may follow the nature of the tort on which it is founded. The exception to this rule arises from the nature of the offence. As when the offence created by a statute is the making of a contract prohibited by it, the contract must be charged and proved according to the truth of the case. For if it be proved to be different from the contract alleged, they cannot be presumed to be the same contracts <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The plaintiff must have judgment on the verdict to recover the penalty of fifteen dollars, with full costs; for although the action be in its form on a contract, yet it is not a simple contract within the statute of 1803, c. 154. \u00a7 5 <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b214-15\"><em> Nickerson </em>vs. <em>Brackett, </em>10 <em>Mass. </em>212.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> 2 <em>Hawk.
