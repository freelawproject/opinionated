C. writes underneath, <em>\u201cI acknowledge myself holden as surety for the payment of the demand of the above note, witness my hand, C.\u201d </em>In an action ' against C. on this note, it was held to be a joint and several promise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">This action was <em>assumpsit, </em>brought by <em>Isaac Bennet, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who dying since its commencement,' the present plaintiff was admitted to prosecute it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">The declaration contains several counts upon a paper purporting to be a promissory note, made by one <em>Joseph Chaplin </em>(who is alleged to be without the state), and the defendant. The first count is upon a note signed by the defendant solely. The second is on a note signed by him jointly and severally with <em>Chaplin. </em>[ * 359 ] * The third count is on a special promise of the defendant, that if the plaintiff would trust <em>Chaplin </em>to the amount of 1500 dollars on his note, and <em>Chaplin </em>should fail to pay it at the time limited, he, the defendant, would pay it for him, &amp;c. \u2014There is also a count for money had and received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">The cause was tried on the issue of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and a verdict found for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court, whether the paper writing in the case was sufficient to support the action on either count in the declaration. The note referred to in the case was of the following tenor:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\"><em>\u201c Lee, July </em>93d,. 1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\"><em>For value received, I promise to pay </em>Isaac Bennet <em>fifteen hundred dollars, lawful money of the United States, on the first day of December next, with interest.

And this is not like the common case where one signs as surety at the time of making the original contract. Here is a separate contract, which was complete before the defendant had any connection with it. For aught that appears, this undertaking of the defendant\u2019s was made on a different day. It is to receive the same construction as if it were written * on a differept paper from the principal [ * 360 ] engagement <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> <em>Wain vs. Warlters, </em>5 <em>East. </em>10</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> <em>Ex parte Adney, Cowp. 460. </em>\u2014 Rann. <em>&amp; al., Executors, </em>vs. <em>Hughes, Administratrix, </em>7 <em>D. &amp;.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0-\">The defendant objects to the evidence on which the verdict in this case was found, insisting that on his part it is an agreement to pay the debt of <em>Chaplin, </em>and so is within the statute of 1788, c. 16. \u00a7 1., which is our statute of frauds, and that this agreement, containing no consideration in writing, will not take the cas\u00e9 out of the statute. To support his objection he relies on the case of <em>Wain </em>vs. <em>Warlters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">As our statute of frauds is in this respect similar to the <em>English </em>statute of 29 <em>Car. </em>2. c. 3. \u00a7 4., that case is in point, if this be a promise to pay the debt of another, within the intent of the statute. The decision in that case is of the first impression, and rests upon the legal import of the word <em>agreement, </em>as including not only the prom ise, but also the consideration for which it is made. And if <em>agreement, </em>as used in the statute, is to be taken, not in a popular, but in a strictly legal sense, it may be unreasonable to question the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">On looking further, we find the case of <em>Egerton </em>vs. <em>Matthews </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, where it was determined on the seventeenth section of the same statute (similar to the second section of our statute), that a memorandum of a bargain for the sale of goods, signed by the party to be charged, would take the contract out of the statute, although the consideration of the bargain was not expressed in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">These two decisions are not easily to be reconciled, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A bar gain is a contract or agreement between two parties, the one to sell goods or lands, and the other to buy them. A contract of this sort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>is void in law, unless made on sufficient consideration. And the consideration of a bargain seems to be as necessary a [*361 ] part of it, *as of any other contract or agreement; and there is the same danger of perjury in proving the consideration of a bargain by paroi, as of any other agreement. But if the word <em>agreement </em>may be understood in the popular sense, as intending the undertaking of the party charged, and as not necessarily including the consideration for it, we may approve of the decision in the latter case, while we may doubt as to the former case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">But we do not think it necessary further to consider the application of these cases, which will require further time, as we are satisfied that the contract before us is not a contract to pay the debt of another within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant is an original party to the contract, as well as <em>Chaplin. </em>The contract, in its legal construction, is a promise made, as well by the defendant as by <em>Chaplin, </em>for value received, to pay fifteen hundred dollars to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. To this promise <em>Chaplin </em>has signed as principal, and the defendant as surety. This mode of signing is an accommodation between the promisers, by which the defendant is entitled, if he pay the note, to an indemnity from <em>Chaplin; </em>but as to the intestate, they must be considered as joint and several promisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The legal effect of a note in this form is not different from a note in the form of \u201c For value received I promise to pay,\u201d &amp;c., and signed by one with the word <em>principal </em>annexed to his name, and by another with the word <em>surety </em>thus annexed. Or if the form of the note had been \u201c For value received I, <em>A. B., </em>as principal, and I, <em>C. D., </em>as surety, promise to pay,\u201d &amp;c. This last form is not uncommon, and the promise has always been holden to be made by each as original promiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">If this note had been made by <em>Chaplin, </em>and delivered to <em>Bennet, </em>the intestate, and afterwards the defendant had been [ * 362 ] induced to guaranty the payment, it would * have been necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s objection. But in the present case, the signatures of the promisers were made at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>same time, and before the note was delivered to Bennet; and when he received the note, it was the note of both, and also of each; or, in other words, it was their joint and several note.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANj\"><em>Bidwell, Attorney-General, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The consideration to bind the surety is apparent on the face of the note, being the credit given to the principal by the promisee for the value received of him <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The case of <em>Marsh </em>vs. Ward, in <em>Peake\u2019s N. P. </em>130., is similar in principle. There the note was, \u201c I promise to pay <em>W. M. 81. </em>5s. for value received in fixtures,\u201d and it is signed <em>Robert Bowling, Thomas Ward. Ward </em>alone was sued, and it was holden that the note was as well several as joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In the note in the case at bar, <em>Chaplin </em>as principal promises payment, and the defendant as surety promises payment; and the promise is joint and several.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">On this ground the plaintiff must have judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b287-12\"> 6 East. 307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b287-13\"><em> </em>It is remarkable that the Court did not advert to this obvious distinction be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tween the cases. In <em>Egerton </em>vs. <em>Matthews, </em>the consideration appeared on the face of the memorandum; but m <em>Wain </em>vs. <em>Warlters, </em>no consideration appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The cases like <em>Egerton </em>vs. <em>Matthews </em>are <em>Stadt </em>vs. <em>Lill, </em>1 <em>Camp.
