No express price for the hire was agreed upon. After the defendant had rode to the <em>Punch Bowl, </em>and tarried there about 15 minutes, he rode on about <em>4i </em>miles further to <em>Watertown. </em>After staying there until past 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, he returned with the horse and sleigh to <em>Gen. W.\u2019s </em>door in <em>Boston, </em>one of the general\u2019s family being in the sleigh, after 10 o\u2019clock. Having remained at the general\u2019s about five minutes, he took the horse and sleigh to return them to <em>Wheelock; </em>and having rode about two rods, the horse, after rearing up, fell dead on one of the shafts of the sleigh, which was broken by the fall. The sleigh was returned to <em>Wheelock, </em>and notice given by <em>Wheelwright </em>that the horse was dead. It was agreed that the defendant did not ride the horse immoderately, or neglect to feed or cover him properly with cloths.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">If the Court should be of opinion that on this evidence the plaintiff can, in this action, recover damages on account of the horse it was agreed the verdict should stand; otherwise it should be set aside, and a general verdict entered for the defendant, and judg ment be rendered accordingly.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">At this term, after a brief argument by <em>Otis </em>and <em>Parker </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Whitman </em>for the defendant, the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b86-8\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">[After stating the action, and the facts.] Upon comparing the evidence with the declaration, we are satisfied that the case agreed has negatived the <em>gravamen </em>alleged by the plaintiff in his declaration, and that in this action the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9-pl-split\">The defendant, by riding the horse beyond the place for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>he had liberty, is answerable to the plaintiff in trover. For thus riding the horse is an unlawful conversion; and if the horse had been returned to the * plaintiff, the defendant [ * 106 ] might have given it in evidence, in mitigation of damages. As the horse was not returned, the defendant might have recovered the value of the horse in damages. What that value was, must be settled by a jury. If the horse in fact labored under a mortal distemper, although unknown before his death, the damages would have been the value of a horse so diseased. But it would have been incumbent on the defendant to have proved that from any causes the horse was not worth the apparent value; and if he failed to satisfy the jury of the reduced value, the plaintiff ought to recover the apparent value.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">According to the facts, the plaintiff\u2019s action is misconceived. It should have been trover, and not case for improperly using the horse. And if this verdict should stand, it would not be a bar to an action of trover for a conversion by riding the horse to a place without the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The verdict must be set aside, and a general verdict entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
