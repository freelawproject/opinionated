This act is for the preservation of salmon, shad, and alewives in the waters within the counties of <em>Lincoln </em>and <em>Cumberland. </em>The preamble to the second section recites that the preservation of the fisheries there is of great importance to the public. The penalties for taking the fish contrary to the statute, are imposed on all persons whatsoever. Every citizen must then take notice of this statute at his peril. It is therefore a public statute, and the Courts of law must <em>ex officio </em>take notice of it. Indeed all our fish laws, imposing penalties on all persons offending against them, are made for the public benefit, and are public statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Judgment is not arrested.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
