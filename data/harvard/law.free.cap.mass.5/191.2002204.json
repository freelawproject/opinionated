And the rule was discharged accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Afterwards the defendant\u2019s counsel moved that all further proceedings stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">And it appearing by the statute <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> directing the bond, and by the bond, that it was given for the sole use of the commonwealth, and no law having authorized any person to avail himself of a breach of the condition; and it farther appearing that the action was not commenced, and is not prosecuted by either of the public law officers, nor by any, other person having authority to prosecute the same, it was ordered <em>by the Court </em>that all further proceedings in this action should stay.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> <em>Thomas </em>vs. <em>Leach &amp; al. </em>2 <em>Mass.
