The trial court, however, has found that the child, instead of being engaged in riding the velocipede about the store, was sitting upon it near the counter and that the plaintiff collided with her. These findings have sufficient support in the testimony of the defendant\u2019s clerk, who stated that, as he stood wiping his hands on a towel at the entrance to the washroom at the back of the store, he saw the accident, and who described it substantially as found by the court. We cannot correct the finding in any respect which would materially affect the conclusion of the trial court that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
