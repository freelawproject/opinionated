The verdict is not so manifestly and palpably against the evidence as to give assurance that the jury were influenced by passion, ignorance, partiality, corruption or lack of understanding of the issues or the evidence. Since the verdict was one to which twelve honest men acting fairly and intelligently might come, it was final and could not be legally set aside by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">There is error, and the Superior Court is directed to enter judgment upon the verdict as rendered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
