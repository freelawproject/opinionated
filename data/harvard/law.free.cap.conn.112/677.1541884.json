No claim is made that the driver of the car, who had every opportunity to have seen the plaintiff from the time he left the curb until he was struck, was not negligent. If the jury found these facts it was not unreasonable to find the plaintiff's own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>negligence did not materially contribute to the injuries suffered in consequence of his impact with this automobile. The trial court properly held that the court must under our law consider the plaintiff\u2019s case upon the facts in evidence in the most favorable light that they might be reasonably considered. A verdict upon a conflict of the evidence will not be set aside on appeal unless it has been unreasonably reached in manifest violation of our established rule. <em>Berg </em>v. <em>Spivakowski, </em>86 Conn. 98, 99, 84 Atl. 329.
