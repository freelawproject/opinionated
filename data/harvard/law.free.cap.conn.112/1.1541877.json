Thus the lot as pointed out to the plaintiff by Gilbert began at a point one hundred and twenty feet from the southeast corner of the Ayer lot, giving the Ayer lot a frontage of one hundred and twenty feet on Newfield Avenue, and encroached twenty feet upon the northerly lot as it had been conveyed by Hull to the defendant. The acts of trespass of which the plaintiff complains all occurred upon this latter twenty-foot strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">The trial court having evidence of the statements of Gilbert to the plaintiff about the iron pipes marking the easterly corners of the middle lot, and having before it the deeds by which Gilbert and his successors in title had conveyed the three lots to their then owners, had only to decide whether to rely upon the description of the plaintiffs lot as contained in his deed from Gilbert read in connection with the descriptions in these other deeds and in the light of the surrounding circumstances, or to establish the location of the plaintiff\u2019s land by the declaration of Gilbert that the easterly corners were marked by the two iron pipes. The trial court assumed that Gilbert\u2019s deed of the southerly lot to Ayer contained an ambiguous description, and admitted evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>dence of Gilbert\u2019s declarations as an exception to ihe rule against hearsay statements. Gilbert may have thought that there was uncertainty about the location of the Ayer lot, but in the easterly boundary \u201cone hundred feet more or less\u201d there was no patent ambiguity in his deed to Ayer and the finding discloses that it contained no latent ambiguity, as the Ayer lot was bounded on the south by View Street which at the time of the trial had been duly laid out, an iron pipe marking the intersection of its northerly line with the westerly line of Newfield Avenue and the bounds of which appeared of record. The Ayer lot being definitely located made a proper monument for the southerly boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>57 Conn. 447, 18 Atl. 714; <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Whittlesey, </em>73 Conn. 530, 48 Atl. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">In the deed from Gilbert to Parmalee there was an ambiguity in its southern boundary, the precise location not being fixed. In the deeds from Parmalee to Hull and from him to the defendant the southern boundary is fixed, since in each of these deeds the land conveyed is bounded seventy feet by Newfield Avenue. If the frontage of the Ayer lot is taken at one hundred feet, as it must be in the absence of any facts showing that it was one hundred and twenty feet, and the plaintiff\u2019s frontage on this avenue is that given in his deed, forty-six feet, the total is the two hundred and sixteen feet frontage of the entire original tract owned by Gilbert. In order to reach the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s frontage is forty-six feet, and that it includes the disputed twenty-foot strip, it is necessary to assume the Ayer lot frontage to be one hundred and twenty feet instead of one hundred feet and the Parmalee-Hull-Blinn frontage as fifty feet instead of seventy feet, and these we think are unwarranted assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">The trial court finds that Gilbert in fact believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that the boundary of the Ayer lot was uncertain. If this be correct it conflicts with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Ayer frontage was one hundred and twenty feet which was indispensable to the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s lot fronted on Newfield Avenue forty-six feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The court further concludes that Gilbert did not intend to deed to the plaintiff a piece of land the north boundary of which from east to west was to be a line running to the west from a point one hundred and forty-six feet on Newfield Avenue measuring from the southeast corner of the Ayer lot, but that Gilbert intended to convey to the plaintiff a lot having a frontage of forty-six feet, the northern twenty feet of which reduced the defendant\u2019s frontage from seventy feet, as claimed by her, to fifty. We think these conclusions cannot be justified under these deeds, read in the light of the circumstances, and giving due weight to the declarations of Gilbert, they having been admitted in evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and the cause is remanded with direction to the Court of Common Pleas to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
