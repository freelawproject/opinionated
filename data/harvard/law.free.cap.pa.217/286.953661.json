It appeared that prior to the accident plaintiff asked his superior for a new flatter, saying that the old one was worn, or a little cracked.

On a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto Ralston, J., filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">The plaintiff is a skilled workman, having followed the trade of blacksmith for eleven years. He went into the employ of defendants in July, 1903. On January 20, 1904, a chip flew off from a tool called a \u201c flatter,\u201d with which he was working, entered his eye and destroyed the sight. Plaintiff was at this time twenty-six years of age. lie testified that if he wanted new tools he got them from Mr. Preisen, who was termed \u201c a contractor \u201d and was his immediate superior. One of the plaintiff\u2019s helpers told him the flatter was cracked. Plaintiff asked Preisen for a new flatter. He replied, \u201c Go ahead and use it; I haven\u2019t any more ; it is good enough; go ahead with it.\u201d Plaintiff worked with the flatter for about an hour, the helpers striking it with sledges weighing about thirteen or fourteen pounds, when - the piece of steel flew off where it was cracked and struck him in the eye. On cross-examination, he said that he complained about the flatter because it was worn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>down and he needed a new one ; that it might be dangerous and might \"break, and might not break at all; he thought there was a little danger there, but not that dangerous. He stated that he. would dress up a tool like this when it became worn by putting it in the lire and trimming it down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">Diiffy, one of the plaintiff\u2019s helpers, testifies that Jones asked Preisen for a flatter and said that one was a little bit cracked. Preisen said he had no more, to go on and work with it. It was not claimed that Preisen promised to remedy the defect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">It appeared that a flatter isa hand tool consisting of a square piece of metal with a hole for the insertion of a handle; it is held like a hammer, with one side against the metal to be shaped, and upon the other side blows are struck with sledges. The plaintiff was in the habit of using this tool, and of fixing it up when repairs were required. According to his testimony, he did not tell Preisen that the flatter was cracked, but asked him for a new one because the old one was worn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">The plaintiff was as good a judge of the safety of the tool as Preisen, and did not regard it as dangerous. It does not appear that the tool was shown to Preisen, or that he had an opportunity to discover that it was dangerous or unfit to use. It was the duty of the plaintiff to repair his tools, and thp only knowledge of the condition of the tool imputed to Preisen is that it was worn and a'little bit cracked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">If there was any danger in using the tool, it must have been better known to the plaintiff than to anyone else. While the testimony of the plaintiff is that the chip flew off at the place where the flatter was cracked, there is no evidence that it flew off because of the crack, or that there was anything in the condition of the tool to indicate to an experienced observer that a chip was likely to fly off from it and do injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">In Lehman v. Carbon Steel Co., 204 Pa. 612, 614, Mr. Justice Fell said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-10\">\u201c The danger of the work was not mentioned and apparently not contemplated by anyone. If there was unusual danger it was manifest to the plaintiff, more manifest to him than to any other person.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-11\">There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants, while if a defect of a dangerous character existed in the flatter it was one which the plaintiff observed and of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>lie should have had intelligent knowledge and ability to estimate by reason of his experience and special training.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0K\">April 1, 1907:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">A servant will be presumed to have notice of all risks, which to a person of his experience and understanding are or ought to be open and obvious: Railroad Company v.

Sims, 213 Pa. 1, \u201c The oft-repeated rule as to this is, that an employee who continues in an employment, which by reason of defective machinery or appliances he knows to be dangerous, assumes the risk of any accident that may result therefrom, with the qualification that if in pursuance of the promise of his employer to remedy the defect, and the risk be not such as to threaten immediate danger, the employee continue in the employment and be injured without fault on his part, the employer may be liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">The motion for judgment non obstante veredicto upon the whole record is allowed, and judgment is entered for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-8\"><em>Joseph W.
