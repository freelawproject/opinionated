Penrose, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">In view of the fact that within a few years after the' decedent came to this country, in 1858, both he and his wife whom he left in England, whom he had married in 1854, married again, he in 1868 and she in 1869, the conclusion cannot be avoided without a disregard of settled principles of the law of presumptions, that there was a legal dissolution of their marriage. By her marriage in 1869 to James Hirst, the wife became the mother of six children, and he having died, in 1880, she became the wife of Charles Dyson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-8\">Thus, if the decedent continued to be her husband, they were both guilty of bigamy, and the children by her second marriage were all illegitimate. But the presumption against crime, and still more the presumption in favor of legitimacy, forbid such a result; and nothing less than positive, affirmative proof to the contrary can be accepted as sufficient to overcome such presumptions, especially in view of the great lapse of time and of the further fact that both parties are dead. Every intendent and every inference will be made in favor of innocence and legitimacy: Best on Evidence, sec. 346. \u201c So strong is this presumption,\u201d it is said in 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, sec. 35, \u201c that even when the guilt can only be established by proving a negative,- the negative must, in such cases, be proved by the party alleging the guilt, though the general rule of law devolves the burden of proof on the party holding the affirmative,\u201d See also Wile\u2019s Estate, 6 Pa. Dist. Rep. 384; s. c., 6 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Superior Ct. 435; Richardson\u2019s Estate, 132 Pa. 292. Upon this point no importance whatever can be attached to the testimony of the daughter who remained with the wife in England, with regard to the absence of a divorce. She was but two years old when her father came to America, and but thirteen when her mother married James Hirst, in 1869. The conclusion reached by the auditing judge in favor of the claim of the wife whom the decedent married in 1868 might well be sustained on the ground thus suggested ; but he has placed it upon grounds which are unanswerable and conclusive. If, when the decedent contracted the second marriage, he had not been divorced from the woman whom, years before, he had left in England, the marriage, although solemnized in church, as it was, with due religious ceremony, was void, in spite of the conceded innocence of the wife and her ignorance of the existence of any obstacle. Nor could it have acquired validity if the first wife had survived the husband, no matter how great the lapse' of time or what the belief in the community in which the parties resided. But the first wife did not survive. She died in May, 1891, and the decedent lived until October, 1904. During all this time, a period of more than thirteen years, the person to whom he had been formally married in 1868 was recognized by him and by herself and by the community as his lawful wife. Naturally there was no repetition of a marriage ceremony, or any formal expression of marriage contract, for the wife never had knowledge that the one already entered into was not valid ; but each day during these many years that they thus lived together there was an assertion by acts and conduct which in law are as efficacious as words for establishing a contract by implication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">That marriage may be established by long continued cohabitation and reputation is too well settled to require citation of authority. See Richard v. Brehm, 73 Pa. 140; and while there is a presumption of continuance as to a relation illicit in its inception, under such circumstances as existed in Hunt\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 294, where the interval during which it might have become lawful was but two months (December 13, 1873, to February 16, 1874, or in Grimm\u2019s Estate, 131 Pa. 199, where it was but one week), the doctrine of those cases is not to be extended to one like the present, where in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>good faith the parties continue to live together as husband and wife, after the complete removal of the only obstacle in the way of a valid marriage, and so for many years continuously proclaim themselves to the public until the relation ceases by the husband\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">The presumption of continuance of an illicit relation, under such circumstances, gives away to the superior presumption in favor of compliance with the requirements of the law, of morality, and of common decency. See Greenleaf on Evr dence, sec. 41; Bergdoll\u2019s Estate, Y Pa. Dist. Pep. 13Y.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">In Hantz v. Sealy, 6 Binney, 405, which is supposed by the exceptant to establish the doctrine that when the relation was originally illicit it cannot become lawful without a formal and express declaration, the woman, who did not make such declaration, appears to have left the man after his divorce from the wife, and, without asserting a marriage, sued him in her unmarried name for a legacy which had been left to her by a testator of whose will the defendant was executor, the defense being, inter alia, that the suit could not be maintained because the plaintiff was the wife of the defendant. What was said by the court with regard to the marriage was said with reference to the facts thus disclosed by the evidence, and has no application to the very different facts of the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">But the case does not rest upon the mere long continued cohabitation and reputation after the death of the first wife. There was not only the introduction of the wife as such to strangers by the husband, but the fact that they were husband and wife was solemnly recited and declared in a deed, duly executed and acknowledged by both, to the city of Philadelphia, in December, 1896, and in the face of this deed a finding that there was then no valid marriage would be impossible. The case might safely rest on this alone. Nothing need be added to what has been said by the auditing judge on the subject of commissions.
