Trial by jury at the December Term, 1910, Caledonia County, <em>Butler, </em>J., presiding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">During the progress of the trial, on motion of plaintiff, a discontinuance was entered as to defendant Blanchard, to which no exception was taken. Defendant Ricker testified that he signed the note in question, which is dated August 21,1901, for $1,000, payable twelve months after date to the order of Woodsville National Bank, and signed by B. F. Ricker, J. W. Blanchard, and defendant B. M. Ricker. It appeared that defendant Ricker had none of the proceeds of the note, and as between the signers was in fact a surety. About December, 1904, or January, 1905, B. F. Ricker failed and went into bankruptcy. On the note \u2019appeared five indorsements of interest paid, the first on October 2, 1902, and the last on September 24, 1904, it being the interest to October 1, 1904. There was also an indorsement under date of January 26, 1909, \u201cReeed. $10.25 from trustee in bankruptcy, 1%.\u201d And under date of June 3, 1909, there was an indorsement of a payment of $25.63 by the trustee in bankruptcy. Between the two last indorsements is written, \u201cWithout recourse to Woodsville National Bank, by H. W. Allen, Cashier.\u201d None of the indorsements were in the handwriting of defendant Ricker, and there was no evidence that he ever made or authorized any of those payments, unless it appears by inference from the letters hereinafter referred to that the payments made by the trustee of B. F. Ricker\u2019s estate in bankruptcy were so made. In consequence of a letter from defendant Ricker to H. W. Allen, Cashier, in February, 1906, and by the latter shown to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the note was proved by plaintiff against said estate in bankruptcy. That letter was offered in evidence, but excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">The writ is dated September 27, 1909. There was evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>that soon after the note was given it was sold and transferred by the Woodsville National Bank to plaintiff. On March 12, 1908, Jerry Abbott, plaintiff\u2019s treasurer, wrote and mailed the following, which was signed by him as such treasurer: \u201cThe interest on your note for one thousand dollars to April 1, 1908, will be $226.20, and you are requested to pay the same on or before that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-3\">To B.

F. Ricker and J. W.' Blanchard. The note is given for $1,000, and there has been no interest paid since October 1, 1904, and no payment on the note except a dividend from the bankrupt estate of B. F. Ricker of $10.25 received Jan. 26, 1909. The bank desires this note paid at once. Please give this matter your - immediate attention and let me hear from you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In answer to that letter, defendant Ricker wrote said attorney under date of May 15, 1909, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-3\">\u201cYours received I am sorry to say that I cannot do anything for the Bank now I have lost my money and have no funds to pay with they know all about it.

Defendant Ricker then moved for a directed verdict, which was refused. Thereupon, defendant Rickernot wishing to go to the jury on any issue, and electing to stand, on his motion, on motion of plaintiff a verdict was directed in its favor for the amount due on the note, and judgment rendered thereon. Defendant Ricker excepted to the overruling of his motion for a directed verdict, to the direction of a verdict for plaintiff, and to the rendition of judgment thereon.

There can be no doubt that in each of these letters the defendant acknowledged the note as an existing indebtedness, but this is not enough. To prevent the statutory bar, the acknowledg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\"ment must be of such a character and made in such circumstances as to indicate or be consistent with a willingness to remain liable. <em>Brayton </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>41 Vt. 621; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Vershire, </em>63 Vt. 517, 22 Atl. 655. When the letter of March 16 was written by the defendant the note had yet five months to run before it would be outlawed as to him. It was in reply to a notice sent him by the treasurer of the plaintiff, under date of March 12, stating the amount of the interest on the note to April 1, and requesting its payment on or before that date, and further stating (on a separate sheet) that the bank must have the interest at least, \u201ccannot'wait any longer.\u201d B. F. Nicker, one of the principals on the note for whom'the defendant was in fact surety, was then in bankruptcy. In these circumstances the defendant, in that letter to the plaintiff\u2019s treasurer, asks for the date of the note, the dates of the payments thereon, and then says, <em>\u201c </em>Frank\u2019s bankruptcy (case) has not been settled yet you get all you can out of the other parties he and John Blanchard had the money.\u201d We think thereby the defendant impliedly indicated a willingness to remain liable on the note; that the letter has the force of saying, \u201cI want you to get all you can out of the other parties (for they had the money), and I am willing to pay the rest.\u201d The case of <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>18 N. Y. 558, is very much in point. There one Bowman had the money and was the principal for whom the other defendants were sureties. Before the statute had run the plaintiff called \u25a0upon Hicks for payment of the note, being willing to forego the payment of the principal if the interest should be paid. Hicks replied in substance, \u201cthat he (plaintiff) must get it out \u25a0of Bowman.\u201d This reply of Hicks was held sufficient to bind him; that it meant in other words, \u201cI am surety only, and though liable and willing 'to pay, if the principal fails so to do, I wish you to request him to pay it, and if he refuses or fails, you can call on me again.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\">The letter of September 17, though written after six years from the maturity of the note had elapsed, contained, in this respect, in substance the same as the letter of March 16, with the further statement, \u201cshall be home in two weeks and will see you then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We think that these two letters (without considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>third) were reasonably sufficient to justify the verdict ordered and the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
