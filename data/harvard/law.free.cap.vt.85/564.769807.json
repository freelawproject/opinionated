The contestants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-12\">The will appoints Dyer Bill as the executor thereof, and is witnessed by Isaac N. Cushman, William Raymore, and James Kelly. The bill of exceptions is in the handwriting of Judge Poland, and recites that, \u201cThe appellants filed no written pleas, but objected that the said will was not duly executed so as to be a valid will. The case was tried by the court, and the following facts appeared: The will was written at the dwelling house of said Pope, who was then lying sick, by Hon. I. N. Cushman, and, after written, read to the testator, who pronounced it-drawn according to his wish. The testator then signed the will, Cushman, Raymore, one of the witnesses, and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Bill, the executor, being present. Cushman and Raymore then witnessed the will. Judge Cushman intended to have Dr. Bill sign for the third witness, but it then occurred to him that, as he was the executor named in the will, he might not be a competent witness. Raymore was then sent to a neighbor\u2019s for Kelly, the other witness, who immediately came, and went into the room where the testator was with Cushman and Raymore. Cushman then read the concluding part of the will to Pope and shew him this signature upon it, and asked if it was his last will and testament. Pope replied that it was, and that he had signed it. Cushman then shew Kelly the place to sign his name as a witness, and told him that Raymore and himself had already signed as witnesses to the will. Kelly then signed his name. This was done in the bedroom where Pope was lying, and all done in the presence and hearing of him and of Raymore, who was also in the same room from the time Kelly came till he left. The appellants claimed that these facts did not show the said will to be properly executed. But the court held that the said paper was duly executed and entitled to probate. No other question was made in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-6\"><em>J. H.
