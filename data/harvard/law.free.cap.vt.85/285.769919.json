The buildings on that prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u2022erty were destroyed by fire in January, 1910. For some time before that, and continuously during all the time here material, defendant was in possession of the Hotel Burlington property \u2022under a trust deed thereof'to him from the owner, George M. Delaney. After the fire, defendant, as such trustee, advertised the property to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder on June 4, 1910, and the auction was had accordingly. A few hours before the auction, plaintiff and defendant executed a written agreement, the body of which is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">\u201cThat said Miller hereby agreees to act as agent of Max L. Powell in the purchase at auction of the Hotel Burlington property on Saturday, June 4, at 2:00 p. m. And said Powell hereby agrees to protect him in any bid he may make, and to take the property from him, and to save him harmless in every \u25a0way by reason of his bid; and on his part the said Miller agrees to turn over the property, if it is bid in by him, on request. And it is mutually understood and agreed that in bidding at \u25a0said auction said Miller is to act simply as the agent of said Powell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">When this agreement was made nothing was said about pay for plaintiff\u2019s agreed services. Defendant gave plaintiff instructions as to the manner of bidding on the property, and it was understood that the agency should not be disclosed. Plaintiff attended the auction, in good faith followed defendant\u2019s instructions to his satisfaction, and bid in the property at $17,000.-00. Later conveyances of the property from defendant, as such trustee, to plaintiff, and from plaintiff to defendant and his wife were prepared and plaintiff was asked to execute the latter deed, but refused unless he were paid $500.00 for his services. That defendant declined to do, and no deed of the property was ever executed by plaintiff. It is found that his services at the auction were worth $35.00, for which sum, with his costs plaintiff had judgment. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-7\"><em>Max L. Powell </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-8\"><em>H. 8. Peek </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-9\">Watson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">Defendant excepted to the judgment on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>grounds: (1) that the written contract is silent as to compensation; and (2) that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover \u25a0compensation until he has performed his entire part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The first ground is untenable; for the fact that the written contract says nothing regarding compensation is not conclusive in law against the plaintiff\u2019s right to reasonable compensation for the services performed. On the second ground it is said that plaintiff refused to execute the deed presented him by the defendant for that purpose, to convey the property to the defendant and his wife, without the payment to plaintiff of the sum of five hundred dollars for ffi's services, which sum the defendant refused to pay. If it be true, as claimed, that it was necessary for the plaintiff to \u201cturn over the property\u201d bid off by him, to constitute full performance of the contract on his part, entitling him to compensation, it was no part of his contract to convey the property to the defendant and his wife. The contract was one of agency, and by it the defendant agreed to protect the plaintiff in any bid he might make, and to take the property from him, etc.; and the plaintiff agreed \u201cto turn over the property if it is bid in by him, on request.\u201d Construing the latter provision in the light of the context, its fair meaning at most obligated the plaintiff to turn over the property to the <em>defendant </em>on request, not to any one else. And this even he could not do, since the property was never conveyed to him by the defendant as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
