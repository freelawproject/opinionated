Defendants\u2019 notice under their rejoinder was that on the trial of said cause they would offer evidence tending to prove that the property in and the title to the trees on said close described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, at the time the said several supposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>trespasses were committed, were in the defendants; also that the plaintiff did not at the time this suit was brought, nor at any time since, have any property rights or ownership in the trees standing and growing on, or which had been cut from, said close and were thereon lying and being; also that the defendants went upon said close by leave and license of one E.

H. Saxby. It also appeared that whatever title the defendants had to the standing trees and this same lumber and bark, came to them from the same grantor, Saxby; that Saxby, by quitclaim deed' duly executed and recorded, conveyed to one J. B. Bean the timber on the close described, and that the same timber before it was in fact severed from the land, was in like manner conveyed by Bean to the defendants. Sylvanus H. Martin and Perley H. Martin joined as grantors in the deed from Saxby to Bean, but what their interest was in the land or timber described, the bill of exceptions does not show.

This deed contained the same time-limit clause as did the deed to Bean, with the words \u2018 \u2018and and not after\u201d inserted immediately after the date \u2018 \u2018April 1, 1905;\u201d it also contained in substance the same habendum, followed by the same covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">On October 22, 1908, Saxby and his wife quitclaimed all their right, title, and interest in the land, and also all their \u2018 \u2018right, title and interest in and to the timber cut from said piece-of land by J. B. Bean, or his assigns, or the agents ther\u00e9of, which was not removed from said land before the 2nd day of April, 1908, and all bark peeled from said timber.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s-evidence tended to show that he took possession of the premises, and the wood, lumber, and bark theron, under said deed shortly after its date. At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase there was-lumber and bark lying and being on the land, which was subsequently removed by the defendants. It appeared that all this lumber.had been cut by the defendants prior to April 1,1908, except about 3,000 feet, and that it was all cut and the bark peeled and piled sometime before the plaintiff got title by virtue of his deed from the Saxbys. The plaintiff purchased the farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>with full knowledge that defendants claimed they had paid for .and owned all the timber, lumber, wood and bark on that part of the farm described in the deed from Saxby to Bean. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that after his said purchase -sheSnotified the defendant not to remove the lumber and bark dying and being on said lot; and he claimed to recover the full \u2022value of all such lumber and bark there when he took his deed \u2018October 22, 1908, which was subsequently removed by the \u25a0defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-5\"><em>R, M.

In addition to the land, the plaintiff then acquired' all the right, title and interest in and to such lumber and bark as the Saxbys had. Before any of the standing timber was-cut the defendants took a conveyance from Bean of all his right and title therein with the appurtenances thereof. The ownership of the lumber and bark in question at the time named is therefore dependent upon the construction of the deed to Bean.. The plaintiff contends that the time-limit clause therein made the grantees title conditional on the timber being cut and removed from the land within the time specified, and that the-title to so much thereof as was not thus cut and removed remained in the grantor, or reverted to him at the expiration of that period. The defendants contend that the sale was-absolute, and that the so-called time-limit clause is a mere covenant naming a time within which entry upon the land might be made for the purpose of cutting and removing the timber..</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The question is, What was the intention of the grantors? And this must b.e ascertained from the whole instrument, with, a view to giving every part of it meaning and effect. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Lavelle, </em>44 Vt. 230. The habendum cannot enlarge the-grant, yet it may be considered in aid of its construction. <em>Deavitt </em>v. <em>Washington County, </em>75 Vt. 156, 53 Atl. 563. The same may be said of the covenant following the habendum, it cannot be understood as enlarging the estate granted in the premises, of the deed, yet it being a question of construction as to what. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>was granted, resort may be had to the covenant to help out the construction, and this, upon the principle that it must be in view of the whole instrument, and to give each part some operative effect. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Catlin, </em>22 Vt. 98. \u201cIt is an important rule of construction, applicable to all written instruments,\u201d says the Court in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>The Missisquoi R. R. Co., </em>59 Vt. 426, 10 Atl. 522, \u201cthat every word and every -clause shall, so far as possible, be given some force and meaning, and that in case, construing the whole instrument one way, meaning is given to every word and clause, while construing it another way some portion of the language used is rendered meaningless, the construction which gives force and meaning to all the language used, is, as a rule, to prewail. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The deed shows that the grantors \u201cforever quitclaim\u201d to Bean \u201call their right and title\u201d to the \u201clot of standing timber,\u201d described. \u201cIt being all the standing spruce, fir, hemlock, bass, ash and hard wood timber\u201d on the Martin farm, described as follows: \u201cIt being all the standing timber bounded,\u2019\u2019 \u2014 then follows a description by metes and bounds. The time-limit -clause, \u201cmeaning to convey all the standing timber upon said above described premises and said J. B. Bean shall have three years from April 1,1905, for the purpose of cutting and removing .said timber, \u201d is a paragraph by itself following the description and immediately preceding the habendum. The words of the habendum in essential respects are like those of the grant, \u201call our right and title in and to said quitclaimed standing timber with the appurtenances thereof, to the said J. B. Bean, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d And the words of the grantors\u2019 covenant next following are equally unlimited and positive in character, \u201cthat from and after the ensealing of these presents, we * * * will have and claim no right in, or to the said quitclaimed standing \u25a0timber.\u201d Such use of the words \u201cstanding timber\u201d in the habendum and in the covenant is significant. The word gen\u2022erally used in such, connection in quitclaim deeds is <em>premises, </em>.and is well adapted to designate the interest or estate intended to be conveyed, let it be all of the grantors\u2019 \u201cright and title\u201d 'in and to the property described, or a lesser interest. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>19 Vt. 272; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>56 Vt. 441. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>may well be asked why all the different parts of the deed, including the fore part of the paragraph containing the time-limit clause, were thus written in apt terms to effect an absolute and unconditional sale, unless such a sale was intended by the .grantors. It is pretty difficult to understand why the habendum and the covenant following it were peculiarly written in a way most consistent with an absolute grant, and inconsistent with the idea of conveying a limited or conditional estate, if the latter was intended. Indeed, there is nothing on the face of the instrument tending to support a construction giving such an estate only, except the time limit clause itself; and this clause, construed in the light of its purpose gathered from a consideration of the contract as a whole <em>(McLean </em>v. <em>Windham Light &amp; Lumber Co., 85 </em>Vt. 167, 81 Atl. 613,) may, without doing violence to the language used, be considered a covenant not affecting the independence of the grant, but fixing a time within which entry might be made upon the land for the purposes connected with it. It is said by Chancellor Kent (4 Kent\u2019s Com. 132.) and quoted with approval by this Court in <em>Palmer\u2019s Exr. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>63 Vt. 227, 22 Atl. 574, that, \u201cIf it be doubtful whether a clause in a deed be a covenant or a condition, the courts will incline against the latter construction.\u201d We hold therefore that the deed from Saxby and others to Bean constituted an absolute conveyance of the standing timber, and that the clause therein, pertaining to cutting and removing the timber, is a mere covenant giving the right of entry upon the land for such purpose during the period named. Consequently the charge to the' effect that if there was no extension of time, the lumber not removed from the land before the first day of April, 1908, became the property of Saxby, was error. <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Stratton Mills, </em>54 N. H. 109, 20 Am. Rep. 119; <em>Magnetic Ore Co. </em>v. <em>Markbury L. Co., </em>104 Ala. 465, 16 South. 632, 27 L. R. A. 434, 53 Am. St. Rep. 73; <em>Irons </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>12 Vroom, 203, 32 Am. Rep. 193; <em>C. W. Zimmerman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Daffin, </em>149 Ala. 380, 42 South. 858, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 663, 123 Am. St. Rep. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The plaintiff cites the cases of <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>40 Vt. 547, <em>Judevine </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>35 Vt. 19, and <em>Ordway </em>v. <em>Farrows, </em>79 Vt. 192, 64 Atl. 116, 118 Am. St. Rep. 951, as authorities supporting his contention. In <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>construction of the contract in this respect was not called in question. The plaintiff\u2019s brief before us says in that case \u201cit was conceded that the words there used created a condition and the court so construed them.\u201d In the Judevine case the grantors conveyed by deed the land on which the \u2018\u2018French Meeting House\u201d was situated, \u201cever reserving the said meeting house and meeting house sheds, and all stones on the premises, and the privilege of getting said house, sheds and stone off from the premises till the 1st day of April, 1853. We having the privilege of leaving what stone we choose to at said time.\u201d The stone described in the deed were the foundation stone of the buildings on the land. The plaintiffs removed the buildings, and a part of the stone before April 1, 1853. The remainder of the stone the defendant took and converted to his own use. The intention of the parties, as collected from the deed and the character of the transaction, was held to be that the plaintiffs should have no right to the property after the time named, unless they removed it from the premises before then. The fact that by the reservation the grantors had \u201cthe privilege of leaving what stone\u201d they \u201cchoose to at said time,\u201d having reference to the expiration of the time limited, was quite indicative of an intention to make the ownership conditional on such removal, and so far as the case shows there was no indication of a contrary intention. In the Ordway case the estate created by the conveyance of the timber was by the express terms of the deed dependent upon the \u201ccondition\u201d that he remove the timber within the time specified. There is nothing in those cases indicating that the deed upon which the right to the timber now in question rests has been given a wrong construction, and hence they are not in conflict with the views here expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">By Beans\u2019 conveyance to the defendants, they acquired all his right and title in and to the standing timber, and the same right of entry as an appurtenant thereof. <em>Yale </em>v. Seeley, 15 Vt. 221. The plaintiff took his conveyance of the land charged with full knowledge of the defendant\u2019s ownership of the lumber and bark thereon, and of whatever rights and privileges they had in connection therewith. By that conveyance the plaintiff acquired no right or title to said lumber and bark, for the Saxbys had none which they could convey. It follows that the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>of the logs and bark on the land at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase is not an element of damages which can be recovered in this action, and the exception to the failure of the court to charge in compliance with the defendants\u2019 eleventh request must be sustained. <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Stratton Mills, </em>before cited; <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>43 N. H. 277. But the time for cutting and removing the timber being expressly fixed in the deed of sale, the defendants* without a new license by virtue of which they could enter* were trespassers in entering to remove the lumber and bark, after the plaintiff became the owner of the land, and are liable for the damage done to him by such wrongful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The court charged upon the question of the extension of the license by parol, the effect thereof if extended, and its revocation, to some portions of which exceptions were saved. However, the bill of exceptions gives us no light regarding the evidence bearing thereon, other than the allusions thereto in the charge, and the conveyance of the land by the Saxbys to the plaintiff, which is not sufficient for a proper understanding of the situation. Consequently these exceptions are not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The other questions argued are not likely to arise on a new trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
