Trial in the court of common pleas before Mellen, J. who signed the following bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-11\">\u201c The defendants claimed title from one Calvin Shepard, under a mortgage from him, dated July 3d 1852. The conversion by them was admitted. There, was evidence tending to show an agreement between the plaintiff and Shepard for a sale of said machine to him, made in 1851, by which Shepard was to pay the plaintiff for the same one thousand dollars, in monthly payments of one hundred dollars each, and when the same was paid, the property was to become Shepard\u2019s ; and the property went into Shepard\u2019s possession under such agreement. There was also evidence tending to show that in pursuance of such agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ment Shepard had paid the plaintiff the sum of five hundred dollars, of which three hundred was paid before the mortgage of Shepard to the defendants. The whole one thousand dollars was never paid by Shepard. At the time of the conversion of the machine the remaining payments were due and in arrear; and no evidence was given of a waiver of the non-payment. The court ruled that the defendants could not show these payments in reduction of damages, and that the plaintiff was entitled to the full value of the machine at the time of the conversion, with interest from that time, and the jury found a verdict accordingly; to which ruling the defendants allege exceptions.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-5\"><em>D. </em>Foster, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa4X\">The balance of the purchase money due to the plaintiff, with interest, would fully indemnify him, and is the equitable and true measure of damages. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>14 Pick. 361. <em>Chamberlin </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>18 Pick. 283. <em>Dresser Manuf.

The facts show, not a sale, but an agreement for a sale, upon certain conditions precedent, to be performed by Shepard. Those conditions had not been performed at the time of the conversion by the defendants. The property therefore remained in the plaintiff, and the m\u00e9asure of damages is indemnity to the plaintiff' as the owner of the chattel, that is, the value of the property taken and interest from the time of the conversion The ruling of the court of commor . leas was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">\n<em>Mcceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
