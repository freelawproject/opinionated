The case is not within Rev. Sts. <em>c. 120, </em>\u00a7 11. The former action was not duly commenced, nor defeated for any matter of form. The action, not being brought in the county in which the trustee resided, the court had no jurisdiction over it; Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>109, \u00a7 7; it was a nullity, and would have been so treated by the court <em>ex officio, </em>or on motion of any one as <em>amicus curi\u0153.

The jurisdiction could only have attached by express consent of parties. Nor is this case within the equity of the statute.

Sts. <em>c. 120, </em>\u00a7 1. The cause of action accrued more than six years before the suit was commenced ; but the plaintiff relies on \u00a7 11 of the same chapter, by which it is provided, (among other things) that \u201c if, in any action duly commenced within the time in this chapter limited and allowed therefor, the writ shall be abated, or the action otherwise defeated, for any matter of form, the plaintiff may commence a new action for the same cause, at any time within one year after the abatement or other determination of the original suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The defendant denies, <em>first, </em>that the original action was duly commenced. We have, therefore, to inquire into the meaning of the words \u201c action duly commenced.\u201d Their meaning, we believe, is to be learned from the previous legislation on this matter. The English <em>St. </em>21 Jac. 1, <em>c. </em>16, \u00a7 4, made provision for commencing a second action, after the failure of the first, in three cases only; <em>first, </em>when judgment should be reversed by error; <em>second, </em>when, after verdict, upon matter alleged in arrest of judgment, judgment should be given against the plaintiff, that he take nothing by his plaint, writ or bill; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>third, </em>when, in an action brought by original, the defendant therein should be outlawed, and should afterwards reverse the outlawry. Our provincial <em>St. </em>10 Geo. 3, (Anc. Chart. 672,) and the <em>St. </em>of 1786, <em>c. </em>52, \u00a7 1, allowed, as causes for commencing a second action, only the first two allowed by the statute of James. But by the second section of <em>St. </em>1793, <em>c. </em>75, it was further provided, that any action declared in according to the first section of the same chapter, in which the writ purchased therefor should fail of a sufficient service or return, by any unavoidable accident, or by the default, negligence or defect of any officer to whom the writ should be directed, or when such writ should be abated, or the action thereby commenced should be avoided by demurrer, or otherwise, for any informality of proceedings, then another action upon the same demand might be commenced, and the limitation thereof saved. The first section, to which the second referred, was in these words : \u201cAny action of the case, or of debt grounded upon any lending or contract, or for arrearages of rent, actually declared upon in a proper writ, returnable according to law, purchased therefor before the first day of December last, [1793] or which has been or shall be so actually declared in, within the term of. six years next after the cause of such action accrued, shall be deemed and taken to be duly commenced and sued, within the meaning of said act <em>[St. </em>1786, <em>c. </em>52, \u00a7 1,] for the limitation of personal actions.\u201d The <em>St. </em>of 1786 limited the time within which actions should be originally \u201c commenced and sued.\u201d The <em>St. </em>of 1793 declared, that the making of a writ and inserting a declaration in it should be a <em>due </em>commencement and suing of an original action, and also of a second action when the first should fail through any of the causes of failure mentioned in that statute. The commissioners for revising the statutes combined, in \u00a7 11 of <em>c. </em>120, the provisions of <em>Sts. </em>1786 and 1793, concerning the bringing of a second action, and the legislature enacted that section in the words used by the commissioners. We therefore understand that, by an \u201c action duty commenced,\u201d that section means an action on a claim \u201c actually declared upon in a proper writ returnable according to law.\u201d And if these last quoted words had been inserted in \u00a7 11, instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of the words \u201c duly commenced,\u201d we could not have understood \u201c a proper writ \u201d to mean a writ that could not be abated or defeated for any matter of form, but must have understood it to mean a writ adapted to the cause of \u2018action. Lawes Pl. in Assump. 745. Such a writ was sued out and declared in by the plaintiff, in the first action on the note now in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The defendant denies, secondly, that the original writ was abated, or the action otherwise avoided or defeated for any matter of form, because the court dismissed that action for want of jurisdiction. But the bringing of the action in the wrong county might have been pleaded in abatement, and the writ been technically abated. 14 Mass. 134. 6 Cush. 564. Such plea, however, was unnecessary, because the objection was apparent on the writ, and was as well the subject of a motion to dismiss, as of a plea. The dismissal of the action is therefore to have the same legal effect as the abatement of the writ would have had. For the words used in the statutes declaring the cases in which a second action may be maintained, after a failure of the first, have always been construed favorably for the plaintiff\", and never have been held to have a technical meaning; but, as said by Shaw, C. J. in <em>Coffin </em>v. Cottle, 16 Pick. 386, are meant to declare, that \u201c where the plaintiff has been defeated by some matter not affecting the merits, some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process, the statute shall not prevent him from so doing, provided he follows it promptly, by a suit within a year.\u201d In that case it was decided that where, upon a <em>scire facias </em>on a judgment, that judgment was held invalid, on facts alleged in a plea to the <em>scire </em>facias, a second action on the original cause of action, commenced within a year, might be maintained, on the ground that such avoidance had the same legal effect under <em>St. </em>1786, <em>c. </em>52, as if the judgment had been reversed by reason of error, or arrested on motion, after verdict, according to the letter of that statute. So, under <em>St. 21 </em>Jac. 1, <em>c. </em>16, it was early decided that a second action was well brought within a year after the outlawry of the defendant had been adjudged void on plea. <em>Fynch </em>v. Lambe, Cro. Car. 294. The court there said: \u201cAlthough the outlawry is not reversed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>a writ of error, but avoided by plea, it is all one within the intent of the statute.\u201d See also <em>2 </em>Saund. 63 h, <em>note; </em>Blanshard on Lim. 110\u2014115; <em>2 </em>Greenl. Ev. 431, 432; <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Lindsay, 2 </em>Barr, 385; <em>Givens </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>11 Alab. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> Thomas, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
