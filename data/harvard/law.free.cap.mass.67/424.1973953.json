The parties submitted the case to the decision of the court upon the following facts: The defendants are incorporated by the laws of the State of Connecticut; and, at the time of the service of the trustee process upon them, were in the possession, under leases from the Berkshire Railroad Company and the Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad Company, of the roads of those corporations in this county; and under such leases and undei their charter, had agents at the stations in Pittsfield and other towns through which these roads pass; and were indebted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to Cbappel for work done by him, in the defendants\u2019 employment and for their benefit, in repairing the Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad in the town of Lee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARy\">It is agreed that the defendants have leases of railroads in this county, and this would make a strong case for charging them as trustees, if they could be chargeable as such, under any circumstances. But the case of <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Penny, </em>3 Met. 564, is decisive, and shows that a foreign corporation cannot be so charged. By Rev. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7 6, \u201c all corporations may be summoned as trustees.\u201d But what corporations ? The very generality of the terms requires some qualification. It cannot be construed literally all corporations, in whatever part of the world established and transacting business. The answer is to be found in the statutes in <em>pari materia then </em>existing. The statute in question was only an extension of an existing system. It was intended, we think, to put corporations on the same ground as individuals. And it is well settled that an individual, an inhabitant of another state, is not chargeable by the trustee process, although found in this commonwealth, and here served with process. <em>Tingley </em>v. <em>Bateman, </em>10 Mass. 343. <em>Nye </em>v. <em>Liscombe, </em>21 Pick. 263. In the case of corporations, which have no local habitation, the principle is this; if established in this commonwealth, by the laws thereof, they are inhabitants of this commonwealth within the meaning of the law; but if established only by the laws of another state, they are foreign corporations, and rannot be charged by the trustee process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
