There was no evidence where the first payment of interest was made, but there was evidence that the second payment was made in Massachusetts, and the last two in Hillsdale, N. Y. And it was admitted that the payments were for the annual interest on the following note: <em>\u201c </em>$200. For value received, I promise to pay Nehemiah Shutts or order two hundred dollars, to be paid in four annual payments of fifty dollars each, with the annual interest.

Williams, being called as a witness for the plaintiff testified that on the 1st of April 1847 the plaintiff and the defendant came to his house in Alford in this commonwealth, and he, at their request, drew a deed from the defendant to the plaintiff of land in Alford and Egremont, and also said note and a mortgage of said land to secure the payment thereof, and that the note was given as the consideration for the deed; that the defendant at that time inquired of Williams if he could not write the note so that he could have seven per cent., saying he had borrowed money in the State of New York for the accommodation .or benefit of the plaintiff, for which he had to pay seven per cent, interest; and the witness further testified that the plaintiff then agreed to pay seven per cent, interest on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The judge allowed the defendant, the plaintiff objecting, to introduce evidence tending to show that the deed, note and mortgage, and the promise to pay seven per cent, interest, so made in this commonwealth, were in pursuance of a previous oral agreement made by the parties in the State of New York, and for the purpose of carrying otit that agreement, and instructed the jury that, if they found they were so made, the taking of the seven per cent, interest was not unlawful.

The contract was in writing, and was the note. The note was made in Massachusetts, and its construction is to be governed by the laws of this commonwealth. If upon the face of a contract it appears that it was to be performed elsewhere, that may be regarded as- an adoption of the law of the place of performance, and so making it a part of the contract. There is nothing in this contract to indicate such purpose. The rate of interest was fixed by the contract as much as if the six per cent, had been written in it. The taking of move was usurious and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Some of these payments were made in New York. Why effect, if any, this fact would have, we do not determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
