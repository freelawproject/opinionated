The plaintiff brought an action upon the note, in which the defendant prevailed on a plea of infancy. The plaintiff, immediately thereafter, demanded a return of the cow; and, the defendant not returning her, brought the present action. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant had sold the cow, and received the money for her, before the note fell due, and that he had not since had the possession Dr control of her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">Upon the facts conceded, and which the evidence tended to show, the defendant contended, and requested the judge to rule, \u201c 1st. That the plaintiff\u2019s treating the note as a valid contract, when in a condition of mind competent to judge of the circumstances under which it was given, and afterwards bringing suit upon it, were a conclusive ratification of the sale on his part. 2d. That bringing the action on the note was a waiver of the tort complained of. 3d. That as the original cause of action was grounded in contract, the plaintiff could not maintain tort, if the jury should find that, when the note fell due, and the demand was made for a return of the cow, the defendant had sold her and parted with the possession and control of her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">But the judge ruled against the defendant on all these points, and instructed the jury, \u201c that if, upon the whole evidence in reference to the fraud, they should find the sale void for that cause, the plaintiff\u2019s treating the contract afterwards as a valid contract, and the acts done by the plaintiff and defendant after such sale, as stated in the evidence, would not prevent the plaintiff from recovering, the defendant himself having prevented the plaintiff from enforcing payment of the note, by his successful defence to the action by his plea of infancy.\u201d The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-7\"><em>C. </em>Delano, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak8\">Whatever cause of action in tort the plaintiff had, prior to his demand, was waived both by his ratification of the contract, and by his election of remedies.

The defendant obtained the possession of her by fraud, a fraud to which infancy would constitute no defence. Supposing no contract to have been made, the plaintiff then had the election to bring his action for the tort, or, as the cow had been sold before the note became due, to waive the tort and bring assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In this case, however, there was a voidable contract made. But the contract had this peculiarity. It might be avoided by either party; by the plaintiff on the ground of drunkenness, and by the defendant on the ground of infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Ordinarily, in the case of torts, it is in the election of the owner of the property wrongfully taken, to bring his action for the tort, or, waiving that, to bring assumpsit, and when he brings the latter, the defendant is estopped to say there was no promise and that he took the property wrongfully, or to set up his own fraud or wrong in defence of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In the case at bar, the contract needed a double affirmation to conclude the parties. The fraud or tort was merged in the contract, only when the contract had become complete. The plaintiff, by bringing his action upon the note, declared his willingness to affirm the contract. The defendant, on the other hand, still elected, as he had a right to do, to avoid the contract. This want of assent of the defendant is fatal, and the contract never becomes complete. The title to the cow did not pass. The tort was not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">If the defence to the action upon the contract had been one, which admitted its validity, and then sought to discharge it, as a discharge in insolvency of the defendant, payment, set off, or the statute of limitations, the judgment in the case would have concluded the parties. The contract being once complete, the plaintiff could not return to his remedy for the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">What was the effect of the new demand, it is not material to consider, as the facts show a conversion by the defendant before the demand was made, and the demand was therefore wholly unnecessary. <em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
