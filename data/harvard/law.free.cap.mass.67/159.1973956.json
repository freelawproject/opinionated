There was conflicting evidence upon the question whether the defendant kept the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tiff in custody, after the transcript of the record was ordered to be returned to the clerk, and after the defendant was directed to let the plaintiff go out of his custody. It. also appeared that the plaintiff was confined in the house of correction two months from the said 15th of October, according to his sentence; and that no sentence was passed a second time, further than is shown by the facts stated in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">The case was submitted to the jury with instructions that if, upon trial, conviction and sentence of the plaintiff, he was ordered by the court into custody, and the sheriff pursuant to such order took him into custody, for this he would not be liable, so long as such order remained unrescinded and in force; out if the court rescinded the order on suspending the sentence or the execution of the sentence, the sheriff would be liable if he detained him in custody after it was so rescinded, and that he would have no right to take him into custody until a new order was given for that purpose by the court, or sentence passed, or the sentence already passed ordered to be enforced; that if the. court, on the fifteenth day of October, being during the term, ordered the transcript of the record made on the 14th to be redelivered to the sheriff to be by him executed according to the order and sentence of the court, and he so executed it, he would not be liable in this action for so doing, although he nad unlawfully detained him in custody on the 14th after the order to hold him in custody had been rescinded; and if the court passed sentence on the 14th, and the defendant was ordered and taken into custody, and the sentence or its execution afterwards suspended in the manner before stated, the defendant would not be liable for the subsequent commitment of the plaintiff, pursuant to the sentence of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">The verdict was for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to these instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-7\"><em>B. </em>Dean, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACF\"><em>Habeas corpus </em>is the only process to hold one in custody before the court as a witness. Rev. Sts. c. 111, \u00a7 37. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 312. The power of the court was exhausted by the final sentence of the plaintiff, and his arrest by the sheriff in carrying the sentence into execution; the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>quent directions of the court were not binding upon the sheriff; and the release of the plaintiff by the sheriff was voluntary. The process thereby became <em>functus officio, </em>and the plaintiff could not be again arrested thereon. The subsequent commitment was therefore illegal. Archb. Crim. Pl. 473, 474. 2 Hawk. <em>c. </em>13, \u00a7 9. <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Jameson, </em>5 T. R. 25. 1 Saund. (Wms. ed.) 35, <em>note. Allanson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>1 Sid. 330. <em>Buxton </em>v. <em>Home, </em>1 Show. 174. By the transcript of the record requiring the officer to commit the plaintiff, he had no authority except to commit him; and by not obeying the precept after he had arrested the plaintiff, he became a trespasser <em>ab initio, </em>and therefore liable for depriving the plaintiff of his liberty upon that day, which was in addition to the full sentence, subsequently carried into effect. <em>Tubbs </em>v. <em>Tukey, </em>3 Cush. 438. If the defendant is not liable for the arrest and custody of the plaintiff on the 14th of October it is because it was a part of his sentence ; and if it was, the commitment on the 15th was illegal, because, after one day of the sentence had expired, he was committed to remain the entire term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-6\"><em>E. M. Gardner, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Afm\">There was a conflict of evidence upon the question whether the plaintiff was held in custody by the defendant, after the issuing of the order by the court for the return of the transcript to the clerk. But under the instructions which are the subject of exceptions, the jury must have found that there had been no such detention of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We are of opinion that the instructions of the court of common pleas were correct, and that the exceptions must be overruled. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
