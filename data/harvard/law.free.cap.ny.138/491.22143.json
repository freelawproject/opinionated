It is submitted that the term \u201c managing agent \u2019\u2019 in its very nature imports an agent of such wide and extended powers and responsibilities that it will be fairly understood to relate as a rule, in domestic corporations, at all events, to but a single person in the corporation. <em>(Flynn </em>v. <em>H.

Yeomans </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amj\">The person served was a managing agent, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. (Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 431.) Service of process upon a person as a managing agent of a corporation is good if the person served be a managing agent to any extent. It is not necessary that he have charge of the whole business of the corporation, but merely that he have sufficient character and rank to make it reasonably certain that the corporation will be apprised of the service made. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Penn. Co., </em>35 Hun, 369; 99 N. Y. 679.) In the case at bar, the person served was certainly, to a very great extent, a managing agent of the appellant, and of sufficient character and rank to make it reasonably certain that the appellant would be apprised of the service, especially when we consider that the service was made at the principal office of the appellant. <em>(Pope </em>v. <em>T. H. C. &amp; M. Co., </em>87 N. Y. 137; <em>R., H. &amp; L. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>48 Hun, 190; <em>Bain </em>v. <em>G. Ins. Co., </em>9 How. Pr. 448.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALMs\">The defendant seeks to set aside the service of the summons in this action, for having been made upon its general superintendent. It is a domestic corporation, and, under section 431 of the Code, such a service, if not made upon the president, secretary, cashier, treasurer or a director, might be made upon its managing agent. It appeared from the affidavits, read on behalf of the defendant company, that the person served was the general superintendent of th\u00e9 work of operating the lines of the company. It was said of him that he was given that title \u201c to distinguish him from superintendents of divisions of its lines, and from superintendents of other departments of business.\u201d There was a sufficiently broad agency, or delegation of power,to constitute him a managing agent of the company. The design of the statute was to secure notice of the commencement of a suit to the corporation, and it is very apparent, from the description in the statute of the persons upon whom service might be made, that the legislature intended to facilitate such service, and only required that the person to be served should sustain such responsible and representative relations to the corporation, as would be comprehended in the term \u201c managing agent.\u201d This language would exclude persons holding such subordinate, or clerical positions as imposed no responsibility upon them; but,plainly,would include a person holding so responsible and representative an office as did the general superintendent of this company.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
