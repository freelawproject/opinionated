The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 153 NLRB No. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">The Board found that respondent had violated Sections 8(a) (1), 8(a) (2), 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (1), (a) (2), (a) (3) and (a) (5), and it ordered respondent to cease and desist from the violations and to take certain affirmative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-24\">The principal contention in opposition to this petition concerns the violation of Section 8(a) (5), involving respondent\u2019s refusal to bargain with the union. Respondent argues that its refusal was not culpable since it had a good faith doubt concerning the union\u2019s majority status. In particular, respondent challenges the validity of the union\u2019s authorization cards which it claims were obtained under a misrepresentation that their sole purpose was to force an election. See NLRB v. Gotham Shoe Manufacturing Co., 359 F.2d 684 (2d Cir. 1966). An attack is also made on the Board\u2019s finding that respondent fired an employee to discourage union activity in violation of section 8(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-25\">Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s conclusions which are therefore unassailable here. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Its order is appropriate to redress the violations which the Board has found. See NLRB v. Gotham Shoe Manufacturing Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-26\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
