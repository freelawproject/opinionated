Y. (the \u201cM\u00e1lveme\u201d School District). His father, Arthur Olson, brought this proceeding to contest an order of the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York which rezoned the District and thereby effected the shifting of his child, and many others, to the Woodfield Road School.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-23\">The M\u00e1lveme School District operates one Senior High School (grades 9-12), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and one Junior High School (grades 6-9), which \u00e1re attended by all children regardless of where they reside in the District. There are also three elementary schools (kindergarten-fifth grade), and prior to 1966 there were separate \u201cattendance zones\u201d for each of them. The \u201cattendance zone\u201d within which a child lived determined the elementary school he attended. Because of the residential pattern of the community, therefore, the enrollment of the Wood-field Road Elementary School was 91% Negro; the Lindner Place Elementary School was 18% Negro; and the Davison Avenue Elementary School was 21% Negro.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">In 1962 parents of Negro children appealed to the Commissioner of Education to reverse the local Board of Education\u2019s refusal to allow the transfer of their children from the Woodfield School to one of the two other elementary schools. The Commissioner referred this request to a three-man committee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for inquiry and report; this committee reported to the Commissioner that it found no evidence of different educational standards in the three elementary schools. Nevertheless, the committee concluded that the Woodfield School was \u201cracially imbalanced\u201d and that \u201cthe social, psychological and educational problems which are ordinarily found in segregated or racially imbalanced schools are present in this situation.\u201d The committee proposed four alternative plans to eliminate the \u201cracial imbalance\u201d; the Commissioner adopted one of these plans and ordered the \u201cM\u00e1lveme\u201d School Board to establish a single district-wide \u201cattendance zone\u201d for grades four and five, and to create two \u201cattendance zones\u201d for kindergarten through third grade pupils. Thus all pupils in grades four and five, regardless of race, attend one school\u2014 the Woodfield School.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision was unsuccessfully attacked in the New York State Courts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Now once again the Commissioner\u2019s order is being challenged by another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">We need not consider all the arguments advanced by the parties, for we find one is dispositive of this appeal. In June 1966, Wayne Olson graduated from the fifth grade, and in September 1966 he entered the sixth grade (Junior High School). Since the Commissioner\u2019s order which Olson attacks did not alter the arrangements for pupils in the sixth through twelfth grades, he can no longer claim that he is adversely affected by the Commissioner\u2019s action. \u201cObviously no decision we could render now would protect any rights * * * [he] may once have had, and this Court does not sit to decide arguments after events have put them to rest.\u201d Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, at 432-433, 72 S.Ct. 394, 396, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952). The appeal must therefore be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">.
