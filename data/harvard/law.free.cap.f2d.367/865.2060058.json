Since the fundamental errors will not recur upon another trial, no useful purpose would be served by a discussion of them. So that a new trial may be had, the order of the district court denying the appellant\u2019s motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence of the appellant. It appears that the district court was without jurisdiction to enter any order denying appellant\u2019s motion under Rule 33, Fed.Rules Crim. Proc. 18 U.S.C.A. and the appeal from that portion of the district court\u2019s order is dismissed. That portion of the order denying the Section 2255 motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
