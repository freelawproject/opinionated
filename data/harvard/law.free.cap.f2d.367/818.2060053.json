Crouse, a vice-president of Maxon, Maxon\u2019s answers to interrogatories and the deposition of Roy Sundling, manager of Max-on Premix Burner Sales and Service, disclose that Maxon is an Indiana corporation having its principal place of business and all of its manufacturing activities in Muncie, Indiana, which is not in the district of suit, the Northern District of Illinois. In Chicago, Illinois, however, which is within the district of suit, Max-on owns and operates a local office, Maxon Premix Burner Sales and Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">While Maxon\u2019s Chicago office has solicited orders for the accused burners, Maxon <em>has never displayed or demonstrated the accused burners in the district. </em>Demonstrations of the accused burners are offered, but all are made in Muncie, Indiana. Since the issuance of the patent in suit, Maxon\u2019s Chicago office has not made arrangements for demonstrating the accused burners, either in or outside the district of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">All orders for Maxon\u2019s products solicited in the district of suit are forwarded to Maxon\u2019s Muncie office for acceptance or refusal. If the offer is accepted, Maxon ships the product directly to the customer, and title passes to the customer when the product, in this case, the accused burner, has been delivered to the carrier in Muncie. The customer is billed directly by the Muncie office.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">In addition to soliciting orders for the accused burners, it appears that Maxon\u2019s Chicago office provides consultation and some service functions for them. At least one accused burner installation exists and is operated within the district of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">The deposition reveals that Maxon sends sales literature from Muncie to present and prospective customers. Sales literature describing the accused burner was mailed from Muncie on May 29, 1964, over a year prior to the grant of the patent in suit. There apparently has been no active solicitation from the Chicago office for a long period of time; virtually all business came from calls to the office from prospective buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">Venue in patent infringement actions is controlled solely by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1400 (b), Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 229, 77 S.Ct. 787, 788, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">\u201cAny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Maxon does not reside within the district of suit, but it has admitted that it has a regular and established place of business in the district. Under the venue statute, therefore, venue will lie if Maxon can be considered to have committed acts of infringement in the district of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 271(a), the manufacture, use, or sale of a patented invention without authority constitutes infringement of the patent. Maxon does not manufacture or use the accused burner within the district of suit; consequently, the only question we must decide is whether Maxon\u2019s activities in the district of suit constitute, for venue purposes, an act of infringement through <em>sale </em>of the accused burner.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Mid-Continent, citing this court\u2019s opinion, Union Asbestos &amp; Rubber Company v. Evans Products Company, 7 Cir., 328 F.2d 949 (1964), contends that the test for acts of infringement under the venue statute is not as stringent as that required to sustain judgment under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 271 for patent infringement. It further contends that arrangements within the district of suit for demonstrations of the accused burners outside of the district, together with solicitation, amount to an act of infringement for venue purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Unlike the instant case, in <em>Union </em>As<em>bestos </em>prospective buyers were taken to a demonstration of the accused device within the district of suit, and the solicitation involved was described as \u201csystematic and continuous.\u201d This court did say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">\u201c * * * technicalities of sales law should not control whether defendant\u2019s degree of conduct within the district was sufficient to constitute \u2018acts of infringement\u2019 for venue purposes.\u201d <em>Union Asbestos, </em>supra, at 952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">But, it was further stated and held that: \u201c * * * two demonstrations of the accused device, added to the systematic and continuous solicitation of orders within the district, constitute, for venue purposes, a sufficient degree of selling to amount to \u2018infringing sales.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzK\">\u201cWe do not reach plaintiff\u2019s \u2018broader proposition\u2019 that mere solicitation as part of a systematic and continuous sales effort is sufficient for venue purposes.\u201d <em>Union Asbestos, </em>supra, at 952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">Having in mind the limitation that patent venue provisions are not to be construed liberally. Schnell v. Peter Eckrich &amp; Sons, 365 U.S. 260, 264, 81 S.Ct. 557, 5 L.Ed.2d 546 (1961), we hold that \u201carrangements for demonstration\u201d outside the district of suit, at the place of manufacture, none of which were made after the issuance of the patent in suit, and such limited and modest solicitation and sales effort as occurred in this case, do not amount to a sale or a sufficient degree of selling to constitute an act of infringement under the venue statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">We find no merit in Mid-Continent\u2019s further contention, which was not charged in its complaint or amended complaint, that Maxon\u2019s activities amounted to active inducement of infringement and that thereby the venue statute is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the amended complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
