The court, Charles M. Metzner, Judge, denied both motions, holding that a material issue of fact existed and that the case was not ripe for summary judgment in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-24\">On argument, the court raised the question of appellate jurisdiction, since no final judgment has yet entered, and it questioned the soundness of decisions upholding jurisdiction in similar cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) as appeals from denial of interlocutory injunctions. The question has now been resolved by the court <em>en banc </em>in Chappell &amp; Co., Inc. et al. v. Frankel, 367 F.2d 197 (2d Cir., Oct. 13, 1966) unanimously holding that appellate jurisdiction is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-25\">The appeals are dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
