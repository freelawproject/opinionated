Appellant was convicted upon his plea of guilty of burglary of a United States Post Office in Georgia. Appellant\u2019s present motion challenges the constitutionality of his continued confinement on the following grounds: (1) that he was denied counsel of his own choice during his original trial; (2) that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>was not served a copy of the indictment; and (3) that he was mentally incompetent at the time of his plea of guilty and thus unable to enter such a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The District Court conducted a full and thorough hearing on Appellant\u2019s motion at which Appellant was represented by privately retained counsel. In its detailed opinion the District Court specifically found against Appellant on each of the three points. Pohlabel v. United States, N.D.Ga., 1965, 258 F.Supp. 782. The record amply supports the District Court\u2019s conclusions and judgment, and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
