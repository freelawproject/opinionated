We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-26\">The question is, do the motion and files and records conclusively show that Lowe is entitled to no relief ?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-27\">The indictment charged Lowe, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, with forgery of the endorsement of a payee on the back of a United States Treasury check. At the morning arraignment the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Attorney stated that the charge was \u201ca one count indictment, forgery of a government check.\u201d The court then appointed counsel for Lowe. In the afternoon of the same day, Lowe and his counsel appeared, receipted for a copy of the indictment, and counsel told the court she had spoken with Lowe during the lunch hour. She waived, for Lowe, formal reading of the charges, which she stated to be \u201cthat one count, forgery of United States Treasury check in the amount of $135.50.\u201d Counsel also told the court she had informed Lowe of the penalties for the alleged offense, which she repeated, and of his right to a jury trial under a not-guilty plea. She said that Lowe desired to plead guilty. The court then told Lowe that he had heard counsel\u2019s statement and asked him whether he understood his right to a trial by jury before the court and that the maximum penalty (specifying the penalty) faced him if he pleaded guilty. The court then asked: \u201cUnderstanding that, do you still desire to plead guilty?\u201d Lowe answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"> There is no merit in Lowe\u2019s claim that his guilty plea is void because the court accepted the plea without determining its voluntariness and his understanding of the nature of the charge. He relies upon Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this court\u2019s decisions in Ellis v. United States, 313 F.2d 848 (7th Cir. 1963), and United States v. Davis, 212 F.2d 264 (7th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We think Lowe claims too much for the term \u201cnature\u201d in the requirement in Rule 11 that \u201cthe court * * * shall not accept the plea [of guilty] without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.\u201d There is no requirement that the \u201celements\u201d of the offense be explained. We take \u201cnature\u201d to mean the substance. There is no particular ritual. United States v. Davis, 212 F.2d at 267. A formal determination of Lowe\u2019s understanding is not required; the court must have been \u201cresponsibly satisfied\u201d that when pleading guilty Lowe knew what he was doing and was doing so voluntarily. See United States v. Rizzo, 362 F.2d 97, 99 (7th Cir. 1966). That test was met here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And there is no reason why the court should have done more than it did to insure that Lowe\u2019s drug addiction did not render unreliable his understanding and voluntariness. The statements of Lowe\u2019s counsel and the court\u2019s questions and Lowe\u2019s answers show this.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In <em>Ellis, </em>there was likely confusion surrounding Ellis\u2019 plea and \u201cno audible response\u201d to the court\u2019s question whether he understood the significance of his plea. And in <em>Davis, </em>the defendant charged misrepresentation of the charge by his attorney, and the \u201csubstance\u201d of the indictment was not \u201cstated in the defendant\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">We are not persuaded that reversible error was committed by the district court\u2019s failure to rule on Lowe\u2019s allegation, in the Section 2255 motion, that he would not have pleaded guilty \u201chad not threats and promises been made to him.\u201d The district court merely found that \u201cno statement or confession was received in evidence\u201d against Lowe and that his sentence was upon his voluntary plea. This finding does not directly meet Lowe\u2019s point that he pleaded guilty only because he had received \u201cthreats and promises.\u201d We cannot assume the truth of these conclusions, but only of facts alleged to justify the conclusions. This allegation is vague, not particularized by allegations of fact, and does not show that Lowe has proof sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>demand inquiry into whether there was compulsion interfering with the voluntariness of his plea. See Mitchell v. United States, 359 F.2d 833, 836-837 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">We wish to express our appreciation to Mr. F. Willis Caruso of the Chicago Bar, who served as court-appointed counsel for Mr. Lowe and rendered valuable service, both in written briefs and on oral argument in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">. Rule 11, Fed. R. Crim. P., as amended February 28, 1966, and effective July 1, 1966, now contains the express requirement that the court <em>address the defendant personally </em>in determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to the amended rule makes clear that personal interrogation of the defendant on this matter by the court is now required, even though he is represented by counsel, and counsel or the government attorney has attempted to explain the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
