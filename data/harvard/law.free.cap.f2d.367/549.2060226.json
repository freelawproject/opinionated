This appeal is from the district court\u2019s refusal to grant relief on behalf of one of the employees, Adrian Johnson, who was discriminatorily discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Defendant Ross Preserving Company, Inc. is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of preserves, jellies and gift packages, substantial quantities of which were found by the court to have been shipped interstate, while defendant Ross Packaging Company, Inc. manufactures and distributes packaging materials for fruits and preserves. Both companies, which operate from adjoining premises, are actively managed and directed by defendants Sarah Rossheim and her son Ralph Rossheim.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Following a Wage-Hour investigation of defendants\u2019 businesses in the Fall of 1963, which revealed violations of the Act, defendants agreed to make restitution of wages unlawfully withheld from their employees. Mrs. Rossheim subsequently prepared official receipt forms to evidence payments of the deficiencies. Six employees signed the forms without, in fact, receiving the amounts due, and these false receipts were submitted to the Wage and Hour Division by Mrs. Rossheim. However, two employees of Ross Preserving Company and one employee of Ross Packaging Company insisted upon payment of their back wages before signing their receipt forms, and were promptly discharged. Although defendants contended at trial that all three of these employees were discharged for cause, the district court found their discharges were \u201ca direct result of their participation in the government\u2019s investigation and their insistence upon receiving retroactive wage payments from defendants.\u201d Accordingly, the district court concluded that the discharges of the two employees of Ross Preserving Company were in violation of Section 15(a) (3), and awarded payment of lost wages on their behalf. However, the court refused to award relief on behalf of the one Ross Packaging Company employee, Adrian Johnson, concluding that his discharge was not in violation of the Act, since \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to establish that any employees of Ross Packaging Company, Inc. were engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">It is clear that the district court erred in holding that Adrian Johnson\u2019s discharge was not in violation of Section 15(a) (3). Unlike the wage and hour provisions of Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, which apply only to an \u201cemployee * * * engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the protections of Section 15(a) (3) apply, without qualification, to \u201cany employee.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>prohibitions </em>of Section 15(a) (3) are similarly unlimited, for they are directed to \u201cany person.\u201d Thus the clear and unambiguous language of the statute refutes the district court\u2019s view that either the employee or his employer must be engaged in activities covered by the Act\u2019s wage and hour provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>sions in order for the strictures against discriminatory discharge to be invoked.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The judgment of the district court is reversed insofar as it held that the discharge of Adrian Johnson was not in violation of Section 15(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-22\">.
