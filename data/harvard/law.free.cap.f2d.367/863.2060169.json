The parties agree that in Claimant-Appellant\u2019s own unique case, it would be advantageous to him to use his earnings in the years beginning in 1937, because they were considerably higher than his earnings subsequent to 1949 when he became self-employed. The dispute is over how many \u201cbenefit computation years,\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 415(b) (2) (A), must be included in computing the \u201caverage monthly wage.\u201d Claimant in his <em>pro se </em>briefs and arguments contends that he need include only his eleven best years between 1937 and 1966, relying primarily on a pamphlet issued by the Government<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which sets out one of the methods for computing benefits. The Government agrees that this would be proper had the; Claimant chosen to rely solely on his. earnings subsequent to 1950, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 415(b). The Government contends, however, and the Administrator and District Court agree, that by incorporating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>his earnings beginning in 1937 in the computation, Claimant falls within subsection (d) of \u00a7 415. Consequently, he must include <em>all </em>the years subsequent to 1937 as \u201cbenefit computation years,\u201d not just the years subsequent to 1950.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are in accord with this interpretation of the statute and the computation it produces.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-22\">.
