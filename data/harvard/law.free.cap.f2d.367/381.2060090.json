The district court assumed that the facts alleged in the appellant\u2019s petition were true, but decided that the petition did not disclose a detention of the appellant in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">On January 3, 1947, the appellant pleaded guilty, in a Superior Court of the State of California, to two counts of first degree robbery. He was sentenced by the court to imprisonment \u201cfor the term prescribed by law.\u201d The \u201cterm prescribed by law,\u201d California Penal Code \u00a7 213, for first degree robbery was \u201cnot less than five years.\u201d The appellant\u2019s claim in this present proceeding is that his 1947 sentence was imprisonment for five years; that he learned, at some time after 1951, that the California authorities were regarding his sentence as a life sentence; that the California legislature in 1951 amended \u00a7 671 of the penal code to read, as it now reads, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-18\">Whenever any person is declared punishable for a crime by imprisonment in the state prison for a term not less than any specified number of years, and no limit to the duration of such imprisonment is declared, punishment of such offender shall be imprisonment during his natural life subject to the provisions of part 3<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of this code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">The appellant claims that he is now being held as a prisoner for life pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>1951 amendment of Penal Code \u00a7 671; that that amendment, as applied to him, increased, <em>ex post facto, </em>his 1947 sentence of five years, to a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">If appellant\u2019s analysis of his situation were correct, it would present a case of an <em>ex post facto </em>statute. But his analysis is not correct. His sentence in 1947 was not a five year sentence. It was a life sentence. In 1935 in the case of People v. McNabb, 3 Cal.2d 441, 456-457, 45 P.2d 334, 341, the Supreme Court of California said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">* * * a statute which prescribes a minimum sentence of not less than five years and with no maximum is in law a life sentence until and unless a court or executive board * * * remits a portion of the life term. This question was definitely settled by In re Lee, 177 Cal. 690, 171 P. 958, in 1918 and has been the pronounced law of the state since.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The 1951 amendment of Penal Code \u00a7 671 was, so far as concerned persons in the situation of this appellant, who were under the sentence prescribed by Penal Code \u00a7 213, \u201cnot less than five years,\u201d only a declaration of existing law. The amended \u00a7 671 did change the law by extending its life sentence feature to persons whose prescribed sentences were less than five years. As to persons in that category, the life sentence feature could only have been applied in cases of crimes committed after the 1951 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The appellant cites Lindsey v. State of Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 57 S.Ct. 797, 81 L.Ed. 1182, where the Supreme Court held that a state statute enacted after the date of a crime, and making mandatory a sentence which was, by the statute in force at the date of the crime, discretionary, was an <em>ex post facto </em>statute, as to a crime committed before the enactment of the new statute. In the appellant\u2019s case, the sentencing court had no discretion at the time of sentencing in 1947. Penal Code \u00a7 671 as enacted in 1892 seemed to give discretion to the sentencing court. But Penal Code \u00a7 1168, enacted in 1917, had the effect of removing that discretion. People v. Stratton, 136 Cal.App. 201, 208, 28 P.2d 695 (1934); People v. Wells, 68 Cal.App.2d 476, 484-485, 156 P.2d 979 (1945). The appellant\u2019s reliance upon Lindsey v. State of Washington, supra, 301 U.S. 397, 57 S.Ct. 797 is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The appellant does not urge that the 1951 amendment of Penal Code \u00a7 671 affected in any way the discretion of the California Adult Authority, under Penal Code \u00a7 3020, to \u201cdetermine and redetermine\u201d his sentence. That discretion still exists with regard to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The district court was right in its dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-20\"> Part 3 contains the indeterminate sentence provisions of the code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
