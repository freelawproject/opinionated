A plenary hearing was held, after which the court in an exhaustive and well-considered opinion held that the several contentions of petitioners were unfounded and that their constitutional rights had been fully protected during all stages of the proceedings against them. We agree with the findings and conclusions of the trial judge, and, accordingly, the judgment denying petitions for writs is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
