The appellant made such an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellant then sought to re-register and change his affiliation from Democratic to Independent on September 24, 1964, but his request was denied by the appellee Dekle because Florida law further does not allow a voter to change his registered party affiliation during the period starting thirty days before the primary and expiring after the general election. F.S.A. \u00a7 97.111.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellant then brought suit on September 30 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, seeking an injunction allowing him to re-register as an Independent, and freeing him from the bonds of his party loyalty oath. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">On November 3, 1964, the general election was held. In Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 16 S.Ct. 132, 40 L.Ed. 293 (1895), the plaintiff sued to secure the right to vote in an election of delegates to a state constitutional convention. The election was held before the ease reached the Supreme Court, and therefore that court dismissed the case because no relief could be granted by it. Post election relief was similarly denied in Munoz v. Amador, 340 F.2d 590 (5 Cir. 1965). See also Fair v. Adams, 233 F.Supp. 310 (N.D.Fla.1964). Insofar as it concerns the November, 1964, election, the appellant\u2019s cause is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Nor has the appellant stated a valid claim for relief independent of the 1964 election. The party loyalty oath of which he complains binds only candidates for office and officeholders. The record does not show that the appellant is now an officeholder or a candidate, or now expects to become such, or is now prevented from becoming such by the party loyalty oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The complaint does suggest in the vaguest terms that the appellant seeks to unshackle himself in possible or hypothetical future quests for public office. Such a hint of a cause of action does not warrant declaratory relief. The court should exercise sound discretion in entertaining declaratory judgment actions, by requiring a full-bodied record developed through adequate adversary proceedings, with all proper parties before the court. The issue posed should be real and substantial, and not merely academic or speculative. Public Affairs Associates v. Rickover, 369 U.S. 111, 82 S.Ct. 580, 7 L.Ed.2d 604 (1962). Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U.S. 426, 68 S.Ct. 641, 92 L.Ed. 784 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Insofar as the appeal concerns the 1964 election it is dismissed as moot. In all other respects the dismissal by the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Appeal dismissed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
