Applicant sought to register \u201cHUNT\u201d for \u201cGeneral Purpose Cleaning Compounds.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Appellant-opposer is the owner of a plurality of registrations of marks consisting of \u201cHUNT\u201d and the possessive form thereof, \u201cHUNT\u2019S,\u201d for a long list of canned food products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board, with one member dissenting, dismissed the opposition stating in summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">* * * And, all things considered, it is our opinion that canned foods and cleaning preparations are such distinctly different products that there is no reasonable likelihood of purchasers ascribing a common origin thereto were they to be sold under the name \u201cHUNT\u201d or \u201cHUNT\u2019S\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">This appeal appears before us in the following posture. Both parties submitted evidence in support of their respective positions. Appellant submitted the results of a consumer survey involving 502 housewives and appellee submitted four third-party registrations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee here submits the case on the record, no brief having been filed and absent any oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Appellant\u2019s arguments here, in summary, are as follows: Appellant\u2019s trademark HUNT\u2019S is a well known mark entitled to broad protection, the evidence of record showing advertising expenses since 1943 of more than 46 .million dollars, and sales, since 1944, in excess of 1 billion dollars. As factors tending to establish a likelihood of confusion, appellant argues that the marks and the chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>neis of trade are identical; that other well known trademarks have been used concurrently for food products and cleaners ; that appellant is the prior user and registrant of HUNT\u2019S for a product used in cleaning; and that doubt should be resolved against the applicant. Appellee\u2019s defenses relating to surnames, registrations of third parties, and \u201cunclean hands\u201d are allegedly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Appellant\u2019s case is well summarized in the opinion of the dissenting board member:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">While canned food products and a general purpose cleansing compound are clearly distinct, have different uses and are non-competitive, they do, nevertheless bear some relation to each other. General purpose cleansing compounds and canned food products are sold to the same purchasers, at the same time, in the same manner and in the same place. It has been shown that \u201cHUNT\u2019S\u201d food products and general purpose cleaners have sometimes been displayed closely together and that retailers have promoted such goods in a single advertisement. Thus, the parties\u2019 products are related as to their manner of promotion, distribution and purchase. Purchasers well familiar with \u201cHUNT\u2019S\u201d canned food products and desirous of purchasing a general purpose cleansing compound could be immediately confronted with a display of \u201cHUNT\u201d general purpose cleaner and would, in my judgment, reasonably and logically assume a connection or association between the two as to source or sponsorship. This is borne out by the testimony of housewives who indicated an awareness that certain manufacturers produced both food and detergent products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The majority of the board, however, were of the view that a \u201crather commonplace surname,\u201d \u201cHunt\u201d was involved and the respective products were so \u201cunrelated\u201d and \u201cdistinctly different\u201d that there was no reasonable likelihood of purchasers ascribing a common origin to the products, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">* * * opposer argues that confusion would be likely because its canned food products and cleaning preparations of the character sold by applicant are offered for sale in all types of supermarkets and groceries, but this factor is considered not to be of controlling importance herein since it is common knowledge that such stores sell an infinite variety of wholly unrelated products, as for example, toothpicks, clothing, hardware items, toilet articles, light bulbs, cigarettes, toys, soft drinks, and the like. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The evidence of record shows, on appellant\u2019s behalf, several factors tending to establish a relationship between the respective products. As appellant\u2019s brief points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">As is well known, and as the record shows, general purpose cleaners and related products are commonly sold to the general public in all types of supermarkets, groceries, etc. * * * ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">* * * In many of such stores \u2014 particularly the smaller establishments\u2014 opposer\u2019s food products and cleaners, detergents, soaps, etc. are often stacked in the \u201csame sections\u201d or \u201cback to back\u201d * * * or in adjoining aisles * * *. Moreover, opposer\u2019s products frequently have been set up in numerous special displays \u2014 featuring its HUNT\u2019S trademark \u2014 next to the general purpose cleaners, detergents and soaps in many stores * * *. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">The respective products are also likely to be displayed together under the parties\u2019 identical marks in the <em>same </em>advertisements of supermarkets and other retail food stores. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">The respective products are thus related as to their manner of promotion, distribution, purchase and intended users. Moreover, the goods are all inexpensive kitchen or pantry items which are \u201cnot apt to be purchased with any degree of discrimination on the purchasers\u2019 part * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">****** Other famous food trademarks have, in fact, been used concurrently by their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>owners to identify food products and cleaners. ? * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The above statements are supported by evidence of record and were not contradicted by appellee. In addition, appellant submitted the results of a survey wherein, according to the majority of the board, at least 70 of 502 housewives interviewed named a product of opposer\u2019s when asked to name any additional products made by the makers of \u201cHUNT General Purpose Cleaning Compound.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 does not set forth special rules regarding the registration of marks involving surnames in determining the issue of likelihood of confusion. See Alfred Electronics v. Alford Mfg. Co., 333 F.2d 912, 51 C.C.P.A. 1533; John W. Taylor Packing Co. v. Taylor Sales, Inc., 139 USPQ 59 (TTAB); E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. National Sure-Fit Quilting Co., 137 USPQ 317 (TTAB). Cf. Section 2(e), Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e). Here we think the evidence shows that opposer possesses a strong trademark entitled to broad protection which is a factor to be considered in resolving the issue of likelihood of confusion. See Tiffany &amp; Co. v. Tiffany Tile Corp., 345 F.2d 214, 52 CCPA 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> The fact that the goods are not of the same descriptive properties is also not <em>controlling </em>under the terms of the Trademark Act of 1946. Elizabeth Kent Cosmetics v. G. B. Kent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 309 F.2d 775, 50 CCPA 738. As stated in Hollywood Water Heater Co. v. Hollymatic Corp., 274 F.2d 679, 680, 47 CCPA 782, 784:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">* * * Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 and the unquestioned weight of modern authority in this field does not require a finding of confusing similarity of goods as the basis for sustaining a trademark opposition but instead requires us to determine whether it is \u201clikely\u201d that the mark when applied to the goods of the applicant will cause confusion or mistake or deceive purchasers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-11\"> Nor are we concerned on the present record with appellee\u2019s argument below that the manner of sale and distribution or class of purchasers are different. These limitations are not reflected in the application for registration and applicant\u2019s stated desire is to expand his market to the general public. Merritt Corp. v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 277 F.2d 956, 47 CCPA 937. \u201c[T]he likelihood of confusion must be determined on the basis of the \u2018goods covered in appellant\u2019s applications.\u2019 \u201d California Stucco Products of New England, Inc. v. Maas &amp; Waldstein Co., 272 F.2d 398, 399, 47 CCPA 732, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Applicant seeks registration of the mark \u201cHUNT\u201d for a \u201cGeneral Purpose Cleaning Compound.\u201d The evidence of record shows that such products are relatively inexpensive, and are intended for the general public just as opposer\u2019s products. The respective products often appear side by side in stores and frequently appear in the same advertisements of stores. Thus while the descriptive properties of the respective goods are different, we think the evidence of record establishes a <em>likelihood of confusion </em>among purchasers such as to preclude federal registration by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">There remains for consideration certain defenses of appellee. Appellee offered 4 third-party registrations \u201cfor the purpose of indicating that the word \u2018HUNT\u2019 is in the nature of a surname, although registrable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The thrust of this alleged defense is not clear. Appellee does not claim that \u201cHUNT\u201d is its surname. See Yandenburgh, Trademark Law &amp; Procedure 78-82 (1959). And, as stated earlier, under section 2(d) the issue of likelihood of confusion is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>somehow changed or different here because opposer\u2019s mark is a surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Third party registrations are of some evidentiary value in determining the scope of protection (see Vandenburgh, supra, at 64-66) or the distinctiveness of a trademark. Clinton Detergent Co. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 302 F.2d 745, 49 CCPA 1146. However, as we stated in In re Helene Curtis Industries, Inc., 305 F.2d 492, 494, 49 CCPA 1367, 1371:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">* * * We will not assume any knowledge on the part of the purchasing public of mere registrations in the Patent Office and neither will we assume that marks are in continuing use, so as to have had any effect on the mind of the purchasing public, merely because they have been registered. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Additionally, the nature of the products covered by the third-party registrations is a factor to be considered in determining the distinctiveness of the mark in relation to the issue of likelihood of confusion, Price-Pfister Brass Mfg. Co. v. Milwaukee Faucets, Inc., 311 F.2d 817, 50 CCPA 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Considering the four registrations offered, one has been cancelled, and the remaining three cover putty, wine, and photographic chemicals, respectively. There is no evidence of record as to the effect, if any, of the above marks on the mind of the purchasing public, <em>Helene Curtis Industries, </em>supra, and putty and photographic chemicals are dissimilar goods in relation to the goods under consideration here. See Conde Nast Publications, Inc. v. American Greetings Corp., 329 F.2d 1012, 51 CCPA 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Considering the evidence of record we do not find the third-party registrations sufficient evidence to prove that appellant\u2019s marks are lacking in distinctiveness or entitled only to narrow protection in relation to the issue of likelihood of confusion. See <em>Price-Pfister Brass Mfg. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Appellee also argued below that appellant has \u201cunclean hands\u201d in that appellant\u2019s registrations Nos. 437,875, 420,786, and 420,951 allegedly were procured through \u201cacts of fraud [and] deceit\u201d in the Patent Office. Appellee contended that the marks covered by these registrations were not used on certain of the goods set forth therein prior to the filing of these applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">The board held that this defense would not be considered in the absence of a counter claim for cancellation, Contour Chair-Lounge Co. v. Englander Co., 324 F.2d 186, 51 CCPA 833, and also that the record was \u201cinconclusive on the issue raised.\u201d We find no error in the board\u2019s decision in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">For the above reasons the decision of the board must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">WORLEY, C.
