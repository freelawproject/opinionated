The opinion of Judge Lane in the court below, 239 F.Supp. 815 (1965), contains a complete and accurate statement of relevant facts in this case. We shall not repeat them except where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The respondent-appellee, Piperata, owned a skiff, the \u201cSkipton\u201d, and insured it for $10,000 with Continental Insurance Co., the libellant-appellant. The \u201cSkipton\u201d was \u201clost\u201d during the hurricane of March 1962. On March 20, 1962 Piperata executed a proof of loss to Continental requesting total reimbursement in accordance with the terms of his policy. McNitt, a marine surveyor and adjuster for Continental, got in touch with Piperata and informed him by a letter dated April 2, 1962 of the necessity for him, Piperata, to reject and disclaim all ownership and interest in the \u201cSkipton\u201d if there was to be a total constructive loss of the vessel. Because of this letter on April 3, 1962, Piperata wrote a letter to the \u201cCorps of Army Engineers, New York City\u201d informing them of the loss of the \u201cSkipton\u201d and stating that \u201cthis letter is to notify you that I am abandoning subject vessel to the Corps of Army Engineers\u201d. The receipt of this letter was acknowledged by the Chief of the Operations Division of the Corps of Army Engineers in Philadelphia. Since the \u201cSkip-ton\u201d was lost from Little Egg Harbor in New Jersey the vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia District. On April 9, 1962 \u201cMarine Office of America\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a check drawn to Piperata in the amount of $10,000 and enclosed the check in a letter addressed to its local agent, The Thomson Agency, requesting Thomson to advise Piperata \u201cthat we reject and disclaim any ownership or interest in the vessel either in part or in whole.\u201d On April 25, 1962 Thomson forwarded the $10,000 check to Piperata. Acting pursuant to the letter of April 9, and to a second letter, dated April 24, from \u201cMarine Office of America\u201d to Thomson, the latter on Continental\u2019s behalf, informed Piperata of the insurer\u2019s intent to reject and disclaim all ownership interest. About the end of May the \u201cSkip-ton\u201d was found in a cove about 25 miles from Egg Harbor and was taken to \u201cSilver Bay Marine\u201d at Toms River, New Jersey, for repairs. Piperata did not notify Continental that the \u201cSkipton\u201d had been found. He did, however, by letter inform the Corps of Army Engineers at Philadelphia of this fact. There is no doubt that the \u201cSkipton\u201d when found was in bad condition. Piperata and Hosbach, one of Piperata\u2019s employees, testified in substance that the vessel was \u201cjunk\u201d, a hull sitting in the mud, with the inside hull and motors covered with sand and water. The vessel was resting in about five feet of water. Nasife, an independent witness and a fleet representative for Sun Oil Company, who had discovered the vessel, corroborated Piperata\u2019s and Hosbach\u2019s testimony. Bauer, a professional yacht broker, designer and marine surveyor of thirteen years\u2019 experience, was of the opinion that a hypothetical craft lost under circumstances such as those attendant upon the loss of the \u201cSkipton\u201d and found approximately two months later was \u201cvirtually worthless\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Piperata expended some $2650 for the repairs made by Silver Bay Marine. He testified also that Nasife worked four and one-half days in order to float and tow the vessel in for repairs, and that he himself had spent about ten days trying to locate the vessel and had worked some two weeks in tearing down and overhauling the motors at Toms River. Piperata testified that he caused the \u201cSkipton\u201d to be repaired, <em>inter alia, </em>for \u201csentimental reasons\u201d. There is testimony, accepted by the trial Judge, that when the \u201cSkipton\u201d was first returned to the water in October 1962 the condition of the vessel was \u201cfair\u201d but that the hydraulic action was water-filled and still contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sand. Piperata testified also, and his evidence was accepted by the trial court, that he and his wife had used the \u201cSkip-ton\u201d on about six occasions since October 1962 but that the longest run of the \u201cSkipton\u201d during this period was restricted to less than two miles. On October 13, 1962, Piperata secured a new yacht policy in the amount of $10,000 with the Royal Insurance Company, Limited. The application form for Royal insurance contained answers that the \u201cSkipton\u201d had never been altered, repaired or rebuilt; that its then market value was $12,000 and its replacement value was $16,000, and that no vessel owned by him had sustained accident or loss within the past five years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Disclaimers of ownership of a vessel as was done here by Piperata, according to Blond, \u201cHull Claims Manager\u201d of the Marine Office of America, are for the purpose of minimizing the civil liability of both the owner and the insurer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blond\u2019s testimony must be read in connection with 33 U.S.C. Section 409.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This ties in with the doctrine of \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d. When Piperata abandoned the vessel to the Secretary of War, at the direction of Continental\u2019s agent, Continental was required to pay the full amount of the insurance. Piperata\u2019s policy with Continental contained the customary \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d provision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It will be noted that Piperata abandoned the vessel to the Secretary of War but that Continental did not abandon the vessel to the Secretary of War insofar as the record shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">The Continental policy provided that in the event of damage \u201cno recovery for a constructive total loss shall be had hereunder unless the expense of recovering and repairing the vessel shall exceed the value of the hull insurance.\u201d The value specified for hull insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>was $10,000. The policy, therefore, applied the so-called English rule as compared to the American rule which is that a constructive total loss may be claimed if the cost of repairs is one-half of the agreed value. See Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Scott, 209 F.2d 852, 854 (2 Cir. 1954), and Bradlie &amp; Gibbons v. Maryland Insurance Co., 37 U.S. 378, 9 L.Ed. 1123 (1838). See also Vance on Insurance, Hornbook Series, Sections 176, 177, wherein he states: \u201cUpon receiving notice of abandonment, the underwriter may accept or reject the abandonment. If he accepts, he becomes at once liable for the whole of his insurance, and also becomes entitled to all rights which the insured possessed in the thing insured. He acquires the same title to the abandoned vessel as he might have acquired by purchase. He may save and repair her, sell her, or otherwise do as he will with her. If the injury to the vessel was due to the tort of another, the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation, heretofore limited to the amount of payments made by him, becomes extended by abandonment to the full amount recoverable from the tort feasor, even though that may exceed the amount of insurance paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u201cThe acceptance of an abandonment fixes the rights of the parties, and no subsequent developments affecting the expediency of either the abandonment or the acceptance can give either party the right to rescind the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As was stated by Judge Learned Hand in Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Scott, supra, at 854: \u201cTo meet what would otherwise be a failure of the policy to accomplish its purpose, the doctrine of \u2018constructive total loss\u2019 was devised, which gives the insured the privilege of compelling the insurer to pay the full amount at once in exchange for the transfer of the wreck. Since this is in effect a transfer forced upon the insurer, it was necessary to hedge it against abuse by the insured ; and it is for this reason that the condition was imposed that there must be some relation between the extent of the injury and the value of the ship, when restored.\u201d In short, when the insurer has accepted the application of the doctrine of constructive total loss the insurer becomes the transferee of the vessel and the insured in effect loses his interest therein. This is what happened here. Thereafter Piperata recovered the \u201cSkipton\u201d, in very bad condition indeed, and expended several thousand dollars on its repairs which, in the judgment of the court below, were inadequate to make it fully seaworthy. But as Judge Hand pointed out in his Calmar S.S. Corp. opinion, the forced transfer of a vessel under the doctrine of constructive total loss must be subject to some \u201chedge\u201d to prevent abuse by the insured. Otherwise there would be an unjust enrichment of the insured. Upon a valid abandonment the insured is divested of all of his interest in the vessel and the insurer becomes entitled to all the right, title or interest of the insured. Mason v. Marine Insurance Co., 110 F. 452, 54 L.R.A. 700 (C.C.A.6, 1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Winter in his Marine Insurance, 3rd Edition, at 396 states: \u201cUnderwriters may always refuse to accept abandonment. As soon as a case appears hopeless, it is the usual practice for the owner to tender and the underwriter to refuse abandonment. The rights of both parties having thus been preserved, the assured should continue to seek means to recover the property under the requirements of the sue and labor clause until absolute proof of the constructive total loss of the property can be demonstrated.\u201d Continental\u2019s policy contains a \u201csue and labor\u201d clause. See Vance on Insurance, supra, at 939-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The doctrine of \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d was applied in Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Scott, supra, 209 F.2d at 854, \u201cto relieve the owner of the embarrassment of having upon his hands a ship, completely useless as she lies, and being without remedy until such time as she can be recovered and repaired, which may mean an indefinite postponement.\u201d In the instant case Continental accepted Piperata\u2019s claim of constructive total loss since the \u201cSkipton\u201d was \u201clost\u201d and its possible discovery was postponed for an indefinite time.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The trial court in its opinion, 239 F.Supp. at 820, states: \u201cWhile no case can be found precisely in point, related decisions have allowed the insurer to lay claim following total payment for constructive loss, despite a previous rejection of insured\u2019s abandonment and a disclaimer of liability. See, e. g., Republic of China v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 163 F.Supp. 812 (D.C.Md.1958). The proper rule would seem to follow this decision. Generally, as against the owner, the insuring party should not lose his equity in a discovered vessel because of an earlier effort to avoid the liabilities associated with ownership of its then unlocated wreckage. Once an insurer has paid the entire insured value, it should not have to choose between future liability or future ownership with respect to the insured. The equities associated with a total policy payment should continue between the parties until the insurer has an opportunity, within reasonable bounds of time, to survey the wreckage.\u201d The statement quoted, in our opinion, represents the rule of law applicable here, but the trial court did not follow it. In fact, as will be recalled, Piperata failed to inform Continental of the recovery of the \u201cSkipton\u201d. Continental had a right to claim the \u201cSkipton\u2019s\u201d hull under the rule of the Republic of China v. National Union Fire Insurance Co., supra, and the court below was in error in concluding Continental was not entitled to make such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">But the trial court rested its decision upon another ground. It concluded that the record shows that the \u201cSkipton\u201d in its discovered condition was \u201cvalueless\u201d, and thus any effort to reclaim the vessel and return it to pre-storm condition \u201cwould have entailed a prohibitive cost.\u201d 239 F.Supp. at 821. Continental apparently did not examine the vessel before trial but rested its case on the fact that Piperata had secured a Royal Indemnity Company insurance policy, stating that the replacement value of the vessel was $16,000 and that its market value was $12,000, and that the repairs, which made the vessel operable for trips limited to two miles, plus Piperata\u2019s and Hosbach\u2019s labors, amount to approximately $3,000. Continental contends that the admissions in the Royal Insurance Co. policy are binding on Piperata, citing Purofied Down Products Corp. v. Travelers Fire Insurance Co., 278 F.2d 439 (2 Cir. 1960). These admissions are binding, of course, between Royal Insurance Co. and Piperata,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but not on Piperata in the suit at bar. The Purofied Down Products Corp. opinion does not support Continental\u2019s contention. Couch on Insurance 2d, Section 35:135 (1961) states that, \u201cIn the United States the rule is that a representation to one insurer cannot be evidence of a like representation to another insurer, on application for a different policy, on the same ship and risks.\u201d Nicoll v. American Insurance Co., 18 Fed.Cas. page 231, No. 10259 (1847). Section 35:135 is cited as applying to value and cost of an insured\u2019s property. See id. at Section 37:680.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d of the \u201cSkipton\u201d caused Continental to pay immediately to Piperata the full amount of insurance, $10,000. In return Continental received the transfer of the wreck which was, at the time of the transfer, \u201clost\u201d. The trial court deemed Piperata to be in the position of a \u201csalvor\u201d. Since, by operation of the doctrine of \u201cconstructive total loss\u201d, Piperata no longer had any legal interest in the \u201cSkipton\u201d, his prior ownership did not prevent him from acting as a salvor. In our opinion the court below was not in error in awarding to Piperata the status of a salvor. To create such a status three elements must be present, as they were present in the case at bar, viz.: \u201ca marine peril, voluntary service, and success in whole or in part.\u201d Norris, The Law of Salvage, Section 47 et seq. (1958). However, once having salved the \u201cSkipton\u201d Piperata failed to notify Continental. The fact that Piperata may have believed he was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>owner of the \u201cSkipton\u201d, under a mistaken concept of his legal rights, does not excuse his misappropriation of the ship to his own use. See Norris, The Law of Salvage, Section 106 (1958); The Mabel, 61 F.2d 537 (9 Cir. 1932). The salvor has the right to salvage but he does not achieve ownership of the vessel by salving it, at least under the circumstances at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">It is not clear from the record when Continental became aware of the recovery of the \u201cSkipton\u201d but we cannot doubt it had the opportunity to make an examination of the \u201cSkipton\u201d prior to trial and failed to do so. Continental insists that the burden of proof is on Piperata due to the Royal Indemnity Policy. Biit the court below was entitled to disregard the stated values of the \u201cSkipton\u201d under the Royal Indemnity Policy. However, the trial court in our opinion has adopted an unacceptable method of ascertaining the damages of the parties. We think that the court below in its finding that the vessel when discovered was worthless failed to take into consideration the rights of the parties. It is true that Piperata is a layman but nonetheless he is bound by the principles of admiralty law. The court below lays emphasis upon \u201cthe extremely poor condition in which the <em>Skipton </em>was found,\u201d and apparently took the position that whatever may be the present value of the \u201cSkipton\u201d that value was created by Piperata\u2019s own efforts, owing Continental nothing. We have given this due consideration and conclude that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions are not justified by the evidence or by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">What should be the judgment? It is difficult to say upon the present record, but we are of the opinion that the court below must balance equities. It is possible that when this has been done the prayer of the complaint that the \u201cSkip-ton\u201d be awarded to the appellant, Continental, should be granted but perhaps only if Piperata, or anyone standing in his shoes, receives from Continental the value of the repairs made to the vessel. In so stating we are not unmindful of the rights of a salvor or those of the insurer, and the course that we have mentioned may or may not be pursued with legal propriety by the court below. If Piperata is found guilty of misconduct he, of course, is not entitled to the benefits of a salvor\u2019s position. We do not intend to suggest that he was guilty of misconduct in view of his layman\u2019s position. This is a matter already scrutinized by the district judge which should, perhaps, have further examination upon remand. See The Mabel, 61 F.2d 537 (9 Cir. 1932); Danner v. United States, 99 F.Supp. 880 (S.D.N.Y.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The judgment of the court below in favor of Piperata will be vacated and a new trial ordered. At that trial Continental should be given the opportunity to make proof of the value of the vessel following its repairs. Piperata, of course, must be given the opportunity, if he desires to avail himself of it, to enlarge the record with any proper additional evidence which will support his position.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">.
