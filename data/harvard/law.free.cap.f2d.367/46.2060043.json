The sentence of ten years was entered on a plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with violating the narcotics laws. The plea was specifically to a count based on a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4704(a) which does not carry its own sentence. However, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237(a) does provide for the imposition of a prison sentence of not less than two or more than ten years for a first offense under \u00a7 4704(a). It follows that appellant was entitled to no relief under his motion. See Cordova v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 337 F.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
