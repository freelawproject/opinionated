The motion was denied without a hearing, and the failure to hold a hearing is the principal issue involved. The requirement of a hearing on such a petition depends on whether or not the allegations are valid and substantial and cannot be resolved from the motion, the files and prior records. A hearing would be mandatory if sufficient facts were alleged to support a claim for relief unless the motion, files and records conclusively show that the claim is without merit. See Nelms v. United States, 4 Cir. 1963, 318 F.2d 150, and Floyd v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 368 (decided September 2, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">Appellant\u2019s motion fails to allege any facts sufficient to indicate mental incompetence at the time of arraignment and sentencing. The trial judge who imposed the sentence was fully aware of the personal and criminal history of appellant and rendered his decision after carefully studying the transcripts of proceedings at arraignment and sentencing as well as the presentence report and file of the probation officer. The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-18\">\u201cPetitioner was extensively questioned about whether he desired counsel, about the facts of the crimes, and about the voluntariness and his understanding of the guilty pleas. Unlike the case of Johnson v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 344 F.2d 401, nothing appears in the record that would raise the slightest doubt of petitioner\u2019s mental competency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">There is nothing in the record before us, or that was before the district judge, that would indicate any doubt about appellant\u2019s mental competency. We believe the district judge carefully considered the matter, and that the petition is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
