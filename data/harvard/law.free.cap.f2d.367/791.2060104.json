Petitioner was charged with violating Sections 61.3(a) and 61.131(b) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. These Regulations had been promulgated under authority contained in Section 601 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On December 20,1962, appellant Somlo was the holder of Airman\u2019s Certificate 1287006, with commercial pilot privileges and airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Sometime in December 1962, the corporation of which appellant was president, acquired a twin-engine Cessna aircraft. Appellant took instructions in flying a twin-engine aircraft, and a licensed flight instructor endorsed in appellant\u2019s log book that he was ready for a multiengine rating flight test.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Somlo presented himself twice at the Federal Aviation Agency at Du Page Airport, Illinois, for the purpose of taking a flight test for a multiengine rating. The second time was on December 26, 1962, but he was late for his appointment and did not receive his flight test.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">On December 30, 1962, Somlo flew the Cessna multiengine airplane from O\u2019Hare airport, Chicago, to Naples, Florida. He was accompanied by his wife, mother-in-law, two daughters aged <em>3Yz </em>and <em>AY\u00bf </em>years, and a maid.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">On January 2, 1963, Somlo flew the same aircraft from Naples, Florida, with the same people on board, with O\u2019Hare airfield as his destination. Because of reported weather conditions in the Chicago area, Somlo, filed an instrument flight rules flight plan by radio with the Federal Aviation Agency\u2019s flight service station at Lafayette, Indiana, and received an instrument clearance from Air Traffic Control to proceed to the Chicago terminal. However, as he approached the O\u2019Hare Airport, he encountered icing conditions, and the aircraft struck a house. Four of the occupants of the airplane were killed and Somlo received serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">After an investigation, the Administrator proposed a suspension of petitioner\u2019s certificate for six months. Petitioner then surrendered his certificate to the Federal Aviation Agency stating he was \u201cguilty of most of your charges.\u201d The Administrator issued a six months\u2019 suspension. Thereafter, the petitioner apparently had a change of heart and attempted to appeal to the Board but the appeal was not timely and was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Subsequently, the Administrator reopened the record and directed an evidentiary hearing. The Administrator concluded that the violations charged had been established and directed a retroactive suspension for six months, commencing April 5, 1963. It was this decision which the Board, in effect, affirmed by the order now here under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">The principal contentions of petitioner are 1) that he was, in fact, qualified for flying a multiengine aircraft, but that the Federal Aviation Agency unreasonably frustrated his efforts to take the flight test for multiengine flights, and 2) that the word \u201cpassengers\u201d in Section 61.131(b) means fair-paying passengers and that members of his family and the maid who accompanied him on the trip to and from Florida did not come within that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">As to his first contention, petitioner says that as he was qualified for a multiengine rating, the issuance of that rating was a mere formality, and that he would have received his rating but for the unreasonable and arbitrary refusal of the Federal Aviation Agency to give him his test.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>In effect, petitioner says that where a pilot considers himself qualified for a rating and feels he has not been fairly dealt with by the Federal Aviation Agency in his efforts to obtain a license, he is free to disregard the license requirements of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">We reject this contention of the petitioner. A pilot may not become a law unto himself. In Poulos v. State of New Hampshire, 345 U.S. 395, at 409, 73 S. Ct. 760, 768, 97 L.Ed. 1105, the Supreme Court said: \u201c * * * But to allow applicants to proceed without the required permits to run businesses, erect structures, purchase firearms, transport or store explosives or inflammatory products, hold public meetings without prior safety arrangements or take other unauthorized action is apt to cause breaches of the peace or create public dangers. The valid requirements of license are for the good of the applicants and the public. * * * Delay is unfortunate, but the expense and annoyance of litigation is a price citizens must pay for life in an orderly society * *</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> It is clear that a pilot may not be permitted to disregard licensing requirements designed to insure technical skill and which have a substantial and close relationship to public safety. Therefore, even if the petitioner had been fully qualified for a license in December 1962, and there is no way of knowing that he was qualified, he was not justified in ignoring the legal requirements for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Furthermore, we do not think the record disclosed any arbitrary action by the Agency. The record shows that petitioner made appointments for a test on December 18,19 and 26,1962. Petitioner admits he knew the Agency was on a tight schedule in view of the Christmas holiday season. For some reason not shown, the inspector assigned to give the test on December 18, was unable to give it. The test scheduled for the 19th was cancelled because of bad weather conditions. Petitioner failed to appear at the time designated for the December 26th appointment. Furthermore, there is no indication in the record that petitioner then made any complaint. He merely made another appointment for January 4, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">With respect to petitioner\u2019s second contention, it seems obvious that the purpose of the prohibition of carrying \u201cpassengers\u201d in Section 61.131(b) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the safety of the occupants of an airplane which the pilot has not established his qualifications to fly. Whether those on the plane paid for their passage or not is irrelevant. The term passenger \u201cin common parlance * * * describes a physical status rather than a technical legal status.\u201d Vogrin v. Hedstrom, 220 F.2d 863, 866 (8 Cir. 1955), cert. den. 350 U.S. 845, 76 S.Ct. 86, 100 L.Ed. 753 (1955)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">We hold the term \u201cpassenger\u201d as used in Section 61.131(b) did not exclude the members of petitioner\u2019s family and the domestic servant who accompanied him on his trips to Florida and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">We agree with the Board that petitioner was not a victim of a poorly-drawn regulation but acted deliberately. He had planned the trip to Florida with his family. He was, undoubtedly, impatient at the delays which he encountered in taking his tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">The evidence shows that petitioner was well aware of the requirements of the pertinent regulations on his trip from Chicago to Florida. He classified his wife and two small daughters, his mother-in-law and the maid as \u201ccrew members\u201d or \u201ccargo.\u201d On his return trip, when he filed his instrument flight plan by radio, he listed \u201cone person on board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Petitioner has made several other minor contentions, but we feel they are without merit and do not need discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The order of the Civil Aeronautics Board, No. S 1291 will be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">. The Administrator has the statutory authority and duty to promulgate regulations covering safety in flight, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421 (Section 601 of the Act), and to license airmen, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422 (Section 602). Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429 (Section 609), the Administrator may, if after investigation he determines that safety in air commerce and the public interest so require, issue an order suspending or revoking in whole or in part, an airman certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">.
