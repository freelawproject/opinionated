The trial court, after comprehensive review of the state court record determined that petitioner\u2019s severe sentence had not been arbitrarily imposed so as to violate a federal constitutional right and denied the petition for the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-24\">No appellate claim is made that the judgment of the district court is faulty either upon the merits or upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>jurisdictional grounds. Appellate counsel does assert that petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence are suspect upon several grounds which have not bqen presented to the Colorado state courts and which were not decided by the federal district court. This court, of course, does not review arguments but limits its consideration to that which is decided in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The writ was properly denied and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
