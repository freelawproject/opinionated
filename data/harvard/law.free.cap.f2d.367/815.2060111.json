Defendant owed $650,314.63 and the two corporations together owed $469,542.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Efforts to collect the taxes were unsuccessful. Minimal offers in compromise dated January 25,1961, signed by defendant and received by the Internal Revenue Service on March 31,1961, were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">During the period of efforts to compromise, on February 2, 1961, after defendant had liquidated his personal assets and those of his two corporations and realized therefrom the sum of $540,511.31, defendant caused this sum of money to be deposited in a bank in Switzerland, thus placing it beyond the reach of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Defendant, who had a record of a prior conviction for income tax evasion, did not testify at his trial and made no explanation of the transfer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The trial court found this transfer of assets to the Swiss Bank, following the Government\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to collect and during the period of compromise negotiations, to constitute concealment or an attempt to conceal, as charged in the indictment, thereby violating the proscription set out in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention on appeal, we hold that the statute of limitations had not run before the indictment was returned. The indictment was returned on April 16, 1964. It charged a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201 based on defendant\u2019s conduct ending on February 2, 1961. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6531(2) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fixes the period of limitations at six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s further contention on appeal, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), we hold that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the judgment of conviction on all counts and that the trial court did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">The judgment of conviction on each count is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-16\">. \u201cAny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-10\">. \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any of the various offenses arising under the internal revenue laws unless the indictment is found or the information instituted within 3 years next after the commission of the offense, except that the period of limitation shall be 6 years\u2014 *****</p>\n<p id=\"b870-23\">\u201c(2) for the offense of willfully attempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax or the payment thereof; * * *\u00bb 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6531.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
