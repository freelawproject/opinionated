United States, 9 Cir., 362 F.2d 973, and involves the same robbery of the First National Bank of Nevada. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-24\">The bank\u2019s F.D.I.C. charter was put in evidence to prove the bank was federally insured. We cannot agree with defendant-appellant that this was not enough. Cook v. United States, 5 Cir., 320 F.2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">On the search made of the house of Mrs. Price, good friend of Hayter, there was complete consent of Mrs. Price. In our view, Burge v. United States, 9 Cir., 333 F.2d 210, rehearing 342 F.2d 408 and Nelson v. People of State of California, 9 Cir., 346 F.2d 73, support the government rather than Callahan, as he contends. Therefore, we reject the attack on the search which produced a gun of the type used in the robbery and much of the money taken in the robbery. (Some of the money had been pre-marked by the bank in anticipation of any holdup.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">For the reasons above and those given in Hayter, supra, we decline to reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
