We agree with the trial court that the payments made were made under a valid contract which inured to the benefit of Jefferson Mills and that the payments thus made were properly treated by the trial court as ordinary and necessary business expenses. We have carefully read the opinion of the learned trial judge, and we adopt in full his opinion and base our affirmance on the reasoning of that opinion. 259 F.Supp. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
