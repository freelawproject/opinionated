All of its capital stock, except for qualifying shares, is owned by Atkins, Kroll and Company, Ltd., hereinafter Atkins Kroll, which is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, with its principal place of business at San Francisco. It is not engaged in trade or business in Guam.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-21\">The appeal involves a claim for refund by Kroll (Guam) with respect to the withholding tax on dividends paid by it to Atkins Kroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">The facts upon which the District Court denied the claim for refund are entirely stipulated. The pre-trial order entered in that court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-23\">\u201cNo question of fact is presented and the parties have stipulated that the question involved shall be determined by the court as a question of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">The stipulated facts are: In 1958, Kroll (Guam) declared and paid to Atkins Kroll a cash dividend of $25,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The Government of Guam asserted that Kroll (Guam) was required by the Guam Revenue Laws, Sections 881 and 1442, to withhold 30 per cent of the sum paid as a dividend on the ground that Atkins Kroll was a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in Guam and assessed the sum of $7,500. Kroll (Guam) paid said sum to appellee and filed a claim for refund of such payment. Appellee took no formal action on the claim, whereupon Kroll (Guam) instituted this action in the District Court for refund of the $7,500, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The District Court held that appellee properly required the payment of the tax of $7,500 and entered judgment denying a refund to Kroll (Guam).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam, 64 Stat. 392 (1950), as amended in 1958, 72 Stat. 681 (1958), in parts here relevant [48 U.S.C. 1421i(a), (b), (d), and (e)], provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Section 1421i. Income Tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">(a) Applicability of Federal laws. The income-tax laws in force in the United States of America and those which hereafter may be enacted shall be held to be likewise in force in Guam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">(b) The income-tax laws in force in Guam pursuant to subsection (a) shall be deemed to impose a separate Territorial income tax, payable to the Government of Guam, which tax is designated the \u201cGuam Territorial income tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">(d) The income-tax laws in force in Guam include, but are not limited to the following provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, where not manifestly inapplicable or incompatible with the intent of this section: Subtitle A (not including Chapter 2 and section 931).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(e) Substitution of terms. In applying as the Guam Territorial income-tax the income tax laws in force in Guam, except where otherwise manifestly required, the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Codes of 1954 and 1939, shall be read so as to substitute \u201cGuam\u201d for \u201cUnited States\u201d and with other changes in nomenclature and other language, including the omissions of inapplicable language where necessary to effect the intent of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Section 881 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 imposes on a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in the United States a tax of 30 per cent of the amount received from sources within the United States as dividends. As a means of collecting the tax, Section 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 requires a corporation which pays a dividend to a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in the United States to withhold and pay over an amount equal to 30 per cent of the dividends. The amount so withheld and paid over is allowed as a credit against a tax imposed by Section 881 as provided by Section 1462 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">Under the heading \u201cDefinitions\u201d, Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">(a) When used in this title, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-15\">(4) DOMESTIC. The term \u201cdomestic\u201d when applied to a corporation or partnership means created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-16\">(5) FOREIGN. The term \u201cforeign\u201d when applied to a corporation or partnership means a corporation or partnership which is not domestic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-17\">(9) UNITED STATES. The term \u201cUnited States\u201d when used in a geographical sense includes only the States and the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-18\">(10) STATE. The term \u201cState\u201d shall be construed to include the District of Columbia, where such construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tion is necessary to carry out provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">By substituting \u201cGuam\u201d for \u201cUnited States\u201d, as directed in subsection (e) of Section 1421i of the Organic Act of Guam, such sections in pertinent parts read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">Section 881. In the case of every foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within Guam, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year a tax of 30 per cent of the amount received from sources within Guam as dividends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">Section 1442. In the case of a foreign corporation subject to taxation under this subtitle not engaged in trade or business within Guam, there shall be deducted and withheld at the source in the same manner and on the same items of income as provided in Section 1441 or Section 1451 a tax equal to 30 per cent thereof, and the deduction and withholding shall be at the rate specified therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The problem of substitution arises in connection with Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. It is appellee\u2019s position that \u201cGuam\u201d should be substituted for \u201cUnited States\u201d in the definition of \u201cDomestic\u201d in each of the two places where \u201cUnited States\u201d is used in subsection (a) (4) of 7701. Appellee would recast subsection (a) (4) of 7701 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">\u201c(4) DOMESTIC. The term \u2018domestic\u2019 when applied to a corporation or partnership means created or organized in Guam or under the law of Guam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Appellee would thus excise from the definition the phrase \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d as being inapplicable language.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">It is appellant\u2019s position that \u201cGuam\u201d should be substituted for \u201cUnited States\u201d in only the first place where it appears in the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">In our view we see no reason why the last phrase in the definition \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d should be disregarded and under such view it makes no difference whether \u201cGuam\u201d is substituted for \u201cUnited States\u201d in one or both places where \u201cUnited States\u201d appears in the definition since the phrase \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d preserves Atkins Kroll as a domestic corporation since it was organized in a state of the United States, to-wit, the State of California. In holding that the phrase \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d preserves a California corporation as a domestic corporation, even assuming that \u201cGuam\u201d should be substituted for \u201cUnited States\u201d in both places in the definition, we do so only for the purposes of Section 881, as it may well be that for the purposes of other provisions of the Guam income tax laws, the words \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d would have to be disregarded pursuant to the statutory authority conveyed by the words \u201cexcept where it is manifestly otherwise required.\u201d A reason for not following the latter course with respect to Section 881 lies in the fact that with respect to that section, unless the words \u201cor of any State or Territory\u201d are given full application, a manifest and substantial inequity results, for otherwise the combined Guam and Federal tax burden on the income which a California corporation ultimately receives from the business of its Guam subsidiary substantially exceeds the applicable corporate income tax rate under either the laws of Guam or the United States. We find nothing to indicate that Congress intended the Guam tax laws to be interpreted so as to reach such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">The District Court erred in concluding that Atkins Kroll is a foreign corporation under Guam tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">We deem it unnecessary to reach other contentions appearing in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-19\">. Subtitle A pertains to income taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
