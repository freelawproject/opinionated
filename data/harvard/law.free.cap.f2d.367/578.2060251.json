The appellant submitted his claims and grievances against his employer, the appellee, to the National Railroad Adjustment Board which rendered a decision against him. In the district court the appellee presented motions to dismiss and for summary judgment supported by an affidavit and exhibits. The court granted the motions and dismissed the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">A review of the record clearly demonstrates that the district court was correct in holding that it lacked jurisdiction and that the decision of the National Railroad Adjustment Board was final.
