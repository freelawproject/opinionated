Title 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 416(i) and 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">The Hearing Examiner concluded that appellant had failed to establish that his impairments, either singly or in combination, were of such severity as would preclude him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity during the period in question. The Appeals Council denied review. The District Court reviewed the evidence and filed a detailed opinion in support of its judgment in favor of the Secretary. It was the District Court\u2019s opinion that the record contains substantial evidence in support of the administrative denial. We agree. It is abundantly clear that the evidence supports the finding that appellant was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. Beshears v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1964, 338 F.2d 998; Estes v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1964, 338 F.2d 997; Clinch v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
