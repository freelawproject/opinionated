They presented stolen discharge papers made out to Gilmore and a certificate of eligibility for guaranty made out by the defendant. The bank procured a credit inquiry which erroneously reported that \u201cGilmore\u201d was then working at an auto body shop and had been for fourteen months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cGilmore\u201d signed the bank\u2019s loan application, which contained the usual condition permitting the bank to withdraw from the transaction \u201cif other transactions develop facts respecting the security or the responsibility of the applicant unsatisfactory to the bank\u201d, and the bank forwarded the papers to the defendant with a request that the defendant issue a loan guaranty certificate. On the guaranty application form the bank\u2019s treasurer subscribed to the printed statement that \u201cAll information reflected in this application is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">The defendant thereupon issued the requested loan guaranty certificate, committing the Administration to guarantee sixty per cent of the bank\u2019s loan to Gilmore, and the bank completed the loan. Both parties to this action acted completely in good faith, without suspecting the forgery. After three payments, Hopkins-Gilmore defaulted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bank foreclosed a year later, and the Administration paid its share of the loss. Three years later the Administration discovered the forgery and claimed recovery of the amount it had paid. The bank refused, and the Administration finally set off part of the amount claimed against an unrelated debt due the bank on another loan guaranty. The bank then brought this action, which was tried on a stipulation of the above facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The relevant statute and regulation are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We start with the proposition that in the absence of a statute, the government would be entitled to sue for the recovery of a payment made by mistake. Wisconsin Central R. R. v. United States, 1896, 164 U.S. 190, 17 S.Ct. 45, 41 L.Ed. 399. This would be the case even if the payment resulted from the carelessness of a government official. Cabel v. United States, 1 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 998. In such a case, where the disbursement of public funds is concerned, the government is not under the obligation of showing either that the recipient was unjustly enriched or that the balance of equities otherwise lies in its favor. The several cases cited by the appellant are not persuasive, either because no loss resulted to the public purse or because the court did not consider the right of the government to recovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">In the instant case, the purpose of the guaranty given by the defendant was to underwrite a loan for a veteran. Because of the forgery this purpose was not realized. Because the mortgagor was not an eligible veteran, it is clear that the Administration would not have been legally obliged to pay, and that the payment was made only because of an erroneous understanding of the facts. To refer to the situation in Cabel v. United States, supra, it is as if the government made refunds on merchandise to meet a supposed obligation which did not in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">This brings us to the question whether the statute and the implementing regulation, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.-4325(a), supra note 3, limit the Administration\u2019s affirmative right of recovery or the equivalent right to recovery via set-off. As the whole statute indicates, the first sentence of section 1821, the incontestability provision, concerns only the Administration\u2019s certificate that a particular veteran is eligible for a guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>anty and that his avowed purpose in seeking the loan comes within the permitted statutory purposes, and that he is entitled to a specified maximum amount. For example, section 1802 sets forth the circumstances under which a veteran is entitled to the guaranty and criteria for computing the amount of guaranty available; sections 1810, 1812, and 1813 deal with the authorized purposes, such as purchase of a home, farm, or business property. Records available to the Administration enable it to check on all three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the first sentence is not limited to the formal application of the three criteria stated, but that the conclusive effect of a guaranty is subject only to the language of the second and third sentences of section 1821 \u2014 the statutory \u201cdefenses\u201d of fraud and material misrepresentation and the \u201cpartial defenses\u201d which may be established by regulation. Plaintiff further argues that regulation 36.4325(a) goes beyond the statute in providing that \u201cthere shall be no liability\u201d and that even this language provides no basis for affirmative recovery or set-off. Finally, plaintiff cites 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.4325(c), which specifically gives a right of recovery to the government when a lender has been guilty of misrepresentation and fraud, to suggest that the Administrator has officially recognized the difference between avoidance of liability on a fraudulently obtained instrument and affirmative recovery. In short, plaintiff argues that the government has bound itself to treat a loan guaranty according to the generally accepted law of negotiable instruments, under which payment is final even if the payor might have raised valid defenses. Cf. Price v. Neal, K.B., 1762, 3 Burr. 1354, 97 Eng.Rep. 871; UCC (1962 ed.) \u00a7 3-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">While some portions of the regulations might have been more skillfully drawn than others, we cannot lightly infer a restriction on a prior right of the government, unless \u201c * * * Congress has \u2018clearly manifested its intention\u2019 to raise a statutory barrier.\u201d United States v. Wurts, 1938, 303 U.S. 414, 416, 58 S.Ct. 637, 638, 82 L.Ed. 932. That the defendant has consistently interpreted the regulation to justify recovery after payment as well as refusal to make a payment is indicated by various intra-agency legal memoranda, dating from 1950, preserved in the record here. For example, in November and December, 1950, the Loan Guaranty Officer in San Francisco was advised by his chief attorney that \u201c * * it appears that the wife\u2019s signatures to the loan instruments were forged, and under regulation 36.4325(a) the Administration is under no liability\u201d, and was requested by the chief of the Loan Service and Claims Division to seek a refund of payment already made to the lender. Plaintiff has sought to derive comfort from a long memorandum from the office of the defendant\u2019s General Counsel devoted mainly to analysis of the Administration\u2019s liability when the signature of an unnecessary surety is forged. The inclusion in a seven-page opinion of one sentence raising a question as to the Administration\u2019s right to recover a payment made as the result of forgery in a required document is of no persuasive significance. We do not think it a strained interpretation of \u201cthere shall be no liability\u201d to derive the right of affirmative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Nor do we think that the regulation as interpreted is invalid or unsupported by the statute. Here we have not only the regular presumption of validity of a regulation, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. South Texas Lumber Co., 1948, 333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831, but the added weight of a regulation issued shortly after the enactment of the statute and therefore representing a contemporaneous construction of the statute by the agency responsible for its administration. Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 1933, 288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, 1931, 282 U.S. 375, 378, 51 S. Ct. 144, 75 L.Ed. 397. Moreover, this regulation was presented to Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>when it reenacted title 38 in 1958 and expressly approved all regulations then in force. See Act of Sept. 2, 1958, P.L. 85-857, \u00a7 7, 72 Stat. 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Finally, the Administrator\u2019s interpretation seems to us to be consistent with sound policy considerations. The purpose of the incontestability clause is to stimulate bank and secondary market interest in veterans\u2019 loan paper. As to the secondary purchasers, the Administration\u2019s right to recover from the original lender is irrelevant. And as to the bank, it is clear that the Administration could refuse to pay under a guaranty if a forgery were discovered even years later, but before disbursement by the government. The extension of that possibility beyond payment does not seem likely to substantially discourage acceptance of veterans\u2019 loans in either market.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">From the viewpoint of administrative convenience, we think it not unfair to let the burden of ascertaining the identity of the borrower remain with the bank, where it has traditionally lain. In this case it is not without significance that the plaintiff undertook to obtain a credit report on the borrower, admittedly a sparse one, that it forwarded this report to the defendant with the certification of its responsible officer that the information as to the borrower was \u201ctrue to the best of my knowledge and belief\u201d, and that its standard loan application form reserved its right to withdraw upon development of reasonable doubt as to the responsibility of the applicant. To impose the responsibility of verifying a borrower\u2019s identity upon the Veterans Administration would be to remove that function from the smaller local organizations best able to fulfill it and to transfer it to a remote and centralized bureaucracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Opposed to these considerations are the policy of repose embodied in the rule of Price v. Neal, supra, and the bank\u2019s interest in certainty as to the extent of its potential liabilities. The former policy has been rejected with respect to the government in the cases following Wisconsin Central R. R. v. United States, supra. As to the latter, we think the uncertainty engendered by the Administrator\u2019s position is hardly a substantial addition to the risk of forgery assumed by the bank whenever it lends money on the basis of a cursory credit inquiry or becomes the endorser on a stranger\u2019s note. See, e. g., Mass.G.L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 414, 3-417(2) (b). In any event, this interest is clearly subordinate to the public interest in proper expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-15\">.

In McKnight v. United States, 1878, 98 U.S. 179, 25 L.Ed. 115, the government paid a sum to its creditor\u2019s assignee. Upon suit by the assignee on another claim, the government was not allowed to counterclaim on the ground that the assignment had been invalid in law. The Court pointed out that the original creditor had given a valid receipt, and that there was no danger of a double recovery against the government. In In re South Shore Co-op. Ass\u2019n, 2 Cir., 1939, 103 F. 2d 336, the claimants were private persons, not the government, seeking to recover money paid to a trustee in bankruptcy under an alleged mistake of law. In United States v. Hart, 3 Cir., 1937, 90 F.2d 987, the government sought <em>to </em>recover from a legatee a tax refund erroneously paid to the testator\u2019s estate. The court overlooked the cases concerning the government\u2019s right of recovery and relied on cases involving only private persons. It emphasized that recovery was; being sought from a person other than the one to whom the sum had been paid, and that any money traceable to the tax refund had been paid to the legatee legally, by order of court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
