This appeal is from an order of the District Court which sustained the referee\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-27\">The debtor filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI, \u00a7 322 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 722, on November 1, 1965 and since that time has operated its business as debtor in possession. Losses substantially in excess of $200,000 were incurred and on July 28, 1966 the referee, acting pursuant to \u00a7 326 of the Bankruptcy Act, ordered that the debtor \u201cdeposit the sum of $50,000.00 indemnity against further loss or diminution to this estate or in the alternative it may deposit $50,000.00 on deposit toward the plan * * Gott<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>fried was adjudicated a bankrupt when it failed to comply with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On this appeal it is asserted that the referee erred by failing to make sufficient findings of fact or conclusions of law and that he abused his discretion by requiring the indemnity bond, refusing to permit the sale of certain real estate, and giving insufficient weight to the recommendations of the creditors\u2019 committee. The District Court rejected each of these contentions in upholding the referee\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We find no reason to disturb the conclusion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
