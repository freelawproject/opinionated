Higginson, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Ifeyhewen Badidi petitions for review of a dismissal by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) of his appeal of an order of removal and the denial of his motion for continuance. Badidi challenges the determination that he was removable based upon Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 237(a)(l)(D)(i) (8 U.S.C. \u25a0 \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(D)(i)), as an alien who had his permanent resident status on a conditional basis terminated. He also contends that the denial of his motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion by the BIA and Immigration Judge (IJ). The Respondent has filed a motion for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction \u2014 claiming the petition was untimely \u2014 and, alternatively, for summary denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">The Respondent contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over this petition for review because it was not timely filed. A timely petition for review is a jurisdictional requirement. <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003). The BIA\u2019s final order is dated January 27, 2014. Badidi\u2019s petition was therefore due by February 26, 2014, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), but was' received by this court on February 28, 2014. For petitioners such as Badidi who are detained at the time of filing, pleadings are considered \u201ctimely if deposited in the institution\u2019s internal mailing system on \u00f3r before the last day for fifing.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(C); <em>Marmorato v. Holder, </em>376 Fed.Appx. 380, 382 n. 1 (5th Cir.2010) (applying the mailbox rule to filings by a'detained alien). Because Badidi\u2019s petition was filed within two business days of the due date; this court will presume, pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, that the pleading was timely deposited in the prison mail system. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Young, </em>966 F.2d 164, 165 (5th Cir.1992) (presuming notice of appeal was timely mailed when received two days late); <em>Marmorato, </em>376 Fed.Appx. at 382 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">Although we reject Respondent\u2019s argument that the petition was not timely filed, we lack jurisdiction to consider Badidi\u2019s claims regarding the determination that he is removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(D)\u00ae (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(D)\u00ae). In this immigration proceeding, Badidi took two appeals to the BIA. In neither appeal did Badidi present to the BIA the arguments that he now presents to this court: (1) that improper procedures were followed when his conditional resident status was termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>nated; and (2) that the IJ did not develop the record and adjudicate his 1-751 petition to remove conditions on residence. He therefore failed to administratively exhaust his challenge to the removal order and this court thus lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We reach the merits of Badidi\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying his request for a continuance pending the appeal of the denial of his 1-130 petition. The BIA determined that the IJ had properly denied Badidi\u2019s continuance request, given that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service had denied the 1-130 petition. This determination is in accord with the record, which indicates that the I-130 petition was denied due to numerous discrepancies in the couple\u2019s answers to questions designed to establish the authenticity of their marriage. Badidi\u2019s conclusory assertions regarding this issue do not establish a likelihood of success in challenging USCIS\u2019s determination, or that the denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 n. 3 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Matter of Hashmi, </em>24 I &amp; N. Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009) (listing factors to be considered in assessing whether to grant a continuance due to a pending petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Badidi\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED, in part. The Respondent\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
