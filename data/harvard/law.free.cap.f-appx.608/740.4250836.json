Stat. \u00a7 440.205. On appeal, Jackson argues that: (1) she produced evidence to show that the Agency\u2019s proffered legitimate reason for her termination was a pretext for discrimination on the basis of her disabling eye condition; and (2) she produced evidence to show that the Agency\u2019s proffered legitimate reason for her termination was a pretext for retaliation for having sought and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de <em>novo, </em>applying the same standard used by the district court and drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2001). Under Rule 56, summary judgment is appropriate only where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a). To overcome a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must present more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence supporting her position. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">First, we find no merit to Jackson\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her discrimination claim alleging that the Agency terminated her on the basis of her disabling eye condition. The federal Rehabilitation Act prohibits employers from discriminating against disabled persons. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). Discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standard as claims 'brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794(d); <em>Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). To prevail on a claim brought under the Rehabilitation Act, however, an employee must show that she was discriminated against \u201csolely by reason of [her] disability.\u201d <em>Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1212 n. 6 (11th Cir.2008) (emphasis omitted) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)). If there is no direct evidence that an employer discriminated against a plaintiff on the basis of her disability, she may rely on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to establish her case through circumstantial evidence. <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 251-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>see McDonnell Doug</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>las Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>a plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089. If the plaintiff satisfies that burden, and the employer then produces a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to explain the challenged action, the plaintiff must then show that the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation was a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089. Throughout each stage in the process, the plaintiff retains the burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination, which she can meet either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer, or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The plaintiff bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the stated reasons were pretextual and the true motivation was discriminatory. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). \u201cThe inquiry into pretext centers upon the employer\u2019s beliefs, and not the employee\u2019s own perceptions of [her] performance.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997). We\u2019ve held that, when an employer relies on a report in making an employment decision, the accuracy of the report is irrelevant to the pretext inquiry, which is limited to determining whether the employer, relying on the report, honestly believed the employee had done wrong. <em>Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., </em>883 F.2d 977, 980 n. 2 (11th Cir.1989). Similarly, an employer\u2019s mistaken belief about an employee\u2019s performance does not establish pretext so long as the employer honestly believed her performance was unsatisfactory. <em>Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991). Further, \u201c[a] lack of concern about the accuracy of a decision will not establish pretext as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>883 F.2d at 980 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In conducting the pretext inquiry, we evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistences, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff may not show pretext by recasting an employer\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or by substituting her business judgment for that of the employer. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, the plaintiff must meet the proffered reason \u201chead on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Where an employer\u2019s proffered reason for termination is the violation of a workplace rule, we have held that explanation to be \u201carguably pretextual\u201d when a plaintiff can submit evidence that: (1) \u201cshe did not violate the cited work rule\u201d; or (2) \u201cif she did violate the rule, other employees outside the protected class, who engaged in similar acts, were not similarly treated.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fl., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1363 (11th Cir.1999). In evaluating whether other employees outside the plaintiffs protected class were treated more favorably, it is the plaintiffs burden to show that the employees were \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u201cdifferences in treatment by different supervisors or decision makers can seldom be the basis for a viable claim of discrimination.\u201d Sil<em>vera v. Orange Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1261 n. 5 (11th Cir.2001). In instances where the plaintiff is disciplined for misconduct, it is the plaintiffs burden to show other employees were engaged in \u201cnearly identical\u201d conduct and yet were treated more favorably. <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">A plaintiff can establish a causal relationship between her statutorily protected activity and an adverse employment action by showing a \u201cclose temporal proximity\u201d between the two events. <em>Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted) (addressing a retaliation claim under the ADA). Mere temporal proximity, without more, however, must be \u201cvery close.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted) (addressing a retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). \u201c[A] period as much as one month between the protected expression and the adverse action is not too protracted.\u201d <em>Higdon, </em>393 F.3d at 1220. But \u201c[a] three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough\u201d to support an inference of causation. <em>Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In this case, Jackson failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact about whether the Agency\u2019s proffered reason for her termination was pretextual. For starters, because the Agency\u2019s burden of production was \u201cexceedingly light,\u201d it sufficiently proffered a legitimate reason for her termination \u2014 its belief that Jackson acted inappropriately during an incident with a male resident of the ward in which Jackson worked. In an effort to show pretext, Jackson claims that the Agency improperly relied on a Florida Department of Children and Families (\u201cDCF\u201d) Investigative Summary (\u201cDCF Report\u201d) reporting that Jackson had bitten the resident, and incorrectly interpreted a video of the incident. But under our law, the Agency only needed to <em>believe </em>that Jackson behaved inappropriately, even if the Agency misinterpreted the DCF Report or exhibited a lack of concern about its accuracy. As for the video, it could reasonably be interpreted to show that Jackson acted inappropriately during the incident even if the resident initiated the confrontation and attacked her. Jackson also argues that the official who fired her, Sandra Koon, noted shortly after the incident that Jackson had not done anything wrong. However, this statement does not rebut Koon\u2019s assertion that, after attending a management committee meeting and reviewing the DCF Report, the video of the incident, and Jackson\u2019s disciplinary history, she concluded that Jackson had in fact acted inappropriately during the incident. In short, Jackson simply has failed to present any genuine dispute of fact about whether the Agency honestly believed that she acted inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"ABo\">We are also unconvinced that Jackson has raised a genuine dispute of fact about pretext by pointing to the timing of her termination, which was close in time to her second eye surgery and the termination of her workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and far in time from the incident with the resident. Indeed, contrary to Jackson\u2019s claim, the long investigative process performed by the Agency and DCF may have reflected an intent to make a careful and fully informed decision about whether to discipline Jackson for her involvement in the incident. To the extent that timing could be indicative of pretext, it constituted no more than a \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence, and could not lead a reasonable factfinder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>to find the Agency\u2019s proffered legitimate reason unworthy of credence, <em>see Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538. In addition, evidence of events that took place two years <em>prior to </em>Jackson\u2019s termination does not constitute evidence that the Agency intentionally discriminated against her.</p>\n<p id=\"ABE\">Jackson also failed to show that similarly situated, nondisabled employees were treated more favorably than she was. Among other things, she fails to show that any of these other employees had a disciplinary history similar to hers, or that they had the same supervisors and faced the same decision-makers. In short, Jackson failed to rebut the Agency\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for her termination, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Agency on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Finally, we reject Jackson\u2019s claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Agency on Jackson\u2019s claim alleging that the Agency retaliated against her for having sought and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Section 440.205 of the Florida Statutes provides that \u201c[n]o employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee\u2019s valid claim for compensation or attempt to claim compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.205. The Florida Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 440.205 creates a cause of action for employees who are subject to retaliatory treatment by their employers for attempting to claim workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Bifulco v. Patient Bus. &amp; Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>39 So.3d 1255, 1257 (Fla.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">As we\u2019ve already discussed, the temporal proximity between Jackson\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and her termination \u2014 in the context of the ongoing investigation and disciplinary process\u2014 constituted no more than a scintilla of evidence in her favor. Thus, for the same reasons as we\u2019ve detailed above, Jackson failed to establish that the Agency\u2019s proffered reason for terminating her employment was a pretext for retaliation or discrimination. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Agency on Jackson\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
