The district court granted summary judgment to the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. While this appeal was pending, and after both parties filed their initial briefs, the Supreme Court handed down <em>Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1338, 191 L.Ed.2d 279 (2015). The Court in <em>Young, </em>abrogating precedent from this circuit, <em>see id. </em>at 1348 (abrogating <em>Urbano v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 204 (5th Cir.1998)), laid out a new analysis for Title VII claims, such as the one presented here, that an employer\u2019s failure to accommodate pregnancy constitutes sex discrimination. <em>See id. </em>at 1353-55. Given this intervening change in the law, we conclude that the parties here must be afforded an opportunity to present their claims and defenses in light of <em>Young, </em>and the district court should decide the matter under current law in the first instance. <em>See Easterling v. Sch. Bd. of Concordia Parish, </em>196 Fed.Appx. 251, 253 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished) (after intervening change in Title VII law, vacating district court\u2019s judgment and remanding for decision based on new law). Therefore, the district court\u2019s summary judgment as to the Title VII claim is VACATED, but the court\u2019s judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>AFFIRMED in all other respects,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the case is REMANDED. On remand, the district court should decide whether, and to what extent, additional discovery is appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-20\">. We have considered the plaintiffs arguments regarding her claim under La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:342(2)03) and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
