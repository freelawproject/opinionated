On appeal, Nave argues the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his Rule 60 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>because he demonstrated that a fraud upon the court had occurred and that the court based his conviction and sentence upon that fraud. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a court to \u201crelieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for various reasons. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(8) (\u201cfraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party\u201d); (b)(4) (\u201cthe judgment is void\u201d); (b)(6) (\u201cany other reason that justifies relief\u2019). Rule 60(b), however, \u201cdoes not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case.\u201d <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1365-1366 (11th Cir.1998) (observing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply only to civil, not criminal, proceedings). Therefore, the district court did not err in determining it lacked jurisdiction to grant Nave relief from his criminal judgment under Rule 60. <em>See id. </em>(holding \u201cthe district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction necessary to provide Rule 60(b) relief'\u2019 in a criminal forfeiture proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
