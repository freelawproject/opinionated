Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Carrizo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>652 F.3d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). We must affirm a decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>Under this test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable <em>to </em>the decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor thereof. <em>Id. </em>We will reverse an IJ\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence compels a reasonable factfinder to find otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 1331. Whether a group constitutes a particular social group under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">The Attorney General has the discretion to grant asylum to an alien who establishes that he or she is a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13; <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1280-31 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The applicant must also demonstrate that one of the enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason\u201d for the persecution. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). The statutory grounds for asylum specifically include \u201cmembership in a particular social group, or [a] political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cPersecution on account of political opinion is persecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political- opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). The key question is whether the persecutor is acting <em>because of </em>the applicant\u2019s political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 438. We have held that \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Congress has not defined what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA, and we defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of that term, pursuant to <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1195-96. In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we approved the BIA\u2019s definition of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d as a group of persons who \u201cshare a c\u00f3mmon, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193, 1196-97 (internal quotation marks omitted). This characteristic \u201cmust be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">To qualify as a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d a group must: (1) share an immutable characteristic, (2) not be defined by the risk of persecution alone, and- (3) not be \u2022too numerous or inchoate. <em>Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam). Additionally, a particular social group must have \u201csocial visibility\u201d (which the BIA recently renamed \u201csocial distinction\u201d), which requires a group, to be socially distinct within the society in question, i.e., it must be perceived as a group by society. <em>Matter of W-G-R-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 208, 210-12 (BIA 2014). Apart from social distinction, a purported social group lacks particularity if the description of the group is too amorphous to allow members to be recognized as a discrete class of people. <em>See Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 584-85 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Additionally, an alien is eligible for withholding of removal if removing him or her to a country would threaten the alien\u2019s life or freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The burden is on the alien to show a clear probability of future persecution, meaning that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he or she will be persecuted or tortured if returned to his or her country. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. The standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>standard for asylum, and if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard of proof for asylum, he or she will be unable to meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"> Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. First, Diaz-Hin-capie did not suffer past persecution because the threatening phone calls that he received from members of the former paramilitary group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (\u201cAUC\u201d) did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Second, substantial evidence supports the finding that Diaz-Hincapie did not show that the former AUC members\u2019 interest in him has survived his more than eight year absence from Colombia and the AUC\u2019s 2006 demobilization. <em>See id. </em>at 1232. Third, Diaz-Hincapie failed to show that the evidence compels the conclusion that the persecution he fears is based on his political opinion or his membership in a particular social group. Diaz-Hinea-pie has not shown specific facts to demonstrate that the AUC\u2019s interest in him is based on his political opinion or family membership, rather than his refusal to pay funds that the AUC demanded. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Fourth, the agency did not err in determining that the \u201csocial group\u201d proposed by Diaz-Hincapie, a family that runs a successful business and openly opposed the AUC, is not a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for purposes of the INA because Diaz-Hincapie presented no evidence that his proposed group is socially distinct within Colombia. <em>See Matter of W-G-R-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Finally, because Diaz-Hincapie failed to carry his burden as to asylum, he necessarily failed to carry the higher burden, required to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1249 n. 3. Accordingly, because the record does not compel reversal of the agency\u2019s determination that Diaz-Hincapie failed to meet his burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, we deny the petition, for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
