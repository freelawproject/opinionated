Leonel Deleon Roblero (\u201cDeleon\u201d), a citizen of Guatemala, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) final order affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Deleon\u2019s application claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala by the Mara Sal-vatrucha street gang (\u201cthe Maras\u201d) because, as a catechist in his local Roman Catholic Church, he had refused to join the Maras and had preached to others in his hometown not to join the Maras. The IJ and the BIA denied Deleon\u2019s application, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Deleon had not shown past persecution on account of a protected ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the IJ and the BIA determined that Deleon was not a member of a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-20\">On appeal, Deleon argues that the BIA erred in concluding that \u201creligious teachers who oppose gang membership and deter other[s] from joining such gangs\u201d are not a \u201cparticular social group\u201d within the meaning of the INA. After review, we deny Deleon\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [his] country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground if returned to his home country, and a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that the applicant will likely be persecuted in the future. <em>Cendejas Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1308 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">While Congress did not define the phrase \u201cparticular social group,\u201d the BIA formulated a definition in <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985), which this Court has concluded is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming the BIA\u2019s conclusion that noncriminal informants working against the Cali drug cartel in Colombia are not a particular social group). Under the <em>Acosta </em>formulation, a \u201cparticular social group\u201d means a group of persons who share a common characteristic that is immutable or fundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1193-94. Furthermore, the group must have sufficient \u201csocial visibility,\u201d and persecution based on membership in a particular social group should not be defined so broadly that it becomes \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196-97. Thus, a particular social group must not be too numerous and inchoate, and the group\u2019s defining attribute cannot be its persecution alone. <em>Id. </em>at 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The BIA did not err in concluding that religious teachers in Guatemala who oppose gang membership and deter others from joining gangs are not a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA. According to the 2013 World Report for Guatemala, created by Human Rights Watch, transnational gangs such as the Maras carry out attacks on those who defy their control. Similar to the petitioners in <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>Deleon has not established that his purported social group was treated any differently by the Maras than any other individual in Guatemala that the gang perceives as interfering in its activities. <em>See id. </em>at 1198. Consequently, Deleon has not distinguished his particular social group from people who oppose criminal organizations generally, and this Court and the BIA have concluded that people who oppose criminal organizations do not constitute a particular social group. <em>See id.; Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 581, 590 (BIA 2008) (addressing persons who resist the Maras in El Salvador); <em>Matter of E-A-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591, 594-95 (BIA 2008) (addressing persons who resist the Maras in Honduras). Contrary to Deleon\u2019s arguments, the defining attribute of his proposed particular social group is persecution by gangs, and the defining attribute of a particular social group cannot be persecution. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198 (explaining that Colombian informants are not a \u201cparticular social group\u201d because their \u201cdefining attribute is their persecution by the cartel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">For these reasons, the BIA did not err in denying Deleon\u2019s application for with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>holding of removal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8Ap\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-14\">. The petitioner is referred to as Francisco Balam-Ruiz, Francisco Milan-Ruiz, and Leonel De Leon, among other variations, throughout the administrative record. The petitioner contends the name Francisco Ba-lam-Ruiz, by which he was identified in his Notice to Appear, was the name he used to enter Mexico en route to the United States, and that his real name is Leonel Deleon Ro-blero. We refer to the petitioner as Deleon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-15\">. In the Immigration Court, Deleon also claimed persecution on account of political opinion and religion and alleged that, in addition to being targeted by the Maras, he was threatened by the Pentecostals. Before this Court, however, Deleon challenges the denial of withholding of removal only with respect to his claims of past and future persecution by the Maras on account of his membership in a particular social group. Deleon also does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusions that his asylum application was untimely and that he was not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. Thus, Deleon has abandoned these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-22\">.Where, as here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision or rely on his reasoning, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>BIA's legal conclusion as to whether an asserted group qualifies as a particular social group under the INA. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b936-18\">. Because we affirm based on the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Deleon failed to show that the Maras\u2019s targeting of him was in the past, or will be in the future, on account of his membership in a particular social group, we do not address Deleon's other arguments relating to persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
