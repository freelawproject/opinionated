The \u201cshotgun\u201d complaint claims that various mail-screening policies of the Defendants violate Bowens\u2019s First Amendment rights. In particular, he seeks permission to receive sexually explicit materials that he contends are necessary to defend multiple sex-crime charges pending against him. These materials are banned by the prison where Bowens is incarcerated. The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AGV\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A \u201cshotgun\u201d pleading like Bowens\u2019s in this case does not comply with Rule 12(b)(6)\u2019s pleading requirements. <em>See Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366-67 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The district court did not err in concluding that Bowens failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.- The complaint contains a number of factual allegations and identifies a number of jailers and other prison officials, but it does not correlate any of the facts to any of the Defendants. His complaint does not allege any of the elements of a claim necessary to prove the unreasonableness of prison regulations insofar as the regulations allegedly infringe upon constitutional rights. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">While the district court did not err in concluding that Bowens\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it did err in not giving Bowens an opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991), <em>overruled in part, Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc). Under <em>Bank, </em>a pro se litigant must be given at least one opportunity to amend his complaint if it appears that a more carefully drafted pleading would state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Bank, </em>928 F.2d at 1112. Bowens\u2019s is such a complaint. Bowens should have been allowed an opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. <em>Turner </em>directs us to consider four factors in determining whether a prison regulation is reasonable: (1) is there a \"valid, rational connection\u201d between the regulation and the legitimate government interest justifying it; (2) do alternative means of exercising the constitutional right remain open to the inmate; (3) the extent to which accommodating an asserted right will affect prison operations, including inmates and staff; and (4) whether the regulation is an exaggerated response to institutional concerns. <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89-91, 107 S.Ct. at 2262.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
