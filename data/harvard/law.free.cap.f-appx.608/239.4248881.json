The district court imposed a sentence of 188 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, with the sentence to run concurrently with the total 151-month sentence imposed in 2009 for guilty-plea convictions for drug-related offenses. On appeal, Wellington challenges his money laundering conviction and sentence, asserting that the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement in the drug cases by indicting him for money laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Invoking the waiver of appeal provision in Wellington\u2019s plea agreement in the money laundering case, the Government moves for dismissal of Wellington\u2019s appeal, or, in the alternative, for summary affirmance. The government contends that the waiver is valid and enforceable and precludes Wellington from challenging his conviction or sentence for any reason. Because the summary affirmance procedure is generally reserved for cases in which the parties concede that the issues are foreclosed by circuit precedent, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Houston, </em>625 F.3d 871, 873 n. 2 (5th Cir.2010), the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">We reach a different result, however, on the motion to dismiss which seeks to enforce the appellate waiver. The validity of an appeal waiver is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Burns, 433 F.3d </em>442, 445 (5th Cir.2005). The record indicates that Wellington read and understood the plea agreement, which contained an \u201cexplicit, unambiguous waiver of appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. McKinney, 406 </em>F.3d 744, 746 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, Wellington\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(l)(N). Accordingly, he is bound by it unless the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002). Wellington does not allege that the Government breached the plea agreement in this case, and an examination of the record reveals that the Government fulfilled its obligations under the plea agreement. Therefore, the appeal waiver provision is valid and binding and bars the appeal of Wellington\u2019s money laundering conviction or sentence for any reason. <em>See Higgins, </em>739 F.3d at 738-39.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Government\u2019s motion for dismissal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. It is worth noting that the plea agreement in the earlier drug case, which is the one Wellington contends the government breached, included a government agreement to not seek \"further criminal prosecution [of Wellington] for any acts or conduct disclosed by [Wellington] ... arising out of any event covered by the indictment ... if [Wellington] voluntarily, truthfully, and completely disclosefd] all information and knowledge\u201d he had. At the sentencing in this case at which Wellington raised the issue concerning his prior plea, the government vigorously disputed that it had breached this agreement. Its position was that Wellington refused to talk about his finances during his debriefing because he was aware of an ongoing money laundering investigation for which he was not the source.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
