On appeal, Defendant challenges only his \u00a7 924(c) conviction for brandishing a firearm. He contends that the prosecution (\u201cthe Government\u201d) presented insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had brandished a firearm that fit the applicable statutory definition. After careful review, we affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">As relevant to this appeal, Defendant was indicted for one count of brandishing a fireman in furtherance of his October 13, 2012, attempted robbery of a Publix grocery store. Defendant pled not guilty and proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">At trial, the Government presented the testimony of Publix assistant store manager, Vanessa Giles. Giles testified that, during the attempted robbery, Defendant told her that he had a gun and ordered her to give him money. Giles did not see a gun at that time. While walking to the cash registers, Giles picked up a bottle of wine and swung it at Defendant, yelling at him to get out of the store. Defendant responded by pulling out a gun and pointing it at Giles. She then swung the bottle at Defendant a second time, and he fled the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">In her testimony, Giles described Defendant\u2019s gun as a small black handgun that \u201clooked like a regular magnum.\u201d She further testified that the gun was a semiautomatic pistol like the one her brother, who was in the military, had shown her. While she only saw Defendant\u2019s gun briefly, she believed that it was real.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">The Government also introduced video footage taken from the store\u2019s surveillance cameras. Giles explained that the recording did not show Defendant with the gun because, when Defendant backed away from her, he entered a \u201cdead space\u201d where the surveillance cameras did not capture what was happening. The gun was never recovered and was not introduced into evidence at Defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 at the close of the Government\u2019s case\u00a1 arguing that the Government had failed to produce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he had possessed an actual firearm. The district court reserved ruling on this motion until after the jury returned a verdict. Defendant renewed his motion before the case was submitted to the jury, and the court again reserved its ruling until after the jury returned a verdict. After the jury found Defendant guilty, the district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">On appeal, Defendant argues that Giles\u2019s testimony was insufficient, by itself, to convict him of brandishing a \u201creal\u201d firearm during the attempted robbery. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number><em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1045 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">To establish the crime of brandishing a firearm during the commission of a crime, the Government must show that a defendant (1) carried or used a firearm (2) during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). A firearm within the meaning of the statute is any weapon \u201cwhich will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 921(a)(3)(A). However, the Government need not \u201cshow to a scientific certainty that a defendant is carrying a device that fires projectiles by means of an explosive.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999). The Government does not have to offer the gun itself into evidence or produce an expert witness to identify the gun as a \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201ca \u00a7 924(c) conviction may be sustained by lay witness testimony that a defendant carried or used a gun.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Here, in light of Giles\u2019s testimony, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the count charging brandishing of a firearm. Specifically, Giles testified that Defendant told her he had a gun and he later pointed it at her. She provided a description of Defendant\u2019s firearm, noting that it was a small black handgun about the size of Defendant\u2019s hand. She further testified that she had experience with a similar firearm, and she believed that Defendant\u2019s firearm was real. From this evidence, the jury could draw a reasonable inference that Defendant brandished a firearm and that it was a real gun, as required by \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal, and we affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. On appeal, Defendant also suggests that the jury may have been confused as to whether the gun needed to be a \"real\u201d firearm in order to convict him for brandishing a firearm. However, Defendant does not challenge the district court\u2019s jury instruction as to this issue, and we presume that the jury followed the instructions they were given. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1237 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
