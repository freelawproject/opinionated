Dunn argues the district court erred because the prison sentence of 150 months is substantively unreasonable. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 150-month sentence. The district court considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). In doing so, the district court observed the seriousness of taking the minor victim to a remote location and pressuring him into engaging in sexual activity. Although the Government requested the district court to impose a term of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court was not constrained by the Government\u2019s request. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThat the sentencing court is not bound by the parties\u2019 agreements or recommendations is well settled.\u201d). Dunn has not met his burden of establishing his sentence was \u201cunreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. We review the substantive unreasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
