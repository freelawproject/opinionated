Upon reviewing the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered final judgment in favor of APS. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"AsS\">APS is a staffing agency that recruits qualified candidates for job openings with client companies. On March 1, 2012, Lampkin interviewed with Megan Hiller, a staffing manager at APS, to discuss a legal assistant position. 'Near the end of the interview, Lampkin asked Hiller about the position\u2019s flexibility, informing Hiller that she would need to leave work early on Wednesday and Thursday evenings in order to take a \u201cspecial needs child\u201d to speech and occupational therapy appointments. Hiller allegedly told Lampkin that \u201cworking downtown may not be \u00e1 good option for you,\u201d but subsequently repeated her intent to submit Lampkin\u2019s resume for the position. On March 26, Lampkin sent an email to Hiller inquiring about the status of the legal assistant position. The following day, Hiller responded that the position had been filled by another agency before Hiller had an opportunity to submit Lampkin\u2019s resume. On April 19, 2012, Lampkin emailed Katherine Byrd-Hand (\u201cByrd\u201d), another employee at APS, requesting to submit her resume for \u201coffice administration positions.\u201d While Byrd initially replied expressing interest in meeting with Lampkin, she took no further action after discovering that Lampkin was \u201crepresented\u201d by Hiller. Byrd was unaware of Lampkin\u2019s relationship with a \u201cspecial needs child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Lampkin filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, claiming that both Hiller and Byrd discriminated against her based on her association with a disabled person in violation of the ADA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following discovery, the parties each moved for summary judgment on Lampkin\u2019s ADA claim, and the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, who recommended denying Lamp-kin\u2019s motion and granting summary judgment in favor of APS. After conducting a de novo review, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Ibarra v. United Parcel Serv., </em>695 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant demonstrates \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a ver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>diet for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When cross-motions for summary judgment have been filed, we review each party\u2019s motion \u201cindependently, viewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Green v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>754 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Duval v. N. Assur. Co. of Am., </em>722 F.3d 300, 303 (5th Cir.2013)). A party asserting a genuine dispute of material fact \u201cmust support such an assertion by citing specific parts of the record.\u201d <em>Grimes v. Wal-Mart Stores Texas, L.L.C., </em>505 Fed.Appx. 376, 379 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Based on a careful review of the record, the parties\u2019 respective briefs, and the relevant magistrate and district court opinions, we conclude that APS\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly granted. The district court correctly concluded that Lampkin failed to establish the fourth element of her <em>prima facia </em>case, <em>i.e., </em>presenting sufficient evidence that would raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the adverse employment action raised \u201ca reasonable inference that the relative\u2019s disability was a determining factor in the employer\u2019s adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. Because the district court\u2019s careful analysis thoroughly explains our reasoning, we need not engage in a redundant analysis simply to reach the same result. We therefore AFFIRM for essentially the same reasons as those assigned by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-13\">. Lampkin's original complaint also asserted Title VII claims for discrimination on the basis of race and sex. These claims were previously dismissed by the district court, and Lampkin has not appealed that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
