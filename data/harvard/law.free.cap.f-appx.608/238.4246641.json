California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Adams has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with-counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The record reflects a clerical error in the written judgment in that the judgment indicates that Adams was' convicted of the offense of conspiring to \u201cPossess with the Intent to Manufacture and Distribute\u201d methamphetamine, whereas Adams pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, as charged in the Second Superseding Indictment. Accordingly, we REMAND for the limited purpose of correction of the clerical error in the written judgment in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 739 n. 16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014); <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>448 Fed.Appx. 466, 466-67 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
