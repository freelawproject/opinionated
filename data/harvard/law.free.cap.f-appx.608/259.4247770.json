After a series of thorough opinions, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government. Fritz appeals, challenging not the substance of the tax assessment, but the jurisdiction of the federal court, the due process he was provided, and several other ancillary objections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-24\">The magistrate judge managing this litigation ably set out the background. In brief, the United States \u201cbrought this suit seeking, among other things, to reduce Defendant Steven Fritz\u2019s 2000-2003 tax assessments to judgment and to foreclose on its federal tax liens against him.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found Fritz liable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fritz timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-26\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-27\">Fritz first argues that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. It did not. This dispute is brought by the federal government and arises under the federal tax laws: it is settled beyond dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the federal courts have the power to resolve such cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In his brief, Fritz appears to argue that the United States must make a sworn statement attesting to the above facts in order for the court to exercise jurisdiction. He offers no relevant authority for such a statement, and we decline to impute such a requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>B.Personal Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Next, Fritz argues that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. Again, it did not. Fritz was served process at an address in La Vernia, Texas. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k), \u201c[sjerving a summons ... establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant ... who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jurisdiction of Texas state courts, in turn, extends to the limits of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and it is long-established that the Constitution is not offended if a state exercises jurisdiction over a resident defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\n<em>C.Jury Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Fritz also claims that the court has denied him a right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. The district court, however, granted summary judgment in favor of the government (a decision Fritz does not challenge), and as we have long held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">The function of a jhry is to try the material facts; where no such facts are in dispute, there is no occasion for jury trial. Thus the right to trial by jury does not prevent a court from granting summary judgment. When the district court properly entered summary judgment dismissing his claim, appellant\u2019s demand for a jury trial became moot.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">\n<em>D.Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aod\">Fritz next argues that the federal government acted as a debt collector in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His argument is large<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ly incoherent, but in any event, it fails. Federal government officers and employees are explicitly exempted from the FDCPA\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt collectors.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">E. <em>Recusal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Finally, Fritz posits that Chief Judge Biery ought be recused. He does not appear to have moved for recusal below, and \u201c[rjequests for recusal raised for the first time on appeal are generally rejected as untimely.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Any remaining arguments are equally without merit. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
