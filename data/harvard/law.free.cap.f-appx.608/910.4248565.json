On July 21, 2005, the District Court sentenced McKinney to concurrent prison terms of life imprisonment on one count and 360 months on the remaining counts, and imposed a special assessment of $600 ($100 on each count). McKinney appealed his convictions, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>219 Fed.Appx. 921 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 22, 2008, McKinney filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and requested an evidentiary hearing. The District Court denied McKinney\u2019s motion. And, on February 17, 2009, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>312 Fed.Appx. 247 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">On March 5, 2008, McKinney moved the District Court to vacate his convictions and sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion on May 6, 2008. And, on April 6, 2009, we denied a certificate of appealability. On January 27, 2014, McKinney moved the District Court for leave to amend the motion he filed on March 5, 2008. The District Court denied the motion on January 30, 2014, as an attempt to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion without obtaining leave of the Court of Appeals. McKinney now appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-22\">The District Court was correct that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain McKinney\u2019s successive \u00a7 2255 motion. To file such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>motion in the District Court, McKinney must first obtain leave of this court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-24\">. While his appeal was pending, McKinney filed several motions for a new trial. All were denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
