In a written plea agreement, Cogdell validly waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">Nonetheless, Cogdell asserts that his plea and the appeal waiver were invalid due to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness because Cogdell was not aware that he could be sentenced as a career offender. We generally decline to address claims of ineffective counsel on direct appeal because the record is not sufficiently developed. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). However, it is clear that this claim of ineffective counsel lacks arguable merit. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>592 Fed.Appx. 335, 336 (5th Cir.2015)(facially meritless ineffectiveness claim requiring no development of the record is an exception to the general rule of non-review on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">To prevail on his claim of ineffective counsel, Cogdell must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by that performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct is not deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To establish prejudice regarding his plea, Cogdell \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">Cogdell offers only his bare assertion that he was unaware of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>consequences of his plea. But he neither says that counsel misled him nor attempts to explain how counsel performed defi-ciently. His conclusional assertion is \u201cinsufficient to overcome the strong presumption of competency and the high burden of actual prejudice required to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Carter v. Johnson, </em>131 F.3d 452, 464 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">Cogdell also fails to show prejudice. <em>See Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. He pleaded guilty despite being advised that he faced up to 40 years in prison. Indeed, the district judge conducted a thorough colloquy at the rearraignment hearing, explaining that the sentence would depend on calculations under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the court, regardless of the Guidelines, was free to sentence Cogdell up to 40 years. Even if it were assumed that Cogdell was ignorant of the career-offender enhancement, he \u201cunderstood the length of time he might possibly receive, [and therefore] he was fully aware of his plea\u2019s consequences.\u201d <em>Barbee v. Ruth, </em>678 F.2d 634, 635 (5th Cir.1982) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Cogdell thus cannot show that the career-offender enhancement affected his decision to plead guilty. <em>See Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. We note as well that the district court considered counsel\u2019s lengthy arguments for a variance based upon the same considerations Cogdell argues here. The district court granted a substantial downward variance having considered the harshness of the career offender status\u2019s effects on Cogdell\u2019s guidelines range (188-235 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
