The district court also denied her motion for reconsideration, rejecting her arguments that (1) the court failed to address a \u201ccore issue\u201d; (2) removal was proper; and (3) there was newly discovered information in the form of a newly decided case by this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">We do not have jurisdiction to hear Brown\u2019s claim that remand was improper because the district court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441. Remand orders are not reviewable on appeal unless the case was originally removed under section 1442 or 1443. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>alleged in her removal notice that the district court had removal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1448. We may only review Brown\u2019s claim that removal was proper under \u00a7 1443. <em>See Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1293 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal of a remand order to the extent it challenged the district court\u2019s removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441, but evaluating jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443). And for the same reason, the district court did not have jurisdiction to address the merits of Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration to the extent that it went beyond removal under \u00a7 1443. <em>See Bender v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>657 F.3d 1200, 1204 (11th Cir.2011) (concluding that \u00a7 1447(d) bars the district court from reconsidering its remand order). We dismiss Brown\u2019s claim challenging remand and vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration to the extent it reaches beyond the issue of whether removal was proper under \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We do have jurisdiction to review Brown\u2019s argument that remand was improper because the district court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443. Under \u00a7 1443, a defendant may remove a civil action that: (1) is \u201c[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce\u201d in state court \u201ca right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof\u2019; or (2) is \u201c[f]or any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">To remove an action under \u00a7 1443, the removal \u201cpetitioner must show that the right, upon which [she] relies arises under a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (quotation omitted). A defendant\u2019s reliance on broad constitutional or statutory provisions does not support removal under'\u00a7 1443 when those provisions \u201care phrased in terms of general application available to all persons or citizens, rather than in the specific language of racial equality that \u00a7 1443 demands.\u201d <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966) (referring to the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Brown did not show that the Florida courts denied her a federal right stated in terms of racial equality. She argued in her removal notice that her due process rights were violated when the state court ignored her removal to tribal court and incorrectly entered summary judgment against her. While Brown does assert that she was denied her civil rights based on her race, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is \u201cphrased in terms of general application available to all citizens\u201d and cannot form the basis of removal under \u00a7 1443. <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790. The district court did not err by remanding her ease for lack of removal jurisdiction. Neither did it err by denying her motion for reconsideration of that portion of the remand order. We affirm the district court\u2019s remand order and denial of Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration to the extent that they address removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-24\">. Contrary to Wachovia\u2019s argument on appeal, Brown\u2019s notice of appeal was not untimely as to the remand order. Brown moved for reconsideration eight days after the district court entered its remand order, and she filed her notice of appeal seven days after the court denied the reconsideration motion. Because the motion for reconsideration stopped the clock to file a notice of appeal, Brown timely appealed both the remand order and the denial of her motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), (a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-26\">. Our jurisdiction to consider remanded cases which were removed under \u00a7 1441 is only to correct the district court's error in wrongly concluding that it had jurisdiction. <em>Boyd v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number><em>Homes of Legend, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
