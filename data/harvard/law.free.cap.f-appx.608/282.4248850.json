Because the BIA relied upon the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews both the IJ\u2019s decision and the order of the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Qhao does not meaningfully challenge the denial of withholding of removal or of her claim that her due process rights were violated; she therefore has abandoned these claims. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Qhao\u2019s attempts to explain away the evidentiary inconsistencies, implausibilities, and lack of detail identified by the IJ do not constitute substantial evidence compelling the conclusion that she is credible. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538. Likewise, she fails to show that substantial evidence compels her entitlement to either asylum or CAT relief. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Qhao\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
