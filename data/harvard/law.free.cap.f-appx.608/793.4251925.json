He now appeals his 6-month, within-guideline range sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court procedurally erred in imposing his sentence by failing to consider all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first to whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1189. On appeal, Defendant challenges his sentence only on procedural reasonableness grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">The district court commits a significant procedural error by miscalculating the advisory guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. While a failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors constitutes procedural error, a district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment that the court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Here, Defendant has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, the district court did consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing sentence. The record reflects that the district court placed substantial weight on Defendant\u2019s history of prior illegal reentries and on the need to deter Defendant from committing further criminal conduct: specifically, discouraging his pattern of continuing to illegally reenter the United States after being deported. In doing so, the court noted that, despite having been deported twice in the prior two years and having previously been sentenced to time served<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 the same sentence Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>was requesting in the present case \u2014 Defendant had been undeterred and had continued to illegally reenter the United States. The court also addressed the \u00a7 3553 factor that Defendant argued should control: the violent conditions in El Salvador and the fact that his wife and child<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> lived in the United States. It, however, rejected this factor as justifying Defendant\u2019s illegal reentry or a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Further, the district court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments at sentencing and that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The fact that the court emphasized particular factors \u2014 the need to deter Defendant from continuing to illegally reenter the United States and his past history of illegal reentry \u2014 does not mean that it failed to consider all the factors or that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (the fact that the sentencing court emphasizes one \u00a7 3553 factor as most important does not mean that it has failed to consider all the factors). Consequently, the district court did not procedurally err in sentencing Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">. Although Defendant was released from prison on January 12, 2015, his appeal is not moot because he is still serving a one-year supervised release term. <em>See Dawson v.
