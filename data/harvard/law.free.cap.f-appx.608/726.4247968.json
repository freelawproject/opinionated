Specifically, a jury found that Thompson, as a Bahamian boat captain, was smuggling drugs and aliens into the United States, and murdered Roselyne Lubin, Alnert Charles, and Nigel Warren by ordering them to jump from a boat into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, where they drowned. Thompson is serving a total life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">Thompson appeals the denial of his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. A certificate of appealability was granted on one issue: whether the district court lacked jurisdiction to try Thompson for second degree murder when the acts at issue occurred within three miles of Florida shores. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>I. JURISDICTIONAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Second degree murder is a federal criminal offense if it occurs within the \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(b). For offenses in Title 18 of the United States Code, the United States\u2019s special maritime and territorial jurisdiction includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201chigh seas\u201d and \u201cany other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular [sjtate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7(1). It also includes the United States\u2019s \u201cterritorial sea.\u201d Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 901(a), 110 Stat. 1214, 1317 (1996); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, historical and statutory notes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">For purposes of federal criminal jurisdiction, the term \u201chigh seas\u201d refers to <em>\u201call </em>waters seaward of the territorial sea baseline.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.32(a) (emphasis added). The territorial sea baseline is ordinarily the mean low water line along the United States\u2019s coast. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.20. The \u201cterritorial sea\u201d is \u201cthe waters, 12 nautical miles wide,' adjacent to the coast of the United States and seaward of the territorial sea baseline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.22(a)(1). In other words, federal criminal jurisdiction begins at the coast\u2019s mean low water line and extends out into the sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Meanwhile, both Florida and federal law recognize that Florida\u2019s coastal boundaries extend three geographical miles into the sea. Specifically, Florida\u2019s Constitution sets the state\u2019s eastern boundary at the edge of the Gulf Stream or a distance of three geographical miles, whichever is the greater distance. Fla. Const., art. II, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Similarly, the federal Submerged Lands Act sets the seaward boundaries of each coastal state \u201cas a line three geographical miles distant from its coast line,\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1312, and grants each state title and ownership of the lands, minerals, and other natural resources beneath navigable waters within those three geographical miles, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1311(a). The Submerged Lands Act also transfers to the states \u201cthe right and power to manage, administer, lease, develop, and use\u201d the submerged lands and waters, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1311(a)(2), but it reserves certain rights to the United States, such as the right to use, develop, improve, or control the waters \u201cfor the purposes of navigation or flood control or the production of power,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1311(d), and all rights in and powers of regulation and control for the purposes of commerce, navigation, national defense, and international affairs, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1314(a); <em>see also United States v. Cali</em>fornia, 436 U.S. 32, 40, 98 S.Ct. 1662, 1666, 56 L.Ed.2d 94 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In <em>Murray v. Hildreth, </em>the former Fifth Circuit concluded that a murder commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ted on or alongside a boat in the Atlantic Ocean, within 200 feet of the Florida coast near Dania Beach was committed on the \u201chigh seas\u201d because it was committed on the ocean below the low water mark of Florida\u2019s coast. <em>Murray v. Hildreth, </em>61 F.2d 483, 484-85 (5th Cir.1932) (involving the predecessor statute to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Just as Thompson does here, Murray argued that the murder he was charged with committing was \u201cwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the state of Florida.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument. The Court explained that, although the crime was committed within the State of Florida\u2019s three miles of territorial waters, the statutory requirement that the offense be committed \u201cout of the jurisdiction of any particular State\u201d did not apply to high seas crimes, but only to crimes committed \u201con any other waters,\u201d such as rivers, havens, and bays. <em>Id. </em>at 485 (citing <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>150 U.S. 249, 266, 14 S.Ct. 109, 117-16, 37 L.Ed. 1071 (1893)). The Court concluded that \u201cCongress has taken jurisdiction of crimes committed on the high seas within the three-mile limit....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Murray </em>Court explicitly left undecided whether the State of Florida had concurrent jurisdiction to also prosecute the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II. JURISDICTION OYER THOMPSON\u2019S MURDER CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Here, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to try Thompson for the three murders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the district court found, based on the parties\u2019 agreement, that the murders occurred within 200 yards of Florida\u2019s shore, and neither party challenges that finding on appeal. Importantly, the trial record supports this factual finding and shows that, when Lubin and Charles drowned in August 2006, the boat was at least 50 to 100 yards from the Florida shore, and when Warren drowned in December 2006, the boat was approximately one length of the courtroom away from the Florida shore, both times in water that was over the victims\u2019 heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Given that the murders occurred between 50 and 200 yards of Florida\u2019s coastline, the murders occurred on the \u201chigh seas\u201d and within the \u201cterritorial sea\u201d of the United States, as those terms are defined by federal law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(1); 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.22(a)(1)(h), 2.32(a); <em>Murray, </em>61 F.2d at 484-85. Thus, the murders occurred within the United States\u2019s special maritime and territorial jurisdiction and were federal criminal offenses over which the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7(1) &amp; 1111(b), 3231.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Thompson argues that because he committed his crimes within three miles of shore, Florida has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute him. Specifically, he contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(1) bars his federal prosecution because.it limits the jurisdiction of the United States to only those waters that are \u201cout of the jurisdiction of any particular State.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7(1). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Murray, </em>which concluded that this particular phrase refers only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>\u201cany other waters,\u201d and does not apply to the \u201chigh seas.\u201d <em>See Murray, </em>61 F.2d at 485; <em>see also Chambers v. Thompson, </em>150 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that we are bound by a prior panel\u2019s holding unless that holding is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc). Although <em>Murray </em>interpreted an earlier version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 (then codified as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 451), the relevant language of the provision has not materially changed, <em>see Murray, </em>61 F.2d at 484-85, and Murray\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201chigh seas\u201d is consistent with the current federal regulation defining that term, <em>see </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.32(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Thompson argues that the Submerged Lands Act conferred exclusive criminal jurisdiction on Florida. Nothing in the language of the Submerged Lands Act suggests that, notwithstanding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, exclusive criminal jurisdiction over all waters within the states\u2019 boundaries is conferred on the states. Indeed, the Submerged Lands Act does not refer to either criminal jurisdiction or criminal prosecutions at all. Further, Thompson cites no authority indicating that the Submerged Lands Act was intended to transfer to the states exclusive criminal jurisdiction over waters falling within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(l)\u2019s definition of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In sum, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to try Thompson on the second degree murders counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 1111(b). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Thompson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion with respect to these convictions. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\">.
