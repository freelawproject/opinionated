He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Oliva claims that the district court accorded undue weight to his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">When imposing the upward variance at sentencing, the district court cited Oliva\u2019s two prior convictions for assault of a family member and other evidence of repeated violent behavior by Oliva toward his common-law wife. Oliva\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of this factor is not sufficient to show an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Moreover, a court may consider a defendant\u2019s criminal history when imposing a non-Guideline sentence, <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 709, even though that factor has been incorporated into the Guidelines, <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The extent of the variance, seven months above the upper guidelines range of eight' months, is within the range of variances that we have upheld. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 345 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Key, </em>599 F.3d at 475-76. Given the deference that is due to a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, and the district court\u2019s legitimate reasons for its sentencing decision, Oliva has not demonstrated that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, <em>see Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
