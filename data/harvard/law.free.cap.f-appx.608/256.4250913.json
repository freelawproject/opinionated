Perez, a native and citizen of El Salvador, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) order denying cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Perez argues only that the IJ erred by denying cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) and that he is entitled to cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). He does not address the denial of his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT; address the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of his appeal; or brief his claim for voluntary departure. These issues are therefore abandoned. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">Perez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding the denial of cancellation of removal pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(a) by failing to raise any meaningful arguments on appeal to the BIA. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See Townsend v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice I.N.S., </em>799 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1986); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d). We also lack jurisdiction to review Perez\u2019s claim that he was eligible for special rule cancellation under NACARA, because this issue was raised for the first time in a reconsideration motion to the BIA and is therefore unexhausted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">With respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider Perez\u2019s claim for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(a), Perez has abandoned any challenge to the denial by failing to address the BIA\u2019s determination that the motion was untimely. <em>See Chambers, </em>520 F.3d at 448 n. 1; <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833. To the extent that Perez\u2019s reconsideration motion was a timely motion to reopen, he does nothing more than argue in a conclusory fashion that his family would suffer extreme hardship and fails to address the standard for reopening. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); <em>I.N.S. v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Thus, Perez has abandoned any objection to that decision. <em>See Chambers, </em>520 F.3d at 448 n. 1; <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
