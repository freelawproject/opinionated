In this state-law controlled, diversity action, no reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-24\">Defendants were involved in financing a mixed-use real estate development project called \u201cHarbourside Place,\u201d in Jupiter, Florida. Plaintiff entered into a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>agreement (the \u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with Defendants to provide various services in connection with the development project. Defendants eventually stopped making payments to Plaintiff under the Consulting Agreement, and Plaintiff threatened to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Plaintiff and Defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then entered into a Settlement Agreement and General Release (\u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). Briefly stated, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff a total of $900,000 (to be paid in six installments) in exchange for Plaintiffs release of Defendants from all claims arising out of the Consulting Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Defendants made the first installment payment to Plaintiff under the Settlement Agreement but failed to make further payment. In accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff provided written notice to Defendants of the payment default, allowed Defendants time to cure the default, and accelerated the payments due under the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiff then filed this civil action seeking enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The district court granted Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. Then, following a hearing, the district court denied Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and entered final judgment in favor of Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1180, 1186 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">On appeal, Defendants first argue that the Settlement Agreement is unenforceable under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 475.41 which, briefly stated, invalidates contracts for unlicensed brokerage services. Defendants allege that Plaintiff (who is not a Florida-licensed broker) provided brokerage services pursuant to the Consulting Agreement. As a result, Defendants contend that the Settlement Agreement constitutes indirect payment to Plaintiff for unlicensed brokerage services and, thus, is invalid under section 475.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">\u201cIn rendering a decision based on state substantive law, a federal court must decide the case the way it appears the state\u2019s highest court would.\u201d <em>Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). Where the state\u2019s highest court has not spoken to an issue, we look to decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless we are \u201cconvinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d Mesa <em>Air Group, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>573 F.3d 1124, 1131 n. 9 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">According to the Florida Supreme Court, when statutory language is \u201cclear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>definite meaning, .. the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.\u201d <em>Donato v. AT &amp; T, </em>767 So.2d 1146, 1150 (Fla.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Under section 475.41, \u201c[n]o contract for a commission or compensation for any act or service enumerated in \u00a7 475.01(3) is valid unless the broker or sales associate\u201d was licensed properly under Florida law when they performed the act or service. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 475.41. Section 475.01(3) defines \u201coperating\u201d as a broker to mean \u201cthe commission of one or more acts described in this chapter as constituting or defining a broker.\u201d A \u201cBroker\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">a person who, for another ... takes any part in the procuring of sellers, purchasers, lessors, or lessees of business enterprises or business opportunities or the real property of another, or leases, or interest therein, including mineral rights, or who directs or assists in the procuring of prospects or in the negotiation or closing of any transaction which does, or is calculated to, result in a sale, exchange, or leasing thereof, and who receives, expects, or is promised any compensation or valuable consideration, directly or indirectly therefor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 475.01(l)(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In determining the applicability of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 475.41 to this case, we stress that Plaintiff seeks to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement, <em>not </em>the underlying Consulting Agreement. Under Florida law, a settlement agreement is treated \u201cas a distinct contract, separate from the parties\u2019 underlying agreements.\u201d <em>See Lazy Flamingo, USA, Inc. v. Greenfield, </em>834 So.2d 413, 414 (Fla.Ct.App.2003). Moreover, \u201csettlements are highly favored and will be enforced whenever possible.\u201d <em>Robbie v. Miami, </em>469 So.2d 1384, 1385 (Fla.1985). \u201c[I]n the absence of an ambiguity on the face of a contract, it is well settled that the actual language used in the contract is the best evidence of the intent of the parties, and the plain meaning of that language controls.\u201d <em>Emergency Assocs., PA. v. Sassano, </em>664 So.2d 1000, 1003 (Fla.Ct.App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">The parties entered into the Settlement Agreement \u201cto settle and resolve all disputes between and among the Parties relative to the Consulting Agreement.\u201d In furtherance of that goal, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff a set monetary amount in exchange for Plaintiffs release of Defendants from all claims \u201crelated to or arising out of the Consulting Agreement.\u201d The Settlement Agreement provides expressly that it \u201cis being entered into by the Parties as a compromise of disputed claims and is <em>not for the payment of any particular fee payable to [Plaintiff] pursuant to the Consulting Agreement.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Under the plain, unambiguous language of the Settlement Agreement, the payment to Plaintiff was to be made in exchange for Plaintiffs release of claims against Defendants, <em>not </em>in. exchange for Plaintiffs <em>services. </em>Because the Settlement Agreement is no \u201ccontract for a commission or compensation for any act or service,\u201d the Agreement falls outside the scope of section 475.41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">We reject Defendants\u2019 alternative argument that the Settlement Agreement is unenforceable against Harbourside Funding GP, LLC: Defendants contend that Harbourside Funding GP, LLC was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>party to the Settlement Agreement. First, the Settlement Agreement was entered into expressly by \u201cHarbourside Funding, LP, Harbourside Place GP, LLC, and Florida Regional Center, LLC <em>and their respective affiliates and successors.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The Settlement Agreement also provides that it is \u201cbinding on, and shall inure to the benefit of, each of the Parties and their respective past, present and future ... <em>affiliates, owners, [and] members.... \u201d </em>That Harbourside Funding GP, LLC was the managing member of Harbourside Funding, L.P. when the Settlement Agreement was signed is undisputed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, as an \u201caffiliate\u201d and \u201cmember\u201d of a named party to the Settlement Agreement, Harbourside Funding GP, LLC is bound by the terms of that Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Because we conclude that the Settlement Agreement is not invalid under section 475.41 and is enforceable against all Defendants, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">. The written agreement is in fact titled \"Summary of Principal Terms, 9/11/11, \u2018Har-bourside Place.\u2019 \u201d This single written agreement has been referred to by three different names throughout this proceeding: (1) as the \"Service Contract\u201d by the district court, (2) as the \"Consulting Agreement\u201d by Plaintiff, and (3) as the \"Brokerage Agreement\u201d by Defendants. Because the Settlement Agreement at issue in this appeal refers to the underlying written agreement as the \"Consulting Agreement,\u201d we use that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-14\">. Defendants dispute whether Harbourside Funding GP, LLC was in fact a party to the Settlement Agreement. As discussed later in this opinion, we conclude that Harbourside Funding GP, LLC is bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">. Because Plaintiff does not seek to enforce the underlying Consulting Agreement and because we conclude that the Settlement Agreement is not a contract covered by section 475.41, we need not determine, as a matter of Florida law, whether Plaintiff\u2019s contracted-for services under the Consulting Agreement constituted unlicensed brokerage services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">. Harbourside Funding GP, LLC in fact signed the Settlement Agreement in its capacity as Harbourside Funding, L.P.\u2019s managing member.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\">. In the district court, Defendants also argued that Plaintiff was unentitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff stood <em>in pari delicto </em>with Defendants. Because Defendants have not raised this argument on appeal, it is abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
