Defendant raises three arguments on appeal. First, Defendant argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Second, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the Aventu-ra Police Department\u2019s failure to properly preserve the recording of his post-arrest interview and timely inform the defense that the recording had not been preserved. Lastly, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on one of the aggravated identity theft counts (Count 3). After careful review, we affirm Defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">A. Underlying Fraud Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">From October 8, 2012 through December 28, 2012, Defendant, through a temporary staffing company, worked in the cashier\u2019s office of the Mt. Sinai Medical Center (\u201cMt. Sinai\u201d). In December 2012, he was reassigned to Mt. Sinai\u2019s purchasing department, where he worked until February 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">In December 2012 and January 2013, Defendant used his ID badge to enter the cashier\u2019s office after the other employees had left. Using a co-worker\u2019s username and password, he logged into the computer system and printed screenshots of patient information, including names, dates of birth, addresses, and social security numbers. He printed approximately 94 pages of screenshots from the Mt. Sinai computer database. ' Those 94 pages contained approximately 700 names, dates of birth, and social security numbers, of which 613 matched the information maintained by the Social Security Administration. Defendant also photocopied approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>207 checks (dated December 2012 through February 2013) made payable to Mt. Sinai from individual patients. He then used this personal identifying information to file tax returns. He received tax refunds on prepaid debit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B. Search of Defendant\u2019s Vehicle and Home</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In February 2013, police officers with the Aventura Police Departm\u00e9nt responded to a call from a bank employee about an attempt to cash a fraudulent check. The bank employee told the officers that the person who had attempted to cash the check was one of three black males who had driven away in a dark grey SUV. Approximately one block north of the bank, police officers observed Defendant driving a vehicle matching that description, with two black males ducked down in the back seat, trying to conceal themselves. The officers initiated a traffic stop because Defendant was not wearing a seatbelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Defendant provided the officers with a Florida ID card and what appeared to be a fake Jamaican passport. The officers ran the vehicle\u2019s license plate and learned that the vehicle was rented. Defendant told the officers that he had borrowed the car from a friend, Gerard Reeves, and that he did not have the rental agreement. The officers arrested Defendant after a records check showed that he was driving with a suspended license. Because the vehicle was blocking traffic and because neither of the other two passengers had a valid driver\u2019s license, the officers decided to have the vehicle towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Prior to having the vehicle towed, the officers conducted an inventory search of the vehicle. In the floorboard of the front passenger seat, the officers found an open, black bag with paperwork hanging out of it. The officers observed hundreds of documents containing personal identification information in the bag. A later search of the bag revealed approximately 94 pages of computer screenshots printed from the Mt. Sinai computer database and 207 photocopies of checks made payable to Mt. Sinai from individual patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">During a post-arrest interview, Defendant consented to a search of the home that he shared with Reeves and one other person. The search of Defendant\u2019s bedroom revealed additional printed screen-shots' from Mt. Sinai\u2019s patient database, prepaid debit cards issued in various names, tax returns completed in various names, more copies of checks made payable to Mt. Sinai, and a notepad containing the tax return information. Additional screenshots from the Mt. Sinai patient database were also found in the desk area of the foyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">C. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Federal authorities (\u201cthe Government\u201d) took over Defendant\u2019s case and Defendant was indicted on federal charges. During pretrial proceedings, Defendant moved to suppress the numerous documents (computer printouts, copies of checks, tax returns, notepad, and prepaid debit cards) that were spilling out of and inside the open bag that officers discovered during their inventory search of the impounded vehicle that Defendant had been driving when arrested. Significant to this appeal, Defendant did not challenge the propriety of the original initial stop of the vehicle. Instead, he challenged, somewhat obliquely, the propriety of an inventory search of his vehicle. He also argued, again in a cursory fashion, that the officers could not rely on the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine to justify their examination of the documents that were spilling out of and inside the open bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">The Government opposed Defendant\u2019s suppression motion arguing both (1) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle because the vehicle was rented, he was not listed as an authorized driver on the rental agreement,' and he lacked a valid driver\u2019s license and (2) that the search was yalid on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) on July 3,- 2013. The magistrate judge recommended denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The magistrate judge concluded that Defendant lacked standing to challenge the search. Leaving aside the question of Defendant\u2019s standing, he also concluded that the police officers properly searched Defendant\u2019s bag as part of an inventory search and further that the incriminating documents were in plain view. The R &amp; R instructed the parties that they had 14 days to \u201cserve and file written objections\u201d with the district court. Neither party filed any objections to the' R &amp; R. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">On July 26, 2013, after conducting an independent review of the record and noting that no objections to the R &amp; R had been filed, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and denied Defendant\u2019s suppression motion. On August 7, 2013, Defendant moved the district court to reconsider its adoption of the R &amp; R and sought permission to file out-of-time objections to the R &amp; R.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">D. Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Defendant proceeded to a jury trial, which began on October 16, 2013. Defendant moved for a mistrial after an Aventu-ra police detective testified that, although Defendant\u2019s post-arrest interview had been recorded, the police department did not have the recording because the recording device had malfunctioned and the department had been unsuccessful in retrieving the recording from the device. Defendant argued. that the Government\u2019s failure to disclose this information in its response to the standing discovery order was a Brady<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violation. Defendant later tweaked this argument, claiming that the Government\u2019s failure to earlier disclose the above facts was actually more of a due process violation than a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The district court questioned the detective and reviewed the police department\u2019s emails relating to its history of issues with the recording device and its attempts to recover the recording. The court held an evidentiary hearing at which the police captain, a police officer familiar with the recording device, and a representative from the company that serviced the recording device testified. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">In denying the motion, the district court determined that Defendant could not prevail under <em>Brady </em>because he had not shown that the evidence was exculpatory. The district court further found that the Government\u2019s failure to disclose the information about the recording was not a due process violation because Defendant had not shown bad faith on the part of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">At the close of the evidence, Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure on Counts 1 through 4. The district court denied the motion. The jury found Defendant guilty on all counts, and the district court subsequently imposed a 51-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">1. Parties\u2019 Positions</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence found during the search of the vehicle he was driving. As in the suppression proceedings below, he continues to argue that he has standing to challenge the search of the vehicle, but he no longer argues that the inventory search was improper nor does he dispute that the documentary evidence discovered in his bag was in plain view. Instead, he argues for the first time that, under Florida law, a driver\u2019s failure to wear a seatbelt does not justify a stop by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Because Defendant does not raise on appeal the grounds that he cited in his suppression motion \u2014 the propriety of an inventory search and the Government\u2019s reliance on the plain view doctrine \u2014 we conclude that he has abandoned any challenge to the search based on those grounds. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that arguments not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned). Instead, Defendant proceeds only on an argument that the initial stop of the vehicle was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">The Government argues that we should not entertain any effort by Defendant to challenge the search because, in violation of Rule 59(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Defendant failed to file written objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R within the prescribed 14-day time period and, by the time he got around to objecting to the R &amp; R, the district court had already issued its order adopting that R &amp; R and denying Defendant\u2019s suppression motion. The Government also argues that, even if Defendant has not waived his challenge to the denial of the suppression motion, he cannot prevail on appeal because (1) the magistrate judge correctly concluded that Defendant lacked standing to contest the search and (2) Defendant\u2019s attack on the legality of the stop of the vehicle, raised for the first time on appeal, has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">Resolution of the first two issues on these facts \u2014 whether Defendant waived any challenge to the ruling on the suppression motion and whether he has standing to contest the search \u2014 is uncertain under existing precedent. Resolution of the third and ultimate' issue \u2014 the legality of the stop of vehicle under Florida law \u2014 is straightforward, and Defendant cannot prevail on that argument. Accordingly, because Defendant\u2019s challenge to the stop of the vehicle fails, on the merits, we reject Defendant\u2019s contention that the search in this case should be suppressed. We do, however, briefly address the first two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">2. Whether Defendant Waived His Right To Challenge The Magistrate Judge\u2019s Recommendation To Deny Defendant\u2019s Suppression Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 59(b)(2) requires a party who disagrees with \u00e1 magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to file \u201cspecific written objections\u201d within 14 days of being served with the R &amp; R. The rule further provides that \u201c[fjailure to object in accordance with this rule waives a party\u2019s right to review[,]\u201d and constitutes a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to appellate review of the district court\u2019s adoption of the R <em>&amp; </em>R. Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Here, Defendant did not file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R within the specified time period. Instead, Defendant waited until <em>after </em>the district court had already adopted the R &amp; R denying his motion to suppress before offering his disagreement with the magistrate judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>conclusions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court declined to reconsider its earlier ruling. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 59(b)(2) provides that a failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R within 14 days of service of the R&amp;R \u201cwaives a party\u2019s right to review.\u201d Citing that rule, we have held that a defendant who has failed to file objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R has waived his right to appellate review of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and the district court\u2019s adoption of that recommendation. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>777 F.3d 1234, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2015) (defendant who failed to object to magistrate judge\u2019s recommended denial of motion to suppress wiretap evidence before district court waived right to seek review of that ruling on appeal to the circuit court); <em>United States v. Garcia-Sandobal, </em>703 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2013) (defendant waived his right to challenge the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to accept the defendant\u2019s guilty plea by not filing objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Yet, in those cases where we have found waiver, the defendants had failed to file <em>any </em>objections before the district court and instead had first challenged the R&amp;R on appeal to our court. Here, Defendant belatedly filed his objections, after the 14-day deadline set by Rule 59, but before trial in the case. We have thus far not decided whether a tardy filing of objections automatically gives rise to a waiver and, if not, what factors should be considered in determining the ramifications and standard of review that attend an untimely filing of objections. As noted, we will assume without deciding, that Defendant\u2019s tardy filing in this case does not prevent us from reviewing his present challenge to the search on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">3. Whether Defendant Had Standing To Challenge The Search</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">The Government argues that even if Defendant had preserved the right to challenge the search, he lacks standing to do so because he was an unlicensed driver of the rental car that was searched, and the rental contract did not list him as an authorized driver. As an initial matter, we have yet to consider whether an unlicensed and unauthorized driver of a rental car has standing to challenge the search of the rented vehicle. The circuits that have considered the issue are split. The Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits have held that unauthorized drivers of rental vehicles never have standing to challenge a vehicle search. <em>United States v. Wellons, 32 F.3d </em>117, 119 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Boruff, </em>909 F.2d 111, 117 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Obregon, </em>748 F.2d 1371, 1374-75 (10th Cir.1984). On the other hand, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>held that an unauthorized driver may challenge the search of a rental vehicle if he can establish that he had permission from the authorized driver to use the vehicle. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>447 F.3d 1191, 1198-99 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Best, </em>135 F.3d 1223, 1225 (8th Cir.1998). The Third and Sixth Circuits have determined that an unauthorized driver does not have standing to challenge the search, but has noted the possibility that exceptional circumstances might create the legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>638 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>263 F.3d 571, 586-87 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Because Defendant cannot prevail on his challenge of the search of the vehicle, even if he had standing to do so, we need not decide this standing question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">4. The Stop Of The Vehicle Was Proper</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Defendant argues that police officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle he was driving based on the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. Accordingly, he contends that the evidence discovered after this stop should have been suppressed by the district court. Because rulings on motions to suppress involved mixed questions of fact and law, we ordinarily review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Lewis, </em>674 F.3d 1298, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2012). Here, however, Defendant is challenging for the first time on appeal the propriety of the initial stop of the vehicle he was driving. Accordingly, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 n. 6 (11th Cir.2013). Under plain error review, we will reverse where there is \u201c(1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that has affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and ... (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or. public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">A traffic stop is reasonable, and therefore constitutional, if the officer conducting the stop has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). Under Florida law, driving without wearing a seatbelt is a traffic violation. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.614(4)(b) &amp; (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, at the time of Defendant\u2019s 2013 stop, police officers could pull drivers over solely because the driver was not wearing a seat-belt. It is true that prior to 2009, Florida Statute \u00a7 314.614(8) provided that enforcement of the seatbelt law could only be made \u201cas a secondary action when a driver of a motor vehicle has been detained for a suspected violation of another section of this chapter.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.614, Historical and Statutory Notes, Florida Laws 2009, c. 2009-32 \u00a7 1. However, in 2009, prior to Defendant\u2019s stop, the above sentence was deleted. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s initial stop was proper because the officers had probable cause to believe that the traffic violation of driving without wearing a seatbelt had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Accordingly, the district court committed no plain error by failing, <em>sua sponte, </em>to suppress the evidence based on this newly-asserted ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">B. Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Defendant argues that the district court should have granted his motion for a mistrial because the Government (1) violated his due process rights by not preserving the recording of his post-arrest interview and (2) committed a <em>Brady </em>violation when it failed to disclose to the defense that a recording had been made, but not properly preserved. We consider each ground in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>1. Due Process Violation Based On \u25a0 Failure To Preserve Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that no due process violation occurred is a mixed question of law and fact. We review the district court\u2019s factual conclusions under the clearly erroneous standard and the court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Revolorio-Ramo, </em>468 F.3d 771, 774 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">To show that the loss of evidence by the Government constitutes a due process violation, the defendant must show that the evidence was likely to significantly contribute to his defense. <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 488, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). \u201cTo meet this standard of constitutional materiality, evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528 (citation omitted). \u201c[F]ailure to preserve this \u2018potentially useful evidence\u2019 does not violate [the] due process clause \u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Fisher, </em>540 U.S. 544, 547-48, 124 S.Ct. 1200, 157 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2004) (quoting <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Here, we agree with the district court that Defendant has not shown that the police department\u2019s failure to preserve the recording of Defendant\u2019s post-arrest interview deprived him of due process. Defendant does not argue on appeal that there was evidence of bad faith on the part of the police, but rather he contends that the police exhibited \u201cat least gross negligence.\u201d However, Supreme Court precedent is clear that a defendant must show bad faith on the part of the police to prevail on a due process claim based on the failure to preserve evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">In any event, the district court properly found no bad faith. The detective who interviewed Defendant testified that he tried to record the interview, but the recording device malfunctioned,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, by the time he went to retrieve the recording (after first searching Defendant\u2019s home), the recording device had been sent off for servicing. Testimony from a police captain, another officer familiar with the issues with the recording device, and a representative from the company that serviced the device, as well as internal police department emails, reflected that the police department had been trying to get the recording device to work correctly for more than two years before the manufacturer ultimately agreed to replace it. Because the detective who interviewed Defendant did not work in the Detective Bureau, it was unlikely that he was aware of the long-standing issues with the recording device. Prior to the device being taken away, the police department, with the help of a service technician, tried to offload the recording of Defendant\u2019s interview from the device, but was unsuccessful, and the manufacturer never returned the hard drive from the recording device to the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In short, there is no evidence that the police purposely destroyed the recording of Defendant\u2019s interview. Rather, it is undisputed that the police attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to retrieve the recording from the defective recording device. As Defendant cannot show bad faith, we conclude that the failure to preserve the recording was not a due process violation and the district court properly denied De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>fendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">2. <em>Brady </em>Violation Based On Failure To Disclose</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Brady </em>objection for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1163 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">While a due process violation based on the failure to preserve evidence requires bad faith, suppression of \u201cevidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must show that (1) the .Government possessed evidence favorable to him, either because it is exculpatory or impeaching; (2) he did not possess the evidence, nor could he obtain it himself with reasonable diligence; (3) the Government suppressed the evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1234 (11th Cir.2001). A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Here, Defendant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different had the Government disclosed prior to trial that the police had recorded Defendant\u2019s post-arrest interview, but the recording had not been preserved. Defendant merely speculates that he would have been able to recover the recording had he known of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">Even if Defendant had been able to retrieve the recording from the device, he has not shown that there was a reasonable probability that the recording of his post-arrest interview would have altered the outcome of . his trial. The detective testified that, in his post-arrest interview, Defendant changed his story about who the bag and the documents belonged to. According to the d\u00e9tective, Defendant initially denied, but later admitted, that the bag was his. The detective also testified that Defendant changed his story about how the documents got into the bag and that Defendant had implicated another person as being responsible for putting the documents in the bag. However, based on the information provided about this person, the detective was never able to locate him. Defendant does nothing more than speculate that the recording may contradict the detective\u2019s testimony regarding the interview. Indeed, Defendant does not argue here, and did not argue in the district court, that the detective\u2019s testimony misrepresented Defendant\u2019s statements from his post-arrest statement. As Defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Finally, Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his-conviction on Count 3, which charged that he had \u201cknowingly transferred], possessed] and use[d], without lawful authority\u201d JJP.\u2019s name and date of birth. Defendant argues that the Government failed to present evidence that he possessed <em>and </em>used J.P.\u2019s identity without lawful authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2009). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, resolving any conflicts in favor of its case. <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1233 (11th Cir.2010). Whether the evidence is direct or only circumstantial, we accept all reasonable inferences that tend to support the Government\u2019s case. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2004). Where the Government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences\u2014 rather than mere speculation \u2014 must support the conviction. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"A9J\">To sustain a conviction of aggravated identity theft, the Government must show that a defendant, in relation to certain felonies, \u201cknowingly transferred], possessed], or use[d], without lawful authority, a means of- identification of another person....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). For the purposes of \u00a7 1028A, \u201cmeans of identification\u201d is defined to include any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1028(d)(7). Under the plain language of the statute, the Government did not have to prove that Defendant both possessed <em>and </em>used J.P.\u2019s identity without lawful authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, the Government could obtain a conviction by showing that Defendant either possessed <em>or </em>used J.P.\u2019s identity without lawful authority. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cwhere an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute, a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">The evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the challenged aggravated identity theft conviction. While J.P. did not testify, the Government presented circumstantial evidence at trial from which the jury could reasonably infer that J.P. did not authorize Defendant to possess his personal information. <em>See Capers, </em>708 F.3d at 1297. A printout from the Mt. Sinai computer database with J.P.\u2019s name, date of birth, and social security number was found by the desk area in the foyer of Defendant\u2019s home. This information would have been entered in the hospital\u2019s computer database by a patient access representative when J.P. registered for treatment. Even though Defendant had temporarily worked at Mt. Sinai, he had no work-related reason to print out patient information or take such printouts from the hospital office. Furthermore, Defendant was informed, through ethics training at the start of his employment, that patient information was confidential, employees were prohibited by the code of conduct from taking home any information or providing information to third parties, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>medical center files could not be removed or distributed to anyone unless authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In light of the above evidence, we are satisfied that the jury could reasonably infer that J.P. gave his personal identifying information to a Mt. Sinai employee upon his admission to the hospital and did not authorize Defendant to possess his name, date of birth, and social security, number by printing such information from the hospital database and taking it home.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">For the reasons stated above, Defendant\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">. Defendant explained that he filed his objections out of time because he had been preparing to enter a guilty plea, but then had changed his mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-13\">. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-5\">. As noted, the magistrate judge issued the R &amp; R on July 3, 2013. Defendant should have filed any objections within 14 days thereafter, or by July 17, and failed to do so. The district court adopted the R&amp;R recommending denial of the suppression motion on July 26, 2013. On August 7, 2013, Defendant filed his motion for the court to reconsider that ruling, which we construe as Defendant's belated objections to the R&amp;R. The district court denied that motion. Trial began on October 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">. Of course, Defendant is not seeking review of any determinations made by the magistrate judge in' the R &amp; R to which Defendant made untimely objections. As noted, Defendant does not raise on appeal the propriety of the inventory search or application of the plain view doctrine, which were the two grounds for suppression that the R&amp;R addressed. Instead, Defendant seeks review of a different ground he newly asserts in support of suppression: \u25a0 the propriety of the initial stop of the vehicle. As explained below, we will review this claim, raised for the first time on appeal, for plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. The problem with the recording device was that the audio and video were out of sync.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">. On appeal, Defendant also argues that, in denying his motion for a mistrial, the district court erred by. not separately analyzing the two layers of misconduct discussed above. We disagree, as the record reflects that the district court separately considered whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the evidence was exculpatory as required for a <em>Brady </em>violation and whether there was bad faith on the part of the police as required for a due process violation based on the failure to preserve evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\">. At the time of his arrest, Defendant had yet to use J.P.\u2019s identifying information to file a tax return.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
