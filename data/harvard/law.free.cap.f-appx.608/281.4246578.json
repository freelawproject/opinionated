Ra-him-Momin petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), upholding the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) determination that Rahim-Momin was not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), because his claims were not credible and, alternatively, lacked merit. He asserts he explained many of the omissions from his written application and the discrepancies between his testimony and application. He also contends his credible testimony establishes he more likely than not will be pers\u00e9euted and tortured based upon his race and political opinion upon return to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Only the BIA\u2019s decision is reviewed, \u201cunless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on\u201d that decision. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Review of the factual determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief is for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under this standard, we may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it\u201d. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537 (citation omitted). Furthermore, an adverse credibility determination may be supported by <em>\u201cany </em>inconsistency or omission\u201d, provided \u201cthe totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 538 (emphasis in original) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">The evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and BIA regarding either petitioner\u2019s credibility or his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
