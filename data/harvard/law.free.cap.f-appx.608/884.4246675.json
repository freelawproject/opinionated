On appeal, Exil argues for the first time that his prison sentence of 120 months is unconstitutional because the statute setting forth the minimum sentence, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), violates his rights under the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Exil also avers that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment because the district court did not engage in a proportionality analysis using the factors outlined in <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991). Upon review of the record on appeal and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that Exil\u2019s 120-month sentence is constitutional, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We have squarely held that the statutory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) are not unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Osburn, </em>955 F.2d 1500, 1505 (11th Cir.1992). We have also held that minimum sentences under \u00a7 841(b) do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1178-79 (11th Cir.1988); <em>see also United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1256 &amp; n. 57 (11th Cir.2012). Exil\u2019s eonclusory argument that the district court \u201cmust\u201d employ an individualized test for his case does not explain what makes his sentence unique among the myriad other sentences imposed in this Circuit under statutory minima, such that a proportionality analysis would have resulted in a finding of unconstitutionality for him and him alone. Without making such a showing, and without showing thereby that his rights were substantially affected, Exil cannot show that the district court committed plain error. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010) (finding that a constitutional challenge to a statute raised for the first time on appeal is subject to plain error review and setting forth the requirements thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
