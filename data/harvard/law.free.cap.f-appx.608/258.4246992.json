Springer challenged the authority of District Court Judge Stephen Friot to preside over his case because the judge was hearing cases on a temporary basis in the Northern District of Oklahoma, pursuant to an order by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The district court denied relief, concluding that Springer failed to meet the requirements of the savings clause under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction \u2022 under \u00a7 2241 if the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d When addressing the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-19\">A petitioner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-20\">Because Springer again challenges only the authority of Judge Friot and his temporary assignment in the Northern District of Oklahoma, he has failed to make the showing required by <em>Reyes-Requena. See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Moreover, he has not shown any error in Judge Friot\u2019s temporary assignment by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to preside over cases in another district. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
