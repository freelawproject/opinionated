Thibodeaux challenges his guilty plea convictions for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). He was sentenced, inter alia, to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment \u2014 a total of 40 years, consisting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>five years for the illegal carrying conviction, 10 years for the drug distribution conviction, and 25 years for the firearm possession conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Thibodeaux argues that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1) by failing to more explicitly advise him that the three sentences must be imposed consecutively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii). Specifically, he asserts that the district court, in explaining the role of the advisory guidelines scheme, \u201cblurred the distinction\u201d between the advisory guidelines and the mandatory minimum penalties. At rearraignment, the district court informed Thibodeaux that it had \u201cthe authority, in some circumstances, to impose a sentence that is more severe or less severe than the sentence called for in the [G]uidelines[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Because Thibodeaux did not object in the district court, review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Oliver, </em>630 F.3d 397, 411 (5th Cir.2011). To prevail on plain error review, Thibodeaux must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To establish that his substantial rights have been affected, he \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Where an appellant\u2019s argument raises \u201can issue of first impression\u201d or \u201crequire[s] an extension of precedent,\u201d this court will \u201cconclude that any error was not plain or obvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez, </em>714 F.3d 306, 318 (5th Cir.2013); <em>see also United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe ordinarily do not find plain error when we have not previously addressed an issue.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Thibodeaux has failed to show that the district court committed plain or obvious error. Insofar as Thibodeaux complains that the district court\u2019s correct statement regarding the nature of the advisory guidelines scheme \u201cblurred the distinction\u201d between the advisory guidelines and the mandatory minimum penalties, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. ll(b)(l)(M), he points to no authority to support the proposition that the district court erred in discussing Thibodeaux\u2019s sentencing exposure. The record reflects that the district court did inform Thibodeaux, as to the \u00a7 924(c)(1) convictions, that those sentences would be imposed consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. A district court is not required to inform a defendant \u201cof every \u2018but for\u2019 consequence which follows from a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>505 F.2d 628, 628 (5th Cir.1974). Thibodeaux points to no authority which required the district court to do more. Because Thibodeaux\u2019s argument would require the extension or modification of precedent, any error was not plain or obvious. See <em>Garcia-Gonzalez, </em>714 F.3d at 318; <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Moreover, Thibodeaux has not shown that his substantial rights were affected by demonstrating that, but for th\u00e9 district court\u2019s purported error, he would not have pleaded guilty. <em>See Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333. The record shows that Thibodeaux was aware that the sentences for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) convictions must be imposed consecutively. Specifically, the plea agreement advised Thibo-deaux of the applicable minimum and maximum sentences, including the requirement that the sentences be imposed consecutively. At his rearraignment, Thibodeaux acknowledged that he understood \u201cevery word, line, sentence, and paragraph\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>plea agreement. Such \u201c[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Any documents signed by the defendant at the time of the guilty plea are entitled to \u201cgreat evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Abreo, </em>30 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1994). In addition, Thibodeaux did not object to the PSR\u2019s statement that the sentences must be imposed consecutively or object on this basis at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Casas, </em>715 F.3d 945, 954 (5th Cir.2013). Finally, as noted previously, the district court advised Thibodeaux at rear-raignment, twice, that with respect to the \u00a7 924(c)(1) convictions, the sentences would be imposed consecutively to any other term of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
