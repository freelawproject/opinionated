He argues that the district court erred in imposing an obstruction-of-justice enhancement and in refusing to apply the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. In addition, he argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to file out-of-time objections to the presen-tence report was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">Palacios-Garda has completed his term of imprisonment, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
