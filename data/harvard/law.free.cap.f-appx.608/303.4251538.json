On appeal, Robles challenges the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>authority to require collection of her fine from her monthly prison wages, the procedural and substantive reasonableness of her f\u00edne, and the substantive reasonableness of her sentence. We review the sentence for reasonableness by first ensuring that there was no significant procedural error and then determining whether the sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Robles\u2019s first and second arguments were rejected in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Alvarado, </em>782 F.3d 213, 217-22 (5th Cir.2015). Nothing in the record or in Robles\u2019s arguments compels a different conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">As to Robles\u2019s third argument, the substantive reasonableness of her 20-month sentence, the district court imposed the sentence after reviewing the mitigation evidence submitted by Robles and listening to the statements made at sentencing by both Robles and her attorney regarding mitigation. The district court was in the best position to evaluate Robles\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the need for the sentence imposed to further the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and its decision is entitled to deference. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Robles\u2019s arguments show a mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is insufficient to show the court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Given the significant deference that is due a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court\u2019s explanation of its sentencing decision, Robles has not demonstrated that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-53, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
