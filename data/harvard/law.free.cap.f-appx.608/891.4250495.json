He challenges the district court\u2019s jury instruction on attempted bank robbery in two ways. First, he argues that the court abused its discretion by refusing to include his requested instruction on \u00a7 2113(b) bank larceny as a lesser-included offense. Second, he argues that the district court erroneously included non-standard language regarding \u201cintimidation\u201d under \u00a7 2113(a). After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">First, we review a district court\u2019s refusal to submit a defendant\u2019s requested instruction to the jury for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d 1051, 1071 (11th Cir.2011). Charles argues that the district court erred in refusing to give a requested jury instruction on attempted bank larceny as a lesser-included offense of attempted bank robbery. However, he acknowledges that in <em>Carter v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 255, 274, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 2172, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000), the Supreme Court specifically held that \u201c \u00a7 2113(b) is not a lesser included offense of \u00a7 2113(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, the Court held that the defendant was \u201cprohibited as a matter of law from obtaining a lesser included offense instruction\u201d as to \u00a7 2113(b) when he was charged with bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a). <em>Id. </em>at 259, 120 S.Ct. at 2163. We are bound to follow prior Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules it. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Second, we review a district court\u2019s given jury instruction <em>de novo </em>to discern if the instruction misstated the applicable law or misled,the jury to the defendant\u2019s prejudice. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir.2013). A jury-instruction error does not warrant reversal \u201cunless we are left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWhen the jury instructions, taken together, accurately express the law applicable to the case without confusing or prejudicing the jury, there is no reason for reversal even though isolated clauses may, in fact, be confusing, technically imperfect, or otherwise subject to criticism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Here, the district court did not err when it instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he defendant need not intend for the act to be intimidating.\u201d Under \u00a7 2113(a), the government need not show that a defendant intended to intimidate someone in order to establish that his conduct was \u201cintimidation\u201d under \u00a7 2113(a). <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that \u201c[wjhether a particular act constitutes intimidation is viewed objectively, and a defendant can be convicted under section 2113(a) even if he did not intend for an act to be intimidating\u201d (citation omitted)). The given instruction was therefore a correct description of the applicable law derived from our published holding in <em>Kelley, </em>and could not have confused or prejudiced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
