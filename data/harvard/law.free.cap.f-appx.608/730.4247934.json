Because the Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court's grant of qualified immunity on their claims that the officers unlawfully entered and searched the Plaintiffs\u2019 home and arrested them without probable cause, we assume here that the officers\u2019 search was lawful and that they had probable cause to arrest the Plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b757-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Harvey E. Stewart, III, David Whirrell, and Michael Maxey (Defendants), three Greene County police officers, appeal the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity. This case arose from Megan E. Mitchell\u2019s and Clifton Jackson\u2019s (Plaintiffs) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state-law suit, alleging that the Defendants violated their Fourth Amendment rights when (1) they entered and searched the Plaintiffs\u2019 home, (2) arrested them without probable cause, and (3) transported them to the jail with their genitalia exposed. The Defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming qualified immunity. The district court granted qualified immunity for the first two claims, but denied qualified immunity and official immunity for the third claim. On appeal, the Defendants challenge whether there are genuine issues of material fact about whether the manner of transportation to the jail violated the Fourth Amendment. The Defendants argue alternatively that even if there are genuine issues of material fact, the Plaintiffs\u2019 rights were not clearly established at the time of any violation. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. <em>Fils v. City of Aventura, </em>647 F.3d 1272, 1287 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). In viewing the evidence, this Court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party, and \u201cwhen conflicts arise between the facts evidenced by the parties, we credit the nonmoving party\u2019s <em>version.\u201d Evans v. Stephens, </em>407 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"AQc\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">The Defendants first argue that there are no genuine issues of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>fact about whether they unreasonably seized the Plaintiffs. If an officer has probable cause to arrest a person, the seizure must still be reasonable. <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 8, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 1699, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). \u201cTo determine the constitutionality of a seizure we must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted) (alteration adopted). Additionally, \u201cit is plain that reasonableness depends on not only when a seizure is made, but also how it is carried out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Viewing \u2014 as we must \u2014 the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the record reveals the following version of events.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs were in their home engaging in sexual activity when the Defendants arrived, knocked on the door, and announced themselves as police officers. Jackson asked the officers to wait for him to put on clothes, but an officer shouted that \u201cwe\u2019ll worry about clothes in a minute.\u201d Jackson opened the door completely naked. The officers had Jackson sit on a couch, still naked. Mitchell, wearing a sweater that did not cover her, then appeared in the living room and sat on the couch. Both Mitchell and Jackson stated that all three officers had flashlights and repeatedly shined the light on their faces and genitalia. Mitchell specifically stated that she \u201csaw each of them looking directly at [her] exposed body.\u201d At one point, Mitchell said she was \u201ccold and needed some clothes,\u201d but the officers refused to allow her to put on clothing other than the sweater.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Eventually, the officers arrested the Plaintiffs and prepared to transport them to jail. Jackson alleged that he \u201cgrabbed [a] jacket and put it on while Officer Max-ey was handcuffing [him],\u201d but that he was wearing nothing else. He was taken without pants to a police car, with his genitalia fully exposed. Meanwhile, Mitchell alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">[Officer] Whirrell grabbed my arms and handcuffed me behind my back.... My sweater flung completely open. Nothing was covered. My breast was exposed. My genitals were exposed. [Officer] Stewart kept his flashlight on me the entire time as I was being handcuffed. Then he walked toward my kitchen. [Officer] Whirrell turned me around and I asked him again, could I please get some clothes on. He said, \u201cNo\u201d. We walked out of my front door with his flashlight still on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Mitchell Decl. 7, ECF No. 60-1. The officer took her outside and placed her in another police car. A number of neighbors who witnessed Mitchell and Jackson as they walked to the police cars stated unequivocally that they saw Mitchell\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s genitalia. <em>See, e.g., </em>McCommons Decl. 1-2, ECF No. 60-8 (stating that \u201cCliff [Jackson] had on a white jacket -with nothing underneath\u201d and that \u201cMegan [Mitchell] had on an open sweater\u201d with her \u201cbreast and private area\u201d exposed); M. Jackson Decl. 1-2, ECF No. 60-4 (stating that he \u201ccould see everything, including [Jackson\u2019s] private area\u201d and that he \u201ccould see [Mitchell\u2019s] breast\u201d); Thomas-Decl. 1-2, ECF No. 60-5 (stating that he \u201ccould see [Jackson\u2019s] genital area as he walked to the police car parked on the street,\u201d and that he \u201ccould see [Mitchell\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>breast and private area\u201d because \u201c[s]he did not have on any bottoms or anything underneath the jacket\u201d); L. Jackson Decl. 2, ECF No. 60-6 (noting that \u201cCliff [Jackson] did not have on a shirt or underwear\u201d and that \u201c[h]e was fully exposed,\u201d and that he \u201ccould see Megan [Mitchell\u2019s] breast through the sweater she had on\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Once the police car carrying Mitchell arrived at the jail, Mitchell got out of the car, walked through the door, and sat on a bench \u2014 still dressed in only a sweater. At least two male inmates claimed to see her exposed body in the jail. <em>See, e.g., </em>Davis Decl. 1-2, ECF No. 60-2 (\u201cThrough the window I saw Megan Mitchell in a little brown shirt with her breast and genitals exposed. I saw her standing'in the area you are searched at before you entered the jail. The other trustees and I took turns looking out the window at Megan.\u201d). Based on this version of events, we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could find that Mitchell\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated because their seizure and transportation to the jail was unreasonable. <em>See Fortner v. Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir.1993) (recognizing the \u201cconstitutional right to bodily privacy because most people have \u2018a special sense of privacy in their genitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be especially demeaning and humiliating\u201d\u2019 (quoting <em>Lee v. Downs, </em>641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir.1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The Defendants argue that based on a video recording from one of the police cars at the scene, it is <em>beyond dispute </em>that Mitchell\u2019s private areas were not exposed in the sweater because the sweater was buttoned and it extended \u201cconsiderably below the waist area.\u201d They rely on <em>Scott v. Harris, 550 </em>U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), in which the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 127 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">However, this video recording does not \u201cblatantly contradict[ ]\u201d the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. As Officers Whirrell and Maxey admit in their brief, \u201c[t]he DVD is [of] less than optimal quality.\u201d Also, the video only shows Mitchell\u2019s full profile for about six seconds, as she is being walked from the house to the police car. The lighting is. extremely dim, and the footage is grainy. In those brief seconds, it is difficult to tell the extent to which Mitchell is exposed as she walks. And looking at the record images of the sweater taken after the incident, even if the sweater was fully buttoned as the Defendants claim, a reasonable jury could find that Mitchell\u2019s pubic area was nonetheless exposed since the buttons do not secure the bottom of the sweater. Given the lack of clarity, the video footage in this case hardly resolves the question. It is simply one additional piece of evidence the jury may consider to determine Mitchell\u2019s exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Beyond that, although the Defendants admit that Jackson \u201cwas taken to jail without pants,\u201d as confirmed by the video footage, the Defendants argue that they believed \u201cthe appropriate thing to do was to get [Jackson] on into the vehicle\u201d since they had \u201cheated exchanges\u201d with him in the house. In other words, they argue that Jackson\u2019s nudity was justified by the circumstances. But whether any \u201cheated exchanges\u201d justified the officers\u2019 decision to prevent Jackson from wearing pants is precisely the type of fact-specific inquiry that should be left to the jury. We agree with the district court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>[t]he evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs shows that (1) Mitchell was naked except for a sweater that did not cover her private areas; (2) Jackson was naked except for a jacket that did not cover his private areas; (3) before the officers arrested Plaintiffs and escorted them from the house, the officers pointed their flashlights directly at Plaintiffs and looked at their exposed bodies; (4) each Plaintiff asked Defendants for clothes at least twice; and (5) Plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors and jail inmates could see Plaintiffs\u2019 exposed bodies. These facts must be accepted when deciding Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Although a jury may discredit this version of events at trial, we are not at liberty to make that determination on summary judgment. In the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there are genuine issues of material fact about whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Defendants argue that even if there are genuine issues- of material fact about whether the seizure here was unconstitutional, the district court still erred in denying them qualified immunity because no constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident. .Qualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages. <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1696, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). All parties agree that the officers here were engaged in discretionary functions. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s qualified immunity standard, even if \u201ca violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions,\u201d a court must also ask whether the right at issue was \u201cclearly established.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 121 S.Ct. at 2156.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">This Court has recognized three ways that a Plaintiff can show a right was clearly established. \u201cFirst, the plaintiffs may establish that the right was clearly established by pointing to a materially similar case decided by the Supreme Court, this Court, or the [state] Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Terrell v. Smith, </em>668 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). Second, the Plaintiffs \u201calso may show that a constitutional right was clearly established through a broader, clearly established principle that should control the novel facts of the situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted) (alterations adopted). \u201cHowever, the principle must be established with obvious clarity by the case law so that every objectively reasonable government official facing the circumstances would know that the official\u2019s conduct did \u25a0violate federal law when the official acted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cFinally, the words of the pertinent federal statute or federal constitutional provision in some cases will be specific enough to establish clearly the law applicable to particular conduct and circumstances and to overcome qualified immunity, even in the total absence of case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The district court focused primarily on the second avenue, finding \u201ca broad, clearly established principle that individuals who have been placed in police custody have a constitutional right to bodily privacy.\u201d We agree. This Court has recognized this right in at least two cases. In <em>Fortner v. Thomas, </em>we \u201crecognize[ed] a prisoner\u2019s constitutional right to bodily privacy because most people have \u2018a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>sense of privacy in their genitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be especially demeaning and humiliating.\u2019 \u201d 983 F.2d at 1030 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>641 F.2d at 1119); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[W]e now recognize that prisoners retain a constitutional right to bodily privacy.\u201d). And in <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107 (11th Cir.2006), we again affirmed \u201cthe privacy rights of prisoners emphasizing the harm of compelled nudity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1111. These two cases clearly establish the principle that, absent a legitimate reason, individuals maintain a right to bodily privacy, in particular the right not to have their genitals exposed to onlookers.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The Defendants argue that <em>Fortner </em>and <em>Boxer X </em>do not clearly establish that the officers\u2019 conduct in this case was unconstitutional because those two cases dealt with female prison officers who forced male prisoners to expose their private areas. This might be an effective argument if we were relying on the first way to find a clearly established right, which requires providing a \u201cmaterially similar case.\u201d <em>Terrell, </em>668 F.3d at 1256. But the district court followed the second avenue, which requires only a \u201cbroader, clearly established principle that should control the novel facts of [a] situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the district court wisely reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">If convicted prisoners <em>retain </em>a constitutional right to bodily privacy <em>while in jail, </em>then they must have had that right before they were incarcerated, which means that free citizens enjoy at least the same right to bodily privacy. And if a prison guard must have a legitimate reason for impinging an inmate\u2019s right to bodily privacy, then an arresting officer certainly must have a legitimate reason for violating the bodily privacy rights of an arrestee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Indeed, prisoners retained a right to bodily privacy in <em>Fortner </em>even though \u201cwe must give great deference to the decisions of prison officials.\u201d <em>Fortner, </em>983 F.2d at 1029 (citing <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). The rights of arrestees are surely as substantial as those of inmates. Of course, at trial, the jury may determine that the officers here <em>did </em>have a legitimate reason for exposing the Plaintiffs to onlookers in this way. But we may not make that determination for them at the summary-judgment stage. We find it was clearly established at the time of the incident in question that the Plaintiffs had a broad constitutional right to bodily privacy, and that in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could find that the Defendants violated that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The Defendants offer similar arguments to say that they are entitled to official immunity on the Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims. In Georgia, \u201c[p]ublic agents are immune from liability for their discretionary acts unless they are done with malice or intent to injure.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Waldo, </em>309 Ga.App. 108, 709 S.E.2d 278, 281 (2011). \u201c[Ajetual malice requires deliberate intention to do wrong.\u201d <em>City of Atlanta v. Shavers, </em>326 Ga.App. 95, 756 S.E.2d 204, 206 (2014) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted). We agree with the district court that \u201ca jury could conclude that Defendants knew that Plaintiffs were nearly naked and that there was no legitimate purpose for parading them in front of their neighbors and to the jail that way, but Defendants did it anyway.\u201d Thus, for the same reasons we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity on the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of official immunity on the Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"ArjF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for punitive damages under both state and federal law. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51 \u2014 12\u20145.1(b) (allowing punitive damages under Georgia state law where \u201cthe defendant\u2019s actions showed willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious\u2019 indifference to consequences\u201d); <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 51, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1638, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983) (noting, in a \u00a7 1983 case, that a jury may award punitive damages if the defendant\u2019s conduct involved a \u201creckless or callous indifference\u201d to the plaintiffs federally protected rights). As we have said repeatedly, \u201c[n]o matter how egregious the defendant\u2019s conduct, whether to award punitives is left to the factfin-der.\u201d <em>Wright v. Sheppard, </em>919 F.2d 665, 671 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
