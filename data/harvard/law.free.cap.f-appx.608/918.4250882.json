We review the district court\u2019s denial of reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fla. Ass\u2019n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. State of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Rehab. Servs., </em>225 F.3d 1208, 1216 (11th Cir.2000). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Pursuant to Local Rule 7.2(E), \u201cMotions for reconsideration shall not be filed as a matter of routine practice.\u201d Rather, such motions are only appropriate when \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to present: (1) newly discovered evidence; (2) an intervening development or change in controlling law; or (3) a need to correct a clear error of law or fact. <em>Bryan v. Murphy, </em>246 F.Supp.2d 1256, 1258-59 (N.D.Ga.2003). Lexon did not advance any of the foregoing grounds for reconsideration either in this Court or the district court, and as such, Lexon\u2019s appeal is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Lexon is asserting clear error under Rule 7.2(E), we are not persuaded. As the district court observed, Lexon seeks reimbursement of over $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for more than 50 hours spent researching and drafting a 7-page response to Community &amp; Southern Bank\u2019s motion. Lexon\u2019s response merely pointed out the Bank\u2019s obvious failure to comply with Rule ll\u2019s requirements. The district court denied this request as \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d Although we have not decided the issue, several other circuits have held that district courts do not abuse their discretion by wholly denying exorbitant fee applications when an award of fees is permissive, as in the instant case. <em>Andrews v. United States, </em>122 F.3d 1367, 1375 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc. v. Consolidated Equity LLC, </em>428 F.3d 717, 718 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Fair Housing Council of Greater Wash. v. Landow, </em>999 F.2d 92, 96-97 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Lewis v. Kendrick, </em>944 F.2d 949, 956 (1st Cir.1991). Because it is at \u201cat least arguable\u201d that the district court was entitled to deny Lexon\u2019s request outright, the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Battle, </em>272 F.Supp.2d 1354, 1358 (N.D.Ga.2003) (\u201cAn error is not clear and obvious if the legal issues are at least arguable.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
