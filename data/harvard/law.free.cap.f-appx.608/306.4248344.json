Rodriguez-Soto appeals the 37-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for being found unlawfully in the United States after prior removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He contends that his within-guidelines sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Rodriguez-Soto has completed his term of imprisonment, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
