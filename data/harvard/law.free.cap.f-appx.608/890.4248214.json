On appeal, he argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">Our review of the reasonableness of a sentence is a two-step process. First, we ensure that the district court committed no \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">Second, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasizing the \u201cinstitutional advantage\u201d of a district court in determining a sentence (quot\u00e1tion omitted)). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court \u201chas weighed the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553] factors in a manner that demonstrably yields an unreasonable sentence\u201d and \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment ... by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted). Where, as here, the district court imposes a sentence that is within the Guidelines range, we presume that the sentence is substantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>reasonable. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1185 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">To begin, we find no significant procedural error. Mette does not point to any error in the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation. Instead, he argues that the district court did not adequately explain the basis for his 120-month sentence. However, before imposing Mette\u2019s sentence, the court considered the applicable Guidelines range, the appropriate statutory factors, and testimony from Mette and Mette\u2019s family. It also made clear that, in its view, a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate because of Mette\u2019s prior history of violent offenses. Under our Court\u2019s precedent, this explanation is sufficient. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that \u201cthe acknowledgment by the district court that it had considered [the defendant\u2019s] arguments and the sentencing factors of section 3553\u201d was an adequate explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Neither are we left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that Mette\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable given our deferential standard of review. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. Because the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence, we begin with the presumption that Mette\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Mette cannot overcome this presumption. Although he argues that the district court placed too much weight on his prior criminal history, a sentencing court \u201cis permitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (quotation omitted). And as the district court pointed out, Mette\u2019s presentence report reflects a number of arrests and convictions over the past two decades, including convictions for violent offenses. Thus, it was fully within the district court\u2019s discretion to emphasize Mette\u2019s extensive criminal history in concluding that a 120-month sentence was warranted. <em>See e.g., Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1239-40 (affirming an upward variance to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment based primarily on prior criminal conduct); <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>586 F.3d 918, 934-36 (11th Cir.2009) (affirming an upward departure and an upward variance to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment where both the departure and variance were based on prior criminal conduct). Mette has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
