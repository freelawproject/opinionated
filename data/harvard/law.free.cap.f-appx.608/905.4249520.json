Williams alleged that the University advertised a doctorate program in sports psychology with an option' to \u201crespecialize\u201d in counseling; after he completed two years of the sports psychology program, he learned that the University had \u201cterminated\u201d the \u201crespecialization\u201d program and he had to apply to the \u201ccombined counseling and school psychology program\u201d; and, after the University refused \u201cseveral times\u201d to admit him to the combined program, he enrolled elsewhere to \u201cpursue licensure as a psychologist.\u201d The University moved for summary judgment based on state sovereign immunity. The district court ruled that the University was immune from liability for Williams\u2019s claim of breach of contract and that Williams failed timely to notify the University of his claims in tort as required for a waiver of state sovereign immunity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment based on sovereign immunity and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Griesel v. Hamlin, </em>963 F.2d 338, 341 (11th Cir.1992). Summary judgment should be entered when the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The district court did not err when it entered summary judgment in favor of the University and against Williams\u2019s claim of breach of contract. Williams alleged that the University breached its contract to provide an \u201copportunity to pursue a doctoral degree in Sports Psychology with the respecialization in Counseling and School Psychology\u201d and to \u201cbe accepted to the Combined PhD program.\u201d The University, as part of the public university system of Florida, enjoys state sovereign immunity from contractual liability unless the action is based on an \u201cexpress, written contractu into which the state agency has statutory authority to enter,\u201d <em>Pan-Am Tobacco Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>471 So.2d 4, 6 (Fla.1984). <em>See Cnty. of Brevard v. Miorelli Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>703 So.2d 1049, 1051 (Fla.1997) (concluding that sovereign immunity barred recovery for work hot mentioned in a written contract); <em>S. Roadbuilders, Inc. v. Lee Cnty., </em>495 So.2d 189, 190 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986) (same). Williams failed to produce an \u201cexpress, written contract\u201d between himself and the University. Williams argues that his \u201cProgram of Study\u201d constituted a contract, but the document does not require the University to admit Williams to a \u201crespecialization\u201d program or a combined doctorate program. Williams\u2019s claim for breach of contract is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The district court also did not err when it entered summary judgment in favor of the University and against Williams\u2019s claims in tort. The State of Florida, \u201cfor itself and for its agencies or subdivisions, ... waives sovereign immunity for liability for [certain] torts,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.28(1), but \u201c[a]n action may not be instituted on a claim ... unless the claimant presents the claim in writing to the appropriate agency, and ... to the Department of Financial Services within 3 years after such claim accrues,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 768.28(6)(a). Compliance with the notice requirement is a \u201ccondition[ ] precedent to maintaining an action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 768.28(6)(b); <em>see Pub. Health Trust of Miami-Dade Cnty. v. Acanda, </em>71 So.3d 782, 784-85 (Fla.2011). Williams\u2019s claims about misleading advertising, deceptive trade practices, and negligence concerned his inability to respecialize and the refusal of the University to admit him to the combined psychology program. Those claims accrued on November 2, 2009, when Williams received a letter stating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>University had denied his request for reconsideration for admission to the combined program and that the decision was \u201cfinal and there shall be no further appeals.\u201d Williams submitted an affidavit stating that he provided notice to the University in 2013, several months after the statutory deadline expired. Williams argues that his claims accrued in December 2010 when the University dismissed him from the sports psychology doctoral program, but that event is unrelated to his ability to respecialize or obtain a combined degree from the: University. Williams failed to comply with the condition prerequisite to give timely notice to obtain a waiver by the State of its sovereign immunity from damages allegedly attributable to officials of the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the University.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
