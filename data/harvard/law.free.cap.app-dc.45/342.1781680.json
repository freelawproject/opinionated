Within the figure is a picture of a man in overalls, having an arm extended displaying a placard.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">The registration was opposed by the Shull-Day Company, which has a previous registered trademark of \u201cBig 5,\u201d consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ing of a figure \u201c5\u201d in large type within the loop of which is a group of five workmen, in the upper bar of the figure are the words \u201cBig Five\u201d in comparatively small type. The mark was registered August 9, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">It appears, also, that prior to this registration the Bice-Styx Company of St. Louis, Missouri, had registered a trademark \u201cBig 4\u201d for overalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Experts for the Shull-day Company testified that confusion in trade would likely result from the word \u201cBig,\u201d common to both marks, and the similarity of figures \u201c5\u201d and \u201c3.\u201d Experts on behalf of the Levy Overall Manufacturing Company testified to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The Examiner of Interferences thus discussed the evidence of actual confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">He said: \u201cThere is some evidence in behalf of opposer that samples of overalls that were sent out by applicant to certain merchants were disposed of by substituting them for the Big Five overalls of opposer. It appears, however, that this was not the result of any confusion of marks, and that a garment of aiiy other make or brand could have been as easily substituted. The witness Harding testified that on one occasion when he asked for a pair of Big 5 overalls he was handed out a Big 3, and that he did not notice the difference until he opened the package. He does not say, however, that he saw the mark on the garment when he bought it. Furthermore, it appears that when he did take notice of the mark, he saw that it was not a Big 5. There is no evidence, therefore, of any actual confusion having resulted from the concurrent use of the marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">This is an accurate <em>r\u00e9sum\u00e9 </em>of the evidence as to actual confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The Commissioner was of the opinion' that the Eice-Styx Company registration must be taken as prima facie ownership by that company of the word \u201cBig,\u201d and the numeral \u201c4,\u201d and that the case was thereby within the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Liggett &amp; M.
