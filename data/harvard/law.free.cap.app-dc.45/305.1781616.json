In other words, appellant\u2019s contention is that prior to December 23, 1910, the filing date of the present application, appellee always used the word \u201clithia\u201d with the word \u201cbear,\u201d and it therefore has no right to priority in a similar mark from which the word \u201clithia\u201d has been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The word \u201clithia\u201d is merely descriptive, like the words \u201cspring\u201d and \u201cwater.\u201d The dominating feature of the marks is the representation of a bear. It is not material, as affecting the similarity of the marks, whether the word \u201clithia\u201d is inserted or omitted; nor is it important that in one instance a black bear is shown, while in the other it is a polar bear; or whether the word \u201cbear\u201d is printed beside the picture of the bear, or on it. The prominent feature of the mark is the representation of a bear, or its equivalent, the word \u201cbear.\u201d The case is governed by <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Brandau, </em>32 App. D. C. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
