M. Robinson, Norton, &amp; Company to the registration by the Royal Tailors of a mark consisting of a full-length representation of a tiger reclining upon a pedestal, the pedestal having thereon the words \u201cThe Royal Tailors, Chicago-New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The application was filed December 1, 1913, and contains the following disclaimer: \u201cNo claim is made to the words \u2018The,\u2019 \u2018Royal,\u2019 \u2018Tailors,\u2019 \u2018Chicago-New York,\u2019 apart from the mark shown in the drawing.\u201d It is alleged that the mark was used on men\u2019s coats, vests, and trousers since November 19, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The opposition alleged that the J. M. Robinson, Norton, <em>&amp; </em>Company, a corporation, has been for many years, and prior to the year 1892 was, engaged in the business of selling clothing in the city of Louisville, State of Kentucky. That in its business J. M. Robinson, Norton, <em>&amp; </em>Company have adopted the words \u201cTiger Brand\u201d and the representation of a tiger\u2019s head for use upon clothing, and more particularly coats, overcoats, duck coats, and overalls and shirts, and the said Tiger Brand has been used continuously since the year 1891, and has been continuously used for all of said goods since said date, in interstate commerce by opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">It appears that the J. M. Robinson, Norton, &amp; Company registered July 16, 1907, a trademark consisting of a circle showing a tiger\u2019s head therein, with the words \u201cTiger Brand,\u201d trademarks for coats, overcoats, duck coats, vests, trousers, and overalls. December 8, 1903, J. M. Robinson, Norton, <em>&amp; </em>Company registered another trademark consisting of a tiger\u2019s head and the printed word \u201cTiger\u201d above thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The goods specified in the application are not limited to ready-made or made-to-order clothing, and, as stated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Examiner of Interferences, are identical with the goods upon which the opposer has established the nse of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The proof shows that the opposer, while mainly engaged in selling ready-made- clothing, occasionally makes clothing to order from special measurements. It appears that, beginning in 1891, the opposer used as a mark on its goods the word \u201cTiger,\u201d and a full length representation of two tigers pulling in opposite directions at a pair of trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The use of this mark has been discontinued for a number of years, for a mark which was registered as afore described. The opposer advertises its goods in printed catalogues, and calendars, and pictures for hanging in stores, in which it uses the full-length representation of a tiger. The slogan, as expressed by its witnesses, used by the opposer, is \u201cThe Tiger Brand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Both parties have testified they did not know of the use by the other of their respective marks until a short time before the institution of this opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the mark of the applicant sufficiently resembled that of the opposer to produce probable confusion in trade. On appeal the Commissioner affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The evidence on behalf of the applicant shows that subsequently to the adoption and use of the trademark by the I. M. Bobinson, Norton, &amp; Company the applicant adopted as a trademark used upon its goods a figure showing the head and part of the b.ody of a tiger emerging from a hole in the ground, surrounded with certain words. It next used a tiger\u2019s head in a circle surrounded by the words, \u201cThe Boyal Tailors, Chicago-New York.\u201d The open mouth of the tiger carries an inscription which reads, \u201cPay less and dress better.\u201d Its next three labels were of a similar character. It next used a tiger\u2019s head, with the inscription underneath reading, \u201cThe Boyal Tailors, Chicago-New York.\u201d Its last representation, adopted and used in 1918, consists of the mark offered for registration, namely, the full-length recumbent figure of a tiger on a pedestal, and or the pedestal the words \u201cThe Boyal Tailors, Chicago-New York\u201d ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>There is some evidence of confusion in trade resulting from the use of these marks, but we agree with the Commissioner that there is sufficient similarity to cause confusion in the minds of the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As the opinion of the Examiner of Interferences, and the Commissioner contained a full discussion of the matters in controversy, we content ourselves with citing in support of this conclusion the following cases: <em>Re Braadland, </em>37 App. D. C. 602; <em>Carmel Wine Co. </em>v. <em>California Winery, </em>38 App. D. C. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The decision is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
