Hoover, appellee, to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sustained while he was a passenger of the appellant, a common carrier. The declaration was filed October 22, 1909, consisting of two counts. An amended declaration was filed December 1, 1911, adding two further counts, which were later amended January 5, 1914. General issue pleas were filed to each count, issue joined thereon, and a trial had, resulting in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $6,000, upon which judgment was entered, and from which judgment the present appeal is prosecuted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">The learned justice before whom the case was tried correctly stated, in his charge to the jury, the nature of the complaint set forth in the declaration, which was in substance, as follows: On February 13, 1909, the plaintiff, his wife, son, and daughter were passengers for hire on a car of the defendant in Washington, District of Columbia, and, while said car was going easterly on Pennsylvania avenue, it was stopped at a point about midway between Tenth and Ninth streets N. W. to allow passengers thereon so desiring, including the plaintiff and his party, to alight therefrom, and that, while plaintiff, his wife, son, and daughter were in the act of so doing, or endeavoring so to do, and while plaintiff was upon the platform assisting his daughter to alight, said car was negligently and carelessly started, throwing the plaintiff violently from said car to and upon the ground, and severely injuring him, as set forth in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">1. The question of negligence was submitted to the jury under the following instruction, the giving of which was objected to by the defendant and is the subject of the second assignment of error: \u201cIf you find from the testimony that the plaintiff, his wife and his infant son and his infant daughter, were, together as one party of which the plaintiff was the head, received by the defendant as passengers on one of its cars; that the defendant stopped the car in order to enable the said party to alight therefrom; that the plaintiff and his wife thereupon safely alighted from the car, and the plaintiff\u2019s son was in the act of alighting therefrom when the plaintiff discovered that his daughter had not reached the platform of the car in time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>alight therefrom with him; that the plaintiff thereupon again boarded the car, while it was still at rest, in order to assist his daughter in alighting therefrom; that the servants of the defendant in charge of the car either knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, would have known, the situation as thus assumed, and that the plaintiff was in the act of returning to the car for the purpose of seeing that his daughter should safely alight therefrom; and that nevertheless before he could again alight from the car with his daughter, and while he, with his daughter, and while exercising due care in that behalf, was in the act of endeavoring so to alight, the car was started by the defendant\u2019s servants or one of them, in charge thereof, and that by such starting thereof the plaintiff was thrown therefrom to the street and injured, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">Appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error also relate to the same general subject-matter as the second assignment; the third assignment relating to a peremptory instruction requested by appellant, and the fourth assignment relating to a requested instruction by appellant that there could be no recovery by plaintiff unless he had actually taken his daughter <em>\u201cin Ms arms\u201d </em>before the car was started, a limitation not contained in the third and fourth counts of the declaration, which were the counts upon which the case was submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-6\"><em>Mr. G.

The only other question involved in the appeal is that raised by the first assignment of error, relating to the refusal of the learned trial justice to permit counsel for appellant to see and inspect a.paper (exhibit Jackson 2), which was shown by counsel for appellee to the witness Jackson, while upon the witness stand and in the presence of the jury, and identified <em>and also read </em>by the witness, but which was not offered in evidence. The record shows that this occurred at the close of the redirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>examination of the witness (rec. 17-8), and therefore could not have had the effect of refreshing the witness\u2019s recollection or otherwise prejudicing appellant in the direct, cross, or redirect examination of the witness. Moreover, the brief recross-examination of the witness by appellant was of a nature which could not have been affected thereby. While, therefore, no prejudicial error can be predicated in this case upon the failure to permit appellant\u2019s counsel to inspect the paper in question, the correct and safer practice is to permit opposing counsel to see any paper shown to, <em>and read by, </em>a witness while upon the stand, though such is not required where the paper is merely <em>identified, </em>and <em>not read, </em>by the witness. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Chesebrough, 30 </em>Fed. 145, <em>Calderon </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donahue, </em>47 Fed. 39. A door for great abuse would be opened if papers could be shown to, <em>and read by, </em>a witness, and the opposite party kept in ignorance of their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
