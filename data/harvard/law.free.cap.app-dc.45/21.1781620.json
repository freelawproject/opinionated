See <em>Re Fessenden, </em>36 App. D. C. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The patent to Hillyard shows \u00e1 like system in which the lower reservoir is sunk in the earth and the upper one is elevated upon supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The Maxim patent shows the idea of using a difference of surface levels to produce the necessary head to use water pressure for generating electric current.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The patent to Fox shows the use of a natural elevation for storing energy. Water is accumulated during normal operation, and energy is restored to the system by means of a turbo-generator when the ordinary source fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">What the references do not show is the location of the lower reservoir in the deep pit in the earth.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The Examiners in Chief were of the opinion that claims 1 to 6 are not limited to the use of such a pit, and question whether claims 6 and 7, which called for such a pit, would not read on claim 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">As the Patent Commissioner stated, \u201cassuming, however, that the claims are all limited to the location of the lower reservoir in a deep pit, it adds nothing to their patentability, for it is a purely structural idea, and not a process idea. The cycle of operations and the relation of cause and effect in the various steps of the process are exactly the same, whatever the nature of the supports for the water tanks, and whatever their location relative to a selected part of the earth\u2019s surface. The true process disclosed in this case is precisely the process involved in each of the British patents cited.\u201d He further stated: \u201cThe limitation to the structure for performing the process is out of place in these claims. It mal\u00edes them- equivalents in substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>to the apparatus claims of applicant\u2019s companion case, in which such limitations were properly inserted. That case went to the court of appeals, and the corresponding claims were held unpatentable over the same references as are filed herein. The patentability of the idea of locating the lower reservoir for such a system at the bottom of a deep pit having been adjudicated in the apparatus case, to which it properly pertained, and decided against applicant, he cannot now obtain a patent on the same idea by cleverly mingling it with claims to the process inherent in all such systems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We agree with both conclusions of the Commissioner. The claims are properly apparatus claims which were refused in the application in the former case. They undertook to convert into a method what is the simple function of the apparatus in that case. <em>Re </em>Fessenden, 36 App. D. C. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The decision is affirmed, and this decision will be certified to the Commissioner of Patents. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
