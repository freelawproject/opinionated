After setting out the claims, the letter contained the following request: \u201cIn order to determine whether it is necessary to declare an interference, you are requested to obtain a statement from Fowler, setting forth when he conceived the invention defined in the above-quoted claims, when he disclosed it to others, and when he reduced it to practice. This statement will not be made a part of the record and will be returned to you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">Shortly thereafter, on November 23, 1915, petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote the Commissioner, inclosing .the following communication from petitioner: \u201cIn response to your request I beg to say that I conceived the subject-matter of the claim quoted in your letter on or about April 16, 1915, disclosed the same to others, and made drawings on or about the same date, and have not reduced the invention to practice by constructing any full-sized devices\u2019.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">On the same date, petitioner, through his attorney, filed an amendment to his application, inserting the claims suggested in the Commissioner\u2019s letter, with the following statement: \u201cIt is thought that these claims appear in a copending application, and they are inserted at this time with the request that, if such claims do appear in a copending application, an interference be declared.\u201d On December 10, 1915, the Commissioner replied to petitioner\u2019s attorney, as follows: \u201cThe dates of invention claimed by Eowler are subsequent by several months to the filing date of the application of the other party. The other party\u2019s case will be passed to issue as soon as possible, and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>patented will be cited as a reference against such claims in Fowler\u2019s application as it may be found to anticipate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s return to the rule to show cause is based upon the ground that petitioner\u2019s date of conception is several months subsequent to the date on which the other application was filed, and that this finding justifies the Commissioner in refusing to declare an interference.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-5\"><em>Mr. Robert F.

It is urged by counsel for petitioner that, having found the existence of an interference, the Commissioner is without discretion to refuse its declaration. That the finding of an interference is a matter confided to the discretion of the Commissioner was held by this court in <em>United States ex rel. Trussed Concrete Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>42 App. D. C. 179, where the court in its opinion said: \u201cThe determination of the existence of an interference is confided by the statute to the judgment and discretion of the Commissioner of Patents; and whether in the exercise of that judgment in the present case he was night or wrong, the conclusion was a possible one, and is not subject to review by mandamus. <em>United States ex rel. Ness </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>223 U. S. 683, 56 L. ed. 610, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">But we have here a different case. Not only had an interference been found to exist, but the claims in interference were suggested in 'the Commissioner\u2019s letter to petitioner. Section 4904, Pev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a7 9449, defining the procedure in the Patent Office when the Commissioner is of opinion that an interference exists between pending applications, reads as follows: \u201cWhenever an application is made for' a patent which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, .would interfere with any pending application, or with any unexpired patent, he shall give notice thereof to the applicants, or applicant and patentee, as the ease may be, and shall direct the primary examiner to proceed to determine the question of priority of invention. And the Commissioner may issue a patent to the party who is adjudged the prior inventor, unless the adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>party appeals from tlie decision, of the primary examiner, or of the Board of Examiners in Chief, as the case may be, within such time, not less than twenty days, as the Commissioner shall prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Section 483, Bev. Stat. Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a7 745, confers upon the Commissioner of Patents, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, the power to \u201cestablish regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of proceedings in the Patent Office.\u201d In the exercise of this power the following regulations, constituting the rule of procedure in such cases, and having the force of statute while in existence, were promulgated and put in force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c93. An interference is a proceeding instituted for the purpose of determining the question of priority of invention between two or more parties claiming substantially the same patentable invention. The fact that one of the parties has already obtained a patent will not prevent an interference; for, although the Commissioner has no power to cancel a patent, he may grant another patent for the same invention to the person who proves to be the prior inventor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c94. Interferences will be declared in the following cases, when all the parties claim substantially the same patentable invention:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c(1) Between two or more original applications containing conflicting claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The limitations upon the power of courts to control executive or judicial officers by mandamus are well defined. Where official or judicial discretion is reposed in such an officer, the exercise of that discretion cannot be controlled by mandamus. The remedy, however, may be invoked to compel the officer to act. As we have observed, the Commissioner may not be compelled to find the existence of an interference. Neither can he be compelled to decide the issue raised in a particular way. But we are here asked to compel action, \u2014 not to control discretion. Congress has created a statutory right in applicants for patents, when conflict is found by the Commissioner to exist between pending applications in the Patent Office. The mere finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the existence of such a conflict presents an issue which justice demands shall be litigated between the parties. In the case of conflicting applications, Congress has provided a tribunal and procedure for ascertaining who, in fact, is the real inventor and entitled to priority and the patent. The statute is mandatory upon the Commissioner to permit the parties, or either of them, to invoke its aid. The Commissioner has no more power to refuse to put the machinery of the law in operation by declaring an interference and taking jurisdiction of such a case, than this court would have to refuse to take jurisdiction of an appeal taken in accordance with the law and the rules governing its appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The procedure provided by statute for the protection of the rights of the citizen, whether in the courts or in the departments of the government, is mandatory upon the officers charged with its administration. No rule of convenience to avoid delays caused by the great volume of business, or for any other reason, will justify such a departure from the course of procedure defined, as will deprive an appliant for a patent of his statutory rights. It may well be that, in the great majority of cases, a litigant in the position of petitioner cannot possibly prevail in the course of litigation following the declaration of an interference. But it is designed for the protection of the property rights of the small minority who may be found entitled to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u25a0 If the welfare of the public business demands an amendment of the procedure, it is a matter for the legislative department of the government, and not for the executive or judicial departments. The-finding by the Commissioner of the existence of an interference raises an issue between the parties upon which they are entitled to be heard, and the statute points out the remedy. When this stage is reached, the statute provides for an adjudication \u201cto determine the question of priority of invention.\u201d It is not possible for the Commissioner by any short cut he may devise to deprive the applicant of this right. He is required, to put the machinery of the law in operation by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>declaration of the interference as prescribed by the rules. No discretion is reposed in him. The duty is imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">An application for the writ of certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court of the United States November 20, 1916.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
