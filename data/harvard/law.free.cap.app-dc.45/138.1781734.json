Tbe case was beard upon bill, rule to show cause, answer to tbe bill, and return to the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">Appellee, as its name indicates, is a public service corporation, engaged in tbe telephone business in the District of Columbia. In the year 1883, when its subscribers were relatively few, it established what is known as unlimited \u201cflat-rate\u201d business service, under which the subscriber pays a stated sum per year, without reference to the number of calls made. Contracts for such service contain a provision that either party may terminate them after the first year on ten days\u2019 notice. A contract of this sort was entered into on June 29, 1903, with the appellant. In the year 1896 the telephone company also established a schedule of measured or message rates for business service, under which each subscriber pays for the actual service rendered. On June 30, 1904, when there were approximately 8,413 business stations in use in the District, of which 2,730 were on the flat-rate basis, the telephone company ceased entering into further contracts of that sort. In other words, from that time on all new subscribers were required to pay according to the actual service rendered. Through its efforts to eliminate existing flat-rate contracts without friction, the number of these contracts had been reduced, on March 1, 1913,- to 188, covering service to 312 stations, whereas on that date there were approximately 6,900 contracts for business service under the measured standard, covering approximately 21,773 stations. It thus appears that on the date last named no flat-rate contracts had been entered into-by the company for nine years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">On March 4, 1913, the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia was created by Congress (37 Stat. at L. 974, chap. 150). Paragraph 2 of the act reads in part as follows: \u201cThe charge made by any such public utility for any facility or services furnished or rendered, or to be furnished of rendered, shall be reasonable, just, and nondiscriminatory. Every unjust or unreasonable or discriminatory charge for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>facility or service is prohibited and is hereby declared unlawful.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">Under paragraph 24 it is made the duty of every public utility to file with the Commission \u201cschedules, which shall be open to public inspection, showing all rates, tolls, and charges which it has established and which are in force at the time for any service performed by it within the District of Columbia, or for any service in connection therewith or performed by any public utility controlled or operated by it.\u201d This paragraph further provides that \u201cthe rates, tolls, and charges shown on such schedules shall not exceed the rates, tolls, and charges now allowed by law, and shall be the lawful rates, tolls, and charges within the District of Columbia, and shall remain and be in force until set aside by the Commission.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">Paragraph 30 reads as follows: \u201cThat it shall be unlawful for any public utility to charge, demand, collect, or receive a greater or less compensation for any service performed by it within the Distinct of Columbia, or for any service in connection therewith, than is specified in such printed schedules, including schedules of joint rates, as may at the time be in force, or to demand, collect, or receive any rate, toll or charge not specified in such schedules. The rates, tolls, and charges named therein shall be the lawful rates, tolls and charges until the same arc changed as provided in this section.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">Paragraph 81 forbids, under penalty, the charging or collecting of a greater or less compensation for any service rendered \u201cthan that prescribed in the public schedules or tariffs then in force or established as provided herein, or than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person, firm or corporation other than one conducting a like business for a like and contemporaneous service.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">Paragraph 94 reads in part as follows: \u201cThat, first, unless the Commission shall otherwise order, it shall be unlawful for any public utility within the District of Columbia to demand, collect, or receive a greater compensation for any service' than the charge fixed on the lowest schedules of rates for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>service under the law in force at the date of the passage of this section.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">The telephone company seasonably filed with the Commission its regular schedule of rates in force on March 4, 1913, and appended thereto a list of rates which it denominated \u201cobsolete\u201d rates. These so-called obsolete rates embraced the flat-rate contracts for business service, including the contract of appellant. Thereafter, a flat-rate contract subscriber brought to the attention of the Commission that the telephone company desired to cancel the contract, and sought the views of the Commission upon the question whether the continuance in force of the service provided by that contract would constitute a discriminatory act, in violation of the Public Utilities law. Under date of May 4,1914, the Commission, through its chairman, filed an opinion in which it said:- \u201cThe Commission adopts the opinion of its \"general counsel that the flat-rate business service above referred to is discriminatory in the meaning of the law, and that the continuance in force of this and similar contracts discriminates against new subscribers who are refused similar service by the telephone company, and perpetuates the very inequality which the Public Utilities law was enacted to prevent. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the flat-rate business service is unlawful because of such discrimination, and that the telephone company and all persons receiving, this class of service under contracts similar to that referred to are subject to the fines prescribed by the Public Utilities law.\u201d A copy of this opinion was sent to the telephone company. Thereupon, after notice in writing, that company terminated its contract with appellant, offering him measured service under its regular schedules. After receiving a copy of the above opinion of the Commission, appellant, in a communication to the Commission, said: \u201cBecause the telephone company wishes to force its old subscribers having unlimited service to take a measured service and <em>pay a higher rate, </em>you conclude,\u201d etc. In a communication to appellant dated May 18, 1914, the Commission directed attention to the fact that it was then engaged in making such an investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion of public utilities as would enable it intelligently to fix rates, and that before such rates were fixed a public hearing would be held. The communication continues: \u201cFrom this it will appear that while the immediate effect of canceling the unlimited business service in the case of the telephone company may result in increased rates for those who are enjoying this class of service, it does not follow that this condition will continue when rates for telephone service are finally fixed by this Commission.\u201d Thereupon, on July 15, 1914, this bill was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">In its answer the telephone company averred \u201cthat the said obsolete or flat rate is unfair and discriminatory as against the great majority of its business subscribers who are and for many years have been paying the regular standard measured or message rates.\u201d The answer admitted that these flat rates were the lowest rates in existence prior to March 1, 1913, but denied that under the law said flat rate was the lawful, nondiscriminatory rate, and averred that said rate \u201cwas the favored and discriminatory rate at the time of the passage of said act of March 4, 1913, and by the express terms of said act made unlawful by reason of such discrimination.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-6\"><em>Mr. E.

The argument is that the amount paid under that contract constituted the lowest rate in force for that class of service when the act was passed. The telephone company answers that the act continued in force <em>current </em>rates only, and not rates no longer open to the public; in other words, that the contract with the appellant was special and discriminatory in character and hence expressly prohibited by said act. The view of the company was adopted by the learned trial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The above act requires every public utility to file with the Commission schedules of all rates, tolls, and charges \u201cwhich it has established and which are in force at the time.\u201d Such rates, tolls, and charges, unless they contravene some express statute, are declared to be the lawful rates, tolls, and charges within the District of Columbia until set aside by the Commission. What was the purpose of this provision? Was it intended thereby to continue in force the regular schedule of rates which had been available to all, or was it intended to discontinue those rates for the time being, and establish in their stead rates which for nine years had not been available to the general public, but which had been enjoyed by a favored few who constituted a special class ? Obviously, both schedules may not subsist, for it is averred on the one hand and conceded on the other that the amounts paid under these special contracts are less than would be the charges under the regular schedules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>As the main purpose of the act was to prevent discrimination, it is apparent that two fundamentally different schedules of charges for the same service may not exist under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">For nine years prior to the passage of this act new subscribers had been discriminated against, for the only schedule open to them for this class of service was the regular or measured service schedule. That schedule was known to all, but neither the public nor Congress knew whether the telephone company had entered into special contracts. In other words, it was not known whether all were treated alike, so that each should bear his just proportion of the cost of a given service. Was it not, therefore, one great object of Congress in this legislation to turn the light into dark places, to the end that all discrimination might be terminated? Adopting this view, it becomes reasonably certain that Congress intended to continue in force, for the time being, the regular current rates, and not such rates as were special and discriminatory. As was well stated by the Utilities Commission: \u201cWhile the immediate</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">effect of canceling the unlimited business service in the case of the telephone company may' result -in increased rates for those who are enjoying this class of service, it does not follow that this condition will continue when rates for telephone service are finally fixed by the Commission.\u201d Being of the opinion that, until the Commission does act, the regular schedules are in force, we affirm the decree, with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
