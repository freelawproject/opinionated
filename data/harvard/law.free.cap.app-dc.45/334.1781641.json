It therefore is a Delaware corporation, but its principal place of business is in the District of Columbia, where reside many of its stockholders. In the summer of 1913 the company became financially embarrassed, and all its activities ceased. The American National Bank of Bichmond, Virginia, as assignee of a creditor of the company, brought a suit in the supreme court of the District against it. Foreclosure proceedings were commenced about the same time, which resulted in loss to the company of all its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tangible property, except some structural steel which had been manufactured for the hotel building' by the American Bridge Company, and shipped here for that purpose. Thereupon the American National Bank, on February 17, 1914, on its own behalf as well as on behalf of all other creditors who might come in, filed a bill in equity alleging the insolvency of the company and the other facts above mentioned. The bill prayed the appointment of a receiver of all the assets of the corporation, especially the structural steel and unpaid stock subscriptions, for a reference to take account of the assets and liabilities and that portion of the capital stock that had not been paid for, and for directions to the receiver to take steps to enforce the collection thereof. Before action had been taken on this bill, Charles P. Taft, a stockholder, filed another bill in which, among other things, he sought the acceptance as advantageous to the stockholders and creditors of the offer of the American Bridge Company to take bade the structural steel above mentioned, and cancel its claim against the hotel company. The hotel company answered the Taft bill, and admitted its insolvency and the advisability of appointing a receiver with authority to accept the offer of the American Bridge Company. Thereupon the John W. Cooney Company, a judgment creditor,'filed a petition for leave to intervene. The two causes were heard together, and appellants, Aulick Palmer and Peyton Gordon, were appointed receivers of all the property, assets, choses in action, claims, and d\u00e9mands belonging to, due to, or held in trust for, the Arlington Hotel Company, wheresoever the same might be situated, including the evidences of debt and stock subscriptions. They also were directed to take possession of all the company\u2019s vouchers, evidences of debt and stock subscriptions, and to institute such proceedings as might be necessary to recover the possession thereof, and \u201cto enforce and collect any unpaid subscriptions ma.de to the capital stock of said defendant.\u201d The decree further provided that the cause should be referred to a special auditor to ascertain the assets and liabilities of the company, \u201cincluding all amounts, if any, which remain unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>upon subscriptions to its capital stock.\u201d A special auditor was appointed, who proceeded with his reference and in his report stated the total indebtedness of the company. The assets were stated as $28,311.55 cash, the proceeds of the sale of said structural steel (the offer of the bridge company to take it back having been rejected), and $481,600 unpaid balance due on subscriptions to preferred stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">Thereupon appellants filed the petition herein against all of the persons appearing by the books of the company to be holders of preferred or common stock not fully paid for, and praying, among other things, that an assessment might be made against the stockholders who might be served with process, or who had appeared or might appear, requiring them to pay their full liability on their stock, if necessary, in order to pay the debts of the corporation; that the liability of all persons receiving what on its face purported to be full paid and nonassessable stock as a bonus, without full consideration, should be determined and required to be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">A rule to show cause was served upon all the holders of preferred and common stock in the District of Columbia, who appeared specially and moved to dismiss the bill. A hearing was had, and the court ruled that \u201cthe defendant company are entitled to have an adjudication of liability binding on all the stockholders, and this can be obtained only in the courts of Delaware,\u201d and therefore dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>Mr. Henry H.

As pointed out by counsel for appellants, this motion was not made until more than three months after the printing of the record, and until after appellees had obtained ah extension of time to file their briefs upon the merits. We agree with appellants that the allowance of this appeal by the learned trial justice and the approval of the appeal bond \u201cis equivalent to leave by the court to the receiver to take an appeal.\u201d <em>Farlow </em>v. Kelley, 131 U. S. appx. cci, and 26 L. ed. 427. The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Since no local statute is applicable, as in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Matthiessen, </em>232 U. S. 221, 58 L. ed. 577, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 312, the law of Delaware,' by which this corporation was created, governs in measuring and enforcing the liability of a stockholder. <em>Converse </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>224 U. S. 243, 56 L. ed. 749, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; <em>Royal Arcanum </em>v. Green, 237 U. S. 531, 59 L. ed. 1089, L.R.A. 1916A, 771, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724. Section 20 of the general incorporation law of that state declares that \u201cwhen the whole capital stock of a corporation shall not have been paid in, and the assets shall be insufficient to satisfy the claim of its creditors, each stockholder shall be bound to pay on each share held by him the sum necessary to complete the amount of the par value of such share as fixed by the charter of the company or its certificate of incorporation, or such proportion of that sum as shall be required to satisfy the debts of the company.\u201d [Del. Rev. Code 1915, \u00a7 1934.] It is further provided that this sum or proportion may be recovered as provided for in sec. 49 of the same act, \u201cafter a writ of execution against the corporation has been returned unsatisfied as provided for in section 51 of this act.\u201d Section 51- ordains that no suit shall be brought against any director or stockholder for any debt of a corporation of which he is such director or stockholder, \u201cuntil judgment be obtained therefor against such corporation and execution thereon re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>turned, not satisfied.\u201d Paragraph 7 of section 2 of the act defining the powers of a corporation provides that it may dissolve itself or be wound up and dissolved \u201cin the manner hereinafter mentioned.\u201d Section 43 provides for the appointment of trustees or receivers when any corporation shall be dissolved \u201cin any manner whatever.\u201d Section 44 gives the court of chancery jurisdiction of such proceedings, and section 45 provides that said trustees or receivers, after payment of all allowances, expenses, and costs and the satisfaction of all special and general liens upon the funds of the corporation, \u201cshall pay the other debts due from the corporation, if the funds in their hands shall be sufficient therefor, and, if not, they shall distribute the same ratably among all the creditors who shall prove their debts in the manner that shall be directed by an order or decree of the court for that purpose.\u201d Section 53 requires all creditors to make proof under oath of their respective claims against the corporation within a time specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>New Keystone Copper Co. </em>\u2014 Del. \u2014, 93 Atl. 380 (Feb. 2, 1915), it was ruled that \u201ca distribution of all the assets (of the corporation) would clearly be a winding up which could be done legally only in the method provided by law.\u201d There is one jurisdiction only, that wherein this corporation was created, where a decree binding all the stockholders may be entered \u201cagainst the corporation in a suit brought against it under the State law for the purpose of ascertaining its insolvency, compelling its liquidation, collecting sums due by stockholders for subscriptions to stock, and paying the debts of the corporation.\u201d <em>Royal - Arcanum </em>v. Green, 237 U. S. 531, 544, 59 L. ed. 1089, 1101, L.R.A. 1916A, 771, 35 Sup, Ct. Rep. 724. In that jurisdiction, by subscribing to stock, they conferred on the corporation authority to represent them, whether they be residents or nonresidents, and such representation binds them. \u2022 In <em>Selig </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>234 U. S. 652, 58 L. ed. 1518, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 926, an action was brought in New York to enforce the liability of a stockholder of an insolvent Minnesota corporation, an assessment having been made against him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Minnesota. \u2022 It was ruled that, the order levying the assessment being conclusive as to all matters relating to the amount and propriety thereof and the necessity therefor, the stockholder is limited in his defenses to showing that he is not a stockholder, or is not the holder of as many shares as alleged, or has a claim agaist the corporation which in law or in equity he is entitled to set off against the assessment, or has any other defenses personal to himself. In the course of its opinion the court said: \u201cThe marshaling of the amounts recovered from stockholders is also the appropriate subject for the consideration of the court which under the statute collects and distributes the fund. It is quite obvious that another court, in an action by the receiver against the' stockholder, could not undertake to fix the amount required to pay the debts for which the stockholder is liable, unless it virtually assumed the duty imposed by the statute of determining what a ratable assessment should be, and thus denied due credit to the determination already made in a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We are of the opinion that this is, in, substance and effect, an attempt to wind up a Delaware corporation in the District of Columbia, and as this may be done only in Delaware, where all the stockholders may be brought in and the ratable assessment of each determined, the decree must be affirmed, with costs;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
