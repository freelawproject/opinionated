Following a jury trial in the circuit court of Macon County, a verdict was returned in favor of Snelson and against Kamm and St. Mary\u2019s in the amount of $7 million. After a hearing on defendants\u2019 posttrial motions, the trial court granted St. Mary\u2019s a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) on the issue of proximate cause and granted Kamm a new trial on the issue of damages, setting aside the $7 million award. The appellate court consolidated the separate appeals by Snelson and Kamm, and affirmed the orders of the trial court. 319 Ill. App. 3d 116. We allowed Snelson\u2019s and Kamm\u2019s petitions for leave to appeal (177 Ill. 2d R. 315) and also consolidated the appeals.</p> <p id=\"b22-5\" pgmap=\"22\">Before this court, Snelson contends that the trial court erred by: (1) granting Kamm a new trial on the issue of damages; and (2) granting St. Mary\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. Kamm challenges certain of the trial court\u2019s rulings and the jury\u2019s verdict. Specifically, Kamm claims: (1) he was improperly prevented from examining Snelson\u2019s medical expert as to bias; (2) the testimony of Snelson\u2019s medical expert should not have been admitted, because it lacked foundation; (3) the jury was improperly instructed; (4) certain medical bills of Snelson\u2019s were improperly admitted into evidence; (5) the verdict was tainted by extraneous information; (6) the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (7) the verdict is excessive.</p> <p id=\"b22-6\" pgmap=\"22\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b22-7\" pgmap=\"22(148) 23(69)\">At the June 1999 jury trial, the following evidence was adduced. In March 1994, Snelson was 58 years old and employed as a clerk by the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. Snelson was referred to Kamm, a general surgeon, who suggested that Snelson undergo a radiological procedure known as an aortogram or arteriogram, to determine the location of arterial blockages in his legs caused by arteriosclerosis, commonly referred to as hardening of the arteries. Dr. Carlos Capati, a radiologist practicing at St. Mary\u2019s, testified that, on March 2, 1999, while attempting to perform a translumbar aortogram on Snelson, he experienced difficulty navigating the guide wire into the thoracic aorta. It appeared that the guide wire instead entered the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies blood to the intestine. Capati withdrew the translumbar needle and the guide wire and attempted to reinsert the guide wire into the aorta. During the second attempt, however, Snelson\u2019s blood pressure dropped, he complained of abdominal and back pain and expressed an urge to have a bowel movement. A portable commode was brought in and Capati examined Snelson\u2019s stool, but did not notice any discoloration. At that point, Capati terminated the procedure and informed Kamm that he had been unable to complete the test and that Snelson was complaining of back and abdominal pain.</p> <p id=\"b23-5\" pgmap=\"23\">Snelson\u2019s son, James Snelson, testified that following the unsuccessful aortogram, he saw his father being brought back to his room on a stretcher, \u201cscreaming and yelling.\u201d Once in his bed, Snelson began complaining of \u201ca lot of pain in his stomach.\u201d He was lying on his side \u201cin a fetal position\u201d with his eyes closed and was sweating profusely. Snelson also complained of pressure in his stomach and the need to use the bathroom. James stated that he went to the nurses\u2019 station and told them that his father needed a catheter and one was provided at about 3 or 3:30 p.m. James testified that he left St. Mary\u2019s late that afternoon to care for his mother and, prior to his departure, did not see Kamm visit his father. James stated that he spoke to his father by telephone that evening at approximately 8 p.m., and that his father still complained of pain and was not making sense.</p> <p id=\"b23-6\" pgmap=\"23(116) 24(66)\">The nurses on staff at St. Mary\u2019s on March 2 and 3, 1994, recorded notes on Snelson\u2019s condition, but none who testified at trial had any independent recollection of the events. The nurses\u2019 notes indicate that, following the unsuccessful aortogram, Snelson was returned to his room at 12:40 p.m. He was complaining of pain in his abdomen and cramping and requested a bedside commode. A 12:44 p.m. shift assessment showed that Snelson was alert and complaining of pain. According to the nurses\u2019 notes, the pain rated \u201c7\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10. At 12:45 p.m., Snelson had a large bowel movement and continued to complain of severe pain across the middle of his abdomen radiating into his back. At this point, the nurses notified Kamm of Snelson\u2019s complaints of abdominal pain. In response, Kamm ordered by phone that Snelson receive blood tests and pain medication, 50 milligrams Demerol by muscular injection, every three hours as needed. Kamm also ordered that Snelson\u2019s vital signs be taken every 15 minutes for two hours and then hourly thereafter.</p> <p id=\"b24-5\" pgmap=\"24\">Snelson\u2019s vital signs were then checked every 15 minutes from 12:45 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. During this period, plaintiffs temperature stayed below normal, his respirations were normal and remained constant. His pulse rose during the first hour and then fell back to normal the second hour, while his blood pressure dropped and rose throughout the period.</p> <p id=\"b24-6\" pgmap=\"24\">The nurses charted in their flow sheet that a catheter was inserted to empty Snelson\u2019s bladder around 3 p.m. A second shift assessment at 3:35 p.m. showed Snelson\u2019s bowel sounds were normal, but he continued to complain of abdominal pain. At 4 p.m., Snelson had a bowel movement with blood-tinged mucous. The nurses immediately paged Dr. Kamm, and were advised that he was in surgery at another hospital. Kamm called back at 4:30 p.m. and was advised by a nurse of the bloody bowel movement. Kamm testified that he spoke with the nurse about Snelson\u2019s condition at 4:30 p.m., and concluded that the bloody stool was due to a mild hemorrhoid or fissure. Kamm told the nurse he would quickly conclude his duties at the other hospital and would proceed directly to St. Mary\u2019s.</p> <p id=\"b24-7\" pgmap=\"24(54) 25(106)\">At 6 p.m., Kamm arrived at St. Mary\u2019s and examined Snelson for 15 or 20 minutes. At this time, Kamm had access to the nurses\u2019 notes, shift assessments, flow sheets and vital sign records which had recorded Snelson\u2019s condition. Kamm noted that Snelson\u2019s vital signs were stable, but he had passed several small blood-tinged stools and was complaining of abdominal pain and difficulty urinating. Kamm found that Snelson\u2019s lower abdomen was tender and distended, with diminished bowel sounds. Kamm\u2019s notes further state the following: \u201cConcerned about mesenteric insufficiency or thromboembolus with ischemia. Will watch closely.\u201d Kamm testified that he was not making a diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia, or deficiency of blood circulation to the intestinal system, but rather was \u201centertaining [it] as a one of the rare possibilities\u201d of arteriographie puncture complications. Rather, at the time, Kamm thought that the most likely cause of Snelson\u2019s pain was bleeding into his retroperitoneal area from the puncture sites.</p> <p id=\"b25-5\" pgmap=\"25\">Because Kamm believed that the fullness and tenderness in Snelson\u2019s lower abdomen was consistent with a distended bladder, he ordered a catheter inserted. Kamm noted that the catheter caused considerable relief in Snelson\u2019s discomfort at that point. Kamm believed that the catheter inserted after his 6 p.m. examination was the first time a catheter had been used on Snelson. However, the nurses\u2019 flow sheet, which Kamm had available to him at the 6 p.m. examination, indicated that a catheter had been inserted at 3 p.m. Kamm acknowledged that a catheter could have been ordered before he arrived as part of a postoperative order. At any rate, it was undisputed that the catheter brought pressure relief and lessened Snelson\u2019s discomfort.</p> <p id=\"b25-6\" pgmap=\"25\">Kamm further testified that, based on his 6 p.m. assessment, he believed Snelson\u2019s condition had stabilized, and that it was therefore safe to increase his pain medication from 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams of Demerol every four hours as needed. He further ordered that Snelson have no food or liquids by mouth, that the nurses check his vital signs every four hours, and that some laboratory work be completed for the next morning. Kamm then left St. Mary\u2019s for the evening.</p> <p id=\"b26-4\" pgmap=\"26\">After Kamm\u2019s examination, the nurses observed Snelson at least every hour. A nurse\u2019s notation for that evening indicates that Snelson had a normal bowel movement and received Demerol at 7 p.m. It was also noted that Snelson slept most of the evening. He was awake at 10 p.m., but was back asleep at 11 p.m. No documentation exists showing that Snelson\u2019s vital signs were taken at 10 p.m.</p> <p id=\"b26-5\" pgmap=\"26\">Kamm conferred with the nurses before he went to bed around 10 p.m. and was advised that Snelson was stable and that they had nothing new to report. At midnight, Snelson\u2019s vital signs were taken. The section in the shift assessment to indicate level of pain was not marked at that time. St. Mary\u2019s nurse Belinda Durbin testified that at 12:45 a.m. on March 3, she administered 100 milligrams of Demerol to Snelson because he was having some pain. She further noted, however, that if he had been experiencing severe pain she would have made a notation of that fact in the records. At 4 a.m., Snelson\u2019s vital signs were taken again.</p> <p id=\"b26-6\" pgmap=\"26(144) 27(24)\">Kamm returned to the hospital on March 3, 1994, and examined Snelson between 6 and 6:30 a.m. It appeared to Kamm that Snelson had not improved over the prior 18 hours, and he had an abnormally high white blood cell count. Over the next four hours, a computerized tomography (CT) scan and abdominal X rays were taken, which showed definite abnormalities, including the presence of air in Snelson\u2019s small intestine. Capati, who interpreted the CT scan and X rays, testified that the results were consistent with \u201csmall and large bowel infarction,\u201d which meant that parts of Snelson\u2019s small and large bowel loops were gangrenous or dead. Capati further testified that the most likely cause of that condition was \u201cacute embolism and thrombosis involving the superior mesenteric artery,\u201d meaning that a plaque or clot moving within the blood vessel, or a preexisting plaque or clot, had blocked the superior mesenteric artery. Capati opined that the unsuccessful translumbar aortogram caused the death of portions of Snelson\u2019s intestine.</p> <p id=\"b27-5\" pgmap=\"27\">Kamm performed emergency exploratory surgery on Snelson later that morning and found that almost all of his small intestine and half of his large intestine were dead due to lack of blood circulation to the area. It was therefore necessary to remove approximately 95% of Snelson\u2019s small intestine and the right half of his large intestine. Snelson was discharged from St. Mary\u2019s on March 21, 1994.</p> <p id=\"b27-6\" pgmap=\"27\">With regard to this cause of action, Kamm testified that the nurses had adequately observed Snelson and reported to him everything that he needed to know about Snelson\u2019s condition following the unsuccessful aortogram. He further stated that, if he had wanted to perform surgery sooner, he would have; however, he did not think it was indicated. On cross-examination, Kamm admitted that, as with any disease, there are signs and symptoms, and that 80% of patients with mesenteric insufficiency will exhibit abdominal pain often described as out of proportion to the physical findings. He further agreed that blood in the stool can be considered a sign of mesenteric ischemia and that occult blood, not detectible by mere sight, could be found in 75% of such cases.</p> <p id=\"b27-7\" pgmap=\"27(87) 28(119)\">Dr. James Sarnelle, Snelson\u2019s medical expert, testified that he is a general and vascular surgeon familiar with intestinal surgery and the translumbar arteriogram procedure, including its risks and complications. Sarnelle opined that, during Snelson\u2019s unsuccessful arteriogram, the guide wire had injured the lining of the superior mesenteric artery, which caused a blood clot to form and, \u201c[o]ver time,\u201d led to the death of the intestines from a loss of circulation. Sarnelle testified that he was familiar with the national standard of care for a reasonably well-qualified general surgeon as it related to a patient in Snelson\u2019s condition on March 2, 1994, and opined that Kamm\u2019s treatment of Snelson following the unsuccessful arteriogram breached the standard of care because Kamm \u201cdid not take any action which was necessary to save [Snelson\u2019s] small bowel.\u201d Sarnelle reasoned: \u201c[Snelson] has all the signs of mesenteric ischemia. In fact, [Kamm] even mentions it in his note at 6 o\u2019clock that he is concerned about ischemia or thrombosis and yet he does nothing, just says will watch closely.\u201d According to Sarnelle, Kamm should not have been watching Snelson closely but instead should have immediately performed surgery to restore circulation, which would have saved a large portion of Snelson\u2019s intestine.</p> <p id=\"b28-5\" pgmap=\"28\">According to Sarnelle, the following signs and symptoms should have alerted Kamm to the mesenteric ischemia: (1) Capati\u2019s indication that during the unsuccessful arteriogram the guide fine went into the superior mesenteric artery; (2) Snelson\u2019s drop in blood pressure and abdominal pain during the procedure; (3) Snelson\u2019s need to have an immediate bowel movement during the procedure; (4) the bloody bowel movements following the procedure; (5) abdominal pain that was severe enough for Kamm to increase the Demerol; and (6) the distention and tenderness of Snelson\u2019s lower abdomen during Kamm\u2019s 6 p.m. examination.</p> <p id=\"b28-6\" pgmap=\"28(89) 29(59)\">Sarnelle further opined that \u201ca window of opportunity\u201d existed to prevent the permanent loss of Snelson\u2019s intestine. At 6 p.m., Snelson was stable enough to have surgery, and Sarnelle testified that, if revascularization surgery had been performed in a timely fashion on March 2, a large portion of Snelson\u2019s intestine could have been salvaged and he would not now be dependent on intravenous supplemental nutrition. Sarnelle testified that the latest point in time that Snelson\u2019s intestines could have been saved was midnight on March 2, and \u201cafter that it was too late.\u201d Sarnelle explained that, while the length of time that intestines will remain viable once blood supply is lost is variable from patient to patient and cannot be determined with 100% certainty, based on the clinical data contained in Snelson\u2019s medical records, the latest time his intestine could have been saved was around midnight.</p> <p id=\"b29-5\" pgmap=\"29\">Sarnelle acknowledged that, generally, acute mesenteric ischemia is very difficult to diagnose because the typical patient has an onset of abdominal pain with no clear history of causation. Additionally, the typical patient is elderly and has trouble communicating. However, Sarnelle testified that Snelson\u2019s case was different because, unlike the typical patient who is admitted to the hospital several hours after the onset of pain: (1) Snelson was in the hospital at the time the ischemia began; (2) the problems that developed during the unsuccessful arteriogram involved the superior mesenteric artery; and (3) Snelson developed signs and symptoms quickly and did not just arrive at the hospital with \u201csome obscure things going on.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b29-6\" pgmap=\"29\">Sarnelle opined that Kamm breached the appropriate standard of care by ordering pain medication for Snelson. In that regard, Sarnelle stated the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b29-7\" pgmap=\"29\">\u201c[Y]ou should not be giving a patient pain medicine if you do not know what is going on. The problem with the pain medicine is that you mask the findings, the person may have a lot of problems going on in their abdomen, especially mesenteric ischemia you may give pain medicine and they could feel somewhat better, and you don\u2019t know whether they are really getting better or I am just thinking they are feeling better yet a catastrophe is brewing.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b29-8\" pgmap=\"29\">Finally, Sarnelle acknowledged that he has been involved in approximately 200 medical malpractice cases as a consulting expert and witness, testifying at trial about 20 times, and in all of those cases he represented the plaintiffs. Sarnelle offered no opinion regarding the conduct of St. Mary\u2019s nursing staff.</p> <p id=\"b30-4\" pgmap=\"30\">On cross-examination, Sarnelle acknowledged that, depending on the cause of mesenteric ischemia, it can sometimes take days for a reasonably well-qualified surgeon to diagnose that death of the bowels has occurred. Sarnelle also admitted that the medical literature does not set out certain symptoms as \u201cclassic,\u201d but explained that the literature does not differentiate between arteriogram-induced mesenteric ischemia and other types, instead looking at \u201call comers.\u201d Sarnelle testified that he has performed intestinal revascularization surgery twice in his career, with one patient living and one dying. He estimated the mortality rate for such surgery to be more than 50%.</p> <p id=\"b30-5\" pgmap=\"30\">Grace McCallum, Snelson\u2019s nursing expert, testified that nurses are taught and practice the \u201cnursing process,\u201d which is a critical thinking process that defines the standard of care that a nurse should follow. McCallum opined that the nursing process was not followed by the St. Mary\u2019s nursing staff on March 2, 1994, as evidenced by: (1) the failure to initiate a nursing care plan for Snelson; (2) the failure to request that another physician examine Snelson on the afternoon of March 2, when Kamm was unavailable and Snelson was experiencing abdominal pain; (3) the failure to request a physician after Snelson had a bloody bowel movement at 4 p.m.; (4) the failure to perform a new abdominal assessment following the bloody bowel movement; (5) the failure to document the effectiveness of the pain medication Demerol; (6) the lack of nursing notes regarding Kamm\u2019s 6 p.m. examination; (7) the failure to check all ordered vital signs during the evening of March 2; and (8) the failure to call Kamm after checking Snelson\u2019s vital signs around midnight on March 2. McCallum further opined that the failure to follow the nursing process increases the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. However, Mc-Callum testified that she had no opinion as to the proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury.</p> <p id=\"b31-4\" pgmap=\"31\">Dr. William Pyle, a cardiac, vascular and thoracic surgeon, was one of two medical experts presented by Kamm. Pyle testified that mesenteric ischemia is difficult to diagnose and that the ultimate mortality rate for patients suffering a mesenteric infarction is \u201cin excess of 90 percent.\u201d Pyle opined that Kamm met the standard of care in his treatment of Snelson, explaining that, contrary to the assertions of Sarnelle, \u201cthere weren\u2019t enough findings or symptoms to justify surgery\u201d on March 2. Indeed, after reading the radiologist\u2019s description of the procedure, Pyle believed that an internal dissection of the mesenteric artery occurred, rendering the artery like \u201cwet tissue paper,\u201d and making revascularization impossible. Pyle noted that revascularization surgery was also not an option if the guide wire inserted during the arteriogram had produced a \u201cshowering\u201d of small pieces of plaque and debris which gradually plugged up the artery.</p> <p id=\"b31-5\" pgmap=\"31(152) 32(23)\">Pyle further opined that Kamm complied with the standard of care in prescribing pain medication to Snelson, testifying that the doses were not high and that, in his experience, patients with mesenteric ischemia have excruciating pain that is intractable to pain medication. Pyle stated that, regardless of what caused the ischemia and regardless of when the revascularization surgery occurred, Snelson\u2019s intestines most likely could not have been saved. On cross-examination, Pyle agreed that abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical examination findings is present in many people with mesenteric ischemia. Other symptoms may be abdominal distension and the urge to have a bowel movement, and findings may include blood in the stools. Pyle believed that Kamm\u2019s concern about mesenteric insufficiency at 6 p.m. was appropriate because Snelson was then exhibiting some of the signs and symptoms of the condition. Pyle also agreed that revascularization was a known and practiced technique and that, if possible causes of ischemia other than dissection were considered, the probability of revascularization existed, but was low.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32\">Dr. Philip Donahue, a general surgeon testifying as Kamm\u2019s other medical expert, also concluded that Kamm did not breach the standard of care in his treatment of Snelson by failing to diagnose mesenteric ischemia, prescribing pain medication or failing to perform revascularization surgery on March 2, 1994. Donahue opined that earlier surgery was not warranted because, on the afternoon of March 2, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of acute mesenteric ischemia, just a patient \u201cwith some nonspecific complaints.\u201d While Donahue testified it was \u201ca possibility\u201d that the superior mesenteric artery was totally blocked immediately following the arteriogram, he believed that it had occluded over time, basing his opinion, in part, on the fact that Snelson\u2019s pain diminished after the catheterization and overnight but reemerged in the early morning.</p> <p id=\"b32-6\" pgmap=\"32\">Mary Delaney, St. Mary\u2019s nursing expert, testified that she was familiar with the standard of care applicable to nurses under circumstances similar to those involved here. Delaney opined that the nurses at St. Mary\u2019s did not violate the standard of care in treating or monitoring Snelson.</p> <p id=\"b32-7\" pgmap=\"32(99) 33(119)\">On the issue of damages, Snelson presented, inter alia, his own testimony and that of his treating physician, Dr. Robert Newlin. Newlin testified that the function of the small intestine is to do a significant part of the digestion of food. As a result of the March 3, 1994, surgery during which 95% of his small intestine was removed, Snelson suffers from \u201cshort bowel syndrome,\u201d a condition which creates diarrhea and a lack of ability to absorb sufficient nutrition and calories. Snelson must therefore rely on hyperalimentation, the intravenous infusion of a solution containing sufficient nutrients to sustain him. The solution is infused into a vein in Snelson\u2019s upper chest through a catheter; the catheter is attached to a small machine that injects the nutrition directly into his body. The catheter is a foreign body and bacteria can easily grow on it. Snelson has therefore suffered repeated infections of his catheter site, some of which required hospitalization. Newlin opined that Snelson will continue to suffer from diarrhea and require hyperalimentation for the rest of his life. While Newlin could not say that Snelson\u2019s short bowel syndrome had reduced his life expectancy \u201cto a great degree,\u201d due to his \u201cvarious problems,\u201d including preexisting diabetes and arteriosclerosis, Snelson \u201ccould live another ten years.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33(211) 34(10)\">Snelson testified that, after his release from the hospital, he took medical retirement from the railroad. He must be attached to the hyperalimentation device for 12 hours each day, usually from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. When he unhooks the device, he must be close to a bathroom and remain there for 1 to IV2 hours. Snelson testified that he suffers from chronic diarrhea and must use the bathroom 15 to 20 times each day, consuming most of his waking hours. The hyperalimentation bag weighs between 10 and 15 pounds and must be kept refrigerated. There are numerous steps which must be taken to prepare the bag on a daily basis, including the entering of nutrients and vitamins; the preparation takes 20 to 30 minutes to perform. Sometimes the nutrient solution causes him pain as it enters the catheter, and he requires help from family members to maintain the catheter and catheter site. Snelson has spent a total of almost IV2 years in the hospital since June 1994, mostly for infections of his catheter site. A typical infection which leads to a hospital stay for a catheter change involves chills, a high fever and vomiting. He has had his catheter changed approximately 20 times; the catheter removal can be painful, as are the intravenous antibiotics used for these infections.</p> <p id=\"b34-3\" pgmap=\"34\">Snelson further testified that, because of the hyperalimentation, he must \u201cpretty well stay at home.\u201d Although he can eat regular food, the portions must be small and he cannot eat certain foods, such as salad, green beans or corn, or even enjoy his favorite drink, Kool-Aid, because those items are eliminated by his body quickly and mostly unchanged. Snelson acknowledged that, even before the March 3, 1994, surgery, the arteriosclerosis made it hard to walk, restricting his ability to engage in daily activities. Snelson stated that he still hunts and travels to Minnesota to fish and to Indiana to see his daughter. However, if he chooses to do anything during the day, he must be attached to the bag during that time and then have the elimination process occur at night, possibly resulting in his soiling himself in bed.</p> <p id=\"b34-4\" pgmap=\"34\">In addition to this testimony, Snelson presented as economic damages a medical bill summary totaling $595,766.35, and a lost-wage claim of approximately 2xh years with a 1993 wage rate of $32,130.85. For purposes of his disfigurement claim, Snelson showed the jury the catheter site on his chest where the hyperalimentation device attaches to his body.</p> <p id=\"b34-5\" pgmap=\"34\">Based on this evidence, the jury returned a verdict in Snelson\u2019s favor and against both Kamm and St. Mary\u2019s, awarding $7 million. Because the completed verdict form contained only the total damage award, the trial court instructed the jury to return to its deliberations in order to itemize the verdict. Approximately 20 minutes later, the jury returned with a verdict in the same amount, itemized as follows: (1) $600,000 for past medical expenses; (2) $1.1 million for future medical expenses; (3) $3 million for pain and suffering; (4) $2 million for loss of normal life; (5) $80,000 for lost earnings; and (6) $220,000 for disfigurement.</p> <p id=\"b35-4\" pgmap=\"35\">The appellate court majority affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial on the issue of damages for Kamm and judgment n.o.v. for St. Mary\u2019s. Justice Cook, in dissent, would have reinstated the jury\u2019s award of $7 million in damages. The panel upheld the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Snelson and against Kamm, rejecting Kamm\u2019s claims that a variety of trial errors had prejudiced him. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b35-5\" pgmap=\"35\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b35-6\" pgmap=\"35\">We first address Kamm\u2019s claims of trial error. Kamm argues that the trial court erred by granting Snelson\u2019s motion in limine barring him from cross-examining Snelson\u2019s expert, Sarnelle, regarding his relationship with a professional witness referral agency, Sappanaro, Inc. It is true that, generally, opposing counsel may probe bias, partisanship or financial interest of an expert witness on cross-examination. Sears v. Rutishauser, 102 Ill. 2d 402, 407 (1984). However, we agree with the appellate court that Kamm\u2019s failure to make an adequate offer of proof has resulted in a waiver of this issue on appeal. See People v. Andrews, 146 Ill. 2d 413, 422 (1992); Sinclair v. Berlin, 325 Ill. App. 3d 458, 471 (2001).</p> <p id=\"b35-7\" pgmap=\"35(136) 36(133)\">When a motion in limine is granted, the key to saving for review an error in the exclusion of evidence is an adequate offer of proof in the trial court. See Sinclair, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 471. Counsel makes an adequate offer of proof if he informs the trial court, with particularity, of the substance of the witness\u2019 anticipated answer; an offer of proof that merely summarizes the witness\u2019 testimony in a conclusory manner is inadequate. Andrews, 146 Ill. 2d at 421. Here, a review of the record reveals no adequate offer of proof, only the following statement from Kamm\u2019s written response to the motion in limine: \u201cThe testimony of the experts for [Snelson] is that they have received other referrals from Sappanaro.\u201d Given this sparse information, there is no way for this court to determine if the excluded evidence had any relevance to the proceeding. See Andrews, 146 Ill. 2d at 421 (an offer of proof serves no purpose if it does not demonstrate, both to the trial court and to reviewing courts, the admissibility of the testimony which was foreclosed). However, the record does show that the trial court allowed Kamm to cross-examine Sarnelle as to the frequency of his plaintiff-oriented testimony and to argue to the jury his alleged bias and financial interest. Thus, where counsel failed to explicitly state what the excluded testimony would reveal about Sarnelle\u2019s relationship with Sappanaro, Inc., we have no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court erred in restricting Kamm\u2019s cross-examination of Sarnelle. See Holder v. Caselton, 275 Ill. App. 3d 950, 955 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b36-5\" pgmap=\"36\">Next, Kamm argues that Sarnelle\u2019s testimony should be disregarded as lacking foundation. Kamm claims that Sarnelle failed \u201cto ground his opinions in generally-accepted scientific principles.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b36-6\" pgmap=\"36\">The decision of whether to admit expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court (People v. Miller, 173 Ill. 2d 167, 187 (1996)), and a ruling will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion (People v. Reid, 179 Ill. 2d 297, 313 (1997)). Expert testimony is admissible if the proffered expert is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, and the testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence. See Wiegman v. Hitch-Inn Post of Libertyville, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 789, 799 (1999). Here, Sarnelle testified to his credentials and Kamm admits that they were sufficient to qualify Sarnelle as an expert.</p> <p id=\"b36-7\" pgmap=\"36(47) 37(139)\">At trial, Kamm failed to either object to the admissibility of Sarnelle\u2019s testimony or file a motion for an evidentiary hearing to determine its admissibility under Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). See Donaldson v. Central Illinois Public Service Co., 199 Ill. 2d 63, 76-77 (2002) (the admission of expert testimony is governed by the standards expressed in Frye, which dictates that scientific evidence is only admissible at trial if the methodology or scientific principle upon which the opinion is based is \u201c \u2018sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs\u2019 \u201d), quoting Frye, 293 F. at 1014. Because the record shows that Kamm did not object to the underlying foundation of Sarnelle\u2019s testimony at trial, we find that this issue has been forfeited on appeal. See People v. Moore, 171 Ill. 2d 74, 98 (1996) (defendant waived Frye issue by failing to present expert testimony at Frye hearing); see also Reed v. Northwestern Publishing Co., 124 Ill. 2d 495, 519 (1988) (a party waives evidentiary issues by failing to object at trial).</p> <p id=\"b37-5\" pgmap=\"37\">Citing Kleiss v. Cassida, 297 Ill. App. 3d 165, 174 (1998), and Aguilera v. Mount Sinai Hospital Medical Center, 293 Ill. App. 3d 967 (1997), Kamm argues that, despite his failure to object to the complained-of testimony, the trial court should have entered judgment n.o.v. in his favor because of the alleged deficiencies in the testimony. We disagree. Both Kleiss and Aguilera are distinguishable and do not support Kamm\u2019s position.</p> <p id=\"b37-6\" pgmap=\"37(118) 38(67)\">In Kleiss, the plaintiff farmer alleged that his crops were damaged by the defendant\u2019s spraying of herbicide on nearby farms. The plaintiffs expert testified that the herbicide could have traveled two miles in the air to the plaintiffs property. However, the expert had no reasons whatsoever for his opinion other than \u201c20 to 30 years experience.\u201d In affirming judgment n.o.v. for the defendant, the appellate court held that \u201c[w]hen an expert testifies simply that plaintiff should win but is unable to support that conclusion with reasoned analysis, the expert\u2019s testimony is worthless, provides no assistance to the jury, and should be stricken.\u201d Kleiss, 297 Ill. App. 3d at 174. In contrast to the expert in Kleiss, Sarnelle\u2019s testimony was replete with reasoned analysis supporting his opinions. Sarnelle carefully explained that his opinions were based on the clinical data contained in Snelson\u2019s medical records such as the onset and severity of pain, the vital signs, the appearance of blood in the stools, and that Snelson had been in the hospital having a procedure done in the area of his mesenteric artery when his problems began.</p> <p id=\"b38-5\" pgmap=\"38\">In Aguilera, the plaintiffs decedent was taken to the emergency room complaining of numbness on the right side of his body. About six or seven hours later, a CT scan was taken, revealing a brain hemorrhage. The patient died a few days later. The plaintiff presented two experts who testified that the emergency room physician\u2019s delay in taking the CT scan caused the decedent\u2019s death. It was the plaintiffs theory that a diagnosis of the condition would have triggered surgical intervention to prevent the decedent\u2019s death. However, on cross-examination the plaintiffs experts admitted that they would defer to a neurosurgeon as to whether surgery should have even been performed, yet the only neurosurgeons testifying in the case stated that surgery would not have been appropriate. The appellate court held that a directed verdict for the defendant was proper because, without supporting testimony from a neurosurgeon, the plaintiffs expert\u2019s testimony was insufficient to show that surgery would have occurred absent defendant\u2019s conduct. Aguilera, 293 Ill. App. 3d at 975. Here, in contrast, there was no question that Sarnelle was qualified to render the opinions he offered at trial, and there was no missing link failing to establish all of the elements of Snelson\u2019s case.</p> <p id=\"b38-6\" pgmap=\"38(38) 39(63)\">While Kamm contends that Sarnelle\u2019s opinions were not adequately supported, the basis for a witness\u2019 opinion generally does not affect his standing as an expert; such matters go only to the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. See National Bank of Monticello v. Doss, 141 Ill. App. 3d 1065, 1072 (1986). Indeed, the weight to be assigned to an expert opinion is for the jury to determine in light of the expert\u2019s credentials and the factual basis of his opinion. See Wiegman, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 799; Treadwell v. Downey, 209 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1003 (1991).</p> <p id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">In Wilson v. Clark, 84 Ill. 2d 186, 194 (1981), this court held that an expert may give an opinion without disclosing the underlying facts or data. Rather, the burden is placed upon the adverse party during cross-examination to elicit the facts underlying the expert opinion. Wilson, 84 Ill. 2d at 194. Here, as the appellate court noted, \u201cKamm conducted a vigorous cross-examination of Sarnelle, challenging the bases and soundness of his opinions.\u201d 319 Ill. App. 3d at 136. Thus, it was up to Kamm to reveal any alleged deficiency in Sarnelle\u2019s testimony, a fact which the trial court recognized in denying Kamm\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., stating: \u201c[T]he criticism of Dr. Sarnelle by [Kamm] really goes to the weight of the evidence or testimony presented by him, and I believe that was all argued to the jury at the time. I think suffice it to say that the jury had the option of accepting the testimony of either side\u2019s expert witnesses ***.\u201d The trial court did not err in this regard.</p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">Kamm further contends that the trial court erred by giving certain jury instructions at Snelson\u2019s request. However, the plaintiff has the right to have the jury clearly and fairly instructed on any theory supported by the evidence. Leonardi v. Loyola University, 168 Ill. 2d 83, 100 (1995). This court, in Leonardi, further stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"AI\" pgmap=\"39(58) 40(20)\">\u201cThe question of what issues have been raised by the evidence is within the discretion of the trial court. The evidence may be slight; a reviewing court may not reweigh it or determine if it should lead to a particular conclusion. [Citation.] The test in determining the propriety of tendered instructions is whether the jury was fairly, fully, and comprehensively informed as to the relevant principles, considering the instructions in their entirety.\u201d Leonardi, 168 Ill. 2d at 100.</blockquote> <p id=\"b40-7\" pgmap=\"40\">Kamm first argues that Snelson\u2019s instruction No. 26, alleging Kamm\u2019s negligence in \u201cprescribing pain medication to Robert Snelson once he was concerned with mesenteric insufficiency,\u201d was improper because Sarnelle never testified that Snelson suffered any injury from the prescription of pain medication. It was Snelson\u2019s theory at trial that administering pain medication in his case was a deviation from the standard of care because such medication made his condition more difficult to diagnose. Sarnelle testified that, in his opinion, based on a reasonable degree of medical and surgical certainty, no pain medication should have been given to a patient in Snelson\u2019s condition because it \u201cmay mask the findings.\u201d Additionally, Donahue and Kamm himself testified that Demerol, the pain medication which Kamm prescribed for Snelson, is a narcotic analgesic that can cause sedation and that the patient\u2019s condition can be reassessed only when the medication \u201cwears off.\u201d Because the instant case involved a failure to timely diagnose, we find that there was sufficient support for Snelson\u2019s theory and that no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion occurred in giving this instruction. See Holton v. Memorial Hospital, 176 Ill. 2d 95, 119 (1997) (to the extent a plaintiffs chance of recovery or survival is lessened by the malpractice, he should be able to present evidence to a jury that the defendant\u2019s malpractice, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, proximately caused the increased risk of harm or lost chance of recovery).</p> <p id=\"b40-8\" pgmap=\"40(51) 41(229)\">Kamm further argues that he was prejudiced when, over his objection, the trial court gave Snelson\u2019s instructions based on Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, Nos. 1.03, 1.04, B45.03.A, 30.01 (1995) (hereinafter IPI Civil (1995)). We first address Snelson\u2019s instruction No. 3, which provided: \u201cA fact may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence consists of proof of facts or circumstances which give rise to a reasonable inference of the truth of the facts sought to be proved.\u201d IPI Civil (1995) No. 1.03. Kamm contends that there was no circumstantial evidence concerning him presented in this case. However, Kamm\u2019s expert, Donahue, testified that part of the basis for his opinion that the occlusion of the blood supply was not immediate was that Snelson\u2019s pain had diminished following the catheterization and then reemerged the next morning. Therefore, if Snelson\u2019s pain had not actually diminished overnight, the factual basis for Donahue\u2019s opinion was weakened. To that end, and because no direct evidence existed, Snelson presented circumstantial evidence as to his level of pain after midnight on March 2. Nurse Durbin testified that, while the medical records did not show Snelson\u2019s level of pain during the midnight shift assessment, at 12:45 a.m. Snelson received 100 milligrams of Demerol and that Snelson was therefore in pain at that time. In Illinois, in a civil case where any of the evidence is circumstantial a party is entitled to an instruction on circumstantial evidence. See Kane v. Northwest Special Recreation Ass\u2019n, 155 Ill. App. 3d 624, 630 (1987). We therefore agree with the appellate court that the trial court, in the case at bar, did not err in giving IPI Civil (1995) No. 1.03.</p> <p id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41(103) 42(85)\">Kamm further argues that IPI Civil (1995) No. 1.04, regarding a juror\u2019s life experiences, was improperly given. Snelson\u2019s instruction No. 4 provided: \u201cIn considering the evidence in this case you are not required to set aside your observation and experience in the affairs of life but you have a right to consider all the evidence in the light of your own observation and experience in the affairs of life.\u201d IPI Civil (1995) No. 1.04. Kamm argues that the jury should not have received this instruction because jurors may not attempt to resolve issues of medical malpractice from any personal knowledge they may possess. See IPI Civil (1995) No. 105.02. However, jurors are allowed to use their own observation and experience in assessing damages. See Baird v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co., 63 Ill. 2d 463, 472-73 (1976). Therefore, where the record clearly shows that the jurors were also instructed that they could not use their personal knowledge to determine the issues of professional negligence (see IPI Civil (1995) No. 105.02), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving IPI Civil (1995) No. 1.04.</p> <p id=\"b42-5\" pgmap=\"42\">Kamm also contends that the trial court erred by giving Snelson\u2019s instruction No. 20, a verdict form that provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b42-6\" pgmap=\"42\">\u201cWe find that the total amount of damages suffered by Robert Snelson as a proximate cause of the occurrence in question is itemized as follows:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b42-9\" pgmap=\"42\">The pain and suffering experienced and reasonably certain to be experienced in the future as a result of the injuries ***.\u201d See IPI Civil (1995) Nos. B45.03.A, 30.05.</blockquote> <p id=\"b42-10\" pgmap=\"42\">Kamm argues that there was no competent evidence to support an award for future pain and suffering, \u201cas no party testified that [Snelson] was reasonably certain to experience pain and suffering in the future as a result of injuries allegedly caused by Dr. Kamm.\u201d However, at trial Snelson testified that he suffers from chronic diarrhea, that he sometimes experiences pain when the nutrients enter his body through the hyperalimentation catheter, and that he has experienced sickness and pain in association with the repeated infections and replacements of his catheter. This evidence was sufficient to warrant giving Snelson\u2019s instruction No. 20, and we therefore agree with the appellate court that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting it to the jury. See Leonardi, 168 Ill. 2d at 100 (plaintiff has the right to have the jury clearly and fairly instructed on any theory supported by the evidence).</p> <p id=\"b42-11\" pgmap=\"42(9) 43(137)\">Finally, Kamm contends that the trial court erred by giving a modified version of IPI Civil No. 30.01 that replaced \u201cdisability\u201d as an element of damages with \u201closs of a normal life.\u201d We note that the portion of the instruction at issue is actually contained in IPI Civil (1995) No. 30.04, which is one of a number of \u201celement of damages\u201d phrases that may be inserted between the two paragraphs of IPI Civil No. 30.01 to complete that general damages instruction. See IPI Civil (1995) Nos. 30.01, 30.04, Notes on Use. Kamm argues that it was error to use this modified instruction, first proposed in Smith v. City of Evanston, 260 Ill. App. 3d 925 (1994), because the Smith version was not an approved instruction at the time of the instant trial, citing Supreme Court Rule 239(a) (177 Ill. 2d R. 239(a)).</p> <p id=\"b43-5\" pgmap=\"43(213) 44(91)\">Rule 239(a) provides that whenever IPI contains an instruction applicable in a civil case, and the court determines that the jury should be instructed on the subject, the IPI instruction shall be used, unless the court determines that it does not accurately state the law. 177 Ill. 2d R. 239(a). However, the notes on use for IPI Civil (1995) No. 30.04, which were available at the time of the 1999 trial, state: \u201cIf the trial court rules that the Smith case is applicable, then the phrase loss of a normal fife\u2019 may be substituted for the term \u2018disability.\u2019 \u201d IPI Civil (1995) No. 30.04, Notes on Use. Indeed, since the instant case has been on appeal, the IPI committee has formally adopted \u201closs of a normal fife\u201d as an accepted alternative to \u201cdisability\u201d where the trial court determines that \u201closs of a normal life\u201d more accurately describes the element of damages claimed and would be less confusing to the jury. See IPI Civil (2000) No. 30.04.01, Notes on Use. Here, the trial court, after lengthy discussion at the instructions conference, agreed with Snelson that the loss of a normal life instruction was appropriate. Thus, the trial court complied with Rule 239(a), because it gave the modified instruction believing it to more accurately state the applicable law. Further, while the trial judge later stated, in ruling on posttrial motions, that he believed his decision to give the modified instruction was \u201cin error,\u201d he reasoned that this was because \u201closs of a normal life is merely a component of a compensable damage element and not an independent element in and of itself.\u201d To the contrary, loss of a normal life has been recognized as a separate element of compensable damages in Illinois. See Turner v. Williams, 326 Ill. App. 3d 541, 551 (2001).</p> <p id=\"b44-5\" pgmap=\"44\">Kamm also claims prejudice from the use of the loss of a normal life instruction, arguing that \u201cthe extremely subjective nature of this element may have allowed the jury to decide issues in this case on the basis of sympathy rather than the testimony and evidence.\u201d Not only is this argument speculative, but it is repudiated by the addition of the element to the IPI instructions. See Turner, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 551 (the addition of IPI Civil (2000) No. 30.04.01, which allows either loss of a normal life or disability to be given as an instruction, depending on the nature of the evidence at trial, illustrates that the use of an instruction on loss of a normal life is not contrary to Illinois law). Therefore, where Kamm has failed to show error or prejudice in the giving of the modified instruction, we see no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion requiring reversal. See Thompson v. MCA Distributing, Music Corp. of America, 257 Ill. App. 3d 988, 991 (1994) (a new trial will be granted because of improper jury instructions only where the party has suffered serious prejudice from the offending instruction).</p> <p id=\"b44-6\" pgmap=\"44(52) 45(59)\">We next address Kamm\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence Snelson\u2019s exhibit No. 16, a summary of his medical bills covering five years and many different providers, which totalled $595,766.35. Kamm claims that this exhibit included \u201call\u201d of Snelson\u2019s medical bills incurred since entering St. Mary\u2019s on March 2, 1994, and that no attempt was made to separate and distinguish the medical expenses he incurred for treatment of his preexisting health problems. However, we reject this claim based on Snelson\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that the summary included only bills received for medical services related to his intestinal problem, including those costs and problems associated with hyperalimentation.</p> <p id=\"b45-5\" pgmap=\"45\">Kamm also argues that the exhibit did not distinguish those medical expenses Snelson claimed were due to Kamm\u2019s alleged medical negligence from those Snelson would have incurred had a successful revascularization occurred. While Kamm contends that he objected to the \u201ctotality of the bills,\u201d we agree with the appellate court that the record reveals he specifically objected to only two bills contained in the summary: (1) the initial hospitalization bill from St. Mary\u2019s, for $52,814.59; and (2) a bill from Dr. Thomas Fulbright, a neurologist, for $471. The record further shows that Snelson\u2019s counsel suggested that the summary might be changed to delete Fulbright\u2019s bill and the objectionable portions of the hospital bill, and then the following colloquy occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b45-6\" pgmap=\"45\">\u201cMR. KEHART [Kamm\u2019s counsel]: I just wanted to preserve my objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b45-7\" pgmap=\"45\">THE COURT: At this point it is going to be admitted and then we will work out the details of what gets back to [the jury] later.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b45-8\" pgmap=\"45\">However, neither the trial court nor any of the parties ever raised the issue again and Snelson\u2019s exhibit No. 16 was admitted unchanged.</p> <p id=\"b45-9\" pgmap=\"45(66) 46(119)\">The admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and a reviewing court will not reverse the trial court unless that discretion was clearly abused. Gill v. Foster, 157 Ill. 2d 304, 312-13 (1993). We acknowledge that, \u201c[i]n proving damages, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish a reasonable basis for computing damages.\u201d Gill, 157 Ill. 2d at 313. Here, however, Snelson suggested deleting those medical charges that Kamm claimed were not causally related to his alleged negligence, and Kamm not only failed to accept this suggestion when it was made, but failed to reassert his objection later, allowing the unaltered exhibit to go to the jury. Accordingly, we hold that any valid objection Kamm may have had for admitting the medical bills into evidence was waived by his failure to make specific contemporary objections at trial so that any defect could have been cured. See Janisco v. Kozloski, 261 Ill. App. 3d 963, 966 (1994); see also Simmons v. Garces, 198 Ill. 2d 541, 567 (2002) (failure to object in a timely manner waives objections).</p> <p id=\"b46-5\" pgmap=\"46\">Kamm also argues that the jury verdict was \u201cirrevocably tainted\u201d because the jury considered \u201cextrajudicial information.\u201d We reject this contention, as it is not supported by the record and is based solely on the jury\u2019s submission of the following question to the trial court during deliberations: \u201cWas it possible a Break [sic] Brachial Arteriogram could have been preformed [sic] once Dr. Kamm was concerned with mecenteric [sic] insufficiency? or any procedure that could have shown blockage or reduced circulations [sic]?\u201d</p> <p id=\"b46-6\" pgmap=\"46(126) 47(108)\">It is true that independent investigation by the jury may constitute error so prejudicial as to require reversal. See People v. Holmes, 69 Ill. 2d 507, 519 (1978); Johnson v. Danville Cash &amp; Carry Lumber Co., 200 Ill. App. 3d 196, 199 (1990). In order to set aside a verdict, however, the losing party must show \u201ccompetent and credible evidence of an improper external influence on the jury.\u201d Johnson, 200 Ill. App. 3d at 199. In the instant case, we find, as did the appellate court, that Kamm does not support his claim with any evidence that the jury acted improperly. 319 Ill. App. 3d at 144. Rather, Kamm contends that the jury\u2019s question shows that it considered extraneous information because \u201c[n]o witness, even Dr. Sarnelle, opined that a second or \u2018brachial arteriogram\u2019 should have been attempted.\u201d However, Sarnelle did testify that, rather than a translumbar arteriogram, he preferred \u201ca different route *** into the brachial artery, which is in the arm.\u201d Sarnelle further testified that when Kamm became concerned about ischemia following his examination of Snelson on March 2, he could have done an arteriogram where he would \u201cgo in through the arm to see the circulation.\u201d Kamm\u2019s claim must therefore be rejected because it is unsubstantiated by any \u201ccompetent and credible\u201d evidence and the record shows that the jury could have formulated its question based on the evidence presented at trial.</p> <p id=\"b47-5\" pgmap=\"47\">Kamm also argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, contending that \u201call of the credible evidence on the applicable standard of care supported only a verdict in favor of Dr. Kamm.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p> <p id=\"b47-6\" pgmap=\"47\">It is well established that, in an appeal from a jury verdict, a reviewing court may not simply reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the jury. Rhodes v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R., 172 Ill. 2d 213, 242 (1996); Doser v. Savage Manufacturing &amp; Sales, Inc., 142 Ill. 2d 176, 189-90 (1990). Indeed, a reviewing court may reverse a jury verdict only if it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Rhodes, 172 Ill. 2d at 242. A verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite conclusion is clearly evident or where the findings of the jury are unreasonable, arbitrary, and not based upon any of the evidence. Leonardi v. Loyola University of Chicago, 168 Ill. 2d 83, 106 (1995); Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill. 2d 445, 454 (1992).</p> <p id=\"b47-7\" pgmap=\"47(36) 48(69)\">Here, Snelson\u2019s medical expert, Sarnelle, testified, inter alia, that, based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty, had there been surgery in a timely fashion on March 2, a large portion of Snelson\u2019s intestines could have been saved and he would not require hyperalimentation to survive. In turn, Kamm\u2019s experts, Pyle and Donahue, testified that, even had revascularization been attempted on March 2, the surgery would not have been successful. As we earlier found, and contrary to Kamm\u2019s assertion, we see no \u201cscientific poverty\u201d in Sarnelle\u2019s testimony that would put the jury\u2019s verdict in doubt. Rather, as the appellate court so aptly stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b48-5\" pgmap=\"48\">\u201cThis case involved a classic battle of the experts. Witnesses qualified in their fields stated their opinions and gave their reasons for those opinions. Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs experts did not agree with the defense experts. The jury needed to listen to the conflicting evidence and use its best judgment to determine where the truth could be found. The jury found in favor of Snelson and against Kamm, and this court \u2018should not usurp the function of the jury and substitute its judgment on questions of fact fairly submitted, tried, and determined from the evidence which did not greatly preponderate either way.\u2019 Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 452-53.\u201d 319 111. App. 3d at 145.</blockquote> <p id=\"b48-6\" pgmap=\"48\">We now address Snelson\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering a new trial on the issue of damages. The determination of whether a new trial should be granted rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, whose ruling will not be reversed unless it reflects an abuse of that discretion. Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 455; Reidelberger v. Highland Body Shop, Inc., 83 Ill. 2d 545, 548 (1981). \u201cIf the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, finds that the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, he should grant a new trial; on the other hand, where there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury, it constitutes an abuse of discretion for the trial court to grant a motion for a new trial.\u201d Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 456.</p> <p id=\"b48-7\" pgmap=\"48(40) 49(233)\">Illinois courts have repeatedly held that the amount of damages to be assessed is peculiarly a question of fact for the jury to determine (Lee v. Chicago Transit Authority, 152 Ill. 2d 432, 470 (1992); Baird v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co., 63 Ill. 2d 463, 472-73 (1976)) and that great weight must be given to the jury\u2019s decision (see Hastings v. Gulledge, 272 Ill. App. 3d 861, 863-64 (1995); McMahon v. Richard Gorazd, Inc., 135 Ill. App. 3d 211, 230 (1985)). The very nature of personal injury cases makes it impossible to establish a precise formula to determine whether a particular award is excessive or not. See McMahon, 135 Ill. App. 3d at 230. Additionally, judges are not free to reweigh the evidence simply because they may have arrived at a different verdict than the jury. Drews v. Gobel Freight Lines, Inc., 144 Ill. 2d 84, 97 (1991); see also Hulke v. International Manufacturing Co., 14 Ill. App. 2d 5, 49 (1957) (the question of excessiveness is not to be determined by what we as judges think the damages should have been; the court has no right to substitute its judgment for that of the jury). Indeed, a court reviewing a jury\u2019s assessment of damages should not interfere unless a proven element of damages was ignored, the verdict resulted from passion or prejudice, or the award bears no reasonable relationship to the loss suffered. Gill v. Foster, 157 Ill. 2d 304, 315 (1993). Given this precedent, we believe the trial court, in the instant case, abused its discretion in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict as excessive.</p> <p id=\"b49-5\" pgmap=\"49(121) 50(59)\">When reviewing a question as to the adequacy of damages, the court must consider the record as a whole. See Hastings, 272 Ill. App. 3d at 864. Here, after reviewing the record in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the record support the jury\u2019s verdict, but the trial court\u2019s rationale for granting a new trial was, for the most part, faulty. The trial court\u2019s stated reasons for granting a new trial on damages may be summarized as follows: (1) there was error in giving the \u201closs of normal life\u201d instruction; (2) the jury\u2019s question showed \u201c[it was] attempting to base a decision on something other than the evidence presented\u201d; (3) the jury\u2019s rapid itemization of the verdict indicated \u201cthere could not have been any meaningful discussion as to the allocation\u201d; (4) the pretrial settlement demand showed that Snelson\u2019s $10 million request in closing \u201cwas not made in good faith\u201d; and (5) the amount of the verdict was based \u201cat least in part on sympathy\u201d and was unreasonable given Snelson\u2019s \u201csurviving\u201d and his \u201coverall medical condition.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b50-5\" pgmap=\"50\">As to the first two bases, we have already found that the giving of the \u201closs of normal life\u201d instruction was not error and that the jury\u2019s question was insufficient to show it was improperly considering extrajudicial information. Thus, contrary to the trial court\u2019s belief, these were not legitimate reasons for overturning the jury\u2019s verdict.</p> <p id=\"b50-6\" pgmap=\"50(203) 51(36)\">Next, while the trial court believed the jury took only an additional \u201cfive or ten minutes\u201d to deliberate after the court explained to the jury that it had failed to itemize the damages, the record shows, and Kamm admits, that the jury actually took approximately 20 minutes to complete the itemized verdict form. The trial court\u2019s assumption that the lack of a lengthy delay meant \u201cthere could not have been any meaningful discussion as to the allocation\u201d was speculation and ignored the possibility that the jury had previously deliberated on the individual damage elements but neglected to fill out that portion of the verdict form. Further, we agree with Snelson that it appears the elements of damages were itemized \u201cin a thoughtful way,\u201d where the medical costs awarded were rounded to the nearest large whole number, the future medical awarded related to Snelson\u2019s current expenses of $7,000 to $10,000 per month for hyperalimentation, which will continue for the remainder of his 10-year life expectancy, and the lost-wages amount was taken directly from the closing argument suggestion. Therefore, because the calculations and proportions of the award demonstrate a strong relation to the evidence presented, the jury\u2019s determination cannot be against the manifest weight of the evidence. See Jones v. Chicago Osteopathic Hospital, 316 Ill. App. 3d 1121, 1138 (2000) (if a jury\u2019s award falls within the flexible range of conclusions reasonably supported by the evidence, it must stand).</p> <p id=\"b51-5\" pgmap=\"51\">The trial court also stated that because Snelson had offered to settle the case at the start of trial for $500,000, his closing argument to the jury requesting $10 million was not made in good faith. However, the actual amount of Snelson\u2019s pretrial settlement offer was not $500,000, but rather $1 million, the limits of Kamm\u2019s policy. Additionally, while the trial court assumed that the settlement offer was based upon the predicted value of the. case as determined by Snelson\u2019s counsel, we agree with Justice Cook\u2019s dissent that the demand for the policy limits and its subsequent withdrawal on the record were most likely made to lay a foundation for a possible 1 \u2018wrongful-refusal-to-settle claim.\u201d 319 111. App. 3d at 149 (Cook, J., dissenting). Thus, we believe the basis for the trial court\u2019s finding that Snelson\u2019s $10 million request was not made in good faith is erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b51-6\" pgmap=\"51\">Finally, we address the trial court\u2019s belief that the verdict was excessive given Snelson\u2019s medical condition and the sympathy it engendered. In granting Kamm a new trial on damages, the trial court stated, in pertinent part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b51-7\" pgmap=\"51\">\u201c[T]he $7 million verdict *** under the circumstances of this case is definitely outside the range as what is fair and reasonable based on all of the evidence presented.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b51-8\" pgmap=\"51\">The first reason that I believe that is the case is that the $2 million which was attributed to the loss of a normal life and the $3 million which was attributed to pain and suffering are excessive when viewed in the light of the plaintiffs overall medical condition which existed prior to this occurrence and his ability to function after this occurrence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b51-9\" pgmap=\"51\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b51-10\" pgmap=\"51\">Furthermore, I believe [the experts] all testified that the condition suffered by the plaintiff *** [has] a very high degree of fatality. Here we have the plaintiff surviving.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-4\" pgmap=\"52\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-5\" pgmap=\"52\">I think in the context of this case and this case only, with the plaintiff appearing in Court out of necessity as he has and with the feeding unit, which I in no way criticize plaintiff for because that\u2019s a fact of life, it is something that he has to have. I just think under the circumstances it was inevitable that the verdict was based at least in part on sympathy was [sic] the result here.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b52-6\" pgmap=\"52\">The evidentiary basis for the award of damages for loss of a normal life and pain and suffering was the loss of 95% of Snelson\u2019s small intestine, which has necessitated his dependence on hyperalimentation for survival and has resulted in his suffering from numerous infections and chronic diarrhea. The appellate court majority admits that \u201cSnelson undeniably suffered a serious injury\u201d and states that \u201c[t]his issue is a close one.\u201d 319 Ill. App. 3d at 133. The majority nonetheless upholds the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial on the issue of damages because Snelson\u2019s injury did not diminish his life expectancy, he acknowledged that his restricted ability to engage in daily activities was largely attributable to his preexisting physical problems, and he did not present evidence that his condition was likely to deteriorate in the future. 319 Ill. App. 3d at 133. We, however, believe that, even taking into consideration the majority\u2019s concerns, the injuries suffered by Snelson were shown by the evidence to be significant and devastating, and nothing has been presented that would compel us to conclude that the verdict was excessive.</p> <p id=\"b52-7\" pgmap=\"52(80) 53(170)\">We agree with Snelson that \u201c[i]t is a vast oversimplification to state that [his] damages are limited because he still tries to live by occasionally going fishing.\u201d It is indisputable that the loss of Snelson\u2019s small intestine has radically affected his life and subjected him to phenomenal suffering. He has lost the ability to enjoy food and to consume many foods. He has had to endure bouts of diarrhea 15 to 20 times a day, every day, for over eight years and counting. As Snelson further argued: \u201cEvery decision \u2014 to even leave the house \u2014 requires the trade-off to occur; must he have immediate access to a bathroom, or must he take the bag with him and then affect his ability to sleep that evening or, even worse, to soil his bed.\u201d Therefore, we find that, regardless of his prior medical condition, the jury\u2019s damage award for loss of a normal life was clearly demonstrated and supported by the evidence regarding the limitations on Snelson\u2019s freedom, mobility, and the change in nearly every element of his daily routine caused by the loss of his small intestine. Perhaps Snelson\u2019s own comment at trial made the point most succinctly: \u201cWhen you are hooked up 12 hours a day, you don\u2019t have no days left.\u201d Similarly, we find the jury\u2019s award for pain and suffering was adequately supported by evidence of the infections, diarrhea, and hospitalizations caused by Snelson\u2019s \u201cshort bowel syndrome\u201d and his need for hyperalimentation.</p> <p id=\"b53-5\" pgmap=\"53\">Additionally, we find that the trial court improperly considered Snelson\u2019s survival in determining the verdict to be excessive. The jury found that Kamm was guilty of negligence in his treatment of Snelson and the trial court denied Kamm\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. In determining whether the injuries Snelson did suffer merit the jury\u2019s damage award, it is irrelevant that the negligence did not cause Snelson\u2019s death.</p> <p id=\"b53-6\" pgmap=\"53(99) 54(43)\">In sum, an abuse of discretion will be found where there is no recognizable basis in the record to support the granting of a motion for a new trial. See Greco v. Coleman, 138 Ill. App. 3d 317, 322 (1985). Here, the jury\u2019s damage award was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. There were no trial errors that occurred that persuade this court that the award in the instant case was not fair and reasonable compensation for Snelson\u2019s injuries. Additionally, we have carefully scrutinized the record and do not find that the amount of the verdict is so large as to be a result of passion and prejudice or a shock to the judicial conscience. See Baird, 63 Ill. 2d at 473. Therefore, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial on damages.</p> <p id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">Finally, we address Snelson\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in granting judgment n.o.v. for St. Mary\u2019s on the issue of proximate cause. Snelson acknowledges that he presented no expert testimony indicating that St. Mary\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of his injury. He also acknowledges that Kamm testified that no act or omission of the nursing staff affected his course of treatment of Snelson. Nevertheless, Snelson argues that a question of fact as to proximate cause was sufficiently established by the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b54-6\" pgmap=\"54\">A motion for judgment n.o.v. presents a question of law and should be entered \u201cin those cases in which all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors [the] movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.\u201d Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510 (1967). A decision on a motion for judgment n.o.v. is subject to de novo review by this court. McClure v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., 188 Ill. 2d 102, 132 (1999).</p> <p id=\"b54-7\" pgmap=\"54\">In medical negligence cases against hospitals based on vicarious liability for the conduct of its nurses, it is necessary for a plaintiff to present expert testimony to establish the standard of care and that its breach was the cause of the plaintiffs injury. Jones v. Chicago HMO Ltd. of Illinois, 191 Ill. 2d 278, 296 (2000). The rationale for requiring expert testimony is that a lay juror is not skilled in the profession and thus is not equipped to determine what constitutes reasonable care in professional conduct without the help of expert testimony. Jones, 191 Ill. 2d at 295.</p> <p id=\"b54-8\" pgmap=\"54(9) 55(73)\">Snelson in essence argues that St. Mary\u2019s nurses deviated from the standard of care by failing to (1) advise Kamm at 6 p.m. that they had inserted a catheter at 3 p.m. and (2) advise Kamm that Snelson continued to experience some pain through the evening after Kamm left at 6 p.m. The problem with Snelson\u2019s argument is that there was no expert testimony presented at trial that either of these matters constituted a deviation from the nursing standard of care.</p> <p id=\"b55-5\" pgmap=\"55\">Snelson\u2019s first expert, Dr. Sarnelle, had no opinions about the nurses\u2019 conduct. Snelson\u2019s other expert, nurse McCallum, did not testify that either of the cited omissions amounted to a deviation from the standard of care. Although McCallum was critical of the nurses\u2019 failure to document the effect of the Demerol, she did not testify that this was a proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury in this case. Moreover, she did not testify that a failure to inform Kamm of pain before the closing of the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d was a deviation from the standard of care. She also acknowledged that she was not qualified to offer any opinion regarding the proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury.</p> <p id=\"b55-6\" pgmap=\"55(153) 56(103)\">McCallum testified about eight matters on which she was critical of the nurses. Conspicuous by its absence is any mention that it was a breach of the nursing standard of care to fail to orally advise Kamm that a catheter had been inserted at 3 p.m. This may be because the nurse notes and flow sheets to which Kamm had access at his 6 p.m. visit listed that a catheter had been inserted. It may also be because this was not something that was important for Kamm to know or for the nurses to communicate. Indeed, this theory of negligence based on what was or was not communicated about the catheter was not even a theory relied upon by Snelson at trial. At any rate, the general rule must be applied here \u2014 that except in very simple cases, expert testimony is necessary in professional negligence cases to establish the standard of care and that its breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. See Jones, 191 Ill. 2d at 296; Addison v. Whittenberg, 124 Ill. 2d 287, 297 (1988); see also Natasi v. United Mine Workers of America Union Hospital, 209 Ill. App. 3d 830, 837-38 (1991) (although nursing experts testified that failure to notify doctor was a deviation from standard of care and delays in diagnosis could cause \u201cpoorer ultimate results,\u201d there was no medical testimony to substantiate that omissions of nursing staff ultimately had any impact on outcome of treatment and therefore directed verdict for hospital was proper).</p> <p id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56\">Nurse McCallum also testified that she was critical of the nursing staffs apparent failure to take Snelson\u2019s vital signs at 10 p.m. Snelson, however, does not explain how the failure to take vital signs at 10 p.m. helped to cause his injury. More importantly, there was no expert testimony that the conduct of the nurses on this matter was a proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury.</p> <p id=\"b56-6\" pgmap=\"56\">As previously mentioned, there was no expert testimony that the nurses\u2019 failure to inform Kamm of Snelson\u2019s complaints of pain constituted a breach of the standard of care and was a proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury. Kamm knew about Snelson\u2019s complaints of pain at the 6 p.m. visit. Kamm clearly anticipated that Snelson would continue to experience more pain and so he increased his dosage of Demerol from 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams, as needed. That Kamm was ordering Demerol instead of watching Snelson for pain was the criticism leveled against Kamm by Snelson\u2019s expert. That Kamm knew about Snelson\u2019s pain and yet was unconcerned about it beyond his ordering of Demerol means that the nurses\u2019 conduct on this matter could not have been the proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury even if there had been testimony that they deviated from the standard of care in failing to advise of pain.</p> <p id=\"b56-7\" pgmap=\"56(10) 57(123)\">The outcome of this case is controlled by our previous decision in Gill v. Foster, 157 Ill. 2d 304 (1993). There, the plaintiff was admitted to the hospital and surgery was performed. Several days after the surgery and while still in the hospital, the plaintiff complained to his surgeon that he was having chest pain. Two days later at the time of his discharge, the plaintiff complained to a nurse of chest pain. The discharge nurse, aware that the plaintiff had complained of pain before, did her own examination. She then told the plaintiff that something was wrong, but did not inform the treating physician. At the time of his discharge, the plaintiff actually had a herniation of his stomach into his chest, which required surgery at another hospital two weeks later.</p> <p id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">The plaintiff alleged in Gill that the hospital deviated from the standard of care by failing to inform his treating physician that the plaintiff was complaining of pain at the time of his discharge. This court found, however, that even assuming that the nurse breached the standard of care in failing to inform the doctor of the plaintiffs complaint, it could not have been the proximate cause of delay in the correct diagnosis of the plaintiffs condition because the doctor had repeated contacts with the patient yet failed to diagnose the problem or examine him more thoroughly. Gill, 157 Ill. 2d at 310-311.</p> <p id=\"b57-6\" pgmap=\"57\">Similar to Gill, there was no indication in the present case that Kamm would have taken a different course of action had he been informed that Snelson had some pain after Kamm left at 6 p.m. Moreover, Snelson did not even allege that St. Mary\u2019s nurses deviated from the standard of care in failing to apprise Kamm of any further pain.</p> <p id=\"b57-7\" pgmap=\"57(54) 58(122)\">Snelson\u2019s suggestion that it is impossible for a plaintiff to prove causation where the doctor testifies that \u201che would not have acted differently regardless of what information could have been given him [by the nurses]\u201d is a red herring for two reasons. First, Snelson mistakenly assumes that a doctor will not be willing to tell the truth about whether the conduct of hospital nurses affected his decisionmaking ability. Second, a plaintiff would always be free to present expert testimony as to what a reasonably qualified physician would do with the undisclosed information and whether the failure to disclose the information was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury in order to discredit a doctor\u2019s assertion that the nurse\u2019s omission did not affect his decisionmaking. See Seef v. Ingalls Memorial Hospital, 311 Ill. App. 3d 7, 26-27 (1999) (O\u2019Mara Frossard, P.J., dissenting). In such a case, a factual dispute as to proximate cause would be created sufficient for the jury to resolve. We do not, of course, have such a factual dispute in the present case.</p> <p id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58\">Snelson claims that he was \u201cforeclosed\u201d from presenting such evidence due to the appellate court majority\u2019s decision in Seef. We find no merit to this claim given that the trial in this case took place in June 1999, while the Seef decision was not filed until December 1999 (see Seef, 311 Ill. App. 3d 7).</p> <p id=\"b58-6\" pgmap=\"58\">To support his position that expert testimony establishing causation is not required, Snelson relies upon Holton v. Memorial Hospital, 176 Ill. 2d 95 (1997), and Suttle v. Lake Forest Hospital, 315 Ill. App. 3d 96 (2000). Neither of those cases, however, supports Snelson\u2019s position. Holton and Suttle do not set aside the requirement that a plaintiff present expert testimony asserting that a defendant hospital deviated from the standard of care and that that deviation was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury.</p> <p id=\"b58-7\" pgmap=\"58(59) 59(17)\">In Holton, the hospital\u2019s nursing staff did not inform the plaintiffs two treating physicians that the plaintiffs symptoms had progressed to partial paralysis. Unlike the present case, there was expert testimony in Holton to connect the nurses\u2019 particular deviation from the standard of care to the plaintiffs injury. The two treating doctors testified that they based their erroneous diagnosis and treatment on the incomplete information supplied by the nurses. Holton, 176 Ill. 2d at 108-09.</p> <p id=\"b59-3\" pgmap=\"59\">To define what evidence is necessary to establish a jury question on proximate cause, Holton adopted the rule used by the appellate court in Northern Trust Co. v. Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hospital, 143 Ill. App. 3d 479, 487 (1986) (\u201c \u2018[ejvidence which shows to a reasonable [degree of medical] certainty that negligent delay in diagnosis or treatment *** lessened the effectiveness of treatment is sufficient to establish proximate cause\u2019 \u201d), quoting James v. United States, 483 F. Supp. 581, 585 (N.D. Cal. 1980). Holton, 176 Ill. 2d at 115. In Northern Trust, the plaintiffs expert specifically testified that the hospital breached the standard of care in failing to have a \u201cspecially trained nurse\u201d on call to monitor the plaintiffs meconium baby. The plaintiff connected that breach to the plaintiff\u2019s injury with expert testimony indicating that a specially trained nurse would have notified the doctor of the baby\u2019s problems, that if the doctor had been notified he would have undertaken certain diagnostic steps and treatment, and that the delay in treatment increased the probability of harm. Northern Trust, 143 Ill. App. 3d at 486-88. Thus, the appellate court rejected the hospital\u2019s argument that the jury verdict against the hospital should be reversed for lack of a connection between the hospital\u2019s omissions and the baby\u2019s brain injury. Northern Trust, 143 Ill. App. 3d at 487.</p> <p id=\"b59-4\" pgmap=\"59(74) 60(21)\">Neither Holton nor Northern Trust supports the notion that Snelson in this case should be excused from presenting expert testimony to show that the failure to notify Kamm of the insertion of the catheter and of continued pain amounted to deviations from the standard of care and that those deviations were a proximate cause of Snelson\u2019s injury. Unlike the present case, the plaintiffs in both of the cited cases presented expert evidence connecting a particular breach of the standard of care to the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Thus, neither case is helpful to Snelson.</p> <p id=\"b60-5\" pgmap=\"60\">Snelson attempts to fit the circumstances of this case under the shelter of the appellate court decision in Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d 96. There, the app\u00e9llate court reversed a judgment n.o.v. for a hospital, holding that the question of whether the doctor\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff would have been the same if he had been accurately informed of the plaintiffs true condition was a question of fact for the jury. Suttle, however, is distinguishable and actually supports the judgments of both lower courts in this case.</p> <p id=\"b60-6\" pgmap=\"60\">In Suttle, the appellate court specifically noted that the plaintiff had presented expert testimony establishing the standard of care. The plaintiff also presented evidence of the hospital nurses\u2019 violations of the various provisions of the Illinois Administrative Code to establish the standard of care. The plaintiff further presented expert testimony that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the hospital nurses\u2019 breaches of the standard of care led to a delayed diagnosis that was one of the proximate causes of the plaintiffs injuries. Moreover, the treating doctor testified that the hospital\u2019s breach resulted in a delay in his taking appropriate action. Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 104-05. Under these circumstances, the court concluded that the issues regarding the standard of care and proximate cause were questions of fact properly to be decided by the jury. Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 105. Unlike in Suttle, Snelson presented no expert testimony that the hospital breached the standard of care, resulting in a proximate cause of his injuries.</p> <p id=\"b60-7\" pgmap=\"60(41) 61(167)\">Despite Snelson\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, Suttle did not hold that a case should be submitted to the jury whenever a plaintiff presents some evidence that hospital nurses failed to communicate some information to a treating physician. Instead, Suttle merely distinguished the case before it from this court\u2019s decision in Gill, 157 Ill. 2d 304, noting that summary judgment for the hospital in Gill was proper even though a nurse failed to inform the doctor that the patient being discharged from the hospital was complaining of chest pain because the doctor knew of the plaintiffs pain. Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 104. Suttle further noted, however, that unlike Gill, there was a factual dispute in the case before it as to what the doctor would have done if he had received the information assessing the patient\u2019s blood pressure. Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 104. This was because the plaintiffs expert explicitly testified that the lack of an assessment by the nurses led to a delayed diagnosis that was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury, while the treating doctor testified that his treatment would have been the same even if he knew of the condition of the placenta. Suttle, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 104.</p> <p id=\"b61-5\" pgmap=\"61\">Given the complete absence of expert evidence connecting any deviation from the standard of care by St. Mary\u2019s with Snelson\u2019s injury, we conclude that the evidence so overwhelmingly favored St. Mary\u2019s that no contrary verdict based on the evidence could ever stand. In entering judgment n.o.v. for St. Mary\u2019s, the trial judge stated that in his 21 years on the bench he had always given great deference to jury verdicts and had never entered a judgment n.o.v. before. He then explained that he was compelled to enter judgment n.o.v. for St. Mary\u2019s because Snelson completely failed to present any expert evidence that any of the claimed deviations from the nursing standard of care were the proximate cause of his injury. We agree with the judgments of the trial and appellate courts on this point. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment n.o.v. in favor of St. Mary\u2019s.</p> <p id=\"b61-6\" pgmap=\"61\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b61-7\" pgmap=\"61(19) 62(98)\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the appellate court, rejecting Kamm\u2019s claims of error in No. 91232, is affirmed. As to Snelson\u2019s appeal, No. 91239, the appellate court and circuit court judgments are reversed with respect to Kamm and the cause is remanded to the circuit court of Macon County with directions to reinstate the $7 million award against Kamm. The trial court erred in granting Kamm a new trial on damages, as the jury\u2019s verdict in that regard was supported by the evidence, and we find no reason to overturn it. However, the appellate court and circuit court judgments with respect to the granting of judgment n.o.v. for St. Mary\u2019s are affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b62-5\" pgmap=\"62\">No. 91232 \u2014 Appellate court judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b62-6\" pgmap=\"62\">No. 91239 \u2014 Appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part; circuit court affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.</p> <p id=\"b62-8\" pgmap=\"62\">JUSTICE RARICK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
