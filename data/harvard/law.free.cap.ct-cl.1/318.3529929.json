From these, it appears that two of them claim <em>$219 56 </em>each; another claims $148 <em>21; </em>four others claim $119 56 each; and the eighth petitioner, for himself, <em>$100 </em>\u2014 all for extra services rendered \u2014 and pray judgment for the amount of their respective claims. This is making common cause in a very uncommon way, which, if tolerated by us, would lead to great confusion and difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">These claimants who have united in the petition are not represented as having any joint interest in the sums demanded, but each as looking after his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">The practice is in violation of all rules of pleading, and should not be encouraged. We cannot investigate claims presented in this hotchpot manner,.and therefore dismiss the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
