The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-5\"><em>W. J.

It is not stated whether the sidewalk was in a public or a private way. The assertion that the defendant \u201chad control over\u201d the portion of the sidewalk opposite his premises, at or near which the plaintiff fell, suggests a private way. But, apart from the plaintiff\u2019s disclaimer of this interpretation, if the accident had occurred on a private way the declaration would be defective in not alleging that the plaintiff was using the way rightfully, as upon an invitation from the defendant. We assume, then, that \u201cWest Main Street in the town of Ayer,\u201d referred to as a \u201chighway,\u201d is a public way. Apparently the negligence relied on is the failure to put up a barrier in order to make the sidewalk, with its \"steep projecting banks or sides,\u201d reasonably safe for travel. But the duty to maintain such railing would be on the town, not on the abutter. St. 1917, c. 344, Part IV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 24. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>212 Mass. 211, and cases cited. It is not alleged that the defendant constructed the walk under the provisions of Part V, \u00a7 5 of said highway statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>133 Mass. 569; <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Nantucket, </em>121 Mass. 161. The declaration states that the defendant \u201cconstructed\u201d the sidewalk. If, as argued by the plaintiff, the defendant did construct the walk originally, and prior to the accident its control was taken over by the town, the defendant thereafter not only was not obliged, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>he had no right, to erect a railing or barrier in the public way. See <em>Lexington Board of Survey </em>v. <em>Suburban Land Co. </em>235 Mass. 108, 111. The doctrine of a continuing nuisance has no application to the alleged facts. See <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Central Amusement Co. </em>224 Mass. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The practice act requires that a declaration \"shall state concisely and with substantial certainty the substantive facts necessary to constitute the cause of action.\u201d R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 6. The plaintiff, under any reasonable interpretation of his declaration, has failed to allege the breach of any legal duty owed to him by the defendant. The demurrer was sustained rightly, and the judgment for the defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>\u25a0So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
