The auditor\u2019s report, which was the only evidence at the trial, states that, prior to the date of any of the six contracts appearing in the record, the defendant had acted as the plaintiff\u2019s sole and exclusive agent for the sale of the \u201cEden Electric Home Laundry Machine\u201d within a designated but very restricted field. The defendant, however, during his agency \u201chad conceived or improved an electrical device known and called an \u2018Electric Vacuum Cleaner\u2019 which had been manufactured for him by the Pneuvac Company, and for which he had created a market under the name of Red E and a public demand therefor. At some time the attention of the plaintiff was directed to this . . . cleaner and . . . negotiations began . . . looking toward a contract whereby the plaintiff was to purchase and the. defendant supply cleaners of this description.\u201d The defendant, not being financially able to enter into a contract of the magnitude contemplated, \u201cintroduced the plaintiff ... to the Pneuvac Company for the purpose of establishing a relation between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>plaintiff\u201d and the company whereby the company \u201cwas to manufacture for the plaintiff, cleaners of the same type as that therein-before conceived or improved by the defendant, he to benefit as thereafter agreed.\u201d The contracts dated January 17, 1916, and designated in the record as A, B and C, were simultaneously executed, and the plaintiff thereunder received the full benefit of the defendant\u2019s services as its \u201cexclusive sales agent for the New England States, for all Eden and Brokaw-Eden products.\u201d The Pneuvac Company undertook to pay the defendant upon receipt of payments from the plaintiff \u201cfor said machines, the difference between eleven . . . dollars and the price at which the machines are billed to and paid for by the said Brokaw-Eden Manufacturing Company.\u201d The plaintiff having ordered \u201ctwo thousand of said machines ... to be billed at $12 each,\u201d the defendant\u2019s commission, if the transaction was completed, would be one dollar on every cleaner. The payments however were made by the plaintiff although the money was derived from the Pneuvac Company. By contracts D, E and F, dated May 1, 1916, those agreements were cancelled, and thereafter the plaintiff obligated itself to make the payments, which were reduced to fifty cents, \u201con each electric vacuum cleaner purchased.\u201d In order to determine the basis on which all parties to the new arrangement intended the computation should rest, these contracts, as the defendant contends, may be construed in so far as material as one instrument. <em>Makepeace </em>v. <em>Harvard College, </em>10 Pick. 298, 301. By contract E the plaintiff \u201cplaces its order [with the Pneuvac Company] for ten thousand or more of said machines, and such of attachments as it may require, subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement.\u201d It appears that no cleaners satisfactory to the plaintiff ever were delivered by the Pneuvac Company, and, the contract between them having been mutually cancelled without the defendant\u2019s knowledge, he is left to the contention that the order in question is the equivalent of an order for \u201cten thousand or more of said machines,\u201d as if they had been on hand and ready for delivery, title to which passed to the plaintiff. Go<em>ddard </em>v. <em>Binney, </em>115 Mass. 450. <em>White </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>164 Mass. 516. But it is plain that, until their manufacture and delivery, the cleaners had not been purchased within the meaning of the contract, and, no commissions having been payable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the defendant, he cannot maintain his set-off, and the verdict for the plaintiff\u2019 must stand. <em>Barrie </em>v. <em>Quinby, </em>206 Mass. 259,, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
