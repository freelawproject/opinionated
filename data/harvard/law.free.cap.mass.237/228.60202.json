Hartnett dated October 20, 1902, which deed was introduced in evidence, without objection, by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and there was no other evidence of its delivery.

And, no exceptions having been taken to the master\u2019s report, the question is, whether the decree granting injunctive relief and assessing damages is within the frame of the bill and in accordance with the master\u2019s material findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s title having been established to the satisfaction of the master whose conclusion does not appear as matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to be erroneous, <em>(Burrill </em>v. <em>Nahant Bank, 2 </em>Met. 163, 166,) the only issues of fact were, whether the defendant had unlawfully entered upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and cut and carried away her wood and timber, and, if so, whether the trespasses had been persistent and frequent. The master having found in favor of the plaintiff, she is entitled on the record not only to a permanent injunction restraining the defendant, his servants, or agents, from continuing to trespass upon the premises described in the bill, but to the damages shown by the report to have been suffered from his wrongful acts. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>189, Mass. 353, 357. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Pye, </em>215 Mass. 403, 413.
