It has a second mortgage upon it of $200,000, and its fair value is $800,000 or more. But in the present state of the money market, the plaintiff could not replace the present first mortgage without considerable difficulty, and then only at a higher rate of interest. The present mortgage bears 4% interest, and, except for the option hereinafter referred to, does not become due until June, 1921. As the taxes which were in arrears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>have now been paid, this would be a proper case for equitable relief, except for the clause in the mortgage that \u2018in case any default in the condition of this mortgage shall exist for more than thirty days, the entire mortgage debt shall become due at the option of the holder hereof.\u2019 The defendants have exercised their option under that clause, and now demand payment of the entire debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\">\u201cThe short answer to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the word \u2018condition\u2019 does not refer to the statutory condition is that there is no other condition in the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\">\u201cThe question whether the agreements contained in the mortgage run with the land is immaterial.

The bill was brought to enjoin the defendants from foreclosing a mortgage held by them on the plaintiff\u2019s property. The mortgage, which is now for $500,000 and payable June 10, 1921, is in the form set out in St. 1912, c. 502, \u00a7 6, with certain additions referred to later. It contains the clause, \u201cThis mortgage is upon the statutory condition, for any breach of which the mortgagees shall have the statutory power of sale.\u201d This condition and power are defined at length in said \u00a7 6. The provision therein as to taxes is, that the mortgagor \u201cshall pay when due and payable all taxes, charges and assessments, to whomsoever and whenever laid or assessed, whether on the mortgaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>premises or on any interest therein, or on the debt or obligation secured thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">The statute provides (\u00a7 1) \u201cThe following forms may be used and shall be sufficient for their respective purposes, and they may be altered as circumstances may require. . . .\u201d The mortgage under consideration contained certain agreements that do not appear in the printed statutory form. One of these, which now is material, is \u201cthat in case any default in the condition of this mortgage shall exist for more than thirty days the entire mortgage debt shall become due at the option of the holder hereof.\u201d It is strongly urged that the word \u201ccondition\u201d in this clause is not applicable to the \u201cstatutory condition\u201d which requires the prompt payment of taxes. But the statutory condition \u201cmay be incorporated in any mortgage by reference.\u201d \u00a7 6. It was so incorporated in this mortgage, and contained the above quoted provision for the payment of taxes when due. In fact this usual obligation on the part of the mortgagor is not otherwise provided for in the mortgage. The statutory power is expressly made applicable to \u201cany default in the performance or observance of the foregoing, or other condition.\u201d It seems to us that the parties intended to include -this somewhat drastic additional agreement, making the entire debt due in case of any default, within the scope of the statutory condition and power.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">There was default in the payment of taxes when due. Those assessed on the property for 1918 were not fully paid until December, 1919. The taxes assessed as of April 1, 1919, were not paid when the defendants gave notice, on December 17, 1919, that they exercised their option and declared the entire principal due and payable. This declaration was confirmed by the notice of March 16, 1920; and on April 6, 1920, foreclosure proceedings were begun by publishing the notice of sale. The 1919 taxes were not paid until April 22, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">By the terms of the mortgage the whole amount became payable thirty days after default in the performance of the condition; and this was applicable to a default in the payment of taxes. See <em>Hawkinson </em>v. <em>Banaghan, </em>203 Mass. 591, 594. The presence of this clause in the mortgage distinguishes the present case from those involving a mere technical breach which was promptly cured, like <em>McCombs </em>v. <em>Elmes, </em>197 Mass. 19. On the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>waiver the trial judge found that Mr. Dunbar had authority to act for his clients, \u201cbut his letters and conversation amounted at most to an offer to waive, and this offer, was withdrawn before it had been acted upon.\u201d He had the advantage of seeing the witnesses. W\u00e9 cannot say that he was plainly wrong. The absence of a waiver distinguishes this case from <em>Ver Planck </em>v. <em>Godfrey, 42 </em>App. Div. (N. Y.) 16, relied on by the plaintiff. And see <em>French </em>v. <em>Row, </em>77 Hun, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The record discloses a case of hardship to the plaintiff, which has expended large sums upon the property, and apparently, cannot replace the mortgage at this time, at the same rate of, interest. But in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake, it is bound by the contract it made.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
