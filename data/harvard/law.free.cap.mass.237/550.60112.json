The plaintiff\u2019s counsel produced this statement, handed it to the witness, who examined it and without objection read it to the jury as his testimony. The counsel for the defendant then asked the plaintiff\u2019s counsel for the certificate. It was handed to him, he inspected it, and asked the witness questions as to it. The counsel for the plaintiff then offered the writing in evidence. The defendant objected to its introduction and the trial judge excluded it subject to the exception of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">It is undoubtedly the law that a witness may be compelled to submit to inspection any writing or thing which he has used to refresh his recollection to enable the opposite party to see it and by cross-examination raise the question whether it is a proper memorandum for the purpose. This use and examination does not make the writing or thing evidence for either party, nor authorize it to be submitted to the jury unless for the purpose of testing the memory which has been refreshed by it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jeffs, </em>132 Mass. 5. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>133 Mass. 352. <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>206 Mass. 534. The further-rule that a document on notice produced to and inspected by the party calling for its production makes such document evidence for both parties, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>1 Allen, 53, 57, <em>Long </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>114 Mass. 77, <em>Cornell-Andrews Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>215 Mass. 381, 391, does not apply nor support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the contention of the plaintiff because the written statement was not produced at the trial in response to a notice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
