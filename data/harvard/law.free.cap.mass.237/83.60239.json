The injury to the plaintiff occurred about nine months later. The slab formerly had been the property of the defendant\u2019s father, who had occupied the premises, and after the father\u2019s death it had remained stored on the premises. The defendant had reserved no right so to store it. There was no evidence that its position had been changed during the tenancy. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence warranting a verdict for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">Tort for personal injuries due to the falling upon the plaintiff on April 16, 1915, of a marble slab which had leaned against the wall by the side of a platform at the foot of stairs leading from the kitchen to the cellar in a house occupied by the plaintiff\u2019s daughter as a tenant of the defendant.

It appears that originally the slab with other slabs had been stored \u2022' on the opposite side of the cellar by the defendant\u2019s father who then owned the premises, which after his death were occupied for some years by the defendant and his mother. And the present tenant is the second lessee after their occupation had terminated. During a period of some fourteen years the slab was moved twice by the defendant\u2019s directions, but it is not shown in whom title vested after the father\u2019s death, and the jury would have been warranted in finding that on the day of the accident the slab was in the same position as it was at the date of the beginning of the tenant\u2019s occupancy. It is plain from the terms of the contract when construed most favorably to the plaintiff that the defendant reserved no right of storage. The tenant was given exclusive possession and control of the premises and the defendant never assumed any obligation to maintain them in a safe condition. While the jury could find that when the tenant spoke to him about the cellar \u201che told me he would have a man come up and clean it all out for me the next day)\u201d and \u201cthat a man came the following day after they had moved in\u201d this was not an undertaking to make the premises safe for the tenant\u2019s use. Nor did the defendant\u2019s promise that he would have the premises \u201cfixed up in perfect condition\u201d amount to an express warranty of safety. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>206 Mass. 405. The case at bar does not come within <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>200 Mass. 514, 516, even if it be assumed the jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s servant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>cleaned the cellar left the slab in an unsafe condition. <em>Bertie </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>161 Mass. 504. The conditions were not concealed and the tenant with a full opportunity for inspection having taken the premises as she found them, the plaintiff has no greater rights. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Perham, </em>151 Mass. 162. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>156 Mass. 348, 350. <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>188 Mass. 292. <em>Conahan </em>v. <em>Fisher, 233 </em>Mass. 234. The verdict for the defendant was ordered rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"AdO\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
