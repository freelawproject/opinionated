There also was testimony of experts that \u201cthe cause of death was sclerosis of the coronary arteries, and it was undoubtedly caused by lead poisoning,\u201d and that lead poisoning was progressive and probably was due to the constant assimilation of the lead during the years he had been exposed to it. A single member of the Industrial Accident Board, to whom the claim was assigned for hearing, found that the employee\u2019s death was caused by sclerosis of the coronary arteries resulting from assimilation of lead which occurred during his employment as a plumber and that the final assimilation which caused the death occurred during his employment with the subscriber, his findings were confirmed by the board and, upon certification to the Superior Court, a decree was entered according to the decision of the board, from which the insurer appealed. <em>Held, </em>that the findings had substantial support in the evidence and were conclusive.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\">Certification to the Superior Court, under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, of a decision of the Industrial Accident Board and papers in connection therewith, affirming and adopting findings of a single member of the board, to whom had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>been referred a claim of the widow of John J.

I find that this assimilation of lead occurred during his employment as a painter, [plumber] resulting from the use of lead in his employment, and that the final assimilation which caused his death occurred during his employment with the subscriber in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">As in the analogous case of the verdict of a jury or the finding of a judge in an action at law, this finding is conclusive if it has a substantial support in the evidence. <em>Uzzio\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 331. We are of opinion that there was evidence to warrant it. The claimant testified that the employee had worked as a plumber since he was twelve years of age and that he was thirty-nine years of age when he died. The family physician testified that for the last few years he had treated O\u2019Donnell \u201cfor what he supposed was lead poisoning.\u201d The expert, after reviewing the history and symptoms, gave as his opinion that \u201cThe cause of death was sclerosis of.the coronary arteries, and it was undoubtedly caused by lead poison-</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ing.\u201d There was evidence that during the five months of his employment with Cronin, the assured, he was handling lead pipe, and his handkerchiefs and napkins would be colored red from red lead. On the testimony of the specialist it could be found that the lead poisoning, which was a contributing cause of the employee\u2019s death, was progressive, and probably due to the constant assimilation of the lead during the years he had been exposed to it. Without further reference to the evidence in detail, it is apparent that we cannot say that the finding of the board was unwarranted. - <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388. <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 98, 100. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>223 Mass. 179, 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
