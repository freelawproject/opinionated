There was evidence that, while loading stone under the observation of his foreman, the employee came to the foreman and said, \"I got an awful pain across &lt; here,\u201d pointing to his stomach, and that the foreman advised him to see a physician and sent him home in an automobile. The foreman testified that the employee did not explain \u201chow it happened;\u201d and that he, the foreman, knew nothing further \u201cabout it.\u201d On the second day after the injury, the day following the death, the employer made out a report in writing to the Industrial Accident Board, which he filed four days later, and in which, in describing the injury, he stated that the employee \u201cwas taken ill suddenly while at work and was removed to the hospital, the physician said he had a strain which caused a rupture of which he died of Friday.\u201d The report also stated the names of the hospital and of the attending physician. The Industrial Accident Board found that the employer \u201chad knowledge of the injury\u201d which under Part II, \u00a7 18 of the act dispensed with the requirement of a notice in writing contained in \u00a7 15. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was warranted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">Certification to the Superior Court, under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, of a decision of the Industrial Accident Board and papers accompanying it, that Levi Lapan, while employed in a quarry by the Sullivan Granite and Construction Company, received on July 10, 1919, an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, that the injury terminated fatally the next day, that the employer\u2019s report of the injury to the board, dated July 12 and filed on July 16, showed that on its date the employer had knowledge of the injury and of its fatal termination,\" and that his widow, the claimant, was entitled to compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">In the Superior Court by order of Lawton&gt; J., a decree was entered in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident \u2022 Board; and the insurer appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>L.

The employee received an injury on July 10, 1919, which resulted in his death on the following day. The insurer concedes that there was evidence from which it could have been found that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment and that death resulted therefrom. Written notice of the injury was not given as required by Part II, \u00a7\u00a715 and 16 of the act, and the question presented is whether there was evidence sufficient to warrant the finding of the Industrial Accident Board that the subscriber had knowledge of the injury under Part II, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">There was evidence that the employee received a strain while loading heavy stone into a wagon, which caused a rupture. The employer\u2019s foreman, Barry, under whom the employee worked, testified that another man was loading the team with the deceased, that \u201cthey were within his view, \u2014about ten or fifteen feet away from him,\u201d and that when the team was about half loaded the employee came to him and said \u201cI got an awful pain across here,\u201d\u2014pointing to his stomach; that Barry said, \u201cSit down, maybe it is cramps you got;\u201d that he advised him to see a doctor, and sent him home in an automobile. This witness also testified that the employee did not explain to him \u201chow it happened; that is all he knows about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On July 12, 1919, two days after the injury and after the employee had been removed to the hospital on July 11, where he died on the same day, the employer made a written report of the injury, which was filed with the board on July 16, 1919; in this report under \u00a7 D 3, calling for a description of how the injury occurred, it is stated that the employee \u201cwas taken ill suddenly while at work and was removed to the hospital, the physician said he had a strain which caused a rupture of which he died of Friday.\u201d Under \u00a7 E 3, in the report the name of the hospital and of the attending physician were stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">As the injury occurred before the enactment of St. 1920, c. 223, \u00a7 1, amending \u00a7 18 of Part II, the case is not affected by the amendment. The board found that on the date of the report the subscriber had knowledge of the injury; that finding must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>stand, if there is any evidence to support it. While it has been held by this court that a report of an injury by an employer, based upon an oral notice of it given by the employee, does not make out knowledge of the injury by the employer, and that oral notice is not knowledge, <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 31, 36, we are of opinion that in the case at bar it could not be ruled that the finding that the employer had knowledge of the injury was unwarranted. In referring to \u00a7 18 of Part II, it was said in <em>Brown\u2019s Case, supra, </em>that \u201cThe duty of the employer under this section is to make an investigation, find out the facts and to 'keep a record of\u2019 the facts, and having found out what the facts are then within forty-eight hours make a report of them to the Industrial Accident Board.\u201d It may reasonably be inferred from the statement in the report, that in the performance of its duty, the employer had investigated and found what the facts were; that inquiry had been made of the attending physician, who testified that on the day of the injury he was called to attend the employee, and asked him if he hurt himself, \u201cand Lapan said he thought he had when lifting. He said the first he felt was a quick pain take him when he was lifting a stone. . . . Lapan said .he had hurt himself by lifting, he thought. He felt it when he was reaching for a chain and lifting on the stone. He said it got him very sharp as if something had broken or given way and he had all the appearances of a man being hurt.\u201d The physician also \u25a0 testified that the employee\u2019s condition was acute and came on very suddenly; that this condition was caused by a strain. It is a rational inference from the statement in the report that the employer in the performance of its duty made an investigation of the facts, in the course of which it consulted the physician and from him obtained information upon which the report was made that \u201cthe employee had a strain which caused a rupture of which he died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The evidence that the employer\u2019s foreman, Barry, was present when the injury was received and knew that the employee was suffering great physical pain and had to give up work, together with the facts that the employer had knowledge that the employee had been removed to the hospital and was informed by the physician that he had suffered a strain which caused a rupture from which he died the next day, warranted a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>employer had knowledge of the injury. <em>Bloom\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 434. <em>Carroll\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 203. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 60. See <em>Walkden\u2019s Case, ante, </em>115.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We find nothing in <em>Brown\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at variance with the conclusion here reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
