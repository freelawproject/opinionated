The plaintiff claimed damages for faitee to deliver oil barrels. <em>Held, </em>that the last paragraph of the contract, by omitting the word \"oil,\u201d did not alter the express provision of the first paragraph; and that, if the defendant was not \"willing to ship\u201d oil barrels to the plaintiff, the contract did not require him to do so.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">Contract, upon an agreement in writing made by correspondence and described in the opinion.

The defendant received and cashed the plaintiff's check for $500 which accompanied the letter described in the opinion. On March 7, 1918, the defendant notified the plaintiff by letter that it had \u201cnot been able to decide how many [barrels] we will be able to ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>you but will have a decision in the matter not later than Saturday when we will advise you.\u201d On March 9, 1918, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it had decided, \u201cin accordance with the option contained in the last paragraph of our agreement of March 6, 1918, not to sell any of the empty barrels referred to in that agreement,\u201d and enclosed its check for $500. The plaintiff refused to receive the check and brought this action claiming damages for failure of the defendant to deliver oil barrels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked for the following rulings, among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">\u201c5. By the last clause of the agreement of March 6, 1918, the defendant was obliged to deliver to the plaintiff under the terms and conditions of said agreement all the oil barrels mentioned in said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">\u201c6. Under the terms and conditions of the agreement of March 6, 1918, by the acceptance of the $500 mentioned in said agreement on account of the purchase of the barrels, the defendant was obliged to deliver to the plaintiff all the oil barrels mentioned in said agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">The rulings were refused. The judge in substance charged the jury, subject to an exception by the plaintiff, that if the payment of $500, described in the opinion, \u201cwas simply to bind the bargain, there isn\u2019t anything due the plaintiff, because according to the bargain it was wholly in their hands as to how many barrels they would ship, if any,\u201d but that, if the $500 \u201cwas a payment on account\u201d then it stood \"for the payment of the number of barrels that they in the exercise of their option would ship under this contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">The jury found for the defendant; and thei plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-10\"><em>J.

The question whether it constituted an enforceable contract or only an offer or option, is not raised by the exceptions, as the trial judge ruled to the plaintiff\u2019s advantage that there was a contract. See <em>Burgess Sulphite Fibre Co. </em>v. <em>Broomfield, </em>180 Mass. 283. The question before us is, what are the obligations of the defendant and the rights of the plaintiff under the terms of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-21\">The interpretation of the first and principal paragraph is clear. The offer was to purchase as many of the empty barrels as the defendant was \u201cwilling to ship.\u201d At most this imposed on the defendant the obligation to sell to the plaintiff any of said barrels which it might sell to any one. This obligation, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>not broken, as there is no evidence that the defendant did sell or offer to sell any of the barrels. The next paragraph in the letter contains a reference to a \"cheque for $500 as payment on account.\u201d Apparently this was on account of any barrels that subsequently might in fact be shipped; although the jury, to whom the trial judge left the question, by its verdict found that the $500 was paid merely to bind the bargain. The only serious doubt as to the interpretation of the agreement arises from the omission of the word \u201coil\u201d in the last paragraph. This clause does not purport to alter the express contract set out in the first paragraph. If the intention was to compel the defendant to sell to the plaintiff all the oil barrels, as the plaintiff contends, presumably the letter would have so stated; and certainly the word \"oil\u201d would not have been specifically inserted in the first paragraph. In any event we cannot imply from its mere absence an obligation which to a great extent would nullify the express and clear provisions of the earlier and substantial part of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">In view of our construction of the contract, it is unnecessary to consider the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the judge\u2019s charge and his refusal to give the rulings or instructions requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
