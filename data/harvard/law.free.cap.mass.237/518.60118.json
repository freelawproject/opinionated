[the defendant] . . . West Elm Street, Pembroke,\u201d with a recital of the price and other terms of sale; that the plaintiff took possession and made considerable outlay for repairs and improvements; that at the time fixed for passing papers the defendant tendered a deed for only twenty-five acres of the farm, which the plaintiff refused to accept. The defendant owned no other land in Pembroke than the forty acre farm. There was nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff and the agent, who acted in good faith, had any other understanding than that a forty acre farm was being sold. The master ruled that, because the memorandum of sale did \u201cnot state it was all the property of\u201d the defendant \u201con said West Elm Street,\u201d it could not be enforced, and added \u201cEven if it had so stated, I should have to find, as I have in fact done, that\u201d the plaintiff had \u201cfailed to satisfy me that\u201d the agents \u201cwere authorized by the defendant to give a binder covering the land in dispute.\u201d <em>Held., </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-9\">(1) The memorandum, read in the light of the facts found by the master, should be construed as though it stated that the defendant was selling all his land in Pembroke;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-10\">(2) The ruling of the master that the memorandum could not be enforced because it did not state that the land sold was all the defendant\u2019s property \u201con said West Elm Street\u201d was wrong;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-11\">(3) The statement of the master that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy him that the agents \"were authorized by the defendant to give a binder covering the land in dispute,\u201d if treated as a conclusion of fact, was repugnant to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>finding as to the authority given to the agents, and must be disregarded; and if treated as a ruling of law, was wrong;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b547-5\">(4) The defendant was bound by the ostensible power' given to the agents as recited by the master, and therefore the agents had power to agree to sell the entire forty acre farm;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b547-6\">(5) A decree should be entered directing the defendant specifically to perform the contract to sell the entire forty acre farm.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on November 20, 1918, seeking specific performance of an alleged agreement by the defendant to sell to the plaintiffs a forty acre farm in Pembroke.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">In the Superior Court the suit was referred to a master.

It appears that Charles G. Clapp Company were a firm of \u201creal estate agents,\u201d and the master finds specifically \u201cthat the defendant listed his farm with the Charles G. Clapp Company as a forty acre farm and that the Clapp Company as his agents were authorized to advertize for sale a farm of this area.\u201d The plaintiffs in response to an advertisement of the agents wrote for further information, and received a typewritten slip headed \u201cForty Acre Pembroke Farm,\u201d which gave a full description of the buildings and also stated that the land consisted \u201cof about forty acres, fifteen acres tillage and twenty-five in pasture and wood,\u201d with the price and the amount of the initial payment which \u201cwould probably be accepted.\u201d The plaintiffs accompanied by an employee of the agents inspected the premises, which they believed and understood comprised a \u201cforty acre farm,\u201d and the defendant though present refrained from indicating in any way that the acreage to be sold was less than that stated in the advertisement, while as shown by subsequent events he intended to retain nineteen acres. See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>201 Mass. 301, 310. It is settled that having authorized the brokers to advertise and negotiate the sale of a \"forty acre farm\u201d the defendant is bound by their representations, and when the memorandum of sale was subsequently made there is nothing in the record to show that the brokers and the plaintiffs who each acted in good faith had any different understanding. <em>Lerned </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>9 Allen, 419. The plaintiffs on their return to the office of the brokers closed the bargain. A \u201cbinder\u201d of $100 was paid and a receipt given signed by the brokers which recited that the money was received as a \u201cDeposit on property of Thaddeus W. Chandler, West Elm street, Pembroke,\u201d the total price being $3,000 of which $500 was to be paid in cash when the papers were passed, and the balance of the purchase price \u201cwas to be made up by first and second mortgages 'to be placed.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiffs accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>paid this amount, and took possession of the premises where they expended considerable money in necessary repairs and some improvements. But when they were at the office of the brokers to pass the papers, and discovered on inspection of the title deed which was tendered that only twenty-one acres had been conveyed, the plaintiffs \u201cdeclined to accept the same or to go any further with the transaction, claiming that they had bargained for a farm of forty acres and that they were entitled to the same.\u201d The answer denies that Charles G. Clapp Company were authorized to sign the memorandum a copy of which is annexed to the bill, \u201cor that the real estate,to be sold contained forty acres of land, or that he authorized Charles G. Clapp and Company to sell all the land that the defendant owned on the easterly side of Elm Street, Pembroke.\u201d It was unnecessary that the memorandum should state that the property to be conveyed meant \u201call the property of said Chandler on said West Elm Street.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s title deed shows a purchase of the six parcels as an entire tract which constituted about forty acres and that he owned no other land in Pembroke. A farm of forty acres was advertised for sale. It was bought as a farm of forty acres by the plaintiffs, and it was all the land the defendant owned. The memorandum, the sufficiency of which in form to satisfy the statute of frauds cannot be questioned, and by which the defendant is bound, described the premises as property of the defendant \u201cWest Elm Street, Pembroke.\u201d R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 4.' <em>McGovern </em>v. <em>Hern, </em>153 Mass. 308. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Mass. 391, 392. The words of description in a deed are intended to refer to an estate owned by the grantor, and this is also the presumption in construing a contract for a future conveyance. \u201cIf the party who enters into the agreement in fact owns a parcel answering to the description, and only one such, that must be regarded as the one to which the description refers. With the aid of this presumption, the words \u2018a house and lot\u2019 on a street where the party who uses the language owns only one estate, are as definite and precise as the words 'my house and lot\u2019 would be; a description the sufficiency of which has been placed, beyond all doubt by very numerous authorities.\u201d <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>98 Mass. 545, 547, 548. <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>161 Mass. 161, 162, and cases- cited. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>170 Mass. 461, 463. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Bridges, </em>216 Mass. 416,420. While the terms of the memorandum cannot be contradicted or varied, paroi evidence is admissible to show what real property the defendant had, and to apply the contract to it. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>115 Mass. 413, 414, 415. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>157 Mass. 248, 250. And when thus read the contract means the same as if it had said \"all my land in Pembroke.\u201d <em>New England Dressed Meat &amp; Wool Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Worsted Co. </em>165 Mass. 328, 332. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>204 Mass. 346, 354. The ruling of the master that because the memorandum \"does not state it was on all the property of said Chandler on said West Elm Street\u201d it could not be enforced, was wrong. It is true that he immediately says, \u201cEven if it had so stated I should have to find, as I have in effect done, that the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy me that the Charles G. Clapp Company were authorized by the defendant to give a binder covering the land in dispute.\u201d But he already had expressly found as we have previously stated \u201cthat the Clapp Company as his agents were authorized to advertise for sale a farm of this area,\u201d namely forty acres, and no question is made or can be made on his preceding findings that the agents were held out to the plaintiffs as fully authorized to sell a farm of forty acres, and bind the defendant by a memorandum of sale. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Nudd, 8 </em>Pick. 9. <em>Lobdell </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>1 Met. 193. <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Knox, 7 </em>Cush. 371. The Aiding that the agents were not \u201cauthorized by the defendant to give a binder covering the land m dispute\u201d if treated as a conclusion of fact is not only repugnant to the finding just quoted, but to all the material facts which precede it, and therefore we are not bound to follow it. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>196 Mass. 592. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>234 Mass. 224. <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Waltham Laundry Co. </em>235 Mass. 330. If treated as a conclusion of law it is erroneous. The ostensible powers of an agent are his real powers, and limitations as between the prmcipal and agent of an apparently general authority not brought to the knowledge of third persons do not affect the rights of the .latter. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>174 Mass. 416, 423. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>197 Mass. 376,380. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>216 Mass. 140, 143. The decree dismissing the bill must be reversed, and a decree for the plaintiffs with costs is to be entered, the .terms of which are to be settled in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Ordered </em>accordingly\u201e</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
