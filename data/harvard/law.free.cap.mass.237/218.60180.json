On all the evidence the finding must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1Y\">\u201c2.

The defendant appealed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-12\"><em>D. II.

There was further evidence that the date for the passing of the papers was-set for October 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The decisive question presented is, did the defendant and the prospective customers intend that their oral agreement to the terms of purchase and sale embodied in the formal instrument should be presently binding upon them, or did they intend to be bound only upon the execution of the written, formal agreement. We think it plain that the parties intended the execution of the formal instrument to be more than a convenient memorial, or record of bargain which they had already concluded. The proposed agreement evidently was prepared with the purpose to bind the parties as against the defence of the statute of frauds and that of absence of mutuality of obligation. The \"terms of which\u201d agreement, that is, those contained in the proposed formal agreement, \u201cwere mutually agreeable to the parties.\u201d The purchasers \u201cdesired to show the agreement to their lawyer before signing it;\u201d the defendant agreed that they might do so and he also agreed \u201cto accept of the deposit\u201d and to \u201csign the paper\u201d if the papers were signed by noon of the next day. \u201cThe circumstance that the parties do intend a subsequent agreement to be made, is strong evidence to show that they did not intend the previous negotiations to amount to an agreement.\u201d <em>Ridgway </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 238, 268. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>14 Allen, 242. <em>Beach &amp; Clarridge Co. </em>v. <em>American Steam Gauge &amp; Valve Manuf. Co. </em>202 Mass. 177, 182. <em>Mississippi &amp; Dominion Steamship Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>86 Maine, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The plaintiff to recover must prove that the customers produced by him, or one of them, were ready, willing and able to purchase the premises on the defendant\u2019s terms at a time antecedent to the time his authority was revoked. So long as the terms of the oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>or written agreement remained in a state of a qualified acceptance, in the nature of things it cannot be said the plaintiff produced a customer ready, willing and able to become the purchaser of the premises on the defendant\u2019s terms. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>224 Mass. 577. <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>228 Mass. 343. <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Meserve, </em>228 Mass. 463. <em>Hampden Railroad v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>233 Mass. 411, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In the absence of fraud, of which there is no evidence in the case at bar, the defendant had the legal right to discharge the plaintiff without obligation to pay for services rendered in procuring a customer, at any time before the customers had finally and definitely accepted the terms of the agreement of conveyance presented by the defendant to the customers as the basis of their negotiation of sale. <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>179 Mass. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">It follows that the request that \u201cOn all the evidence the finding must be for the defendant\u201d should have been given. It also follows that the order of the Municipal Court, \u201cReport dismissed,\u201d must be reversed, and judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
