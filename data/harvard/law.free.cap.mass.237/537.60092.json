Equity Pleading and Practice, </em>Decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-6\">An individual contract of employment entered into by an employer with his employee for the term of one year, with provision for an extension for another year, whereby the employee agrees to work for the employer to the best of his skill and ability and in accordance with factory regulations during regular working hours and the employer agrees to pay him a stated rate per hour or the prevailing piece rate, is valid and may be required by the employer as a condition precedent to employment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-7\">The right of the employer to impose as a condition precedent to employment the terms of the above ,described \u201cindividual contract\u201d is not cut down nor abridged by the fact that a motive of the employer in obtaining the contract is to weaken the influence of a labor union and to impair the power of the strike.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-8\">A corporation which employed both union and non-union workmen made \u201cindividual contracts\u201d of employment, as above described, with many of its employees. A labor union having members among the employees endeavored to persuade the employer to desist from making individual contracts and to bargain collectively with the employees. The employer declined to comply. The officers of the union called a strike in the employer\u2019s factory, established picketing and issued circulars calling for assistance. In a suit in equity brought by the employer against the officers, agents and members of the union to enjoin the strike, there was evidence upon which a master, to whom the suit was referred, found that a purpose of the employer in making the \u201cindividual contracts\u201d of employment was to weaken the influence of the union and to impair the power of the strike and that the purpose of the strike, picketing and circulars was to compel the employer to abandon making \u201cindividual contracts.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-9\">, There also was evidence that the union maintained relays of pickets from twenty-five to seventy-five in number who patrolled the streets in the vicinity and at the main entrance to the factory and called in a loud voice \u201cThere is a strike on\u201d \u201cThis plant unfair to organized labor\u201d \u201cStrike honor\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be yellow\u201d \u201c Join us and help win.\u201d The suit was heard upon the master\u2019s report by a judge who confirmed the report and ordered a decree enjoining the strike.

The pickets wear conspicuous badges and are always present, when the employees, who are not on strike, are entering and leaving the works. The number of pickets has varied from about seventy-five to twenty-five. . . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-12\">\u201cThe company\u2019s factory is a very large one, covering an extensive acreage, and having a number of entrances. The main gate is on Eliot Street, where the largest patrol' has been maintained. . . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-13\">\u201cAs a general rule the conduct of the pickets has been orderly. The sidewalk has been left clear for the use of employees, and their free passage has not been interfered with. A few assaults have occurred, not at the place where the picketing is maintained, however, but at such a distance and so seldom that they must be regarded, I think, as individual instances and not as incident to or a part of the system of picketing or of the methods adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the strikers or as caused or sanctioned by the union in its conduct of the strike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\">\"In maintaining their patrol, the pickets walk up and down m the street, generally two abreast. They call out repeatedly \u2018There is a strike on\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Don\u2019t forget there is a strike on\u2019 \u2014 \u2018There is a big strike on.\u2019 In the early part of the strike, but not lately, there were cries of \u2018This plant unfair to organized labor\u2019 and infrequently \u2018Strike honor\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Join us and help win\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Don\u2019t be yellow.\u2019 The calls of the pickets are uttered in an \u2018out-of-door voice,\u2019 louder than is necessary in order to be heard, yet not loud enough to be a breach of the peace, or of itself to constitute disorder. The voices and attitudes of the pickets has at times been hostile, but not habitually so, and here too I find that such instances as have been shown to me of such demeanor have been individual and not a part of the general conduct of the body, or the scheme of the union in conducting the strike, nor have they occurred with such frequency as to charge those in control with responsibility therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">\u201cApart from the ordinary meaning and implication of the words used, and above given, under such circumstances, and the natural influence of the presence of the pickets as a constant reminder of the strike and of a spirit of criticism and some unfriendliness on the part of the strikers toward those who remain at work, I cannot say that in general the conduct of the pickets has been such as to frighten or coerce the other employees. Unless picketing, such as I have described under the circumstances is unlawful, I cannot find as a matter of fact that it was accompanied by injury or threats of injury or by disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">Other material portions of the master\u2019s report are described in the opinion. The suit was heard by <em>Pierce, </em>J., and, exceptions to the report having been waived, the judge confirmed the report and a final decree was entered \u201cthat an injunction issue restraining the defendants and each and every of them, their agents, servants and attorneys, from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s business by maintaining or carrying on any conspiracy for the purpose of compelling the plaintiff to withdraw contracts already entered into with individual employees or to cease signing contracts with individual empk^ees; or by persuading, inducing or enticing any persons now or hereafter in the employment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>plaintiff having contracts of employment with the plaintiff to break the same or to leave the plaintiff\u2019s employment; or by persuading, inducing, or enticing any persons seeking to enter into contracts of employment with the plaintiff or desirous of entering into the same from entering into such contracts of employment or working thereunder; or by continuing, maintaining, aiding or abetting in any manner the strike now in force against the plaintiff, either by intimidating, threatening, annoying or hindering any person or persons now or hereafter in the employment of the plaintiff or desirous of entering the same from entering into or remaining therein, or by annoying or interfering with such persons in proceeding to or from their places of abode and said premises or in pursuing their respective ways about the public streets, or by congregating in the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, or by establishing or maintaining pickets or patrols in the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, or by acting in any manner calculated to intimidate or annoy the plaintiff\u2019s employees or to continue, maintain, aid or abet the strike now in force against the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-3\">The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">St. 1913, c. 690, referred to in the opinion is as follows: \u201cNo person shall be punished criminally, or held liable or answerable in any action at law or in equity, for persuading or attempting to persuade by printing or otherwise any other person to do anything, or to pursue any line of conduct not unlawful or actionable or in violation of any marital or other legal duty, unless such persuasion or attempt to persuade is accompanied by injury or threat of injury to the person, property, business or occupation of the person persuaded or attempted to be persuaded, or by disorder or other unlawful conduct on the part of the person persuading or attempting to persuade, or is a part of an unlawful or actionable conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-5\"><em>H. R. Donaghue &amp; W. G. Thompson, </em>(P. <em>J. Donaghue </em>with them,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-6\"><em>G. F. Choate, Jr., (Joseph Wentworth </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b568-7\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_d\">A strike having been inaugurated at the plaintiff\u2019s factory on March ,5, 1920, suit is brought against the defendants as the officers, agents and members of the local lodge of the International Association of Machinists, a voluntary organization, asking for injunctive relief from a continuance of the strike and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>its maintenance by unlawful means. We shall hereafter refer to the defendants who hold the offices and exercise the powers described in the second paragraph of the bill as the union, and to the plaintiff as the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">It appears from the master\u2019s report, and the single justice could find, that in November or December, 1919, the company for the purpose of preventing machinists from leaving its employment after they had been trained as skilled workmen at considerable expense, and to retain a force of reliable workmen so that it could enter into and perform contracts for the manufacture and delivery of its product with reasonable assurance of success and dispatch, solicited individual machinists as they were hired to sign a contract, a copy of which is annexed to the report. By these contracts, which are referred to in the record as \u201cindividual contracts,\u201d the employee to the best of his skill and ability, and in accordance with factory regulations, agreed to work for the company during its regular working hours for one year from the date of employment, at a fixed compensation for each hour worked, or the prevailing piece rate. If at the expiration of the year neither party gave to the other notice in writing of termination, the agreement was to remain in force for the further period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The company could lawfully contract with machinists who desired to enter its service, and as no law of the land was violated, it could impose as a condition precedent to employment, the terms of the \u201cindividual contracts.\u201d <em>Plant v. Woods, </em>176 Mass. 492, 498, 502. <em>Folsom Engraving Co. </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>235 Mass. 269. And this right is not cut down nor abridged, as the single justice could say, by the master\u2019s further finding, \u201cthat another motive operating in the minds of officials of the company in desiring to obtain such contracts was that by means thereof the influence of the union would be weakened, and the power of the strike impaired.\u201d The means being legitimate, the company could protect itself from the interruption of its business and consequent damage from the action of discontented employees hired in the mass, and controlled at all times in their contractual relations, by the union of which they were members. <em>W. A. Snow Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>227 Mass. 382. <em>Coppage </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>236 U. S. 1,14. <em>Hitchman Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Mitchell, </em>245 U. S. 229. The union also was under no obligation whatever to recognize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cindividual contracts,\u201d and its members who had not thus obligated themselves could retire at will from the company\u2019s service leaving it to go into the labor market and obtain competent workmen if any could be found. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>232 Mass. 106. <em>Folsom Engraving Co. </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>235 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\">But the defendants as the master states were not satisfied to take this course, or any other action short of organizing and precipitating a strike which should so cripple the industrial powers of the company as to compel it to abandon its policy of selecting and hiring employees whenever and wherever it pleased. The situation very likely was becoming critical as \u201cThe contracts were steadily adopted by considerable numbers of the machinists, until on March 5, 1920, two thousand two hundred and twenty-two employees, of a total of about six thousand, had signed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We now take up the action of the union begun shortly after the company had requested signatures to the \u201cindividual contracts.\u201d It first protested. It next presented to the company an agreement which provided that none but union men should be employed when available, and shop committees appointed by the union should be recognized by the company as authorized to consider all disputes or grievances arising between members of the union and the company. It would seem almost unnecessary to say that the parties could have mutually agreed to this proposed form of contract. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bowen, supra. </em>But the company on February 7 declined, and insisted on its right to continue to make \u201cindividual contracts,\u201d and that this form of employment would be followed. The union replied, that it could not agree that its members should sign the \u201cindividual contracts,\u201d and it would have to \u201cinsist on the practice being discontinued.\u201d During further negotiations the proposed agreement submitted by the union was withdrawn, but the proposition then submitted demanded \u201cthe elimination of the individual contracts as it concerns employees of the machine department,\u201d and it would be \u201cabsolutely useless to consider this or any other proposition unless we can come to some agreement as to holding in abeyance the making of these (individual) contracts in the meantime,\u201d that is, \u201cfor six or seven days while the new proposition was being considered by the company, or until a conference with its board of directors could be arranged.\u201d The company on the same day received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>letter from the representative of the union which in substance formally withdrew the proposed agreement, and asked that shop committees to represent the workmen be formed by the machinists which should be recognized as their representatives by the company, and that the \u201cindividual contracts\u201d should be withdrawn. The union had voted on February 21 to strike, but this action had not been communicated to the company until March 5 when the strike was put in force, which on March 3 had been sanctioned by the grand lodge with which as a subordinate it was affiliated.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">It is expressly found that there was no dispute concerning wages, hours of employment, or general conditions of labor. The master reports that the union claimed before him that the strike was called in defence of \u201ccollective bargaining,\u201d while the plaintiff as alleged in the bill contended that it was ordered to compel the abandonment of the \u201cindividual contracts.\u201d The question whether the strike was lawful does not depend upon the choice of descriptive words. If the company surrendered to the union it must of necessity give up in the future the \u201c individual contracts \u201d as applied to employees of the machine department, and the demands even in modified form were not limited to \u201ccollective bargaining,\u201d but included an irrevocable abandonment of the \u201cindividual contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The defendant\u2019s answer to all the essential allegations of the bill is nothing more than a general denial, and on the master\u2019s findings with such material inferences of fact as properly could be drawn, the single justice as shown by the decree could determine, that the strike was for the purpose of compelling the company to do away with \u201cindividual contracts,\u201d and to recognize the rights of the union as stated by their representative, and, his conclusion not being plainly wrong, should not be reversed. <em>East Tennessee Land Co. </em>v. <em>Leeson, </em>183 Mass. 37. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>196 Mass. 592, 594. <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>208 Mass. 336. <em>Folsom Engraving Co. </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>235 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">But if notwithstanding the unequivocal and positive statements to the contrary appearing in the circulars it sent out broadcast, the contention of the union that the strike was solely to compel the company to adopt \u201ccollective bargaining,\u201d the decree should stand. \u201cWhatever may be the advantages of \u2018collective bargaining,\u2019 it is not bargaining at all, in any just sense, unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>voluntary on both sides. The same liberty which enables men to form unions, and through the union to enter into agreements with employers willing to agree, entitles other men'to remain independent of the union and other employers to agree with them to employ no man who owes any allegiance or obligation to the union. In the latter case, as in the former, the parties are entitled to be protected by the law in the enjoyment of the benefits of any lawful agreement they may make.\u201d <em>Hitchman Coal &amp; Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>245 U. S. 229, 250, 251. It has been uniformly held in principle by this court, \"that the employer is as free to make non-membership in a union a condition of employment, as the working man is free to join the union, and that this is a part of the constitutional rights of personal liberty and private property, not to be taken away even by legislation, unless through some proper exercise of the paramount police power.\u201d <em>Plant </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>176 Mass. 492. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>188 Mass. 353. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Mass. 294. <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>208 Mass. 336. <em>Cornellier </em>v. <em>Haverhill Shoe Manufacturers\u2019 Association, </em>221 Mass. 554. <em>Baush Machine Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>231 Mass. 30. <em>W.

The action taken also was intended to be an interference with existing contracts. Before the vote to strike was taken the union appointed committees who were instructed to investigate and report the names of members who had signed existing contracts in order that charges could be preferred against them, and some fifty-nine members who had signed contracts joined the strikers of whom five were in the ranks of the picketers. The circulars which were distributed as we have said directly and indirectly assailed the individual contract system. It is plain on the entire report that what was done was the outgrowth of concerted action manifested in various forms but all for the single purpose of forcing com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>pliance with the terms of the union. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Mass. 294. <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>208 Mass. 336. <em>Folsom Engraving Co. </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>235 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We are therefore of opinion that the injunctive relief granted is supported by the record, and the decree should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
