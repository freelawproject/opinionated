R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. R. 34(j). The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Ordered and Adjudged that the petition for review be denied. This Court has explicitly rejected Petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding the Commission\u2019s consideration of the Corpus Christi projects\u2019 indirect and cumulative effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d). Regarding the indirect effects of natural gas exports, \u201cthe Commission\u2019s NEPA analysis did not have to address the indirect effects of the anticipated <em>export </em>of natural gas ... because the Department of Energy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license the export of any natural gas.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. FERC, </em>827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016). As to the cumulative effects, \u201c[a] NEPA cumulative-impact analysis need only consider the effect of the current projects] along with any other past, present or likely future actions <em>in the same geographic area </em>as the projects] under review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50. This is exactly what the Commission did in this case, so it did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Additionally, the Commission did not violate the hard look doctrine. This Court will uphold an agency\u2019s discussion of alternatives \u201cso long as the alternatives are reasonable and the agency discusses them in reasonable detail.\u201d <em>Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, </em>938 F.2d 190, 196 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Here, the Commission reasonably concluded electric motors were not an appropriate alternative because they would result in additional environmental impacts, raised reliability concerns, and were unnecessary to meet the EPA\u2019s air quality standards. Thus, the Commission did not violate the hard look doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Finally, Petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding greenhouse gas emissions have no merit. This Court has already considered and rejected identical arguments relating to the social cost of carbon. <em>See EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, </em>828 F.3d 949, 956 (D.C. Cir. 2016). The same is true of Petitioner\u2019s arguments for using the projects\u2019 consistency with federal greenhouse gas emission reduction goals as a tool. This argument simply restates Petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding cumulative impacts, which this Court has rejected. <em>Sierra Club, </em>827 F.3d at 50; <em>see also WildEarth Guardians v. Jewell, </em>738 F.3d 298, 309-11 (D.C. Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for hearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
