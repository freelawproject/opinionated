See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b39-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed December 10, 2015, be affirmed. The Department of Labor\u2019s release of the Conciliation Agreement on appeal has mooted appellant\u2019s claim under the Freedom of Information Act. See Crooker v. Dep\u2019t of State, 628 F.2d 9, 10 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (per curiam). Moreover, the district court correctly dismissed appellant\u2019s Title VII claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Because appellant made no attempt at exhaustion, timely or otherwise, the doctrine of equitable tolling is not applicable here. See Dyson v. District of Columbia, 710 F.3d 415, 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Phillips v. Heine, 984 F.2d 489, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-22\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
