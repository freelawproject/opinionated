See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b52-23\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s May 11, 2016 order dismissing appellant\u2019s case be affirmed. The district court properly determined that appel-lees are entitled to judicial immunity from appellant\u2019s claim for damages. See Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 12-13, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). Any claims for injunc-tive or declaratory relief were properly dismissed as well. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). And, to the extent appellant sought review of orders issued by the appellees, the district court also correctly determined it lacked jurisdiction to grant that relief. See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct, 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-24\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>See Fed.
