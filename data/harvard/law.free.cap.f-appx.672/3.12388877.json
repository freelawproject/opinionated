See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing, and the motion to appoint counsel, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">ORDERED that the motion to appoint counsel be denied. In civil cases, appellants are not entitled to appointment of counsel when they have not demonstrated sufficient likelihood of success on the merits. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s November 30, 2015 order dismissing appellant\u2019s case be affirmed. Appellant\u2019s opening brief contains no relevant legal arguments, and he has therefore forfeited any possible arguments. See United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F.3d 488, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (\u201cOrdinarily, arguments that parties do not make on appeal are deemed to have been waived.\u201d). The court does not consider arguments raised only in a reply brief. Newspaper Ass\u2019n of Am. v. Postal Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 734 F.3d 1208, 1212 (D.C.
