R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cib. R. 34\u00ae. The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-23\">The U.S, Customs and Border Protection entered an order of expedited removal against Timothy Dugdale in January 2012, after determining that he had \u201cwillfully misrepresented]\u201d his business activities in order to gain admission to the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). <em>Dugdale v. U.S. Customs &amp; Border Prot., </em>88 F.Supp.3d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2015). The expedited removal order barred Dugdale from reentering the United States for five years. <em>Id. </em>Dugdale challenged the expedited removal order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>a habeas petition. Judicial review of the expedited removal order is limited to the grounds permitted by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e)(2). Dugdale also challenged the constitutionality of the expedited removal system and requested a declaratory judgment of U.S. citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The challenges to the expedited removal order are moot. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection vacated the expedited removal order on April 8,2015. On July 28, 2016, the Board of Immigration Appeals waived Dugdale\u2019s inadmissability based on his willful misrepresentation of his business pursuits. It also confirmed that vacating the expedited removal order lifted the accompanying five-year ban on Dugdale entering the United States. Therefore, the Board granted Dugdale advance permission to enter the United States as a nonim-migrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">To the extent that Dugdale brought and preserved a separate claim for a declaration of citizenship, it is denied. Dugdale has not stated a claim of U.S. citizenship under the law in effect at the time of the relevant events. <em>Montana v. Kennedy, </em>366 U.S. 308, 312, 81 S.Ct. 1336, 6 L.Ed.2d 313 (1961). Dugdale was not \u201cborn ... of ... a citizen of the United States,\u201d he was adopted by one. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 (1964). <em>See, e.g., Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 153, 155 (BIA 2001). Dugdale does not allege that before he turned 18 a naturalization petition was filed on his behalf or that he lived in the United States in his mother\u2019s custody as a lawful permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433(b) (1982). Therefore, Dugdale has not stated a claim to citizenship. This Court also does not have the power to naturalize him as a citizen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421; <em>I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, </em>486 U.S. 875, 884-85, 108 S.Ct. 2210, 100 L.Ed.2d 882 (1988). We have considered and rejected Dugdale\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Feb. R. Apr P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
