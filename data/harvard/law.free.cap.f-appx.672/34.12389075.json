See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed June 16, 2016, be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the complaint did not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Although the complaint alleged retaliation against appellant for his exercise of First Amendment rights, it did not clearly describe any activity by appellant protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
