R. App. P. 34(a)(2), D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j); the motion to reinstate defendant; and the motion to expedite designation of a merits panel, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed November 10, 2015, be affirmed. Although appellant nominally sought a declaratory judgment that his conviction was unlawful and his sentence was \u201cnull and void,\u201d Compl. at 30, such a judgment would be essentially equivalent to a writ of habeas corpus. See Monk v. Secretary of Navy, 793 F.2d 364, 366 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (holding an action for a declaratory judgment that a conviction is unlawful \u201cmust be construed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\u201d). As such, the proper avenue for appellant to seek the requested relief is a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, filed in \u201cthe court which imposed the sentence\u201d\u2014in this case, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">FURTHER ORDERED that the motions to reinstate defendant and to expedite designation of a three-judge panel be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
