See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed July 28, 2015 and November 4, 2015 be affirmed. Appellant raises no arguments on appeal challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that the District of Columbia was the only proper defendant for appellant\u2019s claims. See U.S. ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F.3d 488, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (argument not made on appeal is deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">With respect to appellant\u2019s claims of retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and unde'r 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 &amp; 1983, the district court correctly concluded that these claims were, on their face, conclusively time-barred. See Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1996). With respect to the claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 &amp; 1986, appellant failed to allege any act undertaken in furtherance of a conspiracy or any underlying class-based invidiously discriminatory animus for the alleged conspiracy. See Atherton v. D.C. Office of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 688 (D.C. Cir. 2009). And, \u201cbecause he did not state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3), there is no basis for relief under \u00a7 1986.\u201d Rodriguez v. Editor in Chief, 285 Fed.Appx. 756, 759 (D.C. Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s claims under District Columbia law, see Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988), and denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration or for leave to amend his complaint, see Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
