We vacate the district court\u2019s order in part and remand for further proceedings, in light of our holding in <em>United States v. Romeo, </em>122 F.3d 941 (11th Cir.1997), and the more recent holding in <em>United States v. Biro, </em>143 F.3d 1421 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-19\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">Giraldo-Prado pled guilty to count one of an indictment, charging her with illegal importation of heroin. The district court sentenced her to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment and three-years\u2019 supervised release. In addition, the district court ordered Giraldo-Prado deported as a condition of her supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-21\">At the sentencing hearing, Giraldo-Prado did not object to the district court\u2019s authority to order such deportation; however, the government objected based on our day-old holding in <em>United States v. Romeo, </em>122 F.3d 941 (11th Cir.1997). The district court refused to entertain the government\u2019s objection at the sentencing hearing because the government failed to file a previous objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-22\">Giraldo-Prado failed to object to the district court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction to order her deported as a condition of supervised release, but raises this issue on appeal. In response, the government agrees that the district court exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-23\">II.' <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-24\">We have noted that a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pen-dency of the proceedings. <em>United States v. Biro, </em>143 F.3d 1421, 1431 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Giraldo-Prado did not waive subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>In <em>Romeo, </em>we held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a) divests the district court of jurisdiction to order deportation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). <em>Romeo, </em>122 F.3d at 943-44. We concluded that \u201c[t]he INA [Immigration and Nationality Act], as amended by the IIRAIRA [Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act], does not provide for, or authorize, judicial deportation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Thus, we hold that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a) eliminates any jurisdiction district courts enjoyed under \u00a7 3583(d) to independently order deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">We further concluded in <em>Romeo </em>that \u00a7 1229a(a) extends \u201cto all pending cases because \u2018[intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction\u2019 are ordinarily given immediate effect, \u201cwhether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (citation omitted). Accordingly, \u00a7 1229a(a) was given immediate effect and applied to all cases pending on the date of enactment, April 1,1997. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">In <em>Biro, </em>we reasoned that \u201c[a]s a result of the enactment of \u00a7 1229a(a), \u2018 \u00a7 3583(d) authorizes a district court to order that a defendant be surrendered to the INS for deportation proceedings in accordance with the INA, but it does not authorize a court to order a defendant deported.\u2019\u201d <em>Biro, </em>143 F.3d at 1431 (quoting <em>Romeo, </em>122 F.3d at 943-44).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">Because Giraldo-Prado was sentenced on September 11,1997, after the enactment of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a), we remand with instructions that the district court delete the deportation condition. The district court may modify the sentence by deleting the deportation order and providing that the appellant, upon completion of her term of imprisonment, shall be turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for appropriate proceedings pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See Biro, </em>143 F.3d at 1431. Because these actions by the district court on remand will operate in Giraldo-Prado\u2019s favor, the district court need not hold a new, complete sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b) (providing that hearing and assistance of counsel are required before terms of supervised release can be modified unless relief to be granted is favorable to defendant). Alternatively, the district court, in its discretion, may hold a re-sentencing hearing if it desires to accomplish any other changes in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">VACATED in part and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
