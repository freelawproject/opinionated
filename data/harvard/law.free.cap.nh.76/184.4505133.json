Trial by the court. Transferred from the December term, 1910, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J., on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to an order of nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">The material part of the receipt signed by the defendants is as follows: \u201cReceived of Holman A. Drew, sheriff, for safe keeping, . . . one Reo touring car, all of the value of one thousand dollars, and which I agree to deliver to him or any other proper officer on demand, in good order and condition as the same are now in, free of all expense or charge for keeping; hereby waiving demand upon this receipt (within thirty days after judgment), as is by law prescribed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-14\">February 26, 1910, the plaintiff demanded of the defendants \u201cone Reo touring car of the value of one thousand dollars.\u201d The defendants were ready and willing to deliver the identical car for which they receipted, but the plaintiff declined to receive it as it was not worth one thousand dollars. At the date of the demand the car was in the same condition as when received from the plaintiff, but was worth only $177.50. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants, having described the car in the receipt as of the value of one thousand dollars, were obliged to deliver to him a car of that value; and that if the car receipted for was worth less than a thousand dollars, its delivery in as good condition as when received from the sheriff was not a fulfilment of their agreement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-15\"><em>Herbert I.

The case discloses no facts from which it could be concluded that they failed to comply with the terms of the contract. On the contrary, it appears that when the property was demanded they offered to return the car in as good condition as when received, and that the plaintiff declined to accept it. This was a compliance with, and not a breach of, the contract. Had they failed to comply with the demand, without legal excuse, they would have rendered themselves liable for the agreed value of the car, but in this they were not wanting. <em>Whittredge </em>v. <em>Maxam, </em>68 N.
