Rowell, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, associated himself with Alvah S. Sanborn, the defendant\u2019s intestate, and a number of others, to build a hall. It was a part of the agreement that Sanborn should give the association the land on which to build. The building was begun in 1884, but the association never completed it. All the associates except Rowell and San-born abandoned the undertaking as early as 1886. In 1890 Rowell notified Sanborn that he should have nothing more to do with the building, and Sanborn thereupon took possession of and afterward held it as his own property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>G.

Any member of the association could have maintained an action against Sanborn for an accounting as soon as he took possession of the building. None of the members, therefore, who either knew or ought to have known how he was holding the building can maintain such an action unless it was begun within six years from the time of his taking possession. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Slayton, </em>63 N. H. 402; <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Studley, </em>159 Mass. 17, 19; P. S., c. 217, s. 3. Powell knew in 1890 that Sanborn was holding the building adversely to him and to the association, but did not begin this action until 1898. Consequently the statute is a bar to its maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
