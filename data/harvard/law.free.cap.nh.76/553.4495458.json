Transferred from the April term, 1912, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J., on an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-14\">The act of the respondent upon which the state relies to uphold the information consisted in displaying upon a building in Portsmouth, in which she had an office, the following sign: \u201cDr. Julia J. Chase. Osteopathic Physician.\u201d The sign was eighteen inches long and fourteen inches wide, and the words thereon were legible from the opposite side of the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-15\">An osteopathic physician is one who practices osteopathy, a method of healing in which no drugs are employed and no surgical operations performed. The respondent is such a physician and a graduate of the American School of Osteopathy, from which she received the degree of Doctor of Osteopathy and a diploma certifying that such degree had been conferred. The diploma is and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>prominently displayed in her office during all the time that the sign heretofore described was displayed upon the building. The respondent does not and did not use drugs nor perform surgical operations. She has never \u201creceived the medical degree\u201d or a \u201clicense which constituted at the time an authority to practice medicine under the laws of the state. \u201d Laws 1897, c. 63, <em>s. </em>12.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-5\"><em>Ernest L. Gwptill, </em>solicitor, and <em>Samuel W. Emery, Jr., </em>for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-6\"><em>Edward H. Adams </em>and <em>Arthur 0.

The case is here upon an order of the superior court directing that the respondent be discharged if the facts found do not constitute a violation of law; otherwise that she be adjudged guilty. Facts showing the use made by the respondent of the title of \u201cDr.\u201d are reported, but whether the manner of use made of the title was such as to convey the impression that the respondent was a legal practitioner of medicine is not found.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The question therefore is not whether from these facts reasonable men might conclude that the manner of use made of the title was such as to convey the impression the respondent was a medical practitioner, but whether that is the only conclusion which they could make. As to this we are of the opinion that reasonable men would not be so bound. It is unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\n<em>Respondent discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
