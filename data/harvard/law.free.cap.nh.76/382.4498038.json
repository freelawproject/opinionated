A physician, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>also a member of the board of health of the defendant town, was first called to treat him, and subsequently the patient was quarantined by the board in the plaintiff\u2019s house. A nurse and medical treatment were provided. The plaintiff\u2019s wife assisted in caring for the patient, but the board made no contract with her or her husband to employ her, or to pay for her services. As the protection of the public required the destruction of the bedding used by Hautaula when he was taken sick, it was destroyed by the board. The court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover for the services of his wife or for the bedding destroyed, and he excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-5\"><em>Conrad W.

He was as much a public officer as highway surveyors, police officers, and firemen <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Vinalhaven, </em>65 Me. 402; <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>67 Me. 294; <em>Ogg </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>35 Ia. 495), for whose act while in the discharge of a public or governmental duty, even if wrongful, the town is not responsible, in the absence of a statute making it responsible therefor. <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>62 N.
