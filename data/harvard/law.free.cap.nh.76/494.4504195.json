Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the January term, 1912, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J., on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of motions for a nonsuit and the direction of a verdict in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove the following facts: October 18, 1907, the plaintiff, who had previously been employed as a chopper, was set at work taking away boards from the carriage of the defendant\u2019s sawmill. One Ouillette was the sawyer. On the afternoon of the first day of this employment, a glove on the plaintiff\u2019s right hand became entangled in the machinery, and when the carriage started to return to the saw the plaintiff was dragged with it. When he was fifteen or twenty feet from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>saw he shouted to Ouillette to shut off the power, but this the latter failed to do, and the plaintiff was dragged against the moving saw and suffered the loss of his right arm. The speed of the carriage was such that it could have been stopped in a distance of six inches. Ouillette was incapable of acting with reasonable prudence in case of emergency, and this fact was known to the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-5\"><em>John M. Stark, Arthur S. Healy, </em>and <em>Martin &amp; Howe {Mr. Howe </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-6\"><em>Burnham, Brown, Jones &amp; Warren {Robert L. Manning </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-7\">Bingham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEcf\">Aside from the question of the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of care, it was incumbent upon him to prove (1) that his injury was due to some negligent act or omission of Ouillette, (2) that Ouillette was an incompetent man for the service he was called upon to render, and (3) that his incompetency was, or ought to have been, known to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">There was evidence from which all three of these propositions could have been found. It appeared that after the plaintiff was caught upon the carriage Ouillette had a clear opportunity to stop the machine and prevent the accident, which he failed to do; that he was a \u201cjumping Frenchman\u201d \u2014 a person afflicted with a nervous disability which rendered him incapable of exercising care in case of an emergency or when under excitement \u2014 and that this disability was, or ought to have been, known by the defendant. The particular evidence upon the last proposition was that at the time of the accident Ouillette had been in the defendant\u2019s employ as a sawyer for over three months; that the men at the mill, during the noon hour, were in the habit of getting Ouillette excited by hallooing and pointing at him, so that they might see him jump; and that on one of these occasions the defendant told them not to do so, as some of them were liable to get hurt. The order is,</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
