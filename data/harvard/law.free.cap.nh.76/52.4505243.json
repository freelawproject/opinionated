The plaintiff\u2019s farm, situated in that town, was taxed to him in the non-resident list, which was duly committed to the defendant as collector. The plaintiff had due notice of the tax, but neglected to pay the same before January 1, 1910. The defendant advertised the farm for sale and delivered a copy of the notice in person at the office of the <em>Independent Statesman </em>in Concord, to be published in accordance with section 2, chapter 61, Public Statutes, and also mailed a like copy to the <em>Bristol Enterprise, </em>a newspaper published in Bris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tol in Grafton county, to be advertised therein. Soon after January 1, 1910, the plaintiff, in order to prevent the sale of his farm for taxes in accordance with the published notice, paid to the collector, as fees for advertising, the sum of $30.77, taking the collector\u2019s receipt therefor. If this sum demanded by the defendant had not been .paid, the collector would have sold the property for taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">The items in the taxation of costs which the plaintiff claims are unlawful are for travel from Landaff to Concord and return and for travel from Landaff to Bristol and return, aggregating $22.60.
