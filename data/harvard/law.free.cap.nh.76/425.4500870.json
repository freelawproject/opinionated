If the words the testator used are given their ordinary meaning, by \u201cexpenses,\u201d in the final clause, is intended those incident to the settlement of the testator\u2019s estate, for they are the \u201cusual and ordinary expenses of administration,\u201d and are to be deducted \u201cbefore my estate vests\u201d in the trustee; and by \u201cexpenses\u201d mentioned in the preceding clause is intended those incident to the administration of the trust, for they are the expenses incident \u201cto the care ... of said estate by my said executor, acting as trustee,\u201d and are not to be deducted until the trust estate is finally distributed. It is probable, therefore, that the expenses the testator had in mind in the final clause are not the same as those in the clause which precedes it; in other words, that the final clause is not intended to explain what expenses are meant in the clause which precedes it, but to limit the estate of which the testator\u2019s sisters are to have the income. It follows, therefore, that the testator probably intended to give his sisters the whole of the income of the trust estate, when he said that the expenses incident to its, care and administration are to be deducted from the residuum before it is delivered to the residuary legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">All concurred</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
