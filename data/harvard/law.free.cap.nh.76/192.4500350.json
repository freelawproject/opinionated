She intended to remove the heater before the lease expired, but prior to that time an agreement was made by which she was to have the store for a second term of two years, with a right of renewal for a like term. The second lease was not written until after the first expired. Hayes subsequently assigned the second lease and sold the heater to one Gray, and he sold it to the defendant, who removed it while Gray was occupying under the lease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-15\"><em>Irving E.

The authorities do not sustain the plaintiffs' contention that a tenant cannot remove fixtures after his lease expires. His right to remove them continues as long as he remains in possession of the premises by consent of the lessors. <em>Penton </em>v. <em>Robart, </em>2 East 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">2. Notwithstanding the weight of authority is in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Hayes surrendered the heater to them when she accepted the second lease (19 Cyc. 1068; 13 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law 651), the court is inclined to follow the minority view of the law, which makes the ownership of the heater depend on the intention of the parties at the time the second lease was made <em>(Radey v. </em>McCurdy, 209 Pa. St. 306, \u2014 103 Am. St. Rep. 1009; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>39 Mich. 150, \u2014 33 Am. Rep. 362; <em>Second Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Company, </em>69 Wis. 501; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Simonson, </em>126 Ia. 716; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Gayle, </em>134 Ky. 330; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>82 Neb. 302; <em>Bergh </em>v. <em>Company, </em>136 Fed. Rep. 368); for that is the view of the law this court is accustomed to apply to decide the question of ownership. <em>Dame </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>75 N. H. 38; <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>62 N. H. 657, 660; <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>62 N. H. 627, 629; <em>Cavis </em>v. <em>Beckford, </em>62 N. H. 229; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>57 N. H. 514, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 right to maintain this action depends, therefore, on whether Hayes intended to give them the heater when she accepted the second lease, or did anything which estops the defendant to deny that that was her intention; for both parties derive their title to the heater from her. What she intended and whether he is estopped are both questions of fact. Consequently the only question of law raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 exception is whether there was any evidence to sustain the court\u2019s finding. That question is not open to the plaintiffs, for the evidence is not transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
