The defendants demurred generally. Transferred from the Hay term, 1910, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-14\">In 1905, the plaintiff town \u201cvoted to authorize the water commissioners to extend the water mains from Draper\u2019s corner, so called, along Maple avenue to and including the Sullivan County Fair Association grounds and Pinehurst, so called, provided the people along the line shall guarantee the water commissioners eight per cent upon the expense of extending the water main.\u201d Thereafter the defendants signed the following document: \u201cHaving the .welfare of the town at heart, we, citizens of Claremont, stockholders of Sullivan County Fair Association, and others, do hereby agree to guarantee the eight per cent required by the town to extend the water main from Draper corner along Maple avenue to the Sullivan County Fair Association grounds and Pinehurst, so called; this guaranty to last only until rental of said main shall pay eight per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cent. \u201d This offer was accepted by the town and the extension was made. The annual rental has been less than eight per cent of the cost of the extension, and the defendants refuse to pay the difference. The prayer of the bill is for a decree reforming the contract so that it shall read \u201c eight per cent a year in any one year, \u201d and for a decree for the unpaid deficiency.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-5\"><em>Rosea W. Parker </em>and <em>Ira G. Colby </em>(by brief and orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-6\"><em>Hurd &amp; Kinney </em>and <em>Edward E. Leighton (Messrs.

While it is true that the fact the guaranteed rental is an annual one is not stated in terms, yet it is manifestly so intended, and such is the legal interpretation of the language used. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Green, </em>67 N. H. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">No ground is shown upon which the bill can be maintained as a more convenient remedy than a suit in assumpsit against the signers of the agreement. In such a suit the plaintiff will be entitled to a judgment and execution against each defendant for the whole amount due. It is not apparent wherein equity could give a remedy more ample or more efficient. <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Davison, </em>71 N. H. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Whether the plaintiff should be permitted to amend by making this proceeding a suit in assumpsit is a matter for the consideration of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Ali concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
