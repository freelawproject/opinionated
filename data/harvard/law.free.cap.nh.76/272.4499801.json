February 7, the plaintiffs filed a bill in equity praying that a deed of real estate in which they were named as grantees be reformed so as to include the tract purchased by the defendants, and also a bill praying that the defendants be enjoined from cutting timber on the land in dispute. After a hearing, an injunction was issued upon the plaintiffs filing a bond in the sum of $500, conditioned to save the defendants harmless from all loss, cost, damage, or expense to which they might be subjected by reason of the two suits. In January, 1908, the bill for reformation was dismissed and the injunction was dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">At a hearing upon the motion for an assessment of damages, the plaintiffs offered to prove that the defendants were not the legal owners of the land at any time while the injunction was in force. The evidence was excluded, and the plaintiffs excepted. The court found that the defendants\u2019 loss on the timber was $400.79, their reasonable expenses on account of the injunction petition were 815, and their expenses on account of the proceeding for reformation were $191.85. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion to limit the defendants\u2019 expenses to $15 and the defendants\u2019 motion to assess their damages at $607.64 were both denied, subject to exceptions. The court assessed the defendants\u2019 damages at $500.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>Elwin L. Page </em>and <em>Streeter, Demond &amp; Woodworth (Mr. Page </em>orally), for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-7\"><em>Marlin &amp; Howe </em>and <em>Remick &amp; Hollis (Alexander Murchie </em>orally), for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-8\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az1\">The plaintiffs concede that as to them the defendants\u2019 title is good, but contend that they should not be compelled to pay the loss caused by their unlawfully preventing the defendants from removing the timber, because, as they say, there are persons who might legally have done what they did. They neither defend through these persons nor contend that these persons have any claim against them because of the injunction. If there is a rule which permits a person to do, without incurring liability, whatever any one may legally do <em>(Jenkins </em>v. <em>Parkill, 25 </em>Ind. 473), it does not obtain in this jurisdiction. <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>67 N. H. 529, 531. In this state a person must defend in his own right. <em>Roberts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>v. <em>Rowe, </em>75 N. H. 36. He cannot defend in the right of others unless he claims through them <em>(Fowler </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>68 N. H. 270, 272) ; and this seems to be the general rule, in so far, at least, as actions of this kind are concerned. <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>19 Col. App. 532; 22 Cyc. 1042. The question whether the plaintiffs might have shown that others were making such persistent claims to the land that it is improbable the defendants would have cut the timber, even if they had not been enjoined, is not raised and has not been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The injunction was granted on condition that the plaintiffs give \u201ca bond with sufficient sureties in the sum of $500, to answer to said defendants for any loss, cost, damage, or expense to which they may become subject on account of said suit or this injunction.\u201d If it were not for this order, the defendants\u2019 recovery would be limited to their taxable costs. On the other hand, procuring the injunction bound the plaintiffs to comply with the conditions on which it was issued. Consequently the order limits both the amount the defendants can recover and the items of expense which are chargeable to the plaintiffs. In other words, the amount the defendants can recover in excess of their taxable costs and the items which compose it both depend on the terms of the order. If the language the court used is given its ordinary meaning, or for that matter any meaning of which it is fairly capable, the defendants must have understood that they could not recover more than $500 in case the plaintiffs failed; for the decree provides that the plaintiffs are to answer to them in that sum \u2014 not to pay whatever \u201closs, cost, damage, or expense\u201d they may sustain. The decree provides in terms that the plaintiffs are to answer for any expense to which the defendants may become subject on account of said suit. Therefore the court did not err when it refused to limit the costs of suit to $15, nor when it limited the defendants\u2019 damages to $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled: case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
