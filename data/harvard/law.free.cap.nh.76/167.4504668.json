The latter company covenanted to \u201cput the hotel in suitable condition and repair at the commencement of said term, both inside and out,\u201d and to furnish a new pump, and the defendants agreed to allow $325 \u201cfor said repairs and pump\u201d out of the last instalment of the first year\u2019s rent. May 4, there was executed a supplementary agreement whereby the defendants were to allow the Hotel Company a further sum not to exceed $700, for the purpose of enabling the lessees \u201cto fulfil said covenant contained in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>lease\u201d and to purchase the necessary furnishing for the hotel, said sum to be paid upon presentation to the defendants of the original bills. The Hotel Company purchased the carpeting and directed that it be charged to the defendants; but when a bill was sent to the defendants, they returned it with a denial of their liability.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>Arthur 8.

If the words they used are given their ordinary meaning, the Hotel Company were to put the hotel in complete repair inside and out; and when that was done, the defendants were to pay them $700 and allow them $325 more out of the last instalment of the first year\u2019s rent, provided the repairs and equipment cost as much as $1,025. As there is nothing to show that this was not the sense in which the words were used, the order must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
