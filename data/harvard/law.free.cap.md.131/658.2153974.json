L. Briscoe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-16\">(Seal) Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">On the 10th of x\\pril, 3917, the Board of Plducation of Prince George\u2019s County filed in the Circuit Court for that county a petition against the County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County setting out in greater detail the matters we have already stated and others and praying that a writ of mandamus he issued directed to the County Commissioners -of Prince George\u2019s County, and \u201ccommanding them to indicate in writing what item or items of the budget- of the petitioner have been denied in whole or in part, and the reasons for the denial in whole or in part of the respective items.\u201d The County Commissioners answered the petition admitting all of the essential facts set out therein but denying the petitioner\u2019s right to the writ prayed for. The petitioner de-, murred to the answer, and this appeal is by the Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County from the order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Court below overruling its demurrer and dismissing its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The theory upon which the prayer for the writ was resisted and the writ was denied is that the budget presented by the Board of Education is not an itemized and detailed school budget within the meaning of the law, and it is further contended by the appellee in this Court that section 26 of Chapter 506 of the Acts of 1916 \u201cgives a discretion\u201d to the County Commissioners \u201cand at the same time seeks to-control it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The teams of the Act are explicit and there can be no-serious doubt as to its purpose or meaning, What the law in terms requires of the \u201ccounty of education\u201d is that it shall prepare, \u201csubject to the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education and on and with the advice of the county superintendent,\u201d an <em>itemized </em>and <em>detailed </em>school budget,, showing the amount of money needed for permanent improvements and repairs, and for current repairs, furniture-for old buildings and maintenance and support of the schools during the succeeding school year, and also the estimated total amount that will be received from the State, and the amount \u201cthat will be needed to be raised by local taxation.\u201d Now, it is quite clear, that the terms \u201citemized and detailed\u201d do not mean that the budget is to show only the <em>total </em>amount needed for permanent improvements and repairs, the <em>total </em>amount for current repairs, the <em>total </em>amount for furniture for old buildings and the <em>total </em>amount needed for maintenance and support of the schools, during the succeeding school year. In the <em>Imperial Dictionary </em>a \u201cdetail\u201d is said to be \u201can individual part; an item; a portion; a particular,\u201d and \u201cdetailed\u201d is said to mean \u201cexact; minute; particular.\u201d The same author gives as the meaning of the word \u201citem,\u201d \u201can article; a separate particular in an account; as, the account consists of many items.\u201d In the <em>Century Dictionary and </em>Cyclopaedia, a \u201cdetail\u201d is defined as \u201can individual part; an item; a particular; as, the account is accurate in all its details,\u201d and the following definition is given of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>word \u201citem,\u201d \u201can article; a separate particular; a single detail of any kind; as, the account consists of many <em>items.\u201d </em>The statute requires the county board of education to expend the taxes received by it in accordance with the <em>items </em>of their budget, and provides that if the total amount requested for any one year by the County Board of Education to be raised by local taxation exceeds 40 cents on each one hundred dollars of the assessable property in the county, and such additional tax is not approved and sanctioned by the Board of County Comissioners, the County Commissioners shall indicate in writing what <em>Hem </em>or <em>items </em>of the annual budget \u201chave been denied in whole or part, and the reasons for the denial in whole or in part of the respective items.\u201d Without attempting to go over all of the items of the budget presented to the County Commissioners by the petitioner in this case, if is apparent we think that some of the items are not in accordance with the requirements of the statute. For instance, the item \u201cIncidentals (including janitors\u2019 salaries), * * * $7,500.00,\u201d and the item \u201cRepairs to Old Buildings, * * * $5,000.00.\u201d These items certainly can not be said to contain a <em>detailed </em>statement of the particulars that go to make up the total amounts of the items, and we concur in the conclusion of the learned Court below that the budget furnished by the petitioner was not a compliance with the terms of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Bih in our view that is not the controlling feature of this ease. The County Commissioners did not require further details of any of the items set out in the budget except that relating to salaries, but acted upon the budget, as modified by further details in regard to salaries, and levied amounts, aggregating the sum of $94,267.80, which, while they were in excess of 40 cents on each one hundred dollars of assessable property, were less than the sum asked for in the budget. Having declined to approve and sanction the amount asked for by the Board of Education, it became encumbent upon the County Commissioners, under the expressed terms of the statute, to indicate in writing what items of the budget were denied in whole or in part and their reasons for such denial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>and such statement on the part of the County Commissioners is made necessary for the reason that the Board of Education ys required by the statute to expend all taxes received by it in accordance with the items of their budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The. statute leaves to the discretion of the County Commissioners the allowance of the amount asked for in excess of 40 cents on each one hundred dollars of assessable property in the county, and that discretion can not be controlled by the courts. But the law imposes upon them the <em>ministerial duty, </em>when they do not allow the amount asked for in the budget in excess of 40 cents on each one hundred dollars of assessable property, of indicating in writing what items of the budget are denied and their reasons for such denial. This provision can hardly be said to be directory only. Xt was designed, not only to guard against an arbitrary refusal of the County Commissioners to levy the amount deemed necessary by the Board of Education for public school purposes, but also to advise the County Board of Education of the items to which it is required to limit the expenditure of the school tax. <em>Worcester Co. </em>v. <em>School Comr\u2019s., </em>113 Md. 305 and <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>129 Md. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We think for the reasons stated that the petitioner was entitled to the writ prayed for, and we must accordingly reverse the order of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Order reversed, with costs, and case remanded in order that a writ may issue as prayed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Code, Art. 77.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
