Doremus, Addison G. Du Bois and others, of Washington, D. C-, parties of the first part, entered into a contract with John P. Miller, of Virginia, party of the second part, which recites : \u201cThat whereas the said parties of the first part are the ownersi for the United States of the entire right, title and interest in a certain invention of said Doremus, being an improvement in cotton ginning machinery for which application for letters patent of the United States was filed in the United States Patent Office, May 17, 1907, by said Doremus, and whereas said party of the second part is desirous of securing said entire right, title and interest in and to said invention, and in and to the letters1 patent, which may be granted for said invention by the United States of America..\u201d The agreement then provided that in consideration of the sum of $50,000, to be paid by Miller as therein specified, the parties of the first part did thereby grant, bargain and sell unto him, his heirs and assigns, \u201call the right, title and interest in and to said invention, and in and to any improvements thereon that may be made by said Doremus, and in and to the letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>patent for said invention, and for said improvements thereon that may he hereafter granted by the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On the 27th day of June, 1907, Doremus assigned and transferred to Miller \u201cthe entire right and. interest in and to any and all patents which may be obtained in accordance with this agreement in countries foreign to the United States on said cotton gin, and on any and all improvements, thereon,\u201d in consideration of the agreement that he was to' receive one-half of the profit, in bonds, stocks or money, realized from the sale of letters patent in the United States or in foreign countries, and on the first day of July, 1907, Miller, in consideration- of ten dollars, \u201cand other valuable consideration,\u201d sold to Addison G. Du Bois \u201cone-fourth part of the entire net proceeds from said invention derived from either United States or foreign patents on said invention, whether the proceeds shall be in money, stocks, bonds or other thing or things of value.\u201d Thereafter the National Cotton Improvement Company was organized under the laws of Maine1, and its entire capital stock of $1,500,000, except a few organization shares, was issued to Miller for the American rights to the Doremus invention, and the Doremus patents were assigned to that company by Miller and hy Doremus. There was also formed a corporation called the Doremus Holding Company, to which Doremus assigned his application for the foreign rights, and the stock of the latter company was held by Doremus, Miller and Daniel J. Sully. Miller gave to one John J. Welch an option on the majority of the stock of the National Cotton Improvement Company, and through Welch the D'oremus invention was brought to the attention of the appellant in this case, John Hays Hammond. Mr. Hammond referred the matter to Mr. Sully, with whom he was interested in a plan for warehousing cotton, for investigation and a report as to the value of the invention, and Mr. Sully reported that in his opinion the Doremus invention was very valuable and \u201cwould revolutionize the whole cotton industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Welch failed to make the payments under his option, and his rights became forfeited, and on the 28 th of December, 1909, John P.

This agreement was signed by Daniel J. Sully as the holder of 29,965 shares of the common stock. On the same day a syndicate composed of Daniel J. Sully, John Hays Hammond, Harris Hammond, Mont D. Rogers and D. B. Atherton was formed for the purpose of selling three million dollars of preferred stock and $750,000 of the common stock of the General Cotton Securities Company. This syndicate agreement recited that Mr. Sully had acquired from the General Cotton Securities Company $3,000,000 of its preferred stock and $3,000,000 of its common stock, and provided that each member of the syndicate was to use his best endeavors to sell the $3,000,000 of preferred and $750,000 of the common stock; that the preferred stock was to be offered fox sale at the \u201cprice of $100 for each $100 par value of preferred stock and $25\u2019 par value of common stock if payments therefor he made in one sum, but for the price of $105 for like amount of preferred and common stock if payment be made in instalments.;\u201d that Daniel J.

Mr. Sully gave Mr. Bright an order on the United States Trust Company of Washington for certificate A-3 for 30,000 shares of preferred stock of the General Cotton Securities Company, and. Mr. Bright got the certificate of stock from the Trust Company and brought it back to the meeting. Certificate A-3 was then cancelled, and certificate No. 5-A was issued to John P. Miller for 10,000 shares, and certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>No. 6-A for 4,000 shares was issued tO' Daniel J. Sully, syndicate manager. The 10,000 shares were transferred by Miller to Daniel J. Sully, syndicate manager, and a certificate therefor, being certificate 7-A, was issued to him. Certificates 6-A and 7-A were then returned to the Hnited States Trust Company by Mr. Bright and receipted for by that company, and the remaining 16,000 shares were turned into the treasury of the General Cotton Securities Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It thus appears from the evidence referred to that the American patents for the Doremus invention were purchased by Miller in 1907 from Doremus and others interested therein for fifty thousand dollars. The National Cotton Improvement Company, which will hereafter be referred to as the Improvement Company, was then organized with a capital stock of $1,500,000, and the- American patents were transferred by Miller to that company in consideration of 96 per cent, of its entire capital stock, and the patents were assigned by Miller and by Doremus to the company. Hpon the organization of the General Cotton Securities Company, Miller transferred to that company the stock of the Improvement Company in consideration of the payment of $37,500 in cash, and $1,000,000 of the common stock and $1,000,000 of the preferred stock of the latter company. It also appears from the evidence that the $37,500 was paid by Mr. John Hays Hammond to Mr. Bright, who .paid the same to Mr. Miller, Mr. DuBois, Mr. Doremus and others interested therein, and that Mr. Hammond had previously paid the $12,500, being the balance of the $50,000 which Mr. Miller had agreed to pay for the American rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">From the organization of the General Cotton Securities Company in January, 1910, until the fall of 1910, Mr. Sully was actively engaged in trying to sell the stock of the Securities Company, and to dispose of the foreign rights in the Doremus invention. To that end he made several trips to England, and a number of tests were made of cotton gins constructed in accordance with the Doremus patent. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cost of these tests as well as the personal expenses of Mr. Sully were borne by Mr. Hammond. In September and October, 1910, serious differences arose between Mr. Hammond and Mr. Sully, which resulted in Air. Hammond telling Mr. Sully lhat he would not make any further advances to him for his personal use, hut that he would make further efforts himself to sell the stock of the company and would pay the cost of any further tests of the Doremus gin. Mr. Sully then threatened to issue a prospectus and ff&gt; sell the stock of the company, and Mr. Hammond told him that if he did he would \u201crepudiate\u201d the prospectus in every paper in the country. The attitude of 'Mr. Hammond being, according to his own testimony, that it would not be honest to sell the stock of the company until the value of the Doremus invention could be fully demonstrated by further tests of tbe gin.

C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Under a contract made with you the 28th day of December, 1909, between John Hays Hammond and myself jointly, acting as a syndicate, which was to be composed of John Hays Hammond and myself and one or more other parties, wherein we entered into a contract with you whereby we were to organize a corporation with the capital stock of $7,000,000 common and $3,000,000 preferred stock, which preferred stock was to be 7% cumulative, with a preferment as to assets upon dissolution without participation in profits beyond 7%. And also we desired to obtain from you your interest in the National Cotton Improvement Company, for the General Cotton Securities Company; and also obligated ourselves to finance the said General Cotton Securities Company by the sale of the preferred stock of the General Cotton Securities Company, and to use our best endeavors to sell the preferred stock to meet the obligations which we entered into with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cUnder that contract now, therefore, please take notice that the General Cotton Securities Company was formed, under the requirements of that contract the , syndicate was formed; also under the requirements of that contract I have used my best endeavors to get the consent of my co-partner (John Hays Hammond) to co-operate with me in placing this stock where it could be sold. I have been unable to so do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cTherefore, to absolve myself from any liability financially or morally respecting the contract I herewith inform you that I will on your demand proceed as far as I can to turn back to you legally all and any of the right or interests that I may have under this contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">Daniel J.

Mr. Hammond and Mr. Sully met again on the 6 th of November, when, according to the testimony of Mr. Hammond, friendly relations between him and Mr. Sully were partially restored, with the understanding that Mr. Hammond would take up active measures to establish the value of the Doremus invention with the view of selling the stock of the company, and arrangements were made for a meeting of the \"directors. On the 16th of November the directors met at the office of the company in Washington and the meeting resulted in a further breach between Mr. Hammond and Mr. Sully, and no action on the part of the directors. Following this meeting W. D. Doremus and A. G. DuBois wrote to Mr. Hammond, Mr. Sully and Mr. Bright, as the board of trustees, advising them that they were interested to the extent of three-fourths in the trust certificates issued by them to John P. Miller, and stating: \u201cOur information is to the effect that an alleged meeting of the board of directors held at the office of the company on Wednesday, the 16th inst., the previous minutes of the board of directors, or what was. supposed to be the previous minutes of the board of directors (which were, in fact, made by a board differently constituted from those who were present the 16th inst.), were physically altered in an attempt to release the gentlemen interested in the syndicate, for whom Daniel J. Sully was acting, from the obligation to pay into the treasury of the company, upon demand made therefor, the sum of $1,600,000, as provided for under the contract made by the former president of the company with said Sully, acting for said syndicate, under date of January 7, 1910.\u201d The letter also demanded that the board of trustees request the president of the company to call a special meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of removing4 the then board of directors. On the same day Messrs. DuBois and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Doremus wrote to Mr. Atherton, the treasurer of the General Cotton Securities Company, calling his attention to the fact that there was in his possession the preferred and common stock of the <em>Improvement Company; </em>stating that they had been informed of certain illegal action taken by the board of directors of the Securities Company on the 16th of November which was greatly to their detriment as the beneficial owners of three-fourths of the trust certificates issued to John P. Miller, and demanding, that he retain in his possession the stock of the National Cotton Improvement Company until a proper board of directors could be elected by the stockholders of the Securities Company. They also wrote to Mr. Hammond informing him that they were interested in the stock held by Mr. Miller, and that \u201cAmong the conditions on which the delivery of the stock of the General Cotton Securities Company by it to Mr. Sully was the agreement that he made on behalf of the syndicate to pay in the treasury of the said company the sum of $1,600,000;\u201d that they had been informed that an attempt had been made to alter the contract made by Mr. Sully with the company so as to relieve the syndicate of the payment to the company of said sum of $1,600,000, and that they were advised that such action was absolutely illegal. The letter concluded by stating that they would hold him personally responsible for any injury suffered by them by reason of any change or transfer of the stock then standing in the name of John P. Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Mr. DuBods and Mr. Doremus also wrote to* Mr. Miller, on the 18th of November, 1910, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">Under the several agreements in existence between us you have been authorized to act in our behalf and interests in relation to the stock in the National Cotton Improvement Company, which stood in your name alone, and as you know, we acquiesced in the agreement made by you in December, 1909, with the syndicate represented by John Hays Hammond and Daniel J. Sully. In carrying out the agreement in behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of the syndicate, we are all aware of the fact that the General Cotton Securities Company, through its president and secretary, secured a contract from Mr. Sully made in behalf of the syndicate that was greatly to the advantage of all of us, as under its terms the syndicate is required to pay into the treasury of that company upon demand $1,600,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">Through our consent you have been the representative member for our joint interests on the board of directors of the General Cotton Securities Company, we assuming, of course, that you would in every way protect our mutual interests. If we have been correctly informed, you have failed to appreciate that the recent action taken by the board of directors of the General Cotton Securities Company, or what is supposed to be a board of directors, at a meeting held in this city on Wednesday, the 16th inst., has jeopardized our rights. We feel sure that you must appreciate that in agreeing to the minutes of the previous meeting held by the board of directors in New York on January 7th, 1910, should be physically changed so as to relieve the syndicate from its obligation to pay into the treasury of the company $1,600,000 upon demand, practically places us in the position of being at the mercy of the syndicate. Consequently, we demand that you take necessary steps to at once protect the interests of all of us in the stock of the National Cotton Improvement Company, which was turned over by you through the syndicate to the General Cotton Securities Company, by such appropriate action in the premises that will impress that stock with the trust that you represent in our behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">Yours respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">W. D. Doremus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">A. D. Du Bois.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">It is apparent that the theory upon which Mr. Doremus and Mr. Du Bois acted in writing these letters was that Mr. Hammond was personally liable for the $1,600,000 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Mr. Sully agreed, to pay to the Securities Company, and that the course they pursued was based upon the assumption that there had been a formal meeting of the board of directors of the Securities Company on the 16th of November, 1910. There are no minutes of such a meeting in the record, and there are no grounds upon which Mr. Hammond could be held liable for the sum named.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">After receiving the letter from Mr. Du Bois and Mr. D'oremus, Mr. Hammond tried to arrange for a meeting be^ tween himself and Mr. Du Bois and Mr. Doremus, and went to Washington on November 19th to meet Mr. Doremus for the purpose of explaining to him that he was not liable for the $1,600,000 referred to in Mr. Sully\u2019s contract with the company, and that the directors had not attempted on November 16th to do anything that would prejudice his interest. While in Washington on the 19th of November Mr. Hammond learned from Mr. Bright that Mr. Sully had executed a contract on behalf of the Securities Company with the Fordyce Company, which involved the stock of the Ser curities Company. Mr.' Bright would not explain to him the exact terms of the contract, and Mr. Hammond immediately telegraphed to Mr. Atherton, the treasurer of the Securities Company, who was then in Little Rock, Arkansas, that he had just learned of an \u201cattempted contract\u201d between Mr. Sully, on behalf of the Securities Company, and the Fordyce Company, but that he was not acquainted with the details, and directing him to wire Mr. Fordyce, Sr., in St. Louis, that Mr. Sully had no authority to make the contract; that it was in violation of the syndicate agreement, and absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">A special meeting of the board of directors of the General Cotton Securities Company was called, and was held at the New York office of the company on the 23rd day of November, 1910. The minutes of that meeting show that the return of the $1,600,000 of the preferred stock of the company to the treasurer of the'company was approved; that s' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the letter of Daniel J. Sully to John P. Miller of October 12th, 1910, a copy of which was sent by Mr. Sully to Mr. Hammond, was presented to the board, and with it the following communication from Mr. Hammond to Mr. Miller referring to Mr. Sully\u2019s letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cSince the receipt of that letter I have made great efforts to carry out the contract of December 28th, 1909, which is referred to in Mr. Sully\u2019s letter to you. I find I also am entirely unable to carry out the contract of December 28th, 1909, which is referred to in Mr. Sully\u2019s letter to you. I find I also am entirely unable to carry out the unfulfilled provisions of that contract, and I, therefore, join with Mr. Sully in informing you that I will, on your demand, proceed as far as I can to turn back to you legally all and any of the rights or interests that I may have under that contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">John Hays Hammond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">P.

Mr. Miller stated that he had written a letter to Mr. Sully accepting the proposal contained in his letter of October 12th, 1910, \u201cand demanded the redelivery to him of the capital stock of the National Oot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ton Improvement Company as on the terms set forth in Mr. Sully\u2019s letter.\u201d Thereupon the board of directors adopted the following resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cWhereas heretofore this company entered into an agreement with Daniel J. Sully as set forth in the minutes of the first meeting of the board of directors whereby there was transferred to this company 4,712 shares of the preferred and 9,672 shares of the common stock of the National Cotton Improvement Company for certain considerations moving from this company, to wit, $3,000,000 at par of common stock of this company, and $1,400,000. of preferred stock of said company; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cWhereas thereby and thereunder Daniel J.

Miller for the return of the National Cotton Improvement Company\u2019s stock aforesaid, and that a refusal on their part in their opinion will inevitably precipitate a long and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>expensive litigation and otherwise complicate and disastrously affect the affairs of this company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201cResolved further, That this company hereby accepts the offer of the vendors to rescind the contract aforesaid and to return to it the balance of this company\u2019s capital stock, available for this purpose, to wit, $2,995,100 of common stock of said company and $1,-400,000 par value of its preferred stock which, together with the preferred stock already returned, constitutes the entire stock outstanding under said contract, less 49 shares held by the directors and officers of the company; and that the certificates for all of said shares of this company, except the directors\u2019 shares, be and they are hereby called in and cancelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cResolved further, That the treasurer and secretary \u25a0of this company be and they are hereby authorized and directed to return the shares of the capital stock of the National Ootton Improvement Company and the certificates therefor in accordance herewith, and to cancel on the books of this company the aforesaid shares \u25a0of this company, except the 49 shares of common stock which are not available for this purpose, and to take such other and further action in the premises as may be necessary or proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201cResolved further, That this company execute by its proper officers an assignment of all of its right, title and interest in and to any applications of John R. Rordyce for claimed improvements upon the Doremus 'Grin to National Ootton Improvement Company, the \u25a0owner of the said original patents to whom same under the circumstances and in equity and good faith belong, provided the said National Ootton Improvement Company pays to this company by way of reimbursement the expenses incurred by it or its officers incident to the preparation, filing and assignment of said applications, not, however, to exceed the sum of $165.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201cResolved, That in addition to any other notice that may be required by the foregoing action, that notice of the cancellation of the certificates of the capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>stock of this.company be given by tbe treasurer to the United States Trust Company, Washington, D. C., being certificates A-6 for 4,000 shares of the preferred stock of said company, and A-7 for 10,000 shares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On the day following the meeting of the directors just referred to Mr. Hammond left New York on a trip to Russia. After his return to America, Willard D. Doremus and Addison G. Du Bois filed a bill of complaint against him, the National Cotton Improvement Company, Daniel J. Sully, Drank S'. Bright, John P. Miller and the United States Trust Company, on the 3rd of March, 1911, in the Sfipreme Court of the District of Columbia. The bill is a lengthy one, covering sixteen pages of the printed record, and it is only necessary in this case to set out the prayers for relief, which were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the court pass a decree herein directing the defendants, Daniel J. Sully and Prank S. Bright, to deliver to the plaintiff, Willard D. Doremus, trust certificates Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and .10, representing the shares of common stock of the General Cotton Securities Company, and deliver to Addison G. Du Bois trust certificates Nos. 12, 13, 16 and 17, representing the shares of common stock of the General Cotton Se- ^ curities Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201c3. That the court pass a decree herein directing the defendants, John Hays Hammond, Daniel J. Sully and Prank S. Bright, upon the presentation and delivery to them of the trust certificates of beneficial interests Nos. 4 to 10, inclusive, and 12, 13, 16 and 17 by the plaintiff, to deliver to said plaintiffs the common stock represented thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201c4. That the court pass a decree herein authorizing and directing the United States Trust Company to forthwith deliver to the plaintiff Doremus out of the 10.000 shares of preferred stock now in its possession 5.000 shares and to the plaintiff Du Bois 2,500 shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201c5. That the defendant, the National Cotton Improvement Company, be enjoined <em>pendente lite </em>and permanently from entering into any contract of any kind or description with anyone in relation to the Doremus patents or any improvements thereon, or transferring upon its books any stock that now stands in the name of John P. Miller, trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201c6. That the defendant, John P. Miller, be enjoined <em>pendente lite </em>and permanently from entering into any contract of any kind or description with anyone in relation to the stock now in his possession and standing on the books of the National Cotton Improvement Company in the name of John P. Miller, or John P. Miller, trustee, and that the court pass a mandatory order in this cause demanding that John P. Miller forthwith return to the lawful treasurer of the General Cotton Securities Company all the stock or the certificates for shares of stock of the National Improvement Company received by him from the treasurer or any other officer of the General Cotton Securities Company either previous to or subsequent to the 23rd day of November, 1910, and to assign or reassign any patents or applications for patents in relation to any improvements made upon the cotton gin conceived by the Thomas Pordyee Manufacturing Company, or John R. Pordyee, and assigned by Pordyee, or the Pordyee Manufacturing Company to the General Cotton Securities Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Daniel J. Sully answered the bill on behalf of the National Cotton Improvement Company as its first vice-president, in which all of the allegations of the bill were admitted. The Supreme Court held that Mr. Sully \u201cwas the instigator of the suit; that he was made a party defendant to conceal the same, and to make use of whatever advantage the act afforded the plaintiff by his position as defendant,\u201d and on the 27th of November, 1911, entered a decree dismissing the bill. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia and obtained a reversal of the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of the Supreme Court. In disposing of the case on appeal, Chibe Judge Shepakd said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cThe Court below was right in holding that no jurisdiction had been acquired of the National Cotton Improvement Company by the service of the process in this case. * * * The answer for said corporation, purporting to have been filed by Daniel J. Sully, as vice-president, did not have the effect to bring the corporation before the court. The corporation had a president, as well as a vice-president; and without pausing to consider whether Sully was actually its vice-president at the time, it does not appear that he had any authority as such officer to enter its appearance, or answer for it in this suit. <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>1 App. D. C. 94-106. It does not seem that it was to its interest to appear voluntarily. On the contrary, its answer would seem to have been filed by Sully in the interest of the plaintiffs. The entire record of the case furnishes an example of corporate formation, stock watering and manipulation that is made possible by the character of the corporation laws in force in many of the States, as well as by the absence of restraining legislation in the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cAssuming, what may reasonably be inferred from the circumstances in evidence, that Sully stimulated this litigation, desiring thereby to accomplish some purposes of his own, it does not follow that plaintiffs shall lose any substantial rights they may be entitled to under the allegations of their bill. It remains to be inquired what these are, if any, and if they may be adjudicated in the present proceeding with the parties properly, before the court. So far as inquiry into the corporate proceedings of the General Cotton Securities Company, looking to the correction of its minutes, and the legality of its election of directors and other officers, is involved, that corporation is a necessary party. But being a foreign corporation, if it were a party, the courts of this jurisdiction would have no power to control its internal affairs and the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>its corporate functions. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Mutual Reserve Fund Life </em>Asso., 14 App. D. C. 154-175, 43 L. R. A. 390; <em>Barley </em>v. <em>Gittings, </em>15 App. D. C. 427-443. It does not appear that the administration of the internal corporate affairs of the National Cotton Improvement Company is necessarily involved, nor would it be a necessary party to a mere determination of the right to the ownership of its capital stock as between rival claimants thereof, if such were the object of this suit. * * * Whatever rights the plaintiffs may have are narrowed to the ownership of the shares of the General Cotton Securities Company held in trust by the United States Trust Company, as against John P. Miller. Said Miller is a necessary party to this determination; and whether as against him the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree determining the question of ownership is a question that can not be considered because Miller is not before the court. It was error to dismiss the bill because of the belief that Sully had instigated it against the other defendants. The decree will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded, whereupon the plaintiffs may have it retained for a reasonable time for an opportunity to obtain service of process upon John P. Miller, and to amend their bill if so advised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">After the ease was remanded to the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Anbersoiu in disposing of it, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">\u201cThis is a suit by Willard D. Doremus and Addison G. Du Bois seeking certain injunctive relief against John P. Miller, and further seeking to have delivered to the plaintiffs by the other defendants certain certificates for shares of common stock and preferred stock in the General Cotton Securities Company, which certificates are located within this District and are claimed to belong to the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201cThe case came on for final hearing before Mr. Justice Wright, and a decree was entered dismissing the bill. An appeal was prosecuted from such decree, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the Court of Appeals reversed the same, remanding the case for further proceedings upon the sole question of the ownership of said certificates of stock as against John P. Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals said: \u2018Whatever rights the plaintiffs may have are narrowed to the ownership of the shares of the General Cotton Securities Company held in trust by the United States Trust Company, as against John P. Miller. Said Miller is a necessary party to this determination, and whether as against him the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree determining the question of ownership, is a question that can not be considered because Miller is not before- the court.\u2019 <em>(Doremus </em>v. <em>N. C. Imp. Co., </em>41 W. L. R. p. 8.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals further said, in overruling the motion for rehearing: \u2018Whatever may be the concession regarding the ownership of this stock by the other defendants, who moreover have no interest therein, there is and could be no concession by Miller, who was never a party to this-case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201cAt that\u2019 time Miller had not been-brought into the case either by- personal service or publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cSince the case was remanded, service by publication has been obtained against. Miller, and a decree <em>pro confesso </em>entered, and subsequently made absolute, against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201cThe case is now submitted to the court for the entry of a final decree directing the delivery of the certificates claimed by the plaintiffs. In this situation, the Court of Appeals having held that the other defendants have \u2018no interest therein,\u2019 and having remanded the case for the sole purpose of determining the ownership of said shares \u2018as against John P. Miller,\u2019 this court, in view of Miller\u2019s default and the <em>pro confesso </em>against him, must necessarily enter a decree directing the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs the certificates for common and preferred stock in the General Cotton Securities Company as claimed by them. Whether the General Cotton Securities Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>will recognize them when presented for transfer in view of their supposed cancellation, is a question with which this court can have no concern, and can only be determined in the proper forum in a proceeding in which said company may be made a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u2022 \u201cA decree will accordingly be entered directing the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs the certificates for stock in the General Cotton Securities Company as claimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In accordance with this opinion, the Supreme Court on the 2nd day of June, 1913, passed the following decree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201cThis cause came on for final hearing this term and was duly argued by counsel, and it appearing to the court that the complainants are entitled to the relief sought by the bill of complaint, filed in this cause, and thereupon and upon consideration thereof, it is this 2nd day of June, 1913, adjudged, ordered and decreed that the defendants, Daniel J. Sully and Frank S. Bright, be and they hereby are jointly and severally commanded to deliver to the complainant, William D. Doremus, or to his attorney, trust certificates Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, representing respectively shares of common stock of the General Cotton Securities Company, and to Addison G.

H. Borden,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Mr. Lordan took the certificates, letters and copy of the decree to Mr. Campbell, secretary of the General Cotton Securities Company, who was in the office of Mr. John Hays Hammond, and asked him to transfer the stock in accordance with the letters annexed to the certificates. Mr. Campbell told him that the books of the company were not in the office, but bad been sent to' the resident agent in Wilmington, Delaware, and that he could not therefore make the transfer, and declined to take the certificates. Mr. Lordan then went to see Mr. Atherton, treasurer of the General Cotton Securities Company, on the 17 th of June, and presented the certificates, letters and copy of the decree and requested him to make the transfer of the stock. Mr. Atherton, according to Mr. Lordan\u2019s testimony, told him that he had no authority to do so; that the books were in the office of Mr. Baldwin, the attorney for the company, and that he would not make the transfer unless he received instructions to that effect from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the attorney. Mr. Atherton testified that when Mr. Lordan presented the certificates of stock, etc., some time in July, he told Mr. Lordan that he could not transfer the stock; that, in the first place, he did not have the stock hooks in his possession, and did not know where they were, and, in the second place, the certificates would necessarily have to be signed by Mr. Hammond, and that Mr. Hammond was out of the city, and, in the third place, that he would not transfer the stock without the advice of counsel. He further testified as follows: \u201cHave you had any experience in corporation affairs? A. Yes-, sir. Q. And you say you told him that you would not transfer the stock even' if the certificates were signed by the President, without the advice of counsel? A. Yes, sir. Q. What, if anything, did Mr. Hammond do or say to you along about that time to prevent or influence your action in the transferring or non-transferring of that stock ? \u25a0A. Nothing whatever. I had not seen Mr. Llammond.\u201d After his interview with Mr. Atherton, Mr. Lordan received the following letter from Mr. Baldwin, dated July 31st, 1913 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asg\">\u201cJohn J. Lordan, Esq.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">115 Broadway, New York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">I have been unable so far to get any instructions as to the transfer of the certificates of the General Cotton Securities Company, but have advised the company - that in my opinion the stock having been lawfully can-celled, the certificates therefor are void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Regretting the delay, which I trust has not inconvenienced you, in replying to your correspondent, I remain,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">\u00a5m. Woodward Baldwin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Mr. Hammond \u201e stated in his testimony that the certificate had never been presented to him and that he had not been requested to transfer the stock. At the time of the demand made upon Mr. Campbell and Mr. Atherton, he was at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and he did not hear anything of it until some time thereafter when he heard of it through Mr. Baldwin; that he never gave Mr. Baldwin any instructions in reference to the matter, and when he heard of Mr. Iordan\u2019s request through Mr. Baldwin, he said to Air. Baldwin: \u201cWell, now, Baldwin, this is a legal question, and it is up to you as attorney of the company.\u201d When he was asked what he meant by saying that it was a legal question, he said that on November 23rd, 1910, the stock had been called in and cancelled at the meeting of the hoard of directors of that date. That he knew, as a business man, that it would be dishonest for him to sign certificates of fully paid-up stock when the consideration for that stock had been returned to Mr. Miller, and when the stock represented no assets. \u201cIn other words, I would he committing frand and certainly should not have done it unless I had the very best legal advice or possibly even an order of the court to protect myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">It further appears that there had never been any meeting of the directors of the General Cotton Securities Company after the meeting of November 23rd, 1910. At that time all of the stock of the National Cotton Improvement Company, which represented the patent rights to the Doremus invention of the cotton gin and improvements thereon, and which represented the only assets of the General Cotton Securities Company, was turned over to Air. Miller, and the stock of the latter company had been declared cancelled by the board of directors. Mr. Hammond, in 1913, had no interest in the National Cotton Improvement Company, and had upon his return from Russia in the early part of 1911 resigned as the president of that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On the 21st of Afay, 1915, Addison G. DnBois brought this suit in the Superior Court of Baltimore City against John Hays Hammond. The declaration alleges that the plaintiff was, on the 23rd day of November, 1910, lawfully in possession of a certain certificate or certificates represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ing 2,500 shares of the preferred stock of the General Cotton Securities Company and 2,275 shares of the common stock of said' company; that he on said day lost said stock, and that the same came into possession of the defendant by finding-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cYet, defendant, well knowing the said certificates to be the property of the said plaintiff and rightfully to belong and appertain to him, but contriving and fraudulenty intending craftily and subtly to deceive and defraud the plaintiff in this behalf, has not as yet delivered said certificates to the plaintiff, although often so requested to do, and has hitherto wholly refused so to do; and afterwards, to wit, on or about the twenty-third day of June, 1913, at the ifface aforesaid, converted and disposed of said certificates of stock to his own use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cWherefore the plaintiff says he is injured and has sustained damages to the amount of $477,500. Wherefore the plaintiff brings this suit and claims damages in the sum of four hundred, seventy-seven thousand, five hundred dollars, <em>exclusive of </em>all interests and costs of this suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The second count of the declaration, which was filed on the 21st day of November, 1916, is substantially the same as the first. The defendant pleaded that he did not commit the wrong alleged, and also filed a special plea to which reference need not here be made. To the second count the defendant pleaded the general issue plea, the plea of limitations, and a further plea to which it is unnecessary to refer. The trial of the case in the Superior Court, which apparently extended over a period of several weeks, and the record of which contains between fifteen and sixteen hundrd printed pages, resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for $238,750.00, which was reduced by the Court 1\u00bb $123,775.00, for which amount the judgment from which this appeal is taken was entered in fayor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The Record contains fifteen exceptions, the last one of which relates to the ruling of the Court on the prayers. The Court below granted the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cThe jury are instructed as a matter of law; that the plaintiff\u2019s title to the stock mentioned in the declaration is settled by the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columhit in Equity Cause 30002, and when, the plaintiff presented the decree of said Court, defendant\u2019s letter and said stock to the proper officers of the corporation for transfer (if the jury so find), then he had the right to have it transferred on the corporation hooks to his name and certificates for his shares issued to him, and if the jury find from the whole evidence, the defendant personally, or by his agents or attorney, prevented that being done, defendant was guilty of a conversion of said stock and their verdict should be for plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The Court rejected the prayers of the defendant, asserting that the plaintiff had offered no legally sufficient evidence, under the pleadings, of any conversion by the defendant of the certificates of stock or shares of stock of the General Cotton Securities Company mentioned in the declaration, and that the verdict of the jury should therefore he for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The primary and important question to ho determined is, therefore, whether the Record contains any legally sufficient evidence of a conversion by the defendant of the stock mentioned in the declaration. In considering this question it is necessary to keep in view the precise nature of the inquiry. In the case of <em>Dietus </em>v. <em>Fuss, </em>8 Md. 148, the Court used this language: \u201cBefore expressing an opinion in reference to' the plaintiff\u2019s- third prayer it is- proper to- notice some of the principles relating to the subject of conversion, for the action of trover cannot he maintained without a conversion. It- may be either direct or constructive, and therefore may he proved directly or by inference. When the plaintiff fails- in proving an actual conversion it will he necessary for him to' give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>evidence of a demand and refusal having been made at a time when the defendant had the power to give up- the goods. A demand and refusal are only evidence of a prior conversion , which may be explained and rebutted by evidence to the contrary. 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>secs. 642, 644; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>11 Mess. &amp; Wels. 363.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the case of <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>47 Md. 506, Judge Alvey said: \u201cThere is nothing in the facts stated, and which have been found by the jury, that would, in the least, justify a pretension that there had been any such conversion of the personal effects of the plaintiff as would entitle him to recover under the first count of his declaration. There was no evidence whatever of any intention on the part of the defendants either to take to themselves the property in the goods., or in any manner to deprive the plaintiff of them. To entitle him to recover on the count in trover, such proof would have been required. <em>Dietus </em>v. <em>Fuss, </em>8 Md. 148; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Lillystone, 8 </em>Exch. 431, 442; <em>Burroughes </em>v. <em>Bayne, </em>5 H. &amp; N. 296; <em>Pillott </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>2 H. &amp; Colt. 72.\u201d In the case of <em>Balto. Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dalrymple, </em>25 Md. 269, the Court said: \u201cIn the case last cited <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>11 M. &amp; W. 362), the plaintiff\u2019s assignee in bankruptcy relied on a demand and refusal as the ground of their .action, the conversion having taken place before the <em>find </em>in bankruptcy, it was held the suit could not.-be maintained. <em>Parke, Baron, </em>said: If the goods were in possession of the defendants, a demand and refusal would be evidence of a conversion. But it is not so in a case where the goods have been previously parted with by sale. There cannot be an effectual demand and refusal unless the party has at the time possession of the goods and has the means of delivering them up.\u2019 In 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>sec. 644, the effect of a demand and refusal is correctly stated, and many cases cited. In <em>Dietus </em>v. <em>Fuss, </em>8 Md. 158, the case in 11 M. &amp; W. 362, and the sections of <em>Greenleaf </em>on this subject were cited and approved. It follows from these authorities that the demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and refusal in this case could have no effect either in giving to the plaintiff a right of action, or to fix the measure of damages.\u201d In a more recent case of <em>Merchants Bank </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>110 Md. 334, Judge Burke, speaking for this Court, said: \u201cConversion, in the sense of the law of trover, consists either in the appropriation of the property of another, or in its destruction, or in exercising dominion over it in defiance of the owner\u2019s rights, or in withholding the possession from him under an adverse claim of title, and all who aid, command, assist or participate in the commission of such unlawful acts are liable. In this case the hank, accepting for its own benefit, the stock from Wilson Colston &amp; Co., with notice of their want of authority to hypothecate, became by that act jointly liable with that firm for the conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, which took place on the 17th of September, 1907.\u201d In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Young, </em>1 Camp, 439, Lord Ellekborough said: \u201cThe defendant would have been guilty of a conversion if it had been in his power; but the intention is. not enough. There must be an actual tort. To make a demand and refusal sufficient evidence of a conversion, the party when he refuses must, have it in is power to deliver up, or to detain the articles demanded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Applying these principles to the facts in this case, it is apparent that there is not the slightest evidence of the conversion of the stocks in question by Mr. ITammond on the 23rd day of June, 1913. So far1 as the evidence discloses, the books of the General Cotton Securities Company were not in his possession or in the possession of his agents. Ho demand was made upon him to transfer the stock, and, according to the uncontradicted evidence he had no knowledge of the demand upon Mr. Atherton and Mr. Campbell until long after it was made, and he had never given them any instructions. in reference thereto. There is. evidence tending to show that Mr. Campbell was also employed by Mr. Hammond, but the demand made upon him was made upon him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>as the secretary of the General Cotton Securities Company, and he declined to make the transfer except under advice of counsel for the company. Mr. Baldwin, to whom Mr. Hammond had given no instructions in reference to the matter, wrote Mr. Bordan that he had been unable to get any instructions as to the transfer of the stock, but that he had advised the company that, in his opinion, the stock having been lawfully cancelled, the certificates therefor were void. The fact that Mr. Campbell was also employed by Mr. Hammond, and that Mr. Baldwin was also counsel for Mr. Hammond, would not justify an inference that in what they did and said they acted as the agents of Mr. Hammond, and not as the secretary and counsel of the company, when the evidence is to the effect that they were not approached as the agents of Mr. Hammond, and that Mr. Hammond had no knowledge of the alleged demand, and gave no instructions to either of them in reference to the transfer of the stock. It is true, a principal may, by his subsequent ratification or acquiescence, become liable for the unauthorized acts, of his agents, but this principle presupposes that the act complained of was the act of one <em>as the </em>agent, or on behalf of the principal. In this case there is no proof to warrant the view that in what Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Atherton did, or refused to do&gt;, they acted as the agents of Mr. Hammond, because, as we have said, the evidence shows that he had given them no instructions in reference to the matter, and they were only called upon to act as the <em>officers of the compamy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Court helow in granting the plaintiff\u2019s prayer proceeded upon the theory, and the learned counsel for the appellee contended in this Court, that the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia determined the plaintiff\u2019s right to a transfer of the stock on the books of the General Cotton Securities Company. But it is obvious that the decree could not have that effect, and that the learned Judge of that Court did not intend so to decree. The General Cot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ton Securities Company was not a party to that suit, and no decree could have been passed affecting its interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It is not necessary in tbis case to determine whether this Court can properly pass upon the legality of the proceedings of the board of directors of tbe General Cotton Securities Company on tbe 23rd of November, 1910. The only question here involved is whether the conduct of Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Atherton amounted to a conversion of the stock by Mr. Hammond. If the demand had been made upon Mr. Hammond, as tbe president of tbe company, to transfer the stock, it might be questioned whether, in view of the resolution of the board of directors of the company, he would have been authorized to make the transfer without some previous action of or authority from the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Among other cases cited and relied on by the appellee is the case of <em>Travis </em>v. <em>Knox Terpezone Co., </em>215 N. Y. 259, 109 N. E. 250. It may be noted, however, that in that case that the defendants, Rogers and Skinner, who* were the president and treasurer of the corporation, joined with the defendant company in a formal refusal to transfer the stock. In this case there was no demand made upon Mr. Hammond, and no refusal on his part to make the transfer desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">It follows from what has been said that tbe plaintiff below failed to make out a case of a conversion of the stock in question by Mr. Hammond, and the judgment of the Court below must therefore be reversed, without awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs, without awarding a new tried.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
