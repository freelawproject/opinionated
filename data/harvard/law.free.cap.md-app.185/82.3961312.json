The conviction arose from an automobile fire that occurred on September 2, 2006, involving a vehicle that belonged to appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Elizabeth Anderson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">On appeal, appellant focuses on two issues: the jury deliberations, which were the subject of his unsuccessful motion for new trial, and the admission of his medical records. Dorsey asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">1. Whether a new trial should be ordered because jurors disobeyed explicit jury instructions and discussed the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify in his own defense!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">2. Whether the lower court erred by admitting into evidence Mr. Dorsey\u2019s confidential medical records when the State obtained these records in violation of both Maryland\u2019s Confidential Medical Records Act, and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s constitutional privacy rights!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In September 2006, Dorsey was a deputy sheriff who had been employed for fifteen years in the Frederick County Sheriffs Office; Anderson was a police officer in the Brunswick Police Department. They met for dinner on September 2, 2006, at a restaurant in Frederick. After dinner, Anderson left her car at the restaurant, because she had been drinking; appellant drove her home. Late that night, Anderson\u2019s car was set afire, at a location approximately six to ten minutes from the restaurant. State Deputy Fire Marshal K. Arthur McGhee determined that the fire was an arson. No fingerprints, footprints, tire tracks, gasoline cans, or other physical evidence linked appellant to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">At trial, McGhee testified as an expert in the cause of fires and fire investigation. Moreover, he testified that he has been an emergency medical technician since 1981, and had seen burn injuries on \u201c[t]oo many [occasions] to count.\u201d McGhee questioned appellant about the fire on September 5, 2006. Appellant told McGhee that, after he dropped off Anderson, he went to several bars in Harrisburg with a friend, Dale Williams, and got into a fight. During the altercation, Dorsey \u201cgot hit in the face with a bottle.\u201d He explained that the bottle \u201cbroke [and] cut his face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">McGhee recalled that, at the time of questioning, appellant had \u201cfour inch by four inch medical gauze taped to the [left] side of his face and his left hand and wrist area [were] covered in gauze.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aif\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>While [appellant] was filling out the statement and was talking to me, he was sitting on my left at a, just like a dining room table and he was filling out the form and he would have to reach up and try to put\u2014this bandage kept, as he was talking would\u2014it wasn\u2019t put on very well. It was kind of taped on and it kept trying to come off his face and it would stick and he\u2019d put it back. And then I noticed it was a like red and there was, I could see what looked like skin, um, that had, like the first layer of the epidermis had started to come off. It looked like skin hanging. I, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure, but that\u2019s what it looked like. And then I noticed on the gauze that he had on his hand, it didn\u2019t cover every inch of his hand. I mean I could see the web area between his thumb and his finger, his index finger on his left hand, the, the epidermis, the skin was coming off, which looked like a burn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The colloquy continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And the, let\u2019s first start, again, the hand injury you believe was a burn? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">[MCGHEE1: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And how about the injury to his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAU\">[MCGHEE]: It looked like it might have been a burn also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Have you had occasion to see cutting wounds before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">[MCGHEE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Did these appear, did the, the wound on his face, did that appear to be a cutting wound to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">[MCGHEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did it appear to be consistent with something, with being struck with something sharp like a bottle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-14\">[MCGHEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The court received into evidence photographs of the injuries to appellant\u2019s face and hands, which were taken on September 15, 2006. Under one of the photographs, McGhee had written: \u201cSuspect\u2019e [sic] right hand (apperars [sic] to be a burn injury).\u201d Under another he wrote: \u201cSuspect\u2019s injury to left hand (apperars [sic] to be burn injury).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Dale Williams testified that he saw appellant on the morning of September 2, 2006, around noon on September 8, 2006, and at some point after September 3, 2006. Williams recalled that appellant had no injuries on September 2, 2006. But, on September 3, 2006, Williams \u201csaw bandages\u201d on appellant\u2019s \u201cface and hands.\u201d He described appellant\u2019s skin as \u201ckind of pinkish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">John Allen Turner, a constable with the Frederick County Sheriffs Office who had known appellant for about seven years, testified that he saw appellant at Advanced Urgent Care in Frederick on September 8, 2006. The following is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Did you speak with Mr. Dorsey that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">[TURNER]: Ah, yes. I spoke to him for about three to five minutes, which he was there filling out paperwork. I noticed that he was coming out of the door and, you know, I had to do a double-take and ..., you know, I was concerned. I was like man, what happened to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Why\u2019d you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">[TURNER]: Well, he had what appeared to be, was like pink, more or less burns or spots on his face.... And then his hand was wrapped and his wrist on his left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Were you able to see the injuries to his hands or were they all wrapped up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">[TURNER]: No, they were wrapped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Turner added that, when he asked appellant what happened, appellant stated \u201cthat he got in a fight with a grill and that was it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On cross-examination, Turner agreed that in his written statement he said he \u201cnoticed what appeared to be burns.\u201d On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Turner about \u201cany further- comment [he made] as to the injuries to Mr. Dorsey.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: What\u2019d you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">[TURNER]: ... I was just concerned for his welfare and since they appeared to be burns and what, I believe that they were burns. I\u2019ve seen burns and they looked like burns, so that\u2019s ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And specifically, what did you see that ... led you to that conclusion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">[TURNER]: ... [W]hen the skin was pink and on, on his face and then when his, ah, arm was bandaged up, you know, that\u2019s why I thought that they were burns. They appeared to be and therefore I thought they were and then after we had our little discussion about being in a fight wth [sic] a grill I was like okay, then they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did, did you make any comment as to whether skin was missing from Mr. Dorsey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">[TURNER]: I noticed that skin was missing ... and his skin was pink in color. That\u2019s correct\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The State sought to offer appellant\u2019s medical records from Advanced Urgent Care, dated September 8, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected, and the court heard argument regarding the admissibility of the evidence, outside the presence of the jury. Defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">[W]hat we really have is evidence that should never have gotten into the prosecution\u2019s hands in the first place if it wasn\u2019t properly subpoenaed and Urgent Care released it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>without the consent of Mr. Dorsey then he can\u2019t testify to it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to move to preclude him from being able to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Moreover, defense counsel insisted that the State had to prove that it had written procedures in place when it issued the subpoena. Relying on the Maryland Confidentiality of Medical Records Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), Md.Code (2005 Repl.Vol., 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 4-301 to .4-309 of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d), he asserted: \u201c[T]he plain reading of the statute would require that before you enter those medical records [the State] has to produce written guidelines of [the] office\u2019s procedures and unless that\u2019s met I don\u2019t think that that comes in.\u201d As to compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Pub. Law 104-191, 110 Stat.1936 (1996) (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), defense counsel argued: \u201cHIPAA is, is a quagmire of information to try to, to figure out how to comply with it.... \u201d But, he maintained that \u201cthe whole purpose of that reform was to enhance the confidentiality of medical records .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The State countered that, under H.G. \u00a7 4-306, appellant\u2019s authorization was not required for disclosure. The prosecutor also claimed that the subpoena was issued pursuant to \u00a7 6-310 of the Public Safety Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2005, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 6-310 of the Public Safety Article (\u201cP.S.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">[I]t\u2019s clear and there are sections under HIPAA that make it clear that the purpose is to protect confidentiality of patients but is not to prevent disclosure as otherwise authorized by law. So I\u2019m not going to focus on HIPAA.... The records have been disclosed. The records were disclosed by the health care provider pursuant to a subpoena issued under the Public Safety [Article]. The subpoena itself under the Public Safety [Article] did not have the required language under Health General. However, despite that the information came into the possession of the State. It is a, an area where they are, the health care provider is authorized to disclose the records without the permission or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>without notice to the record-holder.... The only reported case deals with the impropriety of the Court ordering disclosure of the records without the written requirements of the confidentiality but that is disclosure for investigatory purposes for whatever reason or without any other, there\u2019s no evidence that there was compliance with the second section of, urn, [H.G. 4\u2014]306(b)(7) or not. I\u2019m going to overrule the objection and allow the witness to testify with the authentication of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Ronald Golden, office manager and radiologic technician at Advanced Urgent Care, was called to authenticate the record, and appellant requested \u201ca brief voir dire.\u201d When appellant asked Golden if he had \u201cwritten procedures for dealing with the release of medical information of patients,\u201d the State objected that it had \u201cbeen ruled upon.\u201d Appellant said that he would \u201cdiscontinue that line of questioning at this point\u201d and \u201c[r]est on [his] prior objection.\u201d The court again overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Appellant\u2019s medical records, dated September 8, 2006, were admitted. They provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (PHYSICIAN): L side of face and L hand were burned 6 days ago when his gas grill ignited with a fireball. He has been using Zim\u2019s wound cream on his face and blister pads on his hand. The burn on his face is looking much improved. His hand has several open wounds and one large deflated blister. Denies purulent drainage. No fever or malaise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">INSPECTION: Skin on L side of face/nose healing well. No edema, erythema, drainage. Intact blisters on dorsal fingers of L hand. Large, deflated blister on dorsal hand. Several small areas of missing epidermis. No purulent d/c. Burn on hand is not circumferential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">During the State\u2019s case, the defense entered photographs that McGhee took of the vehicle during his investigation. At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that \u201cnone of the elements were, were made out on a prima facie case even looking at it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>... in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d Specifically, he contended that there was no proof of malice, and \u201cthe willfulness is ... not 100 percent clear.\u201d The State countered that \u201cthere is certainly enough circumstantial evidence to, ah, for any reasonable jury certainly at this stage to find Mr. Dorsey guilty. I think the plain reading of the statute as well as the jury instruction gives maliciously a definition that frankly we\u2019ve met in this case.\u201d The court denied the motion, stating: \u201c[PJursuant to the language of the jury instruction with the new second degree arson ... there is sufficient evidence to go to the jury.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Appellant did not testify or call any witnesses. The court instructed the jury, in part: \u201cThe Defendant has an absolute constitutional right not to testify. The fact that the Defendant did not testify must not be held against the Defendant. It must not be ... even considered by you in any way or even discussed by you during your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In its closing, the State quoted almost verbatim from the medical records. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">Let me talk for a minute before I go into the rest of my case about [appellant] not testifying. I know that the jury instruction says that you\u2019re not even to discuss it. I know that it\u2019s not to be held against him. But I also know that\u2019s a little bit against human nature and I ask you that if it comes up, I forgive you. [If] [i]t happens to come up in deliberations put it on me, not on [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">After the jury returned a guilty verdict, appellant moved for a new trial. He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the medical records were inadmissible, and that the jury engaged in misconduct because it considered appellant\u2019s failure to testify. Regarding the alleged jury misconduct, appellant asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">After the jury was polled and allowed to leave the courtroom, this Honorable Court indicated it would speak to the jurors. Counsel waited in the hallway until the jurors left and asked to speak with them. One juror spoke with Counsel and indicated that despite the Court\u2019s instruction, the jury wanted to hear from the Defendant and that this fact was a dispositive one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>At a motion hearing on January 16, 2008, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered the information he had obtained about the jurors\u2019 deliberations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argued that Md. Rule 5\u2014606(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not preclude the court from hearing testimony from an investigator about jury misconduct. He also insisted that the medical records were inadmissible because there was no proof of a written policy guarding their confidentiality. The following excerpts from counsel\u2019s argument are pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">The most troubling part of this case, Your Honor, I have to say occurred when I talked to one of the jurors afterwards and she was kind enough to speak with me and indicated that there was some discussion about the fact that [appellant] didn\u2019t testify... . And Ms. Lynn was the only juror who, ah, who took the time to speak to me and, and told me about that. So what we did was, as I provided the materials to you in chambers, was have Mr. Chase, an investigator, go out and see which jurors would care to speak to us and I was very, very careful to let him know, you know, not to pressure anybody and let them know if they don\u2019t want to talk then he just walks and he did. And he did on many of them that they just simply didn\u2019t want to talk to him. But several of the jurors that sat in this case, ah, gave him clear indication that they disregarded your instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">... [M]ultiple folks did, ah, did admit that there was a discussion about it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">... What they said, several of them in, in Mr. Chase\u2019s report is they felt it didn\u2019t influence the case but that they admitted that it was discussed. Only one juror out of the folks that talked about it indicated that he did not overhear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>anyone talking about the, ah, the fact that [appellant] didn\u2019t testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In denying the motion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">I read [Rule] 5-606 as being an absolute prohibition for the Court inquiring into what mental processes juries go through in the jury room. The <em>Jenkins </em>case [375 Md. 284, 825 A.2d 1008 (2003) ] where you have a witness talking to a juror at lunch is different than you\u2019re talking about what the jurors are talking about in the jury room and I read 8-606(b)(2)(sic) as to a real question whether I can even consider the statements made to the investigator for the purpose of determining whether they properly or improperly applied my instructions because I read that as being an inquiry into the validity of the verdict. <em>Jenkins </em>is factually very different. You\u2019re not talking about what the jury was doing in the jury deliberation room to the, as most essential processes that a jury does, which is deliberate on the evidence in the case. The case where they put the alternates in in Baltimore City is different. The case in <em>Jenkins </em>where you\u2019re talking about a witness interviewing a, having lunch with a juror is different because you\u2019re not talking about what the juries are doing inside the jury room. I think 5-606 is very clear that the statements made to [defense counsel] ... and to any investigator, I can\u2019t consider for the purpose of inquiring into the verdict as to a matter or a statement that occurred during the course of their deliberation. So I don\u2019t think I have, ah, I can consider it under 5-606 as a way to inquire in to set aside the verdict on that ground. So I\u2019m denying the motion for new trial on that ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The court also rejected the challenge to the admission of the medical records. It said: \u201cI\u2019ve ruled on that already and I don\u2019t see any reason to, for me to reverse my finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Maryland Rule 5-606(b) is at the center of the dispute pertaining to the jury verdict. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Rule 5-606. Competency of juror as witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict. (1) In any inquiry into the validity of a verdict, a sworn juror may not testify as to (A) any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations, (B) the effect of anything upon that or any other sworn juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the sworn juror to assent or dissent from the verdict, or (C) the sworn juror\u2019s mental processes in connection with the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">(2) A sworn juror\u2019s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying may not be received for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">(3) Notes made under Rule 2-521 (a) or Rule 4-326(a) may not be used to impeach a verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court \u201cerred\u201d or \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in denying his motion for a new trial, which was premised on his claim that the \u201cjurors disobeyed\u201d the court\u2019s \u201cexplicit instructions\u201d by \u201copenly discussing Mr. Dorsey\u2019s failure to testify in his own defense.\u201d In his view, such conduct \u201ccompromised the integrity of the proceedings\u201d and deprived him of \u201ca fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Dorsey concedes that \u201cRule 5-606 upholds the general preRule principal [sic] that jurors cannot be called upon to impeach their verdict....\u201d But, he claims that the trial court misinterpreted Md. Rule 5\u2014606(b) as an absolute bar to the consideration of evidence as to jury misconduct. In Dorsey\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Rule \u201csimply does not make sense,\u201d because it would mean that no verdict could be set aside \u201cif doing so required using any type of evidence involving jurors after they retired to the jury room.\u201d He adds: \u201cFrom a policy perspective, the lower court\u2019s interpretation of Md. Rule 5-606 is unreasonable because it leaves courts with no recourse in the face of compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ling evidence that jurors violated fundamental fairness by discussing a defendant\u2019s refusal to testify in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Moreover, Dorsey argues that the circuit court\u2019s \u201creading of Maryland Rule 5-606 is erroneous because it effectively strikes this entire first clause of 5\u2014606(b)(1) by reading it out of the rule.\u201d In his view, the trial court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation also renders the entire heading to section (b) of the Rule meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In addition, appellant complains that the court did not recognize \u201cthe difference between an \u2018inquiry into the validity of a verdict,\u2019 and the inquiry Mr. Dorsey actually requested: an inquiry into whether there was a systemic breakdown before the verdict, because an extraneous and inherently prejudicial matter was placed before the jury.\u201d He maintains that Rule 5-606(b) permitted the court to consider evidence that the jurors discussed appellant\u2019s silence, \u201cbecause the jurors[\u2019] comments had nothing to do with the verdict.\u201d Dorsey explains: \u201cAs long as the court\u2019s inquiry was limited to whether jurors broke the rule [of not discussing appellant\u2019s silence], the focus remained on \u2018the integrity of the process,\u2019 and it was not even relevant whether the error affected the verdict or not.\u201d Dorsey insists that \u201cthe constitutional interests in a fair trial can be vindicated without even implicating the policy against asking jurors to impeach their verdict because the violation is unrelated to the verdict. An error of constitutional magnitude can be established\u2014or ruled out\u2014 based solely on whether the rule was broken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Further, Dorsey contends that the jury\u2019s conduct was presumptively prejudicial because it went \u201cto the very heart of constitutional fairness in any criminal proceeding.\u201d Claiming that the court failed to balance \u201cthe constitutional rights at stake,\u201d appellant posits: \u201cThis case presents a perfect storm that implicates one of the most core constitutional principals [sic] that exists in criminal proceedings, and one that commands additional vigilance because of the predisposition to assume the worst from a silent defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The State responds that \u201c[b]oth the language of Rule 5-606(b) and case law fully support the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the jurors\u2019s [sic] comments to Dorsey\u2019s attorney and the investigator, as well as the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d In its view, appellant\u2019s \u201clogic\u201d is \u201cflawed\u201d because his efforts to prove that he was denied a fair trial \u201cnecessarily involve[ ] an inquiry into how the verdict was reached\u201d as well as the \u201cvalidity of the verdict.\u201d It argues: \u201c[I]f Dorsey were allowed to present evidence that the jurors talked about Dorsey\u2019s failure to testify, but the discussion had \u2018nothing to do with the verdict,\u2019 then his claim that he was denied a fair trial, and thus is entitled to a new trial, must fail.\u201d Pointing to the fallacy in appellant\u2019s argument, the State asserts: \u201cThe reality is that Dorsey <em>does </em>want to impeach the verdict, and get a new trial, by showing that the jurors disobeyed the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d Furthermore, the State maintains that \u201cRule 5-606 exists, in part, to prevent exactly what happened in this case.\u201d While recognizing that the rule permits \u201can inquiry into the validity of the verdict using other evidence,\u201d the State argues: \u201cThe trial court was correct in finding that Rule 5-606(b) precluded considering ... evidence [that] involved the deliberations and mental processes of the jurors in reaching their verdict.\u201d Alternatively, the State maintains that, even if the trial court could have considered appellant\u2019s proffer, appellant did not offer sufficient proof of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In reply, appellant reiterates that \u201cno juror was asked to impeach their verdict, nor was any juror asked to take the witness stand.\u201d Instead, appellant offered third-party testimony that the court should have considered as \u201cother\u201d evidence. Dorsey asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">In essence, this Court is confronted with two interpretations of Rule 5-606(b). We respectfully submit that [appellant\u2019s] interpretation ... makes more sense. It would allow a third party to testify post-verdict about something jurors report occurring during deliberations, as long as the inquiry is limited to determining whether there was a systemic breakdown relating to the constitutional fairness of the proceeding, and the inquiry does not require jurors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>comment on the validity of the verdict. This interpretation does a better job of balancing the important public policy interests at stake against the constitutional right to a fair trial. It does not violate cannons of interpretation by rendering an important clause in the Rule meaningless. Most importantly, if a juror later confesses to a third party that during deliberations there were discussions of explicitly forbidden topics that could undermine the integrity of the entire process, some limited inquiry can proceed.! ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In construing Rule 5-606, quoted earlier, we apply the same canons and principles that apply to the construction of statutes. <em>See Knox v.

It would open such a door for tampering with weak and indiscreet men that it' would render all verdicts insecure; and, therefore, the law has wisely guarded against all such testimony and has considered it unworthy of notice.

In that case, an African-American defendant convicted of assault and battery moved for a new trial, alleging that racial prejudice influenced the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 65, 102 A.2d 714. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>supported her motion with a juror\u2019s post-trial affidavit, which said, <em>id. </em>at 65-66, 102 A.2d 714 (quoting affidavit):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cThis was an all white jury. From the beginning of the discussion in the jury room it was the race of the defendant, not the facts, which were weighed by the majority of the jurors.

Bandied back and forth between the jurors were the statements that these colored people are smart alecs, especially the educated ones; that they overassert their rights; that we must teach them a lesson. Four of the jurors, including myself, were for complete acquittal at the first of the discussion. A fifth juror was undecided. The other jurors kept hammering at us.

The last half hour, I held out alone. I finally threw in the towel when some of the jurors accused me of being a \u2018nigger-lover.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">After the trial court denied the motion, the defendant appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 66, 102 A.2d 714. In affirming the conviction, the Court of Appeals concluded that the affidavit should not have been considered because \u201c[t]he law in Maryland is well settled that a juror cannot be heard to impeach his verdict,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 67, 102 A.2d 714, and the Court could not \u201cignore the rules as to the manner in which claimed prejudice may be shown____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 102 A.2d 714. Further, it declared: \u201c[T]he affidavit of a juror is inadmissible as evidence at the hearing on the motion for a new trial.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>And, said the Court: \u201cWe have been referred to no case, and careful independent research has disclosed none, where a verdict was set aside on appeal in any jurisdiction, because of fallacious, unfair or biased arguments advanced by jurors to one another in their deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 102 A.2d 714. The Court remarked that it reached this conclusion even though the \u201cclaim that a litigant has been denied justice on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>account of his or her race ... rais[es] an issue of utmost gravity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 102 A.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">As we indicated, appellant argues that a presumption of prejudice arose in his case based on the evidence of the jurors\u2019 discussion of appellant\u2019s silence. But, prejudice is only presumed in circumstances concerning an outside influence. <em>Compare Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954) (outside influence is \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d) and <em>Stokes, supra, </em>379 Md. at 631, 638, 843 A.2d 64 (presuming prejudice based on the presence of alternate jurors in the jury room) <em>with Summers v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 362, 379, 831 A.2d 1134 (no presumption of prejudice when discussion occurs among jurors), <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 619, 837 A.2d 929 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Jenkins, supra, </em>375 Md. 284, 825 A.2d 1008, is illustrative. There the defendant was charged with second degree murder and other crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 825 A.2d 1008. The detective who interviewed the State\u2019s key witness testified for the State at Jenkins\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 290-91, 825 A.2d 1008. Her interview notes \u201cwere read into the record as evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 825 A.2d 1008. Five days after the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, the detective ran into Jenkins\u2019s counsel and told the attorney that she had had contact with a juror during the course of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 825 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Jenkins then moved for a new trial, alleging \u201cimproper contact between a juror and a detective,\u201d which prejudiced Jenkins. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88, 825 A.2d 1008. At an emergency motion hearing, the detective and the juror testified about what the Court characterized as their \u201cextensive contact\u201d with each other at a weekend religious retreat, held while the trial was still in progress. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 825 A.2d 1008. The juror testified that he initially tried to avoid the detective but then approached her and told her he could not talk to her. <em>Id. </em>The detective, apparently thinking he was a juror on a different case, asked if the jury found the defendant guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 825 A.2d 1008. According to the juror, he \u201ctold her that the trial remained in progress,\u201d but the two did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>discuss the case further. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94, 825 A.2d 1008. However, they sat together at a seminar, had lunch alone, and the detective drove the juror to his car at the end of the retreat. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 825 A.2d 1008. The detective gave similar testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 825 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The trial court found the contact improper but denied the motion, concluding that it did not prejudice Jenkins. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 825 A.2d 1008. The Court of Appeals reversed, <em>id. </em>at 341, 825 A.2d 1008, ruling that \u201cdenial of [Jenkins\u2019s] motion for a new trial was a clear abuse of discretion under the specific egregious circumstances in the case <em>sub judice .... </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 825 A.2d 1008. It elaborated, <em>id. </em>at 289, 825 A.2d 1008:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAW\">Regardless of whether details of the ongoing trial were discussed, personal and prolonged contact as occurred in this case ... interjects an inherent prejudice to [Jenkins] in the form of possible bias in favor of the State\u2019s case, [and] creates an appearance of serious impropriety and causes subsequent serious harm to the perception of the integrity of the jury process itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The Court noted that \u201cthe strong possibility of prejudice ... invokes the presumption\u201d of prejudice that \u201cthe State must effectively rebut....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 825 A.2d 1008. Yet, the State\u2019s \u201conly method of affirmatively rebutting\u201d the presumption would be by asking the juror how his contact with the detective affected his ability to decide the case. <em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 825 A.2d 1008. The Court concluded that Rule 5-606(b) precluded such an inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 825 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In contrast, in <em>Summers, </em>152 Md.App. at 378, 831 A.2d 1134, this Court did not presume prejudice based on juror misconduct involving two jurors who discussed the case at lunch, outside the presence of the other jurors. We observed, <em>id. </em>at 379, 831 A.2d 1134 (internal citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">This case differs from all of these cases we have discussed [about improper communications] because the allegedly improper communication here occurred between two jurors, not between a juror and a witness, defendant, or third party. We find that distinction significant. Third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>communication with a juror raises a concern that the juror may reach a verdict On the basis of the improper extrinsic communication rather than the evidence. That concern is greatly diminished when, as in this case, the improper extrinsic communication occurred solely between two jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">To be sure, the rule does not bar all inquiries with respect to a jury verdict. With regard to permissible inquiries, <em>Smith v. Pearre, </em>96 Md.App. 376, 625 A.2d 349, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 454, 632 A.2d 151 (1993), a medical malpractice action, is noteworthy. In that case, the trial court admonished the jury not to read the newspaper or watch the news on television, so as to avoid hearing \u201c \u2018anything about this case or medicine in general or anything about civil suits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 625 A.2d 349 (quoting trial court). After the jury delivered its verdict for the defendants, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel learned of a relevant \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program that aired while the trial was in progress. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 625 A.2d 349. Therefore, he \u201cengaged the services of an investigator to conduct a telephone survey of the jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 625 A.2d 349. After the investigator determined that the jury foreman watched the program, plaintiffs moved for a new trial, alleging juror misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 625 A.2d 349. The circuit court denied the motion and this Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 379-80, 625 A.2d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In our analysis, we addressed whether evidence that the jury foreman watched the program could \u201cbe properly considered by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 625 A.2d 349. The Court reasoned that such evidence \u201cconstitute[d] extraneous material that occurred outside the sanctity of the jury room,\u201d and therefore the trial court could consider it. <em>Id. </em>We distinguished such information from \u201cwhat occurred during jury deliberations,\u201d which the court could not consider. <em>Id. </em>The Court observed, <em>id. </em>at 388, 625 A.2d 349:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">What appellant\u2019s'counsel did in this case\u2014employing an investigator to question the jurors in the hope of finding some basis for impeaching their verdict\u2014is precisely what the rule attempts to avoid. Jurors should not be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>such harassment, and the finality of judgments entered upon their verdicts should not be subject to such attacks, because these tactics do tend to erode public confidence in the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Court was not convinced that the segment prejudiced the foreman who saw the television show. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 625 A.2d 349. Therefore, it upheld the circuit court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, <em>Smith </em>makes evident that, under some circumstances, a court may consider third-party testimony as to jury misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 390, 625 A.2d 349. To that end, appellant relies on <em>Wernsing v. General Motors Corp., </em>298 Md. 406, 470 A.2d 802 (1984) and <em>Christ v. Wempe, </em>219 Md. 627, 150 A.2d 918 (1959). <em>See also Ramirez v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 257, 291, 941 A.2d 1141 (2008) (allowing bailiffs testimony about alternate juror\u2019s presence in jury room). We pause to review <em>Wernsing </em>and <em>Christ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In <em>Wernsing, </em>298 Md. 406, 470 A.2d 802, a personal injury action, the jury rendered its verdict in favor of the Wernsings. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 470 A.2d 802. General Motors moved for a new trial because the foreman allegedly obtained and read from a dictionary, thereby causing four jurors to change their vote. <em>Id. </em>at 410-11, 470 A.2d 802. At the motion hearing, the court considered the jurors\u2019 affidavits; an affidavit from a bystander who stated that the foreman told her \u201cthat he had been able to obtain unanimity on question 2 by reading dictionary definitions to his colleagues\u201d; testimony from the court bailiff that the foreman requested a dictionary, and that the bailiff gave him one; and writings made by the foreman while the jury deliberated, asking for clarification on \u201cproximately,\u201d and quoting the dictionary definition of \u201clegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410-14, 470 A.2d 802. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that \u201cpermit[ting] jurors to overturn their verdicts by post-trial affidavits ... would create havoc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 470 A.2d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On appeal, the Court determined that consideration of the jurors\u2019 affidavits violated the \u201cwell-settled Maryland rule that a juror cannot be heard to impeach his verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 470 A.2d 802. Further, the Court stated that post-verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>affidavits from jurors were \u201ca particularly gross example of soliciting a reconstruction of a juror\u2019s mental processes in reaching the verdict. This is precisely the type of attempted undermining of verdict finality which Maryland law does not permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 470 A.2d 802. In addition, the Court found that the third-party bystander\u2019s affidavit amounted to hearsay, and thus consideration of it was impermissible. <em>See id. </em>at 412, 470 A.2d 802. The Court stated: \u201cThe affidavit by the participant in the post-verdict conversation between certain jurors attempts to prove the truth of the content of the statements made by the foreman in that conversation,\u201d i.e., the statement was hearsay. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, it determined that the bailiffs testimony was \u201ccompetent,\u201d and the foreman\u2019s notes, \u201c[a]s documents generated during the jury\u2019s deliberations, [did] not suffer the taint of possible post-verdict importuning,\u201d and therefore constituted \u201ccompetent proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 470 A.2d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Court expressed concern that prejudice from use of the dictionary was very likely because the foreman\u2019s notes indicated that the dictionary definitions led him to misunderstand proximate cause, and \u201cthe jury\u2019s findings concerning proximate cause controlled the major liability issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 470 A.2d 802. It stated: \u201cIf this approach to proximate cause were in fact applied by the jury, or even by [the foreman] alone, it would mean that all of the evidence, including expert opinions, ,in this protracted and complex products liability case would have been disregarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Court declined to presume prejudice from the presence of the dictionary, <em>id. </em>at 416, 470 A.2d 802, it held that, given the high probability of prejudice, based on proof that the trial court could have considered (the bailiffs testimony and the foreman\u2019s notes), the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 470 A.2d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In <em>Christ, supra, </em>219 Md. 627, 150 A.2d 918, a negligence action, the plaintiffs moved for a new trial, in part on the grounds of juror misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 640, 150 A.2d 918. In an affidavit in support of their motion, the court clerk averred that the forewoman asked the clerk, outside of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>presence of the rest of the jury, whether the jury had to answer the other questions if its answer to the first question was \u201cno.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640, 150 A.2d 918. The affidavit further indicated that the clerk responded to the forewoman in the negative. <em>Id. </em>The court would not permit the plaintiffs to interrogate the jurors at the hearing, however, and it denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 641-42, 150 A.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">On appeal, the Court said: \u201cIn the <em>Williams </em>case we held that an affidavit of a juror will not be noticed on a motion for a new trial to disclose what took place in the jury room, and now we add that such information likewise may not be obtained through interrogation of individual jurors in open court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641, 150 A.2d 918. In contrast, the Court concluded that the trial court properly considered the clerk\u2019s affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 642, 150 A.2d 918. It reasoned: \u201cThe information contained in the affidavit of the court clerk presents a different situation because it emanates from one not a member of the jury panel and is based on his own knowledge. Such evidence should be received and considered by the court in ruling on a motion for new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that the trial judge, like the clerk, had instructed the jury that it did not have to answer the other questions if it answered \u201cno\u201d to the first question, the Court agreed with the trial judge that the \u201cirregularity ... was insufficient to justify a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640, 642, 150 A.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"> Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant apparently proffered evidence of third-party testimony of an investigator hired by defense counsel. As to what jurors allegedly told him, such evidence would have constituted hearsay,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> akin to the third-party affidavit in <em>Wernsing, </em>298 Md. at 412, 470 A.2d 802. Moreover, under Rule 5-606(b), appellant was not entitled to present testimony about \u201cany matter or statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d Asking the jurors directly about their deliberations, or asking a third party to provide hearsay testimony about the jury deliberations, would have constituted an inquiry into the validity of the verdict. Therefore, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in declining to consider such evidence under Rule 5-606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We recognize that there are jurors who may well view the invocation of the right not to testify \u201cas a shelter for wrongdoers.\u201d <em>Ullmann v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 426, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956). Indeed, some jurors may \u201cassume that those who invoke [the privilege against self-incrimination] are either guilty of a crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 76 S.Ct. 497 (footnote omitted). In the context of a criminal defendant\u2019s refusal to testify, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that, at times, \u201cthe inference of guilt for failure to testify as to facts peculiarly within the accused\u2019s knowledge is ... irresistible.... \u201d <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). Moreover, \u201c[n]o judge can prevent jurors from speculating about why a defendant stands mute in the face of a criminal accusation.... \u201d <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 303, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In this case, it is noteworthy that defense counsel recognized the difficulty when, in his closing argument, he explicitly told the jurors that it would be \u201cagainst human nature\u201d for them not to discuss appellant\u2019s failure to testify. Notably, he admonished the jury that, \u201cif it comes up in deliberations,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>they should \u201cput it on\u201d defense counsel, rather than blaming appellant for his failure to testify. In his closing argument, defense counsel made a tactical decision to confront the proverbial \u201celephant in the room\u201d; he anticipated as inevitable that the jury would discuss appellant\u2019s silence. It seems disingenuous for appellant to now argue that, if the jury, indeed, discussed his failure to testify, the court should have granted a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We are also mindful that strict application of Rule 5-606(b) \u201cmay seem to offend the search for perfect justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Benally, </em>546 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir.2008) (discussing Fed.R.Evid. 606(b)). Certainly, \u201cthe rule makes it difficult ... to ensure that jury verdicts are based on evidence and law rather than bias or caprice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that \u201cdecisions by ordinary citizens are likely, over time and in the great majority of cases, to approximate justice.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We hold that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting his medical records into evidence because the State obtained them in violation of H.G. \u00a7 4-306(b)(7), a provision of the Confidentiality of Medical Records Act. He maintains that the statute permits law enforcement agencies to obtain confidential medical records by subpoena, without providing notice to the patient, <em>\u201conly if </em>it is first established \u2018that the prosecution agencies and law enforcement agencies have written procedures to protect the confidentiality of the records.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) According to Dorsey, the records were produced in violation of the Act because no proof was presented as to the existence of such written procedures. In addition, because the Fire Marshal later disclosed the records to the prosecutor, appellant claims that the \u201cre-disclosure\u201d violated H.G. \u00a7 4-302(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>According to appellant, the violation of the Act constituted a violation of appellant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional expectation of privacy\u201d in his medical records, for which \u201cexclusion of the evidence is the proper remedy....\u201d He contends that the court must balance his interest \u201cagainst the legitimate needs of certain entities, like government agencies to access this information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Moreover, appellant insists that any error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because the records provided \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d in a circumstantial ease. In this regard, he contends that the records allowed the State to establish the burns \u201cto a medical certainty, and much more importantly, to date the burns [appellant] sustained to the night of the fire.\u201d Although Dorsey concedes that \u201cthere was other testimony from Deputy McG[h]ee and Mr. Turner that allowed the State to argue that the wounds on [appellant\u2019s] hand and face were burns,\u201d and \u201c[t]he State had some testimony that showed [appellant] acknowledged being burned a week after the fire,\u201d the other evidence was \u201cnot nearly as effective-nor as conclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The State counters that \u201cthe trial court properly exercised its discretion to admit \u201cthe medical records,\u201d because the State \u201clegally obtained\u201d them.\u201d According to the State, the Fire Marshal had the authority to subpoena the medical records under P.S. \u00a7 6\u2014310(b)(2), and the health care provider was required to disclose them under H.G. \u00a7 4\u2014306(b)(7). Moreover, it claims that the Fire Marshal \u201cwas thereafter authorized to turn the medical records over to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office for prosecution, as that office could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>obtained the records in the first instance.\u201d In addition, it argues that the Act does not mandate that the subpoena had to refer to or include the agency\u2019s written procedures to protect the confidentiality of records, nor did the State have to produce the written procedures at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Further, citing Md. Rule 4-252(a), (b), the State argues that appellant waived this contention because, despite learning through discovery that the State had the medical records, he failed to file a timely pretrial motion for a protective order or to quash the subpoena. In addition, the State claims that, even if it violated a state statute concerning disclosure of medical records, \u201cMaryland has no general, independent, exclusionary rule which allows or requires suppression of evidence in a criminal trial for violations of Maryland law, whether the alleged violation is constitutional or statutory in nature.\u201d Noting that \u201cthe legislature knows how to enact a statutory exclusionary rule if it so chooses,\u201d the State suggests that we may not embellish the Act by adding provisions that are not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Alternatively, the State contends that any error in the admission of the records was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, it maintains that the medical records were merely \u201ccumulative to other evidence adduced at trial\u201d that showed Dorsey had sustained burn injuries around the time of the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As a preliminary matter, we address the State\u2019s contention that appellant waived the issue of the admissibility of his medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Appellant concedes that he did not raise the matter until trial. But, the State has not referred us to any authority that suggests appellant had to move, pretrial, for a protective order so as to preserve his contention. The issuance of the subpoena for the medical records did not fall within the scope of Rule 4-252(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> governing mandatory motions. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>appellant could not have filed a motion to quash a subpoena that he did not know had been issued. Therefore, appellant was not required to make a pretrial motion to preserve his challenge at trial to the admissibility of the records..</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s claim that the Act controls here, and that the State violated the Act, we pause to review relevant provisions of the Act.

Subtitle 3 of the Public Safety Article, titled \u201cState Fire Marshal,\u201d is relevant. P.S. \u00a7 6-305 mandates that \u201c[t]he State Fire Marshal shall enforce: (1) all laws of the State that relate to: ...

The State Fire Marshal requested the medical records under the authority of P.S. \u00a7 6-310(b)(2). Therefore, the question arises as to whether P.S. \u00a7 6-310(b)(2) is subject to the provisions of H.G. \u00a7 4-306(b)(7) when the documents at issue are medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The parties have not addressed the issue of the apparent conflict in the statutes.

Those laws were not repealed or revised by the Act. <em>See </em>1990 Md. Laws, ch. 480; 1964 Md. Laws, ch. 15. In the nearly two decades since H.G. \u00a7 4-306 was enacted, the Legislature repealed Art. 38A, \u00a7 8, and reenacted it, in part, as P.S. \u00a7 6-310, without making any substantive changes, despite its knowledge of H.G. \u00a7 4-306. <em>See </em>2003 Md.

Any revision or clarification of H.G. \u00a7 4-306(b)(7) or P.S. \u00a7 6-310(b)(2) must come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Alternatively, even if the Act controls here, it is salient that Advanced Urgent Care voluntarily complied with the subpoena. Therefore, this case is unlike <em>Shady Grove Psychiatric Group v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 163, 736 A.2d 1168 (1999), which involved a provider\u2019s refusal to comply with a subpoena because of the lack of written procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In that case, the State issued a subpoena to a psychiatric group in connection with an investigation of a \u201chate crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, 736 A.2d 1168. The State sought \u201c \u2018a list of patients who had appointments on 6/01/98 between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon. Need addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and appointment history from February 1 to the present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 736 A.2d 1168 (quoting subpoena). Shady Grove, the mental health care provider, refused to disclose the information, claiming \u201cit was shielded from disclosure\u201d under H.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 4-301 through 4-309. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the State moved to enforce the subpoena and, following a hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>circuit court ordered Shady Grove to produce the requested information. <em>Id. </em>We held that the health care provider was not obligated to disclose medical records until \u201cthe prosecution agency first proves that it has written procedures to protect the confidentiality of that record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 736 A.2d 1168. Because there was no proof of written procedures, we concluded that \u201cthe subpoena should not have been enforced.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">To be sure, H.G. \u00a7 4\u2014306(b)(7) requires a law enforcement agency to \u201chave written procedures\u201d before a health care provider may be <em>compelled </em>to comply with a subpoena. But, unlike in <em>Shady Grove, </em>the health care provider here did not contest the subpoena. Notably, H.G. \u00a7 4-305 \u201cis a <em>permissive </em>disclosure provision.\u201d <em>Warner, </em>348 Md. at 739, 705 A.2d 1169. It sets forth several circumstances under which a health care provider has discretion to disclose a medical record, without authorization of a person in interest. <em>Id. </em>Of relevance here, H.G. \u00a7 4\u2014805(b)(3) permits a health care provider voluntarily to disclose medical records, without a patient\u2019s permission, \u201cto a government agency performing its lawful duties.... \u201d The text of H.G. \u00a7 4\u2014305(b)(3) does not limit such disclosure to those government agencies that have written procedures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, if the Act applied here, the health care provider was not required by the Act to ascertain whether the Fire Marshal had written procedures before it voluntarily elected to produce the medical records in response to the subpoena.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In any event, the Act delineates remedies for its violation. As noted, the Maryland statute provides that \u201ca health care provider or any other person, including an officer or employee of a governmental unit,\u201d may be fined if that person \u201cknowingly and willfully requests or obtains a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>record under false pretenses or through deception\u201d; \u201cknowingly and willfully discloses a medical record in violation of this subtitle\u201d; or \u201cknowingly and willfully violates any provision of this subtitle.... \u201d H.G. \u00a7 4-309(d), (e)(1). Further, \u201ca health care provider or any person who knowingly violates any provision of this subtitle\u201d may be civilly liable for actual damages, H.G. \u00a7 4-309(f); and, outside the context of state actors conducting criminal investigations, \u201ca health care provider or any other person, including an officer or employee of a governmental unit,\u201d may be subject to imprisonment. H.G. \u00a7 4-309(e). Of import here, the Act does not provide for. an exclusionary rule as a remedy, and we shall not infer a remedy that the General Assembly did not authorize.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Padilla v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 210, 232-36, 949 A.2d 68, cert. denied, 405 Md. 507, 954 A.2d 468 (2008), is noteworthy. There, we considered the history of the federal exclusionary rule and its applicability to the states. <em>Id. </em>We noted that in <em>Parker v. State, </em>402 Md. 372, 399-406, 936 A.2d 862 (2007), \u201cthe Court acknowledged ... that Maryland courts have, on occasion, recognized limited exclusionary principles on the basis of non-constitutional Maryland law.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>180 Md.App. at 236 n. 12, 949 A.2d 68; <em>cf. Herring v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 695, 699-704, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (discussing federal exclusionary rule). Although the federal exclusionary rule applies for violations of the federal Constitution, we concluded in <em>Padilla </em>that violation of non-constitutional Maryland law does not render evidence inadmissible unless Maryland common law or a State statute provides for an exclusionary rule. <em>Padilla, </em>180 Md.App. at 236 n. 12, 949 A.2d 68. We held that no exclusionary rule existed under State law for evidence allegedly seized in violation of Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 949 A.2d 68. <em>See also Ford v.

The medical records provided evidence that appellant burned his lace and left hand on September 2, 2006, the night of the automobile fire; that appellant attributed the burns to his gas grill; and that appellant sought treatment on September 8, 2006. But, as we have seen, the records were cumulative to ample other evidence that showed that appellant burned his face and hands in the afternoon or evening of September 2, 2006; that he attributed the burns to his gas grill; and that he sought treatment for the burns at Advanced Urgent Care on September 8, 2006.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

We recognize that P.S. \u00a7 6-310 permits the Fire Marshal to subpoena a variety of documents, not merely medical records. To that end, an argument can be made that the appropriate analysis concerns the nature of the documents under subpoena (governed by H.G. \u00a7 4-306), rather than the person who issues the subpoena (P.S. \u00a7 6-310). Under such a framework, if the Fire Marshal happens to issue a subpoena for medical records, the provisions of H.G. \u00a7 4-306(b)(7) would come into play. In our view, however, the specificity of P.S. \u00a7 6-310\u2014applicable solely to the Fire Marshal\u2014militates against such a construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">.
