Simmons, appeals from the order of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County reversing a workers\u2019 compensation award in her favor and granting summary judgment to appellees, Comfort Suites Hotel, and its insurer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Selective Insurance Company of North America (collectively, \u201cComfort Suites\u201d). On appeal, Ms. Simmons presents the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">I. Is the installation of an alarm system to allay the post-traumatic fears of a robbery victim a cognizable medical expense under Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">II. If the answer to Question I is in the affirmative, should the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission be affirmed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">This appeal arises from injuries that Ms. Simmons received while working as a night auditor at the Comfort Suites Hotel in Chestertown, Maryland. On September 25, 2006, at approximately 2:00 a.m., she was brutally attacked with a baseball bat during an attempted robbery of the hotel. Left for dead, the 67-year-old victim was found hours later, lying unconscious in a pool of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Paramedics rushed Ms. Simmons to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, where she was treated for severe traumatic brain injury, diffuse cerebral edema, and multiple skull fractures. On October 6, 2006, she was transferred to Kernan Hospital. After her discharge on December 5, 2006, the Kernan Team recommended that Ms. Simmons receive supportive care and outpatient rehabilitation services at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">On September 29, 2006, Ms. Simmons filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) for the injuries she sustained in the attack. Comfort Suites did not contest the underlying compensability of the claim, and it paid for medical treatment for Ms. Simmons. The Commission awarded Ms. Simmons temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Ms. Simmons thereafter requested that Comfort Suites provide her with a home security system to allay her fear of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>home intruder. The Commission held a hearing on Ms. Simmons\u2019 request on September 14, 2007. In support of her claim, Ms. Simmons submitted a March 23, 2007, letter from Dr. M. Sementilli, a neuropsychologist. Dr. Sementilli wrote, in part: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">I continue to follow the neurobehavioral recovery of Ms. Simmons. Even though she continues to demonstrate cognitive and physical gains, her mood remains anxious to fear of additional assaults. Her anxiety increases in the evening despite the presence of her son(s) who reside upstairs during the night. Ms. Simmons continues to fear that the perpetrator or associates, or random intruders may attempt to harm her. She is hyper vigilant to noises outside and inside the house. The resulting anxiety, ruminations and hyper vigilance are contributing to ongoing insomnia and fear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">To conclude, as her treating neuropsychologist I would strongly recommend that an in home security system be installed. If so I am confident that Ms. Simmons will \u25a0 experience a reduction in fear, vigilance and resulting anxiety. I believe this is a reasonable request for any individual who has been assaulted and continues to be vulnerable during their recovery period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Comfort Suites did not introduce any medical evidence rebutting Dr. Sementilli\u2019s opinion that Ms. Simmons\u2019 anxiety would be reduced with the installation of an alarm system, noting that it was addressing the claim \u201cstrictly from a legal standpoint.\u201d Comfort Suites argued that the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute did not cover a home security system because it was not \u201cmedical treatment\u201d pursuant to the statute. In support of its position, Comfort Suites cited <em>R &amp; T Constr. Co. v. Judge, </em>323 Md. 514, 531, 594 A.2d 99 (1991), for the proposition that modifications to a home constitute medical treatment only when they provide \u201caccess for necessities,\u201d such as modifications that provide a quadriplegic access to physically travel in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The Commissioner disagreed with the argument that a home security system was not covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">Ironically, I think this home modification ... the request is probably designed to do more potential good for the condition of the patient than the modification that you\u2019ve cited in terms of access. Access is for someone whose condition is not going to get any better. This modification will theoretically make the condition better. It\u2019s more reason to do this than the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">The other is kind of vague, acknowledgment that it\u2019s the civil thing to do if someone is a paraplegic or quadriplegifc], you\u2019re improving the standard of the quality of their life. This has the double purpose of improving the quality of her life, and possibly the medical condition. I think with medical documentation from him, I think it\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">On October 10, 2007, the Commission issued an order granting Ms. Simmons\u2019 request for a home security system. Specifically, the order required Comfort Suites to \u201cauthorize medical treatment for [Ms. Simmons] of home modification of installation of a home security system to reduce stress and fear per treating physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On October 30, 2007, Comfort Suites filed in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County a Petition for Judicial Review of the Commission\u2019s decision. On March 18, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Counsel for Ms. Simmons argued that the home security system qualified as medical treatment because (1) it would \u201cassist her in her recovery from the injuries she sustained both physically and emotionally,\u201d and (2) Comfort Suites had not produced a medical opinion that she did not need this system to recover from the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Comfort Suites did not take issue with the doctor\u2019s recommendation that a home security system be installed; counsel stated: \u201cI completely understand and frankly agree with\u201d the need for a home security system for her peace of mind. Comfort Suites stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>[W]hat [counsel for Ms. Simmons] is focusing on is not the right thing here. We\u2019re here on a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">As Your Honor knows, there\u2019s no dispute as to any material facts. I\u2019m not disputing that she may need, from a medical standpoint as Dr. Simantelli [sic] says, this home security system to help her with whatever problems she may have. That\u2019s not the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">The point is legally she\u2019s not entitled to the home security system under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute. They need to clear the first hurdle, which is: Is she even entitled to it under the statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">This is not a medical question. It\u2019s a legal question. Legally is she entitled to it under the statute? The answer is no unfortunately, because what we\u2019re talking about here is the medical treatment in the form of a home modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Comfort Suites argued that, pursuant to <em>Judge, </em>323 Md. at 530-31, 594 A.2d 99, modifications to a claimant\u2019s home are considered medical treatment under the statute only if the modification provides access to necessities. Because a home security system would not provide necessary access, it was not \u201cmedical treatment\u201d that was covered by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The circuit court concluded that the question whether Ms. Simmons is entitled to a home security system under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis a legal, not a factual question.\u201d The court stated that it \u201cagrees with the proposition that this is not something that\u2019s contemplated either by the statute or the <em>[Judge </em>] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">On March 28, 2008, the circuit court entered a written order granting Comfort Suites\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and ordering \u201cthat the decision of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission dated October 10, 2007 is REVERSED as it relates to the installation of a home security system.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Before addressing the merits of this case, we must address the applicable standard of review. Ms. Simmons argues that decisions of the Commission are entitled to a \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d under Md.Code (2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-745 of the Labor and Employment (\u201cL.E.\u201d) Article. Accordingly, she argues, the decision of the Commission satisfied her <em>prima facie </em>case, and the circuit court could not grant summary judgment against her when Comfort Suites \u201coffered no medical evidence to controvert the opinion of [her] treating health care provider that the alarm system was an important component to [her] treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Ms. Simmons is correct that, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-745(b), on appeal: (1) \u201cthe decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.\u201d The Maryland appellate courts have made clear, however, that the language regarding the presumption of correctness of the Commission\u2019s decision does not apply to all issues, but rather, it \u201cis only pertinent when the issue on appeal to the circuit court is one of fact and not of law.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. v. Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. 155, 173, 867 A.2d 370 (2005). <em>Accord Beyer v. Decker, </em>159 Md. 289, 291, 150 A. 804 (1930) (presumption of correctness does not apply where the question \u201cis one of statutory construction, and one of law for the court\u201d); <em>Symons v. R.D. Grier &amp; Sons Co., </em>10 Md.App. 498, 500, 271 A.2d 398 (1970) (presumption of correctness \u201chas no application where the question is one of law instead of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Here, on appeal in the circuit court, the parties each filed a motion for summary judgment asking the circuit court to rule in its favor, as a matter of law, on the issue whether a home security system constitutes a compensable medical expense under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute. In resolving that question of law, there was no presumption of correctness of the Commission\u2019s decision that precluded the circuit court from granting Comfort Suites\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 73, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006); <em>Youngblud v. Fallston Supply Co., Inc., </em>180 Md.App. 389, 399, 951 A.2d 118, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 114, 956 A.2d 203 (2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif there is no genuine dispute of material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018A material fact is a fact that, depending on how it is decided by the trier of fact, will affect the outcome of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rivers v. Hagner Mgmt. Corp., </em>182 Md.App. 632, 646, 959 A.2d 110 (2008) (quoting <em>Mandl v. Bailey, </em>159 Md.App. 64, 82, 858 A.2d 508 (2004)). We determine whether any material facts are in dispute, and, if not, we determine whether the court was legally correct in its ruling. <em>Newell v. Runnels, </em>407 Md. 578, 630, 967 A.2d 729 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">This case concerns L.E. \u00a7 9-660, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014In addition to the compensation provided under this subtitle, if a covered employee has suffered an accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or occupational disease the employer or its insurer promptly shall provide to the covered employee, as the Commission may require:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">(1) medical, surgical, or other attendance or treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">(2) hospital and nursing services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">(3) medicine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">(4) crutches and other apparatus; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">(5) artificial arms, feet, hands, and legs and other prosthetic appliances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">(b) Duration.\u2014The employer or its insurer shall provide the medical services and treatment required under subsection (a) of this section for the period required by the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of the accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">This Court has interpreted this statute as dealing \u201cwith medical services necessary or desirable to treat the effects of the injury....\u201d <em>Harris v. Janco Enter., </em>53 Md.App. 674, 677, 455 A.2d 453 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The question here focuses on the scope of \u00a7 9\u2014660(a)(1), and whether a home security system can be considered to be medical treatment under the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Simmons argues that there is evidence from her doctor that she needs a home security system to help her recover from her injuries, and, under these circumstances, the \u201cinstallation of an alarm system to allay the post-traumatic fears of a robbery victim\u201d is medical treatment under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Comfort Suites makes no argument that medical treatment to allay the psychological effects of an injury falls outside the scope of medical treatment under the statute. <em>See Belcher v. T. Rowe Price, </em>329 Md. 709, 745-46, 621 A.2d 872 (1993) (mental injury may be compensable under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.) <em>Accord </em>Richard P. Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 10.3 (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cClaims for psychiatric treatment\u201d have been held compensable as medical treatment.). Indeed, during oral argument in this Court, counsel for Comfort Suites conceded that if, instead of a home security system to reduce anxiety and insomnia, a doctor had recommended medication for this purpose, it would be covered under the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Comfort Suites argues, however, that a home security system, as a matter of law, is not medical treatment as contemplated by the statute, and therefore, the circuit court properly granted its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Both parties rely exclusively on <em>R &amp; T Constr. Co. v. Judge, </em>323 Md. 514, 594 A.2d 99 (1991), in support of their contentions. We agree that <em>Judge </em>is instructive, but for reasons other than those relied on by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">As explained below, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Comfort Suites based on its finding that a home security system, as a matter of law, does not constitute medical treatment under \u00a7 9-660(a)(l). We recognize that a home security system typically is not viewed as a form of medical treatment. The Maryland Court of Appeals, however, has found that items that are not intrinsically medical in nature could constitute medical treatment if there is evidence that the item conveys a medical benefit. Thus, the question whether a home security system constitutes compensable medical treatment pursuant to \u00a7 9-660(a)(1) is a factual question to be resolved on the evidence in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Under the unique circumstances of this case, where the claimant was brutally attacked, where she suffered both physical and mental disability as a result of the attack,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and where her treating neuropsychologist recommended a home security system to improve her medical condition by reducing her anxiety and resulting insomnia, the trier of fact could find that a home security system constituted medical treatment pursuant to the statute. Accordingly, we will remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">In determining the meaning of medical treatment under \u00a7 9-660, we must apply settled principles of statutory inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>pretation. In <em>Green v. Carr Lowery Glass Co., Inc., </em>170 Md.App. 502, 907 A.2d 845 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>398 Md. 512, 921 A.2d 235 (2007), another case interpreting the language of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\">As this Court repeatedly has made clear, the paramount goal of statutory interpretation is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue. The legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through its very own words. As a rule, we view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood. If the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise: we need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads. Even so, we do not view the plain language of a statute in a vacuum. As we have often reiterated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cWhile the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 508, 907 A.2d 845 (quoting <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335-36, 748 A.2d 478 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The Court of Appeals has explained the background of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">The Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was enacted in 1914 to compensate employees who were injured in the course of their employment. The statute took the place of the common law tort system, which proved to be an inadequate means of compensating employees for their work-related injuries. [T]he statute struck a delicate balance between workers and employers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">Workers lost their right to sue their employers for negligence but gained the right to quick and certain compensation for injuries sustained during the course of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>employment, regardless of fault. In return, employers lost their defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow servant rule but gained the advantage of having their liability limited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 496-97, 520 A.2d 717 (1987) (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The purpose of the Act was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cto protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d <em>Howard Co. Ass\u2019n, Retard. Cit. v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 531, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980), and \u201cto promote the general welfare of the State and to prevent the State and its taxpayers from having to care for injured workmen and their dependents, when under the law as it previously existed, such workmen could not recover damages for their injuries.\u201d <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114, 119, 39 A.2d 544, 546 (1944).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 474, 784 A.2d 569 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In <em>Breitenbach, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that, when interpreting the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a court should keep in mind that \u201cthe Act is remedial in nature and \u2018should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 784 A.2d 569 (quoting <em>Para v. Richards Group, </em>339 Md. 241, 251, 661 A.2d 737 (1995)). \u201c[Ajpplying a canon of construction specific to the Act, if the intent of the legislature is ambiguous or remains unclear, we resolve any uncertainty in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 784 A.2d 569. The Court cautioned, however, that it \u201cmay not stifle the plain meaning of the Act, or exceed its purposes, so that the injured worker may prevail.... Similarly, the Court may not create ambiguity or uncertainty in the Act\u2019s provisions where none exists so that a provision may be interpreted in favor of the injured claimant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Medical Treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In accordance with the liberal construction to be given the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Court of Appeals has given a broad construction of the terms in \u00a7 9-660, including the term medical treatment. In <em>A.G. Crunkleton Electric Co., Inc. v. Barkdoll, </em>227 Md. 364, 177 A.2d 252 (1962), the Court gave a liberal construction of the term \u201cnursing services\u201d under the statute, rejecting the argument that it was limited to professional health care providers and holding that it included services rendered at home by the claimant\u2019s wife, who was not a professional nurse. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 177 A.2d 252.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>Breitenbach, </em>the Court held that, because \u00a7 9-660 was not clear and unambiguous regarding whether an employer was obligated to reimburse an employee for travel expenses incurred to receive medical treatment, the ambiguity was resolved in favor of the claimant. 366 Md. at 484, 784 A.2d 569. Accordingly, the Court held that travel expenses were covered medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In <em>Judge, </em>the sole authority relied upon by both parties, the Court of Appeals similarly gave a liberal construction of the term medical treatment. 323 Md. at 530, 594 A.2d 99. In that case, Judge was completely paralyzed from the neck down due to a fall from a third story window while constructing townhouses. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 594 A.2d 99. He was confined to his bed or his wheelchair and was attended round-the-clock by nurses. <em>Id. </em>Judge sought modifications to his residence, among other things. <em>Id. </em>at 517-18, 594 A.2d 99. The Court, similar to here, was presented with an absolute position; the employer argued that modifications to a residence of a paraplegic or quadriplegic fell outside the scope of medical treatment or services under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 594 A.2d 99.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Court rejected that narrow construction, noting that the statute was to be liberally construed in favor of the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 594 A.2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The Court noted that other jurisdictions with similar statutes had \u201crecognized an obligation, depending on the particular facts before them, for some form of modification to living quarters to allow persons in wheelchairs the essentials of everyday life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 594 A.2d 99. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">The wheelchair confined claimant who has had an established residence is denied access to traditional medical treatment, under an implied circumstance of its rendition, if the home is not wheelchair accessible. The wheelchair is a medical \u201capparatus,\u201d and, without wheelchair accessibility, use of the apparatus is denied in the location where the General Assembly would expect the wheelchair most commonly to be used. Similarly, it is a medical necessity that the wheelchair bound claimant who could use a toilet without assistance have access to the bathroom of the home. We hold that \u00a7 37(a) includes within the concept of medical treatment reasonable modifications to a claimant\u2019s home that allow necessary access for claimants confined to wheelchairs as a result of their compensable injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 594 A.2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The parties, not surprisingly, construe <em>Judge </em>differently. Ms. Simmons contends that <em>Judge </em>supports her argument that medical treatment pursuant to \u00a7 9-660 includes home modifications such as an alarm system. She contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXC\">Judge stands for the proposition that Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation law does not limit medical benefits to the hands-on administration of medical care, i.e. physical therapy or the prescribing of medication. Rather, when a work-related disability generates a need for modification of one\u2019s home, the alteration qualifies as a medically-generated benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Although Ms. Simmons overstates when a modification of a home is authorized pursuant to <em>Judge, </em>we agree that the case stands for the proposition that the term medical treatment should not be construed narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Comfort Suites focuses on the limitations <em>Judge </em>imposed regarding when a home modification will constitute medical treatment, and it argues that these limitations establish that a home security system does not constitute medical treatment pursuant to the statute. Initially, Comfort Suites argues that <em>\u201cJudge </em>appears to include home modifications as an appropriate form of medical treatment under the Act only when the claimant is confined to a wheelchair or physically disabled in at least some form.\u201d Comfort Suites claims that Ms. Simmons is not disabled to the point that she is confined to a wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Moreover, Comfort Suites argues that the Court in <em>Judge </em>made clear that not all home modifications would qualify as medical treatment, but only those modifications that provided access for necessities. In <em>Judge, </em>the remodeling of the home, which would have allowed Judge to independently move his wheelchair to various areas of the home, would have improved Judge\u2019s quality of life. 323 Md. at 530, 594 A.2d 99. Because Judge would still need a full-time attendant, however, the alterations would not allow Judge to be self-sufficient regarding necessities. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">We remain mindful that the act is to receive a liberal construction. Nevertheless, in the area of modifications to a residence, the concept of medical treatment under \u00a7 37(a) must be limited to access for necessities. Here the purpose of the possible improvements goes beyond the necessities already being provided, and seeks to give Judge a sense of increased independence and self-worth. Under the circumstances here that goal is beyond the process of construction of \u00a7 37(a). Were we to depart from the standard of access to necessaries that may be implied in medical treatment, there would be no statutory standard to guide the Commission in determining the extent of an insurer\u2019s obligation to make alterations to a claimant\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 531, 594 A.2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Comfort Suites argues that a security system does not qualify as a mechanism for \u201caccess to a necessity.\u201d Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>acknowledging that it may increase Ms. Simmons\u2019 sense of security and potentially \u201cimprove the quality of her life,\u201d it argues that is not the standard. The standard, Comfort Suites argues, is whether the home modification \u201cwould allow a physically disabled claimant access in his or her home to necessities,\u201d a standard which was not met by the request for a security system.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We agree with Comfort Suites that the portion of the opinion in <em>Judge </em>upon which the parties rely was addressing physically disabled claimants seeking home modifications to provide wheelchair access. It was in that context that the court held that home improvements constitute medical treatment only if they provide \u201cnecessary access.\u201d This part of the opinion is not dispositive, however, of the question whether a home security system, which a medical professional has recommended to relieve the effects of Ms. Simmons\u2019 injury, could constitute medical treatment under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">We find another portion of the opinion in <em>Judge </em>to be more applicable to the issue presented here, <em>ie., </em>whether a device or service that is not inherently medical in nature can qualify as medical treatment if it conveys a medical benefit. In <em>Judge, </em>the claimant requested, in addition to home modifications, that his employer pay for the cost of heating and air conditioning in his residence. <em>Id. </em>at 521-22, 594 A.2d 99. Judge argued that the employer should pay part of the cost because his injury resulted in a lack of normal body temperature controls and a limited tolerance to temperature change. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held: \u201cOn this record the Commission could find that the air conditioning is medical treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 594 A.2d 99.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, that an air conditioner is not typically viewed as medical treatment did not, as a matter of law, preclude it from constituting medical treatment under the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Other jurisdictions similarly have held that devices and services that are not inherently medical in nature may, under the circumstances of a particular case, constitute medical benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute. <em>See, e.g., Bellone v. Indus. Claim Appeals Office, </em>940 P.2d 1116, 1117 (Colo.Ct.App.1997) (child care expenses covered as medical treatment; services \u201cmedical\u201d in nature because they relieved the symptoms and effect of the injury and allowed claimant to deal with fatigue, depression, and other symptoms resulting from serious head trauma); <em>City &amp; County of Denver v. Indus. Comm'n, </em>682 P.2d 513, 515 (Colo.Ct.App.1984) (hot tub found to be medical supply based on medical testimony regarding significant benefit to claimant); <em>Haga v. Clay Hyder Trucking Lines, </em>397 So.2d 428, 432 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981) (swimming pool with handicapped facilities found medically necessary where prescribed by severely burned claimant\u2019s physicians), <em>pet. denied, </em>402 So.2d 609 (Fla.1981); <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 229, 643 N.E.2d 113, 115-16 (1994) (weight-loss program covered as medical services if it aids in recovery of compensable injury); <em>In re Comp. of Gordon, </em>60 Or.App. 361, 653 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1982) (doctor-prescribed waterbed, \u201cfor correction of low back condition,\u201d covered under statute providing for \u201cmedical services\u201d); <em>ARA Servs. and Reliance Ins. Co. v. Swift, </em>22 Va.App. 202, 468 S.E.2d 682, 684-85 (1996) (home exercise station compensable when prescribed by physician as medically necessary to remedy effects of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In New York, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Statute requires an employer to pay for \u201cmedical ... or other attendance or treatment ... as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may require.\u201d N.Y. Workers\u2019 Comp. Law \u00a7 13(a) (2009). New York courts have construed this statute broadly to cover expenses necessary to aid in the recovery of the claimant or to relieve the symptoms of the injury, even if the \u201ctreatment\u201d is not inherently medical in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In <em>Morrell v. Onondaga County, </em>244 A.D.2d 695, 664 N.Y.S.2d 168 (1997), a claimant who suffered from chronic sinusitis and upper airway irritation caused by work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>exposure to formaldehyde requested that her employer pay for items recommended by her doctor to lessen her symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 169. The claimant\u2019s doctor recommended: organic food, to prevent exposure to irritating chemicals in conventional food products; an air filtration system, to remove irritants from her environment; and vitamin supplements, to improve the claimant\u2019s suppressed immune system. <em>Id. </em>at 170. The court held that, under the circumstances of the case, these items were compensable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Similarly, in <em>Clark v. Fedders-Quigan Corp., </em>284 A.D. 430, 131 N.Y.S.2d 575, 576-77 (1954), the issue was whether travel expenses for a trip to Florida constituted medical treatment under the statute. The doctor for the claimant, who was disabled by emphysema, recommended a trip to a warmer climate to relieve the claimant\u2019s symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 577. The court declined to rule, as a matter of law, that these expenses were not covered by the statute. <em>Id. </em>Noting that there was nothing in the statute that restricted a liberal interpretation of the term medical treatment, the court stated that \u201cwhether a change of climate advised by a physician is medical treatment within the meaning of the statute becomes in each instance a question of fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We agree with this approach. We hold that the determination whether a device or service constitutes medical treatment under the statute should not be based, as a matter of law, on whether the device or service is inherently medical in nature. Rather, where there is a recommendation from a medical professional that a device or service be provided because it will provide therapeutic medical relief from the effects of the injury, the determination whether it is compensable medical treatment is a question of fact that should be determined under the circumstances of the particular case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Home Security System</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Applying this analysis, we find that a home security system, although not intrinsically medical in nature, could, under the particular facts of a case, constitute medical treatment. Here, the claimant was brutally attacked, and she suffered a physical and mental disability. Ms. Simmons\u2019 treating neuropsychologist recommended a home security system to provide relief from the effects of her injury by reducing her anxiety and allowing her to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Commission, in finding that a home security system was covered as medical treatment under \u00a7 9-660, recognized the potential medical benefit, stating: \u201cThis has the double purpose of improving the quality of her life, and possibly the medical condition. I think with medical documentation from him, I think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute, regarding what constitutes medical treatment, should be given some deference by the reviewing courts. <em>See Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. at 485, 784 A.2d 569 (\u201c[A]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d) (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We hold that, under the unique circumstances of this case, the circuit court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that a home security system is not medical treatment pursuant to \u00a7 9-660. We want to make clear, however, the limited nature of our holding. We are not suggesting that a home security system is likely to be found to constitute medical treatment in the typical case. Nor are we suggesting that it is so in this case. We are merely holding that it could constitute medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>treatment under the facts of this case, and the issue should be resolved by the trier of fact rather than as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Having determined that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Comfort Suites, the next question is the proper remedy. Ms. Simmons notes that, at the Commission and on appeal to the circuit court, Comfort Suites \u201cstaked their entire defense\u201d on the argument that \u201can alarm system is not a cognizable medical expense,\u201d and it did not dispute \u201cthat she may need, from a medical standpoint,\u201d the security system. Accordingly, now that this Court has determined that the circuit court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that a security system is not a medical expense, Ms. Simmons contends that the case need not be remanded to the circuit court, but rather, the Commission\u2019s decision should be affirmed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">As Judge Moylan explained in <em>Spradlin, </em>an appeal from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission may follow \u201c \u2018two alternative modalities.\u2019 \u201d 161 Md.App. at 166, 867 A.2d 370 (citing <em>S.B. Thomas, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>114 Md.App. 357, 364, 689 A.2d 1301 (1997)). The first modality is an \u201cunadorned administrative appeal\u201d pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-745(c) and (e), which is referred to as an appeal \u201con the record of the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 170, 867 A.2d 370. With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>type of appeal, \u201cno new evidence is taken nor is any fresh fact-finding engaged in. The determination of whether the decision of the Commission was free from error will entail only an examination of the record of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 867 A.2d 370. Thus, \u201cfwjhen a case is submitted to the trial judge on the basis of the record made before the Commission, the judge reads the record and makes his or her decision according to what the judge perceives the record to reveal.\u201d Gilbert &amp; Humphrey, supra, \u00a7 17.05[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The second modality, by contrast, is the \u201cessential trial <em>de novo,'\u2019 </em>or the \u201cadministrative appeal plus,\u201d under L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014745(d). <em>Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. at 171, 867 A.2d 370. Subsection (d) provides that the court should, \u201c[o]n a motion of any party,\u201d \u201csubmit to a jury any question of fact involved in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At a trial <em>de novo, </em>the \u201c \u2018burden is upon the appellant to overcome the presumption that the decision of the Commission is prima facie correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 867 A.2d 370 (quoting <em>Abell v. Albert F. Goetze, Inc., </em>245 Md. 433, 437, 226 A.2d 253 (1967)). \u201cThis can be done by submitting new evidence,\u201d or by relying on the record before the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 867 A.2d 370 (quoting <em>Abell, </em>245 Md. at 437, 226 A.2d 253). The jury should be instructed of the Commission\u2019s earlier decision \u201cand of its presumptive correctness and will be entitled to give it evidentiary significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 226 A.2d 253 (quoting <em>Am. Airlines Corp. v. Stokes, </em>120 Md.App. 350, 360, 707 A.2d 412 (1998)). The \u201c \u2018Commission\u2019s decision is merely <em>evidence </em>of a particular fact (or facts) which, as with all evidence, the jury is free to disregard if it finds it to be incredible.\u2019\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>391 Md. at 76, 891 A.2d 1103 (quoting <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, Inc., </em>334 Md. 480, 484, 639 A.2d 701 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Here, Ms. Simmons requested a jury trial in the circuit court. In so doing, she sought essentially <em>de novo </em>review, which entitled Comfort Suites to introduce additional evidence regarding whether a home security system constituted compensable medical treatment under the facts of this case. Before receiving a <em>de novo </em>jury trial, however, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>filed motions for summary judgment. Now that we have found the grant of summary judgment to be improper, the appropriate remedy is to remand to the circuit court for the requested trial <em>de novo </em>before a jury. At that point, both parties can submit additional evidence, and the trier of fact will determine, under the particular facts of this case, whether a home security system to allay the anxiety and insomnia of Ms. Simmons constitutes compensable medical treatment under \u00a7 9-660.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.
