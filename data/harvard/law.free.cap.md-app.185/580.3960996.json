Pursuant to each of the three theft convictions, the trial court imposed a ten-year prison sentence, each to run consecutively for an aggregate of thirty years. Appellant was further sentenced to an additional two years of imprisonment for his other convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">From these convictions and sentences, appellant filed the instant appeal, presenting two questions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>1. Does application of the single larceny doctrine dictate that appellant\u2019s actions constituted a single criminal act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">2. Did the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury adequately cover legal issues properly generated by the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">For the reasons that follow, we answer appellant\u2019s first question in the affirmative and we conclude that appellant\u2019s second question was not properly preserved. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">On December 7, 2007, two motorcycles and a van were reported stolen from the area around Glen Burnie, Maryland. Howard County police were not provided with information as to the identity of the perpetrators; however, they were able to locate one of the motorcycles by its LoJack<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> signal near Port Capital Drive in Howard County. The investigating officers determined that the signal emanated from a van parked in the driveway of a townhouse at 7235 Old Friendship Way. After several hours of covert surveillance of the van, appellant was seen exiting the townhouse and entering the van. The officers followed the van once it turned onto the main road. Shortly thereafter, the van collided with two parked cars, after which appellant jumped out of the van and escaped on foot. The police pursued appellant and apprehended him two to three minutes later. The stolen motorcycles were found inside the van, which was also later determined to have been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>A jury trial was held on October 24 and 25, 2007. Prior to jury deliberations, the trial judge charged the jury as follows during the course of his instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">Once again, these written instructions are going back. You can review them individually or collectively to determine what, if any, significance you give to these instructions and what, if any differences you see.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel interposed no objection, nor did he take exceptions to the instruction. At the conclusion of jury deliberations, appellant was convicted of three counts of possession of stolen property\u2014two counts of misdemeanor fleeing and eluding, and one count each of reckless driving, \u201cfailing to stop after an unattended vehicle and property damage accident\u201d and driving while privilege was suspended. Appellant was acquitted, <em>inter alia, </em>of the counts of theft of motor vehicle. On January 11, 2008, appellant was sentenced to thirty-two years to the Division of Correction. This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided <em>infra </em>as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Appellant contends that application of the single larceny doctrine dictates that his actions constituted a single criminal act. Appellant was convicted and sentenced for three separate counts of possession of stolen property<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subsequent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>thefts of the two motorcycles and the van. According to appellant, however, the State failed to meet its burden of proving that these thefts were not part of a single larcenous scheme or course of conduct and, therefore, appellant\u2019s thefts should have been deemed as one criminal act under the \u201csingle larceny doctrine.\u201d Instead, appellant was sentenced to consecutive ten-year sentences for each of the three counts of possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Single Larceny Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Court of Appeals first recognized the \u201csingle larceny doctrine\u201d in <em>State v. Warren, </em>77 Md. 121, 26 A. 500 (1893), and more recently reexamined the doctrine in <em>State v. White, </em>348 Md. 179, 702 A.2d 1263 (1997) and <em>Kelley v. State, </em>402 Md. 745, 756, 939 A.2d 149 (2008). The doctrine evolved as a common law principle which typically arises in three contexts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-z\">(1) whether a count in a charging document alleging that the defendant stole the property of several persons at the same time charges more than one offense and is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>duplicitous; (2) whether a prosecution, conviction, or sentencing for stealing the property of one person bars, under double jeopardy principles, the prosecution, conviction, or sentencing for having stolen the property of another person at the same time; and (3) whether, when the property of different persons is stolen at the same time, the values of the separate items of property may be aggregated to raise the grade of the offense or the severity of the punishment, to the extent that either is dependent on the value of the property taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>White, </em>348 Md. at 182, 702 A.2d 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In <em>Warren, </em>the Court of Appeals, faced with the first of these fact patterns, answered the question: \u201cDoes the stealing of several articles of property at the same time, belonging to several owners, constitute one offense, or as many separate offenses as these different owners of the property stolen?\u201d <em>Warren, </em>77 Md. at 122, 26 A. 500. Although the Court, in its analysis, did not state that its decision was based on the single larceny doctrine, it applied the principle, expositing that \u201cthe stealing of several articles <em>at the same time, </em>whether belonging to the same person, or to several persons, constituted but one offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). The <em>Warren </em>Court then articulated its rationale, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">It is but one offense, because the act is one continuous act\u2014 the same transaction; and the gist of the offense being the felonious taking of the property, we do not see how the legal quality of the act is in any manner affected by the fact that the property stolen, instead of belonging to one person is the several property of different persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The Court cautioned, however, that \u201cthe stealing of property <em>at different times, </em>whether belonging to the same person or different persons, constituted separate offenses.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 26 A. 500. (Emphasis added); <em>see Kelley, </em>402 Md. at 750, 939 A.2d 149. Subsequent to <em>State v. Warren, </em>however, the Court of Appeals had determined that a single charge against a defendant could encompass property stolen at different times. <em>Delcher v. State, </em>161 Md. 475, 483, 158 A. 37 (1932) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(where defendant stole money on several occasions over a two-year period, it was not necessary to charge separate counts \u201ccovering each of the items in a series of continuing offenses\u201d); <em>Horsey v. State, 225 </em>Md. 80, 83, 169 A.2d 457 (1961) (where defendant stole various items of clothing and accessories on different dates from store where he was employed, the trial court could properly conclude \u201cthat the separate takings were pursuant to a common scheme or intent\u201d and that it \u201cis generally held that if they are, the fact that the takings occur on different occasions does not establish that they are separate crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Most recently, in <em>Kelley, </em>402 Md. at 758, 939 A.2d 149, the Court of Appeals reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUp\">a single scheme conceivably may be found where multiple takings from different owners at different locations are in quick and unbroken succession and from a limited area ... [\u00a1however, w]here there is a more significant time lapse between the takings ... or they occur from locations that are not in very close proximity, the general rule that the takings are not part of a single scheme or continuing course of conduct should be applied....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">This determination \u201cis a factual matter that must be based on the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756, 939 A.2d 149. The Court of Appeals explained that the burden of proving whether the takings were separate or part of a single scheme rested with the State: \u201cThe question, then, is whether the State has sufficiently established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was, or ... was <em>not, </em>a single larcenous scheme or course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Maryland Theft Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The legislature created the theft statute to consolidate, in a single statutory scheme, the various common law larceny related crimes. <em>State v. Burroughs, </em>333 Md. 614, 636 A.2d 1009 (1994). <em>Acquah v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 29, 48, 686 A.2d 690 (1996). Prior to the enactment of the consolidated theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>statute, larceny, receiving stolen goods and related theft offenses were delineated under separate criminal statutes. Maryland\u2019s Theft Statute provides several theories, requiring the State to prove different elements under which an accused can be charged. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. (2002, 2008 Supp.), Criminal Law (C.L.), \u00a7\u00a7 7-104, 7-105.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 7-104(c), entitled \u201cPossessing personal property,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">(1) A person may not possess stolen personal property knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it probably has been stolen, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">(i) intends to deprive the owner of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">(ii) willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(iii) uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing that the use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Appellant postulates that, unlike other versions of theft which require the accused to have actually <em>taken </em>the property as part of the theft, \u00a7 7-104(c) requires mere <em>possession </em>of stolen goods. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 7-104(a) (\u201cperson may not willfully or knowingly obtain or exert unauthorized control over property\u201d); \u00a7 7-105 (\u201cperson may not willfully take a motor vehicle\u201d). Appellant points out that the Court of Appeals has determined that, although one statute encompasses \u00a7 7-104(a) and \u00a7 7-104(c), an accused cannot \u201cbe both the thief and possessor of the same stolen good.\u201d <em>Grant v. State, </em>318 Md. 672, 679, 569 A.2d 1237 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The single larceny doctrine is codified under C.L. \u00a7 7-103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASo\">(f) Course of conduct\u2014Aggregation.\u2014When theft is committed in violation of this part under one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">(1) the conduct may be considered as one crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(2) the value of the property or services may be aggregated in determining whether the theft is a felony or a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Prior to sentencing, the circuit court requested the preparation of a pre-sentence investigation. The investigation, submitted by the Division of Parole and Probation (DPP), did not treat the three theft counts separately for sentencing purposes. In its Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing, the State took issue with the DPP\u2019s treatment of the theft counts as a single event:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">In reviewing the sentencing guidelines submitted by the [DPP] the State does not agree that they correspond with the calculations as provided by the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The manual provides sufficient guidance in calculating multiple criminal events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">The evidence presented during the trial was that the motorcycles and tags were stolen on different days and from different victims at different locations. The convicted offenses for thefts all relate to different victims and different location [sic] as to where the thefts occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Additionally, at the sentencing hearing, the State opposed the manner in which appellant\u2019s sentence was calculated in the Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing prepared by DPP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\">Your Honor, as the State has submitted already in their memorandum, in our request to correct the sentencing guidelines that was submitted by the [DPP], the State believes that the individual count that they relate to the (inaudible) of those items, <em>those are separate criminal events and so, therefore, they should be added and not taken together from the low to high as ivas suggested by the Parole and Probation agent that submitted the report.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>I do have a copy, Your Honor, of each guidelines [sic] for each event as separated as is required by the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines Manual showing the (inaudible) of each offense for each one of the criminal events for the separate thefts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"pAi9\">\n<em>i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Approximately the first half of the State\u2019s appellate brief is devoted to the argument that appellant, by failing to object, has not preserved for appellate review the issue of the court\u2019s refusal to apply the single larceny doctrine. The State posits that the DPP concluded that appellant\u2019s convictions constituted only one crime; however, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the State\u2019s opposition to the position taken by DPP and failed to otherwise address the issue. The gravamen of the State\u2019s position is that, \u201cBecause the jury could have found that Webb received the vehicles at different times or places ..., it was appropriate <em>to sentence </em>Webb on three separate theft counts.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Appellant likewise concedes, in his brief, that his counsel failed, at sentencing, to object to the trial court\u2019s imposition of three separate, consecutive sentences. The trial court, after hearing the State\u2019s argument and DPP\u2019s findings, determined not to apply the single larceny doctrine. The State maintains that, generally, appellate courts have held that a failure to lodge an objection during sentencing waives the right to appeal the sentence. <em>See, e.g., Brecker v. State, </em>304 Md. 36, 40, 497 A.2d 479 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The State also relies on <em>Reiger v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 693, 908 A.2d 124 (2006), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">[I]t is the availability of an opportunity to ask for and obtain immediate relief from the sentencing court that determines whether a contemporaneous objection is necessary. Simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>stated, when there is time to object, there is opportunity to correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 701, 908 A.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The State thus sums up its argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">To be clear, this is not a case where trial counsel failed to recognize an issue, trial counsel did not object, and the judge made no ruling. The issue was raised and discussed twice\u2014once in the prosecutor\u2019s sentencing memorandum, and once at the sentencing hearing itself. Thus, the applicability of the single larceny doctrine to this case <em>ivas raised and decided below; </em>but due to his failure to object, [appellant] has not preserved his claim for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Appellant, citing the above excerpt from the State\u2019s brief, retorts that we should reject its claim of waiver \u201c[w]here the State concedes the issue was raised in and decided by the trial court.\u201d Expounding, he relies on <em>DeLeon v. State, </em>407 Md. 16, 962 A.2d 383 (2008), for the proposition that the primary purposes of the preservation rule are to bring errors to the attention of the trial court so the court has an opportunity to correct them and to prevent piecemeal litigation and aid in the speedy resolution of litigation. The error, he says, \u201cwas brought to the attention of the trial court by Parole and Probation, disputed by the State, and then decided by the trial court.\u201d Citing <em>Carter v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 437, 443, 534 A.2d 1015 (1988), he maintains that the court, having had the opportunity to consider both sides of the issue before ruling against him, further objection, by his trial counsel would have been futile, and was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">He further suggests that our review of the issue on this appeal will obviate the expense of post-conviction review and further the objective of preventing piecemeal litigation and aiding in the speedy resolution of litigation. Capsulizing his argument is the language of Maryland Rule 8-131 (a), which he points out, makes no mention of the requirement to object and provides, in the disjunctive, rather than the conjunctive, for appellate review when an issue has been \u201craised in or decided by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\n<em>ii</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Generally, a party preserves an issue for appeal by interposing an objection\u2014with particularity\u2014on the record. This requirement provides full opportunity for the trial court to evaluate and assess a party\u2019s argument. <em>See DeLeon v. State, </em>407 Md. at 21, 962 A.2d 383 (primary purposes of the preservation rule are to bring errors to the attention of the trial court so the court has an opportunity to correct them and to prevent piecemeal litigation and aid in the speedy resolution of litigation). The Court of Appeals, in <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 326-27, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006), articulated the rationale for the requirement that an objection be interposed to preserve an issue for appellate review:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In <em>Conyers, </em>we explained the reasons why we ordinarily do not exercise the discretion to address and decide unpreserved issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The rules for preservation of issues have a salutary purpose of preventing unfairness and requiring that all issues be raised in and decided by the trial court, and these rules must be followed in all cases including capital cases. The few cases where we have exercised our discretion to review unpreserved issues are cases where prejudicial error was found and the failure to preserve the issue was not a matter of trial tactics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The <em>Abeokuto </em>Court added, \u201cWe will review the unpreserved claim only where the unobjected to error can be characterized as compelling, extraordinary, exceptional, or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">We deem instructive our prior decisions and decisions by the Court of Appeals, which have considered the preservation issue, in the context o'f a defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction should be merged for sentencing purposes. In <em>Slye v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 520, 522-23, 401 A.2d 195 (1979), a case involving merger, we considered the effect of the imposition of concurrent sentences where the convictions should have been merged:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Examination of the record reveals that appellant\u2019s trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case and stated, in the course of his supporting-argument, that \u201cthe application of both the grand larceny and grand shoplifting would seem to merge somehow or some way in that aspect.\u201d The motion was denied. Appellant did not object thereafter when the trial court submitted both offenses to the jury nor when the jury returned a verdict convicting him under each count nor when the court sentenced him to 10 years for grand larceny and a concurrent three-year term for shoplifting. The State, citing <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 388, 377 A.2d 588, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977), argues that Rule 1085 precludes appellate review of the merger issue when, as here, the sentences imposed were concurrent, not consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Writing for the Court in <em>Rose v. State, </em>Judge Davidson observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">This Court will not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear to have been tried or decided by the trial court. We have, however, occasionally decided such points or questions. While we have often refused to decide a question of merger which has not been raised or decided in the trial court in cases in which concurrent terms were imposed, <em>we have not declined to consider such questions in cases in ivhich consecutive terms ivere imposed. In such cases we shall decide the merger question in order to avoid the manifest injustice which would result if consecutive sentences were imposed for merged offenses. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">37 Md.App. at 393-94, 377 A.2d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Explicating the reasoning underpinning the exception to the requirement that an objection be registered in order to obtain appellate review, we continued in <em>Slye:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">The \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d rationale enunciated in <em>Rose </em>is, we think, clearly applicable to the instant appeal. Here, appellant contends that the larceny conviction, for which he received a sentence of 10 years, should merge into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>shoplifting conviction, for which he received a 3-year term. The latter, it is true, was concurrent. However, if we were not to entertain the merger issue because of Md. Rule 1085, appellant is faced with the prospect of an additional seven years incarceration for an offense which he claims, on the authority of <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A.2d 262 (1977), should have been merged into the conviction for which he received the lesser, 3-year, sentence. The situation is, in practical effect, indistinguishable from that where consecutive sentences are imposed and considerations of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d are equally present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">In this respect, we deem it appropriate to point out that, upon close scrutiny, the cases wherein we have declined to review the question of merger of concurrent sentences because of Rule 1085, do not involve these considerations. In those cases, unlike the present appeal, the sentence imposed for the conviction proposed to be merged was less than or, at most, equal to the sentence imposed for the other conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we shall decide the merger question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 524, 401 A.2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\"><em>See, e.g., Brooks v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 550, 552, 381 A.2d 718 (1978) (Where appellant had received consecutive sentences of twelve years for assault with intent to murder and three years for carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure, citing <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md.App. at 393-94, 377 A.2d 588, we held: \u201cBecause appellant was given consecutive sentences, we will consider the issue of merger even though it was not raised or decided below.\u201d). <em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 306, 316, 381 A.2d 303 (1977); <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 632, 645, 308 A.2d 726, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973); <em>Carter v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 242, 248, 289 A.2d 837, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 734 (1972); <em>Moore v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 396, 406, 291 A.2d 73, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 740 (1972); <em>Alston v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 624, 630, 276 A.2d 225, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 745 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In this case, the trial court imposed three ten-year prison sentences, each to run consecutively, for an aggregate of thirty years. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the trial court erred in refusing to apply the single larceny doctrine, the error, under the court\u2019s ruling, would result in appellant serving twenty years in excess of what he would have served had he received the benefit of a favorable ruling. Similar to the rationale underpinning the <em>Slye </em>and <em>Rose </em>decisions, appellate review should be afforded Webb in order to avoid the manifest injustice which would result if consecutive sentences were improperly imposed. <em>Slye, </em>42 Md.App. at 524, 401 A.2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Moreover, the State is not unduly prejudiced in the case <em>sub judice </em>because the State was not deprived of the opportunity to present evidence on whether the single larceny doctrine should have been applied since the issue does plainly appear by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court. <em>See Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 505-06, 864 A.2d 1006 (2004) (Permitting the appellant to raise the issue of whether canine\u2019s ability to detect diazepam tablets renders his sniff a search for the first time on appeal would undermine the purposes behind Rule 8-131, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cit would prejudice unfairly the State, because the State did not have the opportunity to present evidence on this complex issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Contrary to what occurs most often, here, the State insists that it is the very fact that the issue <em>ivas </em>raised <em>and </em>decided below which imposed a heavier burden on appellant to object, which should operate to preclude appellate review of the court\u2019s refusal to apply the single larceny doctrine. The State emphasizes in its brief, \u201cThis is not a case where trial counsel failed to recognize an issue, trial counsel did not object, and the judge made no ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">As appellant concedes, his trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s ruling. DDP, however, in its pre-sentence memorandum and at the sentencing hearing, had articulated the precise position which appellant now embraces and the State, at that hearing and in its pre-sentence memorandum, argued against the position taken by DDP. The court, having consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ered the pre-sentence memorandum of the State and DDP, decided the issue averse to appellant. Patently, the precise issue for which appellant now seeks appellate review was raised <em>and </em>was decided by the trial court. Accordingly, the requirement \u201cthat counsel bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings,\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>384 Md. at 505, 864 A.2d 1006, was achieved in this case, albeit by a third-party, DDP, in its Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing. That the court would have ruled differently had appellant\u2019s counsel added his voice to DDP\u2019s Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing is nowhere evident from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 201, 905 A.2d 315 (2006), the appellant\u2019s counsel revealed allegedly privileged information to the trial court and the judge repeatedly stated that her determination concerning Smith\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights \u201cwas based upon the proffer of the State and [Smith\u2019s counsel]^ statement that, after consulting with his client, he didn\u2019t believe he had a Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d Noting the Court had held in <em>Newman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004) that \u201conly the client has [the] power to waive the attorney-client privilege,\u201d and that (quoting <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 138, 345 A.2d 830 (1975)), \u201cintrinsic to the definition of \u2018waiver\u2019 is the recognition that the client must be informed of both the scope and nature of the right being relinquished as well as the consequences of so doing,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that Smith\u2019s case was one of the rare instances in which delving into the tactics and strategies of defense counsel in a collateral proceeding would be pointless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfR\">In the present case, as we have determined <em>infra, </em>Smith\u2019s counsel had an inherent conflict of interest between his duties to Smith and his asserted duties to the trial court. As such, Smith\u2019s attorney could not impartially advise him regarding any waiver of the attorney-client privilege because the trial court had an interest in learning counsel\u2019s advice to Smith. Thus, regardless of whether Smith waived his attorney-client privilege either expressly or implicitly, the waiver would be ineffective. <em>Moreover, we can conceive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>of no circumstances that would require Smith\u2019s counsel to reveal the substance of his advice to the court, as such a disclosure could only inure to his client\u2019s detriment. Therefore, we conclude that a collateral evidentiary hearing concerning Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s disclosure would be superfluous. </em>Our refusal to address Smith\u2019s claim on direct appeal would constitute a waste of judicial resources. <em>See In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. at 727, 770 A.2d 202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 201, 345 A.2d 830 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It may be that, having been present when the Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing was submitted to the court by DDP, and the State presented its argument in opposition thereto, counsel might well have considered it futile, after the court ruled, to argue further. Such a consideration, however, would not relieve counsel of the obligation to pursue a justiciable issue on his client\u2019s behalf. Appellant\u2019s counsel, rather than enter the fray, sat on the sideline as an observer, while DDP was recommending that the court impose a ten-year sentence and the State was arguing that his client should receive a thirty-year sentence. There is no conceivable legal theory or tactical advantage that would be explicative of how failure to join in the argument that the court should impose a ten-year sentence, rather than a thirty-year sentence, could be in his client\u2019s best interests. Stated otherwise, there was absolutely no downside to a zealous argument in favor of treating his convictions as a single transaction. Manifestly, the failure to present argument constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. As was the case in <em>Smith, </em>our refusal to address appellant\u2019s claim on direct appeal would constitute a waste of judicial resources. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Finally, in <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>343 Md. 444, 447, 682 A.2d 247 (1996), a case in which the appellant\u2019s two handgun convictions were based upon the same acts or transaction, and appellant failed, in the circuit court, to object to separate sentences for use of a handgun in a commission of a felony, the Court of Appeals, in answering the question of whether this Court erred in refusing to order merger of the sentence for wearing or carrying a handgun, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On numerous occasions this Court has pointed out that \u201c \u2018illegal sentences may be challenged at any time, even on appeal,\u2019 \u201d <em>Spitzinger v.

In support of that assertion, appellant argues that our sister jurisdictions have specifically held that, where a defendant is convicted of possession of stolen goods at the same time and place, he has committed but one criminal act under the single larceny doctrine. <em>See Beaty v. State, </em>856 N.E.2d 1264, 1274 (Ind.App.2006) (\u201cBy simple extension, ... if a defendant <em>receives </em>several items of stolen property, knowing the property to be stolen, at the same time and the same place, he has committed but one criminal act, regardless of whether the items he received belonged to several owners or were the subject of more than one theft.\u201d); <em>People v. Loret, </em>136 A.D.2d 316, 317, 526 N.Y.S.2d 872 (1988) (holding that \u201cpossession at one time and place of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>items taken in separate thefts from various owners is but one crime of criminal possession of stolen property\u201d); <em>State v. Bair, </em>671 P.2d 208, 206 (Utah 1983) (determining that, where the evidence shows that stolen articles were all received on one occasion, the receipt is considered a single offense and must be prosecuted as one crime); <em>State v. Reisig, </em>128 Ariz. 60, 623 P.2d 849, 851 (1980) (holding that a defendant who possessed nine articles of property can only be convicted of one count of possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The single larceny doctrine, we conclude, is applicable to the crime of \u201cPossessing personal property.\u201d \u00a7 7-104(c). Notably, in many of the theft cases in which the single larceny doctrine is implicated, cited <em>supra,, </em>it is the State that is attempting to aggregate various thefts of smaller items in order to exceed the $500 threshold to establish felony theft. In those instances, the State had the burden of establishing \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that there was ... a single larcenous scheme or course of conduct.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>402 Md. at 756, 939 A.2d 149. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the opposite scenario is presented. Appellant is contending that the single larceny doctrine requires aggregation of his three charges for felony theft. Notwithstanding this role reversal, the State retains the burden of establishing \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that there ... <em>was not </em>[ ] a single larcenous scheme or course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We agree with our sister jurisdictions, <em>supra, </em>that, by \u201csimple extension,\u201d if a defendant comes into possession of multiple items of stolen property in rapid and unbroken succession, he has committed but one criminal act, regardless of whether the items in his possession belonged to multiple owners or were the subject of multiple thefts. <em>See Beaty, </em>856 N.E.2d at 1274. Appellant was charged with three counts of felony theft and, thus, the State had the burden of proving that the three alleged felonies were not part of the same scheme or course of conduct. <em>See Kelley, </em>402 Md. at 756, 939 A.2d 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The State contends that appellant\u2019s argument relating to the single larceny (1) \u201crests entirely upon the erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>assumption that the jury\u2019s verdict is inconsistent unless it is interpreted to mean that [appellant] did not commit \u2018theft by taking\u2019 \u201d and (2) fails to take into account that the evidence produced at trial indicated that the \u201cvan and motorcycles were received at different times and places, and/or that [appellant] knew that they were stolen at different times and places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Inconsistent Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The State postulates that it is possible for the jury to have found appellant guilty of \u201cpossession\u201d of stolen property and not guilty of \u201cmotor vehicle taking,\u201d without concluding that appellant did not take the vehicles. According to the State, because the offenses of taking a motor vehicle and theft have different elements and because appellant\u2019s defense on the motor vehicle counts was intended to refute an element not shared by the theft counts, the two verdicts are compatible. Moreover, even if the two verdicts are deemed inconsistent, juries in Maryland are permitted to return inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases, which are tolerated because of the historic role that the jury plays in our justice system and because \u201c \u2018inconsistences may be the product of lenity, mistake or a compromise to reach unanimity.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 24, 29, 949 A.2d 619 (2008) (quoting <em>Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 406, 809 A.2d 653 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The motor vehicle theft statute, C.L. \u00a7 7-105(a), defines \u201cOwner\u201d as one \u201cwho has a lawful interest in or [is] in lawful possession of the motor vehicle by consent or chain of consent of the title owner.\u201d By contrast, C.L. \u00a7 7-101(h) defines \u201cOwner,\u201d in part, as one \u201cwho has an interest in or possession of property <em>regardless of whether the person\u2019s interest or possession is </em>unlawful....\u201d (Emphasis added). Because C.L. \u00a7 7-104 is subject to the definition of owner pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 7-101, the owner of a vehicle need not have a lawful interest or lawful possession of the property in order to obtain a conviction. At trial, appellant argued that the van did not belong to the party named in his indictment. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>contends that some or all of the jurors may have acquitted appellant of the motor vehicle taking count involving the van, not because they did not believe appellant had taken the van, but rather, because they agreed with appellant\u2019s contention that the named party in the indictment was not the <em>owner </em>of the van as is required pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 7-105(a). Likewise, for the counts relating to the \u201ctaking\u201d of the motorcycles, appellant, at trial, argued that the testimony provided by the motorcycle owners was unreliable and did not establish lawful interest, possession or lack of consent and, thus, according to the State, the jury may have acquitted appellant of the charges of \u201ctaking\u201d the motorcycles because of the owners\u2019 questionable testimony and not because they believed appellant did not \u201ctake\u201d the motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The State\u2019s argument is without merit. Stated differently, the State contends that, even though there is no evidence that the jury believed appellant had taken the vehicles, because at least some jury members <em>may </em>have believed appellant took the vehicles at different times, application of the single larceny doctrine is improper. The State is correct that inconsistent verdicts are not proscribed in Maryland, but this precept does not relieve the State of its burden of proof at trial, discussed <em>supra. </em>The State\u2019s reliance on what some jurors <em>ma,y have believed </em>is both unsupported by both the law and the facts. The only evidence adduced at trial connecting appellant to the stolen property was that appellant was arrested while simultaneously in possession of stolen property following police surveillance and pursuit. Other than discussing appellant\u2019s possession of the stolen property, the State has failed to provide any facts or findings that establish that appellant had taken the stolen property. Instead, the State speculates as to the jury\u2019s deliberations and how it reached its verdict, which is not legally cognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>n</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>Receipt and Knowledge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The State next contends that, even if appellant were correct that the jury conclusively found that he was not the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>who \u201ctook\u201d the vehicles, the single larceny doctrine still does not require merger in this case. Although appellant refers to C.L. \u00a7 7-104(c) by its common moniker, \u201ctheft by possession,\u201d the section also includes the crime of receiving stolen property. <em>See Burns v. State, </em>149 Md.App. 526, 549, 817 A.2d 885 (2003). According to the State, the evidence indicated that the receipt of the stolen property occurred at different times and different places, thus precluding application of the single larceny doctrine. The State further argues that one of the cases cited by appellant, <em>Beaty, </em>856 N.E.2d at 1272, provides that, \u201cif a defendant receives items of stolen property, <em>knowing the items to be stolen, at separate times or separate places, </em>he has committed separate criminal acts.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The State posits that the evidence \u201csupports a finding that [appellant] received the Ford van and the two motorcycles at different times or in different places and/or that he knew that they were stolen at different times or different places.\u201d In support of that assertion, the State relies upon the evidence that it asserts indicates the items were stolen at different times and places from different owners, <em>i.e., </em>(1) the broken van ignition switch, enabling the van to be started without a key, hence the inference that it was taken prior to the motorcycles, (2) wheel locks on some of the motorcycles in the van, evidencing the owners\u2019 attempts to safeguard parked motorcycles against theft, (3) the set of Maryland registration plates in the van and the stolen registration plates on the van itself and (4) the facts that each motorcycle in the van had a cover and there were additional unused covers in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The State attempts to distinguish the authority cited by appellant in his brief, arguing that the decisions on which appellant relies address different factual scenarios, legal issues and statutory schemes. According to the State, <em>Bair, supra, </em>is distinguishable because, unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>the evidence conclusively demonstrated that the defendant did not receive the stolen items at different times. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Bair </em>decision arose out of Utah\u2019s \u201csingle criminal episode\u201d statute, for which Maryland has no analog. <em>Id. </em>at 207. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann., \u00a7\u00a7 76-1-401-403 (1953). Additionally, the State argues that, unlike the instant case, <em>Loret, </em>136 A.D.2d 316, 526 N.Y.S.2d 872, addressed criminal possession without contemplating \u201creceipt of stolen property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The crux of the State\u2019s argument is that, \u201c[bjecause the jury could have found that [appellant] <em>received </em>the vehicles at different times or places, or <em>that he knew </em>they were taken at different times or places, it was appropriate to sentence [appellant] on three separate theft counts.\u201d (Emphasis added). For the same reason that the State\u2019s argument in the previous section fails, so too does this argument fail. The State, as we noted, <em>supra, </em>provides mere speculation as to what the jury considered during its deliberations, which is not legally cognizable. Simply positing what the jury \u201ccould have\u201d found, without more, is insufficient to uphold a conviction. More problematic is the State\u2019s argument that, although the State references evidence that indicates that the vehicles were stolen at different times from different owners, it has failed to provide <em>any </em>evidence that appellant <em>received </em>the stolen vehicles at different times. The evidence on which the State relies fails to connect appellant with the actual <em>taking </em>of the vehicles and provides no basis by which to conclude that appellant received the stolen items at different times. Moreover, there is no evidence that appellant\u2019s knowledge\u2014if in fact he had knowledge\u2014that the property was stolen at different times has any bearing on his convictions. Appellant is charged with \u201cpossession\u201d of stolen property rather than \u201cknowing\u201d that the property was stolen at different times. Even if appellant knew that the items were stolen at different places from different owners, so long as appellant came into possession of those stolen items at the same time, he has committed a single act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We have concluded from our review of the record and the transcript of the trial proceedings that the State failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>establish that appellant was guilty of multiple felonies. To the contrary, the evidence indicated that the police witnessed appellant in possession of three stolen items at the \u201csame place and time.\u201d Although evidence indicates that the vehicles were stolen at different times, the State provided no evidence that appellant\u2019s possession of the property was preceded by his theft or knowledge of the theft of the property; the jury properly acquitted appellant of these charges. The police observed appellant enter a stolen van that contained stolen motorcycles, which was sufficient to establish only that appellant was in simultaneous possession of the stolen property. Lest there be any misapprehension of the reach of this opinion, the indispensable lynchpin of our decision that the single larceny doctrine should have been applied is that the credible evidence supported only that appellant, at a discrete point in time, was unlawfully in <em>possession </em>of the stolen property and not that he was the thief. In other words, only the point in time when the possession occurred was established. No evidence was adduced at trial that indicated that appellant came into possession of the stolen property at different times. Consequently, application of the single larceny doctrine constrains the conviction of one count of felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Accordingly, appellant was improperly convicted and sentenced for three separate felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Appellant contends that the trial judge provided the jury with \u201ca general advisory jury instruction.\u201d Midway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>through the jury instructions, the trial judge charged the jury that, in regard to the jury instructions, \u201cYou can review them individually or collectively to determine what, <em>if any, </em>significance you give to these instructions and what, if any differences you see.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant argues that the terms \u201cif any\u201d violated his right to due process pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by informing the jury that it could disregard the law \u201cin its entirety\u201d if it wished. Essentially, according to appellant, this \u201cgeneral advisory instruction is especially prejudicial because it permits the jury to disregard such fundamental rights as the presumption of innocence and burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We have held that errors in jury instructions, including improper instructions, must be objected to before appellate review will be exercised. <em>See Guardino v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 695, 702-03, 440 A.2d 1101 (1982); <em>Middleton v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 286, 292, 431 A.2d 734 (1981). Appellant concedes that his counsel failed to properly object to the alleged advisory instruction; however, he argues that this circumstance warrants our discretion to overlook failure to preserve where the error is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203, 411 A.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The trial judge provided the jury with written and oral jury instructions, in which the oral instructions constituted fifteen pages of transcript. Appellant\u2019s argument focuses on two words on page twelve of the jury instructions; however, the very first instruction provided to the jury advised that the jury was not free to disregard the judge\u2019s instructions on the law: \u201cMembers of the jury, the time has come to explain to you the law that applies to this case. The instructions that I give to you about the law are binding upon you. In other words, you must apply the law as I explain it to you in arriving at your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Maryland appellate courts have consistently rejected requests for plain error review of unobjected-to instructions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 322-23, 958 A.2d 295 (2008) (rejecting plain error review of advisory jury instructions, in part, because \u201cthe fact that an error was \u2018plain\u2019 does not excuse waiver\u201d); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 172-73, 423 A.2d 558 (1980) (declining plain error review of advisory jury instructions where defendant had preserved general objection pursuant to Fourteenth Amendment, but lodged no objection to specific instructions); <em>Simms v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 448, 455, 449 A.2d 1196 (1982) (declining plain error review of instruction that the court\u2019s charge was \u201cadvisory only\u201d); <em>Scarborough v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 276, 281, 437 A.2d 672 (1981) (declining to exercise discretionary review over unpreserved allegation of error regarding advisory jury instruction). Appellant failed to properly object or except to the jury instructions at trial.

The State's entire argument, which focuses on \u201creceipt,\u201d as opposed to \u201cpossession,\u201d of stolen property pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 7-104, is unsus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tainable in light of the jury instructions provided by the trial court. The term \"receive\u201d or \"receipt\u201d does not appear in a single instance in the jury instructions provided to the jury. Conversely, the term \"possess\" or \"possession\" appeared on fourteen occasions. To be sure, a few of those instances did not pertain to the thefts of the van and two motorcycles, but such is indicative that possession and not <em>receipt </em>of the stolen property was the essence of the charges against appellant. The State did not request that the jury be instructed on \u201creceipt\u201d of stolen property, nor did it present argument or evidence at trial under the theory it argues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. The jury instructions included various, alternative theories of criminal liability. It is conceivable that the trial judge was not indicating that the jury instructions were \"advisory,\u201d but rather, that the jurors were permitted to assess the alternate theories of liability and determine on which theory they would rely in their deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
