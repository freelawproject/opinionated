In lieu of the suspension, the circuit court ordered the MVA to issue Baptist an ignition-interlock restricted license, even though Baptist failed to timely complete the statutory requirements for participation in the MVA\u2019s Ignition Interlock System Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d). <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(vii); TR \u00a7 16-404.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">This appeal followed. The MVA poses two questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">I. Did the circuit court exceed its limited authority to intervene by injunction in agency action, and fail to adhere to TR \u00a7 16-205.1, when it ordered the MVA to stay a statutorily mandated suspension of Baptist\u2019s license ..., despite Baptist\u2019s concession that he failed through inattention and neglect to complete within 30 days the actions required to elect participation in the interlock program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">II. Did the circuit court fail to comply with the Maryland Rules and with constitutional principles of due process when it entered a final injunction in a civil action only three days after the filing of the complaint, and when the entire proceeding consisted of a twenty-minute telephone conversation on the merits of Baptist\u2019s unserved pleadings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the Order issued by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On November 9, 2007, Montgomery County Police stopped Baptist on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Baptist consented to a breath test, which indicated that he had an alcohol concentration of .20 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Accordingly, appellee was under the influence <em>per se, see </em>TR \u00a7 11-174.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was subject to a license suspension under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A). That section provides that, for a first offense, the driver\u2019s license of a person whose alcohol concentration is .15 or more shall be suspended for a period of 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On the same date, the police issued Baptist an \u201cOrder of Suspension,\u201d which stated: \u201c[Y]ou are hereby notified that your Maryland Driver\u2019s License/Privilege will be suspended effective on the Forty-sixth (46) day from the above \u2018Issue Date\u2019 because ... you submitted to a test indicating an alcohol concentration of. 15 or more.\u201d In addition, the police provided Baptist with written notification that, in lieu of suspension, or a request for a hearing on the suspension, Baptist could elect to participate in the MVA\u2019s Program for one year, pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(vii), if he met certain eligibility requirements and completed enrollment in the Program within thirty days from the date of the Order of Suspension, i.e., by December 9, 2007. These requirements included installation of the interlock device in appellee\u2019s vehicle; his election of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Program, in writing; and surrender of appellee\u2019s driver\u2019s license, in exchange for the issuance of a new license by the MVA, restricting' appellee to driving vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device. It is undisputed that an interlock device was timely installed on Baptist\u2019s vehicle, but Baptist did not timely submit his written election form, turn in his driver\u2019s license, or obtain a restricted license.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Baptist claimed below that the interlock device was installed on November 26, 2007. He then went to the MVA on December 24, 2007, because he did not receive anything in the mail from the MVA. But, because the lines were too long, he left. In the meantime, because Baptist did not timely complete the requirements for election and entry into the Program, the statutorily mandated 90-day license suspension took effect on December 25, 2007. On January 2, 2008, some three and a half weeks after expiration of the thirty-day deadline, Baptist sought an interlock restricted license from the MVA. At that time, he was informed that his 90-day license suspension was already in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On January 4, 2008, through counsel, appellee filed in the circuit court a \u201cComplaint for Injunctive Relief to Place Plaintiff in Interlock Program.\u201d The Complaint averred, in part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">5.... Mr. Baptist elected to enter the Ignition Interlock System Program. <em>On November 26, 2007, he </em>went to Obsession Motor Sports in Rockville, Maryland, and <em>had the Interlock System installed in his car. </em>A copy of the Lease Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">6. While at Obsession Motor Sports, Mr. Baptist was told that his system would be monitored by a company called \u201cSmart Start\u201d which was in contact with the Motor Vehicle Administration. He understood that therefore MVA was notified of his decision to enter the interlock program. <em>He believed that MVA would send him a driver\u2019s license </em>which would permit him to drive as long as the car he was driving was equipped with the Interlock System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>7. Mr. Baptist made this decision because he needs his driver\u2019s license to keep his job. He is employed as a satellite communications engineer at Segovia, Inc. in Herndon, Virginia. He lives in Germantown. There is no public transportation available to him. Losing his license means losing his job. Therefore, he elected to enter the Interlock Program so as to keep his license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">8. Mr. Baptist is also the primary supporter of his daughter, four-year-old Haylee Baptist. He equally shares custody of Haylee with her mother. He drives Haylee to school. By entering the Interlock Program, he would be able to continue to drive Haylee to school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">9. <em>Unfortunately, Mr. Baptist did not take the Interlock Lease documents promptly to MVA. </em>As <em>set forth above, he thought that MVA was notified because Smart Start (worthing with the Motor Vehicle Administration) was monitoring his interlock. </em>He understood that MVA would send him an Interlock driver\u2019s license in the mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">10. <em>Since he did not receive anything in the mail, on December 21, 2007, [appellee] went to the MVA in Gaithersburg. Unfortunately, the lines ivere so long </em>that after waiting several hours he gave up. (His young daughter was with him, and simply could not wait any longer on Christmas Eve.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">11. <em>On January 2, 2008, Mr. Baptist went back to MVA to find out why he had not received a driver\u2019s license. At that time, he was told that he had missed the thiBy-day deadline to enter the Interlock Program. </em>He was also told that his license was suspended because he had not brought his Interlock paperwork to MVA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">13. As set forth above, Mr. Baptist did enter the Interlock Program. The Interlock Program is actually installed on his vehicle (2006 Ford Taurus). He does not pose any danger to the community, since he already has the device installed. <em>His sole failure was that he did notify MVA by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>bringing the Interlock Lease paperwork to them. </em>(He thought they were notified electronically because Smart Start was monitoring his Interlock.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">14. At this point, Mr. Baptist cannot legally drive. His license has been suspended and he cannot go to work. Given the extreme hardship, Mr. Baptist is respectfully requesting that this Honorable Court issue an Order immediately staying the suspension (temporary restraining order) and also ordering the MVA to enroll Mr. Baptist in the Interlock Program for one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Also on January'4, 2008, appellee\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cPetition for Temporary Restraining Order (Immediate Stay of Suspension),\u201d stating that Mr. Baptist would face \u201csevere hardship\u201d if he were required to wait for the MVA\u2019s answer or for the case to be fully litigated, because he could not go to work \u201cto support himself and his family.\u201d Appellee also stated: \u201cSince Mr. Baptist is already in the Ignition Interlock Program and already has the device installed in his car, there is no danger to the community in having him drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In addition, on January 4, 2008, appellee filed a \u201cCertificate of Immediate Service,\u201d indicating that both the Petition and the Complaint had been faxed to Jonathan Acton, II, Esquire, Assistant Attorney General and Principal Counsel to the MVA. Appellee also filed a \u201cLine,\u201d stating: \u201cKindly process this so that I can walk it to the duty judge when it is ready.\u201d In actuality, at approximately 3:00 p.m. on January 4, 2008, Baptist\u2019s counsel called Thomas Liberatore, MVA\u2019s Manager of Driver Wellness and Safety, and faxed his assistant a copy of the pleadings. As a result, on January 7, 2008, appellee\u2019s counsel filed an \u201cAmended Certificate of Immediate Service,\u201d advising that the original Certificate of Service was incorrect. He averred that the documents had been faxed \u201cto the Administrative Assistant for Thomas Liberatore, an executive at the Motor Vehicle Administration,\u201d and not to Acton, as had been represented in the original Certificate of Service. According to appellee, Assistant Attorney General Dore Liebowitz was given a copy, \u201cpresumably by Mr. Liberatore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The Clerk apparently issued to counsel for Baptist a summons for \u201cpersonal service.\u201d However, appellant contends that neither the MVA, its Administrator, nor the Office of the Attorney General was served with the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The circuit court duty judge telephoned Liberatore on January 4, 2008, seeking to hold an immediate proceeding over the telephone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, Mr. Liberatore requested assistance from the Office of the Attorney General. According to appellant, it was at that point that MVA\u2019s counsel reviewed, for the first time, the available documents and a copy of Baptist\u2019s driving record.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Thereafter, MVA\u2019s counsel participated in an unrecorded telephone call with the court. The MVA\u2019s lawyer argued that the MVA\u2019s action in suspending Baptist\u2019s license was proper because he had failed a breath test and had also failed to comply with the requirements for participation in the Program. According to appellant, at the conclusion of the telephone call the court ruled that Baptist\u2019s driving privileges should not be suspended, he should be enrolled in the Program, and he should receive a restricted driver\u2019s license. Baptist\u2019s counsel subsequently faxed a proposed order to counsel for the MVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Liebowitz faxed a letter to Baptist\u2019s counsel on January 7, 2008, with a copy to the judge, contesting three alleged defects in Baptist\u2019s proposed order. She wrote, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">As you are aware, the MVA opposes any attempt to bypass the requirements of the Ignition Interlock Program by presenting what amounts to several actions in haste to a judge without proper notification to counsel. Although I participated in a phone conference before Judge McGann, the MVA did not have sufficient notice or opportunity to properly prepare its argument in opposition to your client\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Moreover, the Order which you propose to submit to Judge McGann contains several items which require clarification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">The first clause appears to be a Temporary Retraining [sic] Order, the proper form of which can be found at Maryland Rule 15-504(c). The second clause appears to be a stay of your client\u2019s license suspension, which belies the fact that there is no other case filed on his behalf which would justify a stay pending its outcome. Finally, the third clause of this Order appears to be a final decision wherein the Court is ordering Mr. Baptist be admitted into the Interlock Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">As it is presently the MVA\u2019s intent to further litigate this matter in whatever manner is appropriate, kindly submit an Order to clarify the nature of this act and therefore, the nature of MVA\u2019s next remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Despite Liebowitz\u2019s concerns, the court signed Baptist\u2019s proposed Order on January 7, 2008. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">Having read and considered the Petition (Immediate Stay of Suspension) and having heard argument of counsel, and good cause having been shown, it is this 7th day of January, 2008 by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">ORDERED that the Petition for Temporary Restraining Order be and the same as [sic] hereby GRANTED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">ORDERED that the suspension of [Baptist\u2019s] driver\u2019s license ... is hereby STAYED immediately; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">ORDERED that the Motor Vehicle Administration shall permit Plaintiff Michael Glen [sic] Baptist to be enrolled into the Ignition Interlock System Program, and shall issue him a driver\u2019s license with the appropriate restriction, and that the duration time for such program (one year) shall commence once the license is issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Clerk entered the Order on January 8, 2008. On that date, Baptist obtained his restricted driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Before reviewing the MVA\u2019s contentions, it is helpful to review the text of some of the key statutory provisions concerning the Program. As the Court observed in <em>Meanor v. State, </em>364 Md. 511, 528, 774 A.2d 394 (2001), \u201cSince the enactment of its simple predecessor in 1969, as \u00a7 92A of former Article 66\u00a1\u00e9 of the Code, \u00a7 16-205.1 has undergone multiple revisions and has grown from three to twelve pages, bringing with it all the complexities that such a growth ordinarily entails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">TR \u00a7 16-205.1, titled \u201cSuspension or disqualification for refusal to submit to chemical tests for intoxication,\u201d states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">(b) <em>No compulsion to take chemical test; consequences of </em>refusal.\u2014(1) ... [A] person may not be compelled to take a test. However, the detaining officer shall advise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>person that, on receipt of a sworn statement from the officer that the person ... was tested and the result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the Administration shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">(i) In the case of a person licensed under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\"><em>2. </em>For a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">A. For a first offense, suspend the driver\u2019s license for 90 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(3) If the person refuses to take the test or takes a test which results in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing, the police officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">(i) Confiscate the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license issued by this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">(ii) Acting on behalf of the Administration, personally serve an order of suspension on the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">(iii) Issue a temporary license to drive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">(iv) Inform the person that the temporary license allows the person to continue driving for 45 days if the person is licensed under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">(v) Inform the person that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">1. The person has a right to request, at that time or within 10 days, a hearing to show cause why the driver\u2019s license should not be suspended concerning the refusal to take the test or for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing, and the hearing will be scheduled within 45 days; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-16\">2. If a hearing request is not made at that time or within 10 days, but within 30 days the person requests a hearing, a hearing to show cause why the driver\u2019s license should not be suspended concerning the refusal to take the test or for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the time of testing will be scheduled, but a request made after 10 days does not extend a temporary license issued by the police officer that allows the person to continue driving for 45 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">(vii) Inform the person that, if the person refuses a test or takes a test that indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing, the person may participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title instead of requesting a hearing under this paragraph, if the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">1. The person\u2019s driver\u2019s license is not currently suspended, revoked, canceled, or refused;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">2. The person was not charged with a moving violation arising out of the same circumstances as an administrative offense under this section that involved a death of, or serious physical injury to, another person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">3. Within the same time limits set forth in item (v) of this paragraph, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">A. Surrenders a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license or signs a statement certifying that the driver\u2019s license is no longer in the person\u2019s possession; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">B. Elects in writing to participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program for 1 year....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n) is relevant. It states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">(n) <em>Modification of </em>suspension.\u2014(1) The Administration may modify a suspension under this section or issue a restrictive license if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">(i) The licensee did not refuse to take a test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\">(ii) The licensee has not had a license suspended under this section during the past 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\">(iii) The licensee has not been convicted under \u00a7 21-902 of this article during the past 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\">(iv) The licensee has a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.15; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>(v) 1.

An individual is no longer eligible to participate in the Program under Transportation Article, \u00a7 16-205.1 (b)(3)(vii), Annotated Code of Maryland, if the Administration receives a request for an administrative hearing from the individual.... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">With the complex statutory scheme in mind, we turn to MVA\u2019s contentions. It asserts: \u201cBeyond the manifold procedural errors the circuit court committed, and even assuming the facts alleged in Baptist\u2019s injunctive action are true, the circuit court exceeded its limited judicial authority when it ordered the MVA to enroll Baptist in the ignition interlock program.\u201d According to appellant, the circuit court improperly \u201cintervene[d] in agency action, and failed to adhere to TR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u00a7 16-205.1,\u201d by ordering the MVA \u201cto stay Baptist\u2019s suspension and issue him a restricted license.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The Order of Suspension was issued on November 9, 2007. From that date, Baptist had thirty days to complete the requirements for participation in the Program. On November 26, 2007, appellee took his vehicle to an approved interlock provider and had the required device installed on his vehicle. But, by his own admission, appellee did not complete the election form, surrender his unrestricted driver\u2019s license, or obtain a restricted license within thirty days. Indeed, by his own account, Baptist did not go to the MVA until December 24, 2007, which was more than two weeks beyond the deadline. Even then, he left because the lines were too long; he did not return to the MVA until January 2, 2008, almost two months after the Order of Suspension had been issued. As the MVA points out, \u201cBaptist delayed completion of the election so long that his 45-day temporary license on the front of the Order of Suspension had already expired, and Baptist had been driving suspended for a week when he finally appeared at the MVA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">To be sure, Baptist claimed that he thought that the company that installed the interlock device would notify the MVA of Baptist\u2019s election, and that the MVA would then issue an ignition-interlock restricted license to him. But, Baptist was clearly advised that it was his responsibility to complete the requisite steps within the thirty-day period. Given that Baptist failed to adhere to the statutory requirements under TR \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(b)(B)(vii), we agree with the MVA that, pursuant to TR \u00a7 I6-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A) and (b)(3)(iv), it \u201cacted within the law when it commenced the 90-day suspension of Baptist\u2019s license\u201d on the 46th day after the Order of Suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Of import here, we also agree with the MVA that the court had no authority to excuse Baptist\u2019s noncompliance. Indeed, under the statute there are no exceptions to the prerequisites for participation in the program.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We are mindful of appellee\u2019s assertion that he needed to drive for his employment and for family reasons. But, as the MVA observes, \u201cvirtually all drinking-driving offenders facing the loss of their privileges have these same needs. If that fact alone were sufficient cause to waive the requirements and the deadlines for electing the program, no one would have to comply.\u201d Therefore, the court was not entitled to waive the statutory requirements because of hardship, or for an innocent mistake in failing to adhere to the deadlines. Its ruling contravened the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The \u201cparamount purpose\u201d of the Legislature was to \u201ccraft[ ] a regulatory scheme of expedient procedures that swiftly would impose penalties for drunk driving irrespective of any parallel potential criminal processes or penalties.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 59, 821 A.2d 62 (2003). By 1998 Md. Laws, Ch. 526, the Legislature expanded the Program to provide that, if the licensee participates in the Program, \u201cMVA may modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license whether the licensee refused the test or took it and showed a BAC of 0.10 or more.\u201d <em>Meanor, </em>364 Md. at 531, 774 A.2d 394. Among other things, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(2), \u201cwhich applies only if the licensee did not refuse to take the test, was amended to allow MVA to add as a condition to the restrictive license a restriction that prohibits the licensee from driving or attempting to drive unless the licensee is a participant in the Ignition Interlock Program.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>House Bill 525, 2006 Md. Laws Ch. 461, again amended TR \u00a7 16-205.1. In particular, the General Assembly increased sanctions for licensees who drive with an alcohol concentration of .15 or more.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notably, the statute does not confer any discretion on the MVA or the court to modify the high offender\u2019s sanction by reducing the period of suspension. As the MVA explains in its brief, \u201cThe only remaining possibility for modification of the high BAC offender\u2019s period of suspension is participation in the ignition interlock program for one year under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(3) and (4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The MVA elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">The amendment provided the option for those drinking drivers who refuse the test, or take the test with a test result of .15 or greater, to voluntarily elect one-year\u2019s participation in the interlock program instead of requesting a hearing or serving the enhanced period of suspension. The new option to elect participation in the program furthers the statute\u2019s primary purpose to <em>swiftly </em>protect the public by preventing a high BAC offender from starting a vehicle and driving on the roadways with alcohol in his or her system. The requirement to drive only with an ignition interlock equipped vehicle is not fully enforceable, however, until the motorist has turned in [his/her] regular license and obtained a restricted one. There are many ways to circumvent the device and the program, and the easiest of these is simply to drive another vehicle. <em>Once the ignition interlock restricted license is issued, however, if the offender is stopped for another violation ivhile driving a vehicle mth</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>out the interlock device, his driver\u2019s license and record ivill reveal the restriction and the violation. That is ivhy the legislature expressly provided that, as a condition of such election, the licensee must turn in any valid, non-rest\u00f1cted Maryland license no later than 30 days after the Order of Suspension. TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b) (3) (mi) (3) (A).[] </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On this basis, the MVA persuasively argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Given that HB 525\u2019s primary focus was to increase administrative penalties for high BAC offenders, the option to elect a year in the interlock program was clearly not intended to provide those same offenders greater leniency, or a way to delay protection of the public. Yet, the circuit court\u2019s order did just that. Currently, MVA personnel at branches throughout the State strictly apply the 30-day deadline and will not issue a restricted license if the high BAC offender shows up late with the ignition-interlock installation forms. If the courts reject that bright-line rule and excuse the requirements for full, enforceable enrollment in the interlock program within thirty days after the Order of Suspension, just because a motorist like Baptist neglects to read the instructions or waits until it is convenient to surrender his license and obtain a restricted one, the MVA\u2019s ability to uniformly administer the program in a manner consistent with the letter and purpose of the law will break down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The various provisions that we have cited aim to protect the public from those who choose to drive under the influence of alcohol; they are not meant to elevate the needs of the accused driver over the interests of the public. The court\u2019s decision to disregard the requirements outlined above was at odds with the legislative purpose of \u00a7 TR 16-205.1. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100 (2007) (\u201cThe purpose of [TR \u00a7 16-205.1 ] was to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the statute was not meant to protect drivers.\u201d); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 178, 844 A.2d 388 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(stating that \u201cthe Legislature intended \u2018to create procedures that would be an expedient and effective deterrent and sanction against drunk driving.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 373, 739 A.2d 58 (1999) (stating that the suspension of a license serves a remedial purpose, including protection of the public); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 475, 597 A.2d 939 (1991) (recognizing that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of TR \u00a7 16-205.1 is protection of the public). Therefore, we conclude that the court erred by directing the MVA to permit appellant to participate in the Program, and by barring the MVA from imposing the required 90-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Alternatively, appellant contends that the process employed below was so flawed as to require a reversal. Before addressing these contentions, we turn to review some of the rules of procedure on which appellant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Maryland Rule 15-501, pertaining to the issuance of injunctions, is relevant. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Rule 15-501. Injunctions-Definitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">The following definitions apply in the rules in this Chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">(a) Injunction. \u201cInjunction\u201d means an order mandating or prohibiting a specified act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">(b) Preliminary Injunction. \u201cPreliminary injunction\u201d means an injunction granted after opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance but before a final determination of the merits of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">(c) Temporary Restraining Order. \u201cTemporary restraining order\u201d means an injunction granted without opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">Rule 15-502 sets forth general provisions regarding injunctions.

The reasons for issuance or denial of an injunction shall be stated in writing or on the record. An order granting an injunction shall (1) be in writing (2) be specific in terms, and (3) describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act sought to be mandated or prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Rule 15-504 addresses temporary restraining orders. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Rule 15-504. Temporary restraining orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">(a) Standard for granting. A temporary restraining order may be granted only if it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or other statement under oath that immediate, substantial, and irreparable harm will result to the person seeking the order before a full adversary hearing can be held on the propriety of a preliminary or final injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(b) Without notice. A temporary restraining order may be granted without written or oral notice only if the applicant or the applicant\u2019s attorney certifies to the court in writing, and the court finds, that specified efforts commensurate with the circumstances have been made to give notice. Before ruling, the judge may communicate informally with other parties and any other person against whom the order is sought or their attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(c) Contents and duration. In addition to complying with Rule 15-502(e), the order shall (1) contain the date and hour of issuance; (2) define the harm that the court finds will result if the temporary restraining order does not issue; (3) state the basis for the court\u2019s finding that the harm will be irreparable; (4) state that a party or any person affected by the order may apply for a modification or dissolution of the order on two days\u2019 notice, or such shorter notice as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>court may prescribe, to the party who obtained the order; and (5) set forth an expiration date, which shall be not later than ten days after issuance for a resident and not later than 35 days after issuance for a nonresident.

The court shall proceed to hear and determine the application at the earliest possible time. The party who obtained the temporary restraining order has the burden of showing that it should be continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Rule 15-505, which governs preliminary injunctions, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASQ\">Rule 15-505.

A court may not issue a preliminary injunction without notice to all parties and an opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(b) Consolidation with a trial on merits. Before or after commencement of the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the court may order that a trial on the merits be advanced and consolidated with the preliminary injunction hearing, so long as any right to trial by jury is preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Appellant also cites portions of Rule 2-124:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">Rule 2-124.

It argues that \u201cft]he circuit court erred by entering a permanent injunction without a hearing or proper determination on the merits,\u201d and \u201cdisregarded the fundamental precepts respecting the issuance of injunctive relief....\u201d According to appellant, the court \u201cillegally and improperly adjudicated an entire lawsuit on the basis of a twenty-minute telephone call prior to notice or service of the lawsuit upon counsel for the Motor Vehicle Administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">In particular, appellant points to numerous violations of \u201cthe mandatory requirements of Maryland Rules 15-501 through 15-505.\u201d Tt contends that the MVA was \u201cdeprived ... of due process\u201d because MVA was not afforded \u201ca hearing on the merits as required by Maryland Rules 15-504 and 15-505.\u201d[<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] In addition, the MVA claims that the court \u201cnever addressed the reasons for issuance of the injunction in its written Order, in contravention of Rule 15-502(e).... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">If the Order is construed as a temporary restraining order, the MVA insists that appellee failed to show that substantial or irreparable harm would befall him prior to a hearing on the next business day, as required by Rule 15-504(a). Appellant also asserts that the Order \u201cfailed to include a statement of the harm warranting temporary restraint, failed to explain why the order was needed to avoid irreparable harm, failed to include notice to the affected parties of the right to seek its modification or dissolution upon certain terms and failed to set forth an expiration date not to exceed 10 days, as required by Rule 15-504(c) and (f).\u201d Appellant also complains that Baptist did not furnish a bond, as required by Rule 15-503 (stating that \u201ca court may not issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction unless a bond has been filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Further, appellant points out that appellee sent his pleadings to an MVA manager, rather than the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which constituted \u201cinappropriate notice\u201d under 15-504(b). Appellant also contends that, contrary to Rules 2-124(j) and 2-124(k), the MVA was \u201cdeprived of the basic legal safeguards for notice of a lawsuit.\u201d In this regard, it maintains that \u201cBaptist did not comply with the necessary conditions for obtaining jurisdiction and for maintaining his case when he failed to properly serve his complaint.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rules 2-124; 15-502(d). The MVA continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">Although a plaintiff may seek emergency relief pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-351, the rule requires that in all but the most special circumstances, a moving party must certify in \u201cwriting that all parties who will be affected have been given notice\u201d of the time and place of the court hearing. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>special circumstance includes one in which a party seeks protection from physical harm. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 1-203. There were no special circumstances that prevented Baptist from properly notifying the Attorney General\u2019s Office of any anticipated proceedings under Rule 1-351.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Even assuming that the MVA was served, appellant points out that it was entitled to thirty days under the rules to file a response, pursue affirmative defenses, or file appropriate preliminary motions. It cites, <em>inter alia, </em>Md. Rule 2-321 (pertaining to the time for filing an answer); Rule 2-322 (pertaining to preliminary motions); Md. Rule 2-323 (addressing contents of an answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In sum, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">[T]the circuit court made a rapid-fire and permanent determination after a twenty-minute telephonic hearing. That procedure contradicted longstanding and fundamental principles of fairness and due process, denying the MVA a proper opportunity to be served, to respond to the complaint, to file preliminary motions, to draft meaningful argument, to call witnesses or to produce any substantial evidence to the court in support of its opposition to the granting of this relief....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">While Baptist understandably desired immediate relief based on his perceived need to avoid irreparable harm of losing his driving privilege, the trial court inappropriately acquiesced in his attorney\u2019s tactic of bypassing the Maryland Rules and the law of injunction. The circuit court\u2019s premature adjudication, enjoining the MVA to grant the relief Baptist sought, was produced as a result of the procedural shortcomings of Baptist\u2019s lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">We need not resolve all of the claims lodged by MVA to reach the conclusion that the proceedings below were patently flawed. Among other things, the court issued a permanent injunction after an unrecorded, twenty-minute telephonic hearing, without affording the MVA the opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>a trial on the merits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See NCAA v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>301 Md. 574, 483 A.2d 1272 (1984) (recognizing the importance of a determination on the merits with respect to the issuance of a permanent injunction). In addition, we have no idea as to the basis for the court\u2019s ruling, in contravention of Rule 15-502(e), which states: \u201cThe reasons for issuance or denial of an injunction shall be stated in writing or on the record.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the court erred by entering a final injunction.

The <em>Meanor </em>Court also explained, 364 Md. at 531, 774 A.2d 394, that by a 1998 amendment to TR \u00a7 16-205. l(n)(3) and the addition of subsection (n)(4), the MVA was allowed, \"for the first time,\u201d to \"modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license to a person who <em>refused </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>take the test if the person participates in the Program.\u201d In this case, appellee did not refuse to take an alcohol test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">. Prior to the amendment, the consequences of an alcohol concentration of .08 or more did not vary depending on the extent to which the driver exceeded that limit. But, House Bill 525 imposed enhanced penalties for a high alcohol concentration offender. Under TR \u00a7 16-205.1 (b)(l)(i), the license of a driver who takes an alcohol test with a result of .08 to .14 shall be suspended for 45 days for a first offense, or 90 days for a second or subsequent offense. And, if the driver\u2019s alcohol concentration is. 15 or greater, the license shall be suspended for 90 or 180 days, respectively, for a first or subsequent violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">. We pause to observe that the State is not a person for purposes of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>South Carolina v. Katzenbach, </em>383 U.S. 301, 323, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966) (\"The word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to encompass the States of the Union.... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\">. Even if the court below merely granted a preliminary injunction, the process violated Rule 15-501(b), which provides that a court may grant a preliminary injunction \"after opportunity for a full adversaiy hearing on the propriety of its issuance but before a final determination of the merits of the action.\u201d What transpired below was hardly a \"full adversary hearing.\" If the Order of January 8, 2008, constituted a temporary restraining order, Rule 15-504(c) required the court to define the harm that \"will result if the temporary restraining order does not issue,\u201d and to state the basis for its finding that the harm will be \"irreparable.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
