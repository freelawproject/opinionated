After the County moved for summary judgment asserting that Halloran had not complied with the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Circuit Court for Montgomery County entered judgment in favor of the County. Before trial, all of the other defendants, except for the State, were dismissed from the case. At the conclusion of the trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">On appeal, Halloran presents four issues for our review, which we have consolidated into three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">1. Did the circuit court err in concluding that Halloran had not substantially complied with the notice provision of the LGTCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">2. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in concluding that Halloran failed to demonstrate good cause to waive the notice provision of the LGTCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>3. Did the trial court commit reversible error in admitting testimony regarding repairs to the road condition that caused her injuries?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">On October 18, 2004, Halloran fell and was seriously injured when she tripped on irregular pavement in a crosswalk at Old Georgetown Road and Edgemoor Lane in Montgomery County. In a letter dated October 22, 2004, Halloran informed the Montgomery County Department of Public Works and Transportation (\u201cDPWT\u201d) of the accident. She wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">I am writing to inform you of a serious hazard located in the crosswalk intersection of Old Georgetown Road and Edgemoor Road in Bethesda, Maryland. There is a severe depression in the asphalt; which could result in personal injury to the numerous pedestrians who cross this road daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">I personally was hurt at this location on Monday, October 18, 2004 at approximately 12:30 pm. I was walking westbound from the 7500 block to the Chipotles Restaurant at the corner of the 7600 block of Old Georgetown Road during my lunch hour. I fell in the crosswalk due to the irregular pavement. The road appeared to have been dug up previously and was quickly \u201crepaired\u201d without bringing the area flush with the rest of the roadway. I now have a sprained left foot big toe and a broken ankle on my right foot. I have missed 2.5 days of work because of this incident and have suffered pain from the injuries. I have attached pictures of my injury and the unsafe paving of the location mentioned above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Please have this pavement repaired immediately to make the concave area flush -with the rest of the roadway. I do not want anyone else to have to suffer the injuries I\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>sustained or worse. Thank you for you immediate attention to this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">DPWT responded to Halloran, thanking her for \u201cletting [them] know about the condition\u201d and conveying that they \u201cregret [the] injury.\u201d The letter explained that Halloran\u2019s \u201cletter was faxed to the Maryland State Highway Administration\u2019s (MSHA) district maintenance office, because the crosswalk is within the State\u2019s right-of-way.\u201d Nonetheless, DPWT \u201cagree[d] that this [was] a dangerous situation, [and, as a result] a Highway Maintenance crew ... repaired the deteriorated area to ensure pedestrian safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On October 25, 2004, Halloran filed a \u201cNotice of Claim Form\u201d against the State. In the form, Halloran recited the time, place, and nature of her fall, and noted that she was \u201cseeking [her] medical bills to be paid in full. Other damages to be determined.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a letter dated October 28, 2004, the State acknowledged receipt of Halloran\u2019s claim, and advised Halloran that it would \u201cbe investigating [her] claim.\u201d On November 22, 2004, the State responded to Halloran with the results of its investigation. According to the letter, the \u201cclaim was carefully investigated,\u201d but that investigation determined \u201cthat the State was not at fault in the incident.\u201d Although the letter did not elaborate on this determination, it \u201csuggested] [Halloran] refer [her] claim to: Washington Gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In a letter dated January 11, 2005, Halloran\u2019s counsel informed Washington Gas that Halloran \u201cbelieve[d] that Washington Gas may be responsible for the condition of [the] roadway\u201d that caused Halloran to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In a letter dated July 7, 2005, Halloran\u2019s counsel informed the Montgomery County Executive of his representation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Halloran and recited the basic facts of Halloran\u2019s injury. The letter inquired as to \u201cwhether or not [the] location [where the fall occurred] [was] actually County responsibility.\u201d The letter was mailed certified mail, return receipt requested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The Office of the County Attorney for Montgomery County responded by letter dated July 28, 2005. The County Attorney noted that it had \u201creceived the notice of claim\u201d and would be \u201creferring this matter to Schaffer Companies,\u201d the County\u2019s claims adjuster. Additionally, the County Attorney stated that \u201ca review of [Halloran\u2019s] letter indicates that [Halloran\u2019s] notice of claim may be untimely under State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Schaffer Companies denied Halloran\u2019s claim against the County in a letter dated April 20, 2006. According to The Schaffer Companies, \u201c[i]t appeared] that [Halloran] fell at a depression that was either caused by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or Washington Gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">On October 25, 2006, Halloran filed suit against the County, Washington Gas, and WSSC. The County and WSSC moved to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment on the grounds that Halloran had failed to comply with the LGTCA. After a hearing on March 26, 2007, the circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The circuit court declined to rule on WSSC\u2019s motion, pending discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">On April 2, 2007 Halloran filed a separate complaint against the State based on the same injuries and circumstances. On April 27, 2007, Halloran voluntarily dismissed WSSC from the original suit, and the two complaints were consolidated. On December 20, 2007, Halloran voluntarily dismissed Washington Gas from the suit, leaving only the State as a defendant. The case was tried before a jury on March 10 and 11, 2008, at the conclusion of which the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the State. A final judgment was entered on March 13, 2008. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Did the circuit court err in concluding that Halloran had not substantially complied with the notice provision of the LGTCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Halloran argues that her claim against the County should have been allowed to proceed because she substantially complied with the LGTCA. According to Halloran, because she provided DPWT with the information required by the notice provision of the LGTCA, and DPWT was able to conduct an investigation of the roadway, the purpose of the LGTCA\u2019s notice provision was fulfilled. Halloran additionally argues that the County waived any argument that Halloran failed to provide notice under the LGTCA, because the County did not allege that its investigation was impeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The County responds that the circuit court correctly found that Halloran had failed to satisfy the notice requirement. Specifically, the County argues that Halloran failed to demonstrate either substantial compliance with the notice provision or good cause for not serving timely notice pursuant to the LGTCA. According to the County, Halloran\u2019s October 22, 2004 letter was not substantially compliant because it did not state a tort claim and was not directed to an entity responsible for investigating tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u201cWhen reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment we must determine whether a material factual issue exists, and all inferences are resolved against the moving party.\u201d <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 66, 899 A.2d 819 (2006). We must \u201cexamine[ ] the same information from the record and determine[ ] the same issues of law as the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 899 A.2d 819. Where \u201cthe facts surrounding the notice issue are essentially undisputed,\u201d this Court \u201creview[s] the circuit court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>to determine if it was legally correct.\u201d <em>Wilbon v. Hunsicker, </em>172 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Md.App. 181, 198, 913 A.2d 678 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 Md. 316, 920 A.2d. 1060 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The LGTCA</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The LGTCA provides that \u201can action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government or its employees unless the notice of the claim ... is given within 180 days after the injury.\u201d \u00a7 5-304(b). \u201cThe notice shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.\u201d \u00a7 5-304(c)(3). In Montgomery County, the notice must be provided in person, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to \u201cthe county commissioner, county council, or corporate authorities ... or ... the County Executive.\u201d \u00a7 5-304(c)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice requirement is \u201ca condition precedent to maintaining an action against a local government or its employees.\u201d <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 127, 872 A.2d 1 (2005). \u201c[T]he notice requirement operates inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>pendent of the limitations period that applies generally to the filing of suit.\u201d <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>157 Md.App. 462, 480, 852 A.2d 1005 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>386 Md. 104, 872 A.2d 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Court of Appeals has stated that the purpose of the notice requirement is \u201cto have the claimant furnish the municipal body with sufficient information to permit it to make an investigation in due time, sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>233 Md. 164, 167, 195 A.2d 693 (1963). The notice requirement is intended \u201cto protect the municipalities and counties of the State from meretricious claimants and exaggerated claims.\u201d <em>Bartens v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>293 Md. 620, 626, 446 A.2d 1136 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Substantial Compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Strict compliance with the notice requirement is not necessary; substantial compliance is sufficient. <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 144-45, 877 A.2d 1129, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 401, 885 A.2d 825 (2005). \u201c[A] litigant is excused from strict compliance with the notice obligation, <em>so long as the purpose of the notice statute ivas fulfilled </em>by substantial compliance with the statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 877 A.2d 1129 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). \u201cSubstantial compliance requires some effort to provide the requisite notice and, in fact, it must be provided, albeit not in strict compliance with the statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 877 A.2d 1129 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cHowever, when the notice does not apprise the <em>proper officials </em>that the [pjlaintiff is pursuing a claim, there is not substantial compliance.\u201d <em>Bibum v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>85 F.Supp.2d 557, 564 (D.Md.2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\"><em>Jackson </em>was the first Maryland case to articulate the doctrine of substantial compliance with the notice requirement of the LGTCA. In <em>Jackson, </em>the claimant sought to recover damages sustained in a collision with a county dump truck. 233 Md. at 166, 195 A.2d 693. The claimant first provided oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>notice to an assistant county attorney and then sent written notice by ordinary mail to the county commissioners. <em>Id. </em>The county argued that \u201cthere was noncompliance with two essential requirements\u2014there was no notice given of [the claimant\u2019s] claim, only of a claim for property damage and, ... the notice was not delivered either in person or by registered mail\u201d as required by statute. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 195 A.2d 693. The claimant\u2019s written notice read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">We represent Phyllis and William A. Jackson, Jr., and their collision insurance carrier, Interstate Insurance Company, in a claim for damages against Anne Arundel County Public Works arising out of a collision occurring on January 18,1962, at Solley Road and Powhatan Beach Road with a County Roads truck operated by Joseph Frank Havranek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0u\"><em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 195 A.2d 693 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals found \u201csubstantial gratification of the purpose of the statute\u201d in regard to both the content of the notice and its delivery. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 195 A.2d 693. The Court reasoned that the letter, <em>\u201cwhich ... said there ivas a claim for damages against the County,\" </em>and advised of the \u201c\u2018time, place and cause\u2019 \u201d of the injury, \u201cwould seem to be literal compliance\u201d or, at a minimum, substantial compliance. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In <em>White, </em>the claimant alleged police brutality in the course of his arrest for burglary. 163 Md.App. at 132, 877 A.2d 1129. When the claimant filed suit against Prince George\u2019s County and four of its police officers almost three years after the arrest, the circuit court dismissed the case for failure to comply with the notice provision of the LGTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 877 A.2d 1129. The claimant conceded that he did not provide notice within the 180 day period, but contended that he had substantially complied with the notice requirement when, within the 180 day period, he sent a letter to the police department complaining of the alleged brutality, which prompted an internal investigation of the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 877 A.2d 1129. This Court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">[The claimant] did not provide notice to an entity with responsibility for investigating tort claims lodged against the County. Instead, appellant sent notice to the Depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>merit\u2019s Internal Affairs Division [(I.A.D.)]. The content of that complaint pertained to [the claimant\u2019s] allegation of police brutality, not to tort claims arising from such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">Moreover, the investigation that ensued was conducted by and for I.A.D., under a wholly separate procedure.... Notice to I.A.D. simply was not notice to the County Attorney or County Solicitor, as required by C.J. \u00a7 5-304(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 147, 877 A.2d 1129 (footnote omitted). We therefore concluded that the claimant \u201cdid not substantially comply with the statutory notice requirement by filing a complaint with I.A.D. about police brutality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 877 A.2d 1129. Because the claimant had also failed to establish good cause, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>Wilbon, </em>the estate of Joseph Wilbon, as claimant, sought damages on behalf of Wilbon, who died while in police custody. 172 Md.App. at 185-86, 913 A.2d 678. Four days after Wilbon\u2019s death, his mother submitted a \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d to the Civilian Review Board, which was \u201can independent agency tasked with investigating complaints from the public regarding police misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191\u201492, 194, 913 A.2d 678. The statement provided the basic facts of Wilbon\u2019s death, including the date and place of the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 913 A.2d 678. Later, more than 180 days after Wilbon\u2019s death, Wilbon\u2019s mother \u201cmailed, by certified mail, a \u2018Notice of Intent to File Suit\u2019 to the Maryland State Treasurer, the Comptroller of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of the\u201d Baltimore City Police Department (BCPD). <em>Id. </em>Then, \u201cone year after Wilbon\u2019s death, the attorney for Wilbon\u2019s estate mailed, by certified mail, and hand-delivered a \u2018Notice of Claim Form\u2019 to the City Solicitor for Baltimore City[,]\u201d which \u201cpurported to give notice of a claim pursuant to section 5-304.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 913 A.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We first considered the matter of whether the claimant strictly complied with the notice requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 913 A.2d 678. We noted that the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ted to the Civilian Review Board (CRB) \u201cwas <em>not a claim for damages or a notice of intent to file suit. </em>It only stated a complaint of police misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 913 A.2d 678 (emphasis added). Because the letter \u201cwas a notice of an occurrence involving alleged police brutality, not notice of tort claims arising out of that occurrence\u201d and was \u201cnot submitted] .\u2022.. to the City Solicitor, as required,\u201d the claimant had \u201cnot strictly complied] with the notice requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 913 A.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We then considered whether either the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d or the \u201cNotice of Intent to File Suit\u201d \u201cconstituted substantial compliance with the notice requirement under the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200-01, 913 A.2d 678. We noted two problems with the \u201cNotice of Intent to File Suit:\u201d it was sent \u201cto the Commissioner of the BCPD, not to the City Solicitor,\u201d and \u201c[m]ore problematic for [the claimant] ... this letter [was sent] between a month and six weeks beyond the 180-day statutory period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 913 A.2d 678. We concluded that this notice was not substantially compliant because \u201cthe courts have not held that a claimant may submit the notice beyond the time for giving such notice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We also rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d submitted to the CRB just days after Wilbon\u2019s death constituted substantial compliance, because the CRB was \u201cnot an agency of the City of Baltimore or the BCPD.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 913 A.2d 678. More importantly, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\">[the] complaint prompted an investigation that was vastly different from an investigation of a tort claim for damages. The BCPD conducted a dual-natured investigation, involving both the Homicide Unit and the [Internal Investigations Division]. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a crime had been committed and whether the officers had violated departmental rules and standards of behavior. By contrast, an investigation into a tort claim for damages involves different issues, including, among other things, legal defenses, the nature and extent of the actual injuries sustained, the causal relationship of the injuries to the alleged misconduct, the likelihood of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>award of compensatory and/or punitive damages, the necessity and cost of expert testimony, and litigation strategy. Therefore, ... just as the investigation in <em>White </em>did not suffice as a claim investigation, the investigation in the present case did not fulfill all of the purposes of the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (quotation and alteration removed). We added that, although \u201cthe Commissioner of the BCPD indicated that he was familiar with the case and recognized that it might lead to a lawsuit[,]\u201d \u201c[n]ot every excessive force complaint develops into a civil action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Halloran concedes that she did not strictly comply with the notice provision of the LGTCA, and we agree. We disagree, however, with Halloran\u2019s assertion that she substantially complied with the notice provision. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The purpose of Halloran\u2019s October 22, 2004 letter to DPWT was to inform DPWT of \u201ca serious hazard\u201d and to request that the road be \u201crepaired immediately\u201d to protect others from injury. Nowhere in the letter did Halloran state that she had a \u201cclaim\u201d against the County. Although she noted her injuries, she made no allegation that the County was responsible for damages resulting from those injuries. In short, Halloran requested no relief other than that the condition of the road be repaired. Furthermore, the letter was not directed to the proper party under the LGTCA, namely the County Executive. Instead, the letter was addressed to the \u201cHighway Maintenance\u201d division of DPWT. No other entity, particularly the county council, county law office, or \u201ccorporate authority,\u201d was copied on the letter. In handling the letter, DPWT did not forward Halloran\u2019s letter to any of these entities or copy them on DPWT\u2019s response. Consequently, the letter failed to inform \u201cthe <em>proper officials </em>that [Halloran] [was] pursuing a claim.\u201d <em>Bibum, </em>85 F.Supp.2d at 564 (emphasis added). Therefore, based on this letter, the County had no reason to, and did not in fact, start \u201can investigation into a tort claim for damages involving] ... legal defenses, the nature and extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of the actual injuries sustained, the causal relationship of the injuries to the alleged misconduct, the likelihood of an award of compensatory and/or punitive damages, the necessity and cost of expert testimony, and litigation strategy.\u201d <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. at 204, 913 A.2d 678. Accordingly, Halloran\u2019s October 22, 2004 letter to DPWT did not \u201capprise [the County] of its possible liability at a time when it could conduct its own investigation,\u201d <em>Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 298, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002) (internal quotations omitted), and thus did not substantially comply with the notice provision of the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Halloran\u2019s July 7, 2005 letter also failed to rise to the level of substantial compliance. The letter was mailed 262 days after the incident, or almost three months after the expiration of the 180 day notice period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-304(b). As a result, the notice did not fulfill the purpose of the notice requirement by permitting a <em>timely </em>investigation. If the letter in <em>Wilbon, </em>being submitted 30 to 45 days after the 180 day period expired, did not substantially comply with the LGTCA, neither can Halloran\u2019s letter of July 7, which was 82 days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Halloran also argues that \u201cMontgomery County has waived its argument that the LGTCA has not been satisfied by its ability to thoroughly investigate the claim, and it should be estopped from arguing that [Halloran] did not comply with the LGTCA.\u201d In support of this argument Halloran relies on the following comment by the Court of Appeals in <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 180, 807 A.2d 632 (2002): \u201cThe same acts and conduct that establish[ ] that the purpose of the statute has been satisfied may also constitute a waiver of notice or create an estoppel.\u201d Halloran\u2019s argument, however, misconstrues the statute and <em>Moore. </em>In essence, Halloran is arguing that, because the County was able to conduct a thorough investigation and thus was not prejudiced by the late notice, Halloran\u2019s failure to comply with the notice provision of the LGTCA should be excused. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">That evidence may still be available, and an investigation still possible, after the expiration of the 180 day period does not eliminate the notice provision as a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>a claim under the LGTCA. Waiver, under the theory in <em>Moore, </em>may occur only where an imperfect notice is given within the 180 day period that prompts a timely and full investigation of the tort claim. Waiver does not occur whenever a successful investigation occurs regardless of when notice was provided. Such a reading of the LGTCA would render the notice provision superfluous. <em>See Comptroller of the Treasury v. Sci. Applications Int\u2019l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 198, 950 A.2d 766 (2008) (\u201c[A] statute must be read so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d). Therefore, it was <em>not </em>the County\u2019s burden to claim \u201cthat any alleged deficiency in notice had [an] impact ... on [the County\u2019s] ability to conduct a thorough investigation.\u201d Such inquiry only arises, as discussed <em>infra, </em>when a claimant has shown good cause to waive the notice provision, and the burden, by statute, shifts to the local government to show that its defense has been prejudiced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-304(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in concluding that Halloran failed to demonstrate good cause to waive the notice provision of the LGTCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Having determined that Halloran neither strictly nor substantially complied with the notice provision of the LGTCA, we must next consider whether, pursuant to Section 5-304(d), the circuit court abused its discretion in concluding that Halloran did not have good cause to waive the notice requirement. <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. at 205, 913 A.2d 678. Halloran argues that she had \u201cgood cause\u201d for failing to provide proper notice under the LGTCA because she prosecuted her claim with sufficient diligence. Consequently, Halloran claims, the burden was on the County to affirmatively show that it had been prejudiced by the deficient notice, which it tailed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The County asserts that Halloran did not demonstrate good cause sufficient to waive the notice requirement, because, within 180 days of the incident, Halloran was aware of the County as a potential defendant and she had engaged an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>attorney, but failed to supply the requisite notice. The County also contends that prejudice to its defense is inconsequential, because Halloran did not show good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cThe discretion with which all courts determine whether good cause has or has not been shown is broad.

We noted in <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129, that courts have considered the following factors that generally have been found to constitute good cause: \u201c \u2018[1] excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard), [2] serious physical or mental injury and/or location out-of-state, [3] the inability to retain counsel in cases involving complex litigation, ...

We began with a thorough review of the record and found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">[t]here [was] no evidence in the record (1) that [the claimant] suffered from a physical or mental condition that impaired her ability to give timely notice of the claim, (2) that [the claimant] did not know about the statutory notice requirement, or (3) that misleading representations were made by a representative of Baltimore City. In addition, the record show[ed] that [the claimant] consulted with an attorney less than a month after Wilbon\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 913 A.2d 678. With no evidence of these factors, we concluded that \u201cthe only recognized factor remaining to support the trial court\u2019s finding of good cause [was] \u2018excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 913 A.2d 678 (quoting White, 163 Md.App. at 152, 877 A.2d 1129).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We summed up the pertinent facts on the remaining factor this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">The bottom line in the case <em>sub judice </em>is that, within four days after Wilbon\u2019s death, [the claimant] filed a complaint of alleged police misconduct with the CRB and, within a month after his death, [the claimant] sought the advice of a local attorney. No other action was taken by [the claimant], or anyone else on behalf of Wilbon\u2019s survivors or estate, until four to six weeks after the expiration of the 180 day statutory period, when [the claimant] submitted written notice of a tort claim to the police commissioner (instead of to the City Solicitor, as required by Section 5\u2014304(c)(1)(i)). In other words, nothing was done to advance any tort claim arising out of Wilbon\u2019s death for over six months after [the claimant] consulted with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 877 A.2d 1129 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The only excuse put forward by the claimant was the \u201cpresence of an ongoing police investigation into [the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ant\u2019s] complaint of police wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 877 A.2d 1129. We held that such excuse could not constitute \u201c \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 for failing to comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor could tardy notice provide grounds, in and of itself, for good cause. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">[The claimant] has not cited to any cases in support of the proposition that notice of a tort claim sent shortly after the expiration of the 180 day period constitutes good cause to justify a waiver of the notice requirement. Indeed, the concept of diligence of an ordinarily prudent person must relate to actions taken during the 180-day period, not afterwards. Notice of a tort claim sent shortly after the expiration of the 180-day period, without sufficient explanation as to why such notice could not have been given within 180 days, cannot support a finding of the requisite diligence of an ordinarily prudent person. Here, no explanation, much less a sufficient explanation, was given as to why [the claimant\u2019s] January 1, 2001 notice of claim could not have been given on or before December 2, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 877 A.2d 1129 (emphasis added). Thus, while giving due regard to the trial court\u2019s broad discretion, \u201cwe conclude[d] that ... the trial court abused its discretion in finding good cause to waive the notice requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In rendering its decision in favor of the County, the circuit court in the case <em>sub judice </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">So, the fallback position is the determination, if it can be made, of a waiver of the notice requirement. Notwithstanding the other provisions, of this section under 5-304(d), unless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by a lack of required notice upon motion, and for good cause shown, the [c]ourt may entertain the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">The County raises the issue with a good argument that, you know, \u201cThere could have been a bagel shop on the corner, and maybe there are witnesses to this, but so much time has passed that we don\u2019t know. And Judge, there\u2019s no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>good cause anyhow.\u201d Well, without blessing or not blessing the County\u2019s lack of, the County\u2019s argument that they have been prejudiced, and really without making a decision on that, I\u2019m satisfied that there is not good cause under the definition of <em>Wilbon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">The things that have been found to constitute good cause are excusable neglect or mistake. I don\u2019t think we have that here. This was a citizen, obviously, who was upset by this, and obviously so injured that she jumped on it right away. I mean, frankly, I wouldn\u2019t even known who to sit down and get ahold of, but she did, somehow, determine it was the Highway Department and the Department of Public Works. I guess she called up and said, \u201cWho is responsible for the highways?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Serious physical or mental injury; she didn\u2019t have that. Inability to retain counsel; there is no evidence of that. Ignorance of the statutory notice requirement. I\u2019m sure that was that she did have that, but [Judge] Woodward pointed out, the Court of Appeals has not yet chimed in on that, but in <em>Williams v. Montgomery County, </em>the Court of Special Appeals rejected ignorance of the statutory notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">And finally, misleading representations made by representatives of the local government. I don\u2019t find, when I really think about it, that there was anything misleading made by the representation of the response by the Department of Public Works to Mrs. Halloran.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In her appeal, Halloran does not address any of the factors relied on by the circuit court. Instead, Halloran argues that she demonstrated good cause because she \u201cprosecuted her claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d This is so, contends Halloran, because she sent her October 22, 2004 letter \u201cto the entity she believed was responsible both for her injury and for repairing the condition that caused her injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>We construe this argument to be that Halloran demonstrated good cause based on the factor of \u201cexcusable neglect or mistake\u201d under <em>Wilbon. </em>We see no merit in this argument. Within a few days of her injury Halloran identified the County agency responsible for roadway repairs (DPWT) and wrote to that entity demanding that they repair the roadway. Halloran made no tort claim in her October 22 letter to DPWT. When DPWT responded that it had repaired the roadway, and made no mention of a potential claim, Halloran made no further efforts to indicate that she had a claim against the County. Instead, Halloran sent notice of her tort claim to the State and had her counsel send a similar notice to Washington Gas, both within the 180 day notice period. A similar notice, however, was not sent to the County until almost three months after the expiration of the notice period. Halloran failed to articulate before the circuit court or this Court any basis for failing to send proper notice to the County within the requisite time period. The circuit court clearly demonstrated that it understood the law and properly applied the law to the facts of this case. Therefore, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Did the trial court commit reversible error in admitting testimony regarding repairs to the road condition that caused her injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Halloran contends that the trial court erred in admitting her testimony, which was elicited on cross-examination, about the repairs made by the County to the road as articulated in DPWT\u2019s November 10, 2004 letter. Specifically, Halloran contends that her testimony violated Maryland Rule 5-407(a), because the State used the testimony to demonstrate the County\u2019s culpability. Halloran also argues that her testimony about the contents of the November 10 letter should not have been permitted because Halloran lacked first-hand knowledge of the County\u2019s repairs and thus her testimony was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The State argues that the circuit court did not commit reversible error in allowing Halloran to testify regarding the November 10, 2004 letter. Specifically, the State maintains that Halloran waived her objection to testifying about the letter by subsequently entering the letter into evidence. The State contends that, if the issue was not waived, the circuit court properly allowed the testimony, under Maryland Rule 5-407(b)(2), for the purpose of establishing that \u201csomeone <em>other than the State </em>owned and/or controlled the crosswalk.\u201d Finally, the State argues that, even if the circuit court erred in allowing the testimony, Halloran has failed to carry her burden of demonstrating that the error was \u201csubstantially injurious\u201d to merit reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Our review of the evidentiary allegations of error is guided generally by three principles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">First, Maryland Rule 5-103(a) provides that \u201cerror may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling.\u201d Second, \u201c \u2018The admission or exclusion of evidence is a function of the trial court which, on appeal, is traditionally viewed with great latitude/ \u201d <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md.App. 605, 641, 698 A.2d 1167 (1997) (quoting <em>Swann v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>95 Md.App. 365, 374, 620 A.2d 989 (1993)). And third, \u201c \u2018An appellate court will only reverse upon finding that the trial judge\u2019s determination was both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Swann, </em>95 Md.App. at 375, 620 A.2d 989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\"><em>Angelakis v.

Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility.

Halloran\u2019s attorney, however, then offered the November 10 letter into evidence, and it was admitted over the State\u2019s objection. Consequently, Halloran\u2019s attorney did not merely question Halloran about the County\u2019s repairs, as the State had done on cross-examination. Halloran\u2019s attorney affirmatively offered evidence on the same matter. Therefore, we conclude that Halloran waived any objection to her testimony concerning the repairs made by the County to the road condition that precipitated her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Even if we were to determine that the objection had not been waived, we would hold that the question, \u201cit\u2019s your understanding that the County ... made the repairs to this area ... correct?\u201d was permitted under Maryland Rule 5-407(b). '</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">When an objection is made that [a party] is attempting to introduce evidence of a \u201cremedial measure\u201d that should be excluded under Rule 5-407(a), the trial judge must make a factual determination as to whether the testimony sought to be elicited would be about a subsequent remedial measure within Rule 5-407(a) and, if so, whether it would be admissible under Rule 5-407(b). Such factual findings by the trial judge are entitled to great deference and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous, <em>i.e., </em>unsupported by any substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\"><em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Flippo, </em>112 Md.App. 75, 102, 684 A.2d 456 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>348 Md. 680, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Implicit in the circuit court\u2019s decision to overrule Halloran\u2019s objection was a factual determination that the testimony was offered for the purpose of showing the State\u2019s lack of control over the accident site, and this was permitted under Rule 5-407(b). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there was evidence that the State\u2019s defense was premised on demonstrating that it did not have control over the site of the accident and that the objected to question went to that issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The circuit court thus did not err in determining that the testimony was admissible under Rule 5-407(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Halloran contends that the testimony the State elicited from her regarding the contents of the November 10 letter from the DPWT was hearsay. We do not reach the merits of this contention, because it has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(a) provides that \u201c[ojrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d The purpose of the Rule \u201cis to allow the court to correct trial errors, obviating the necessity to retry cases had a potential error been brought to the attention of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Sydnor v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 173, 183, 754 A.2d 1064 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>365 Md. 205, 776 A.2d 669 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1090, 122 S.Ct. 834, 151 L.Ed.2d 714 (2002). The rule arises from the principle that \u201c[w]hen a party has the option either to object or not to object, his failure to exercise the option while it is still within the power of the trial court to correct the error is regarded as a waiver of it estopping him from obtaining a review of the point or question on appeal.\u201d <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 650, 119 A.2d 917 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In accordance with these principles, Maryland Rule 2-517 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">(a) Objections to evidence. An objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">(b) Continuing objections to evidence. At the request of a party or on its own initiative, the court may grant a continuing objection to a line of questions by an opposing party. For purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal, the continuing objection is effective only as to questions clearly within its scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In other words, \u201cunless a [party] makes timely objections in the lower court or makes his feelings known to that court, he will be considered to have waived them and he can not now raise such objections on appeal.\u201d <em>Caviness v. State, </em>244 Md. 575, 578, 224 A.2d 417 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">. Although Halloran, in both her brief and reply brief, directs our attention to all of the testimony recounted above, the objection made by Halloran\u2019s counsel was to only one of the State\u2019s questions: \u201cAnd it\u2019s your understanding that the County correct, the County ... made the repairs to this area ... correct?\u201d No objection was made to any subsequent questions posed by the State, nor did Halloran\u2019s counsel request a continuing objection. The question objected to did not call upon Halloran to testify as to the contents of the November 10, 2004 letter, particularly when just such a question was asked moments later without any objection. Indeed, Halloran\u2019s counsel never objected to any of the State\u2019s questions regarding the contents of the November 10 letter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, we do not reach Halloran\u2019s assertion that her \u201ctestimony about the letter is hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Accordingly, the trial court did not commit reversible error in overruling Halloran\u2019s objection and in allowing Halloran to testify as to the repairs to the site of the accident and the contents of DPWT\u2019s letter regarding those repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">.
