The Circuit Court for Baltimore City rejected appellant John Doe\u2019s contention that forcing him to register with local law enforcement every six months for the remainder of his life, without a showing of present or future dangerousness, violated his procedural due process, equal protection, and privacy rights under both the United States and the Maryland Constitutions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">On February 8, 1977, John Doe was convicted of rape in Baltimore County Circuit Court and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. He was paroled on September 21, 1995, but violated his parole<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was returned to prison before being released on mandatory supervision on September 21, 1998. The period of mandatory supervision expired on April 9, 2007. Because he was under supervision on October 1, 2001, Doe was required to register as a sex offender, and had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">John Doe objects to the registration requirement contending that, at age 57, he poses no danger to the community. He cites the following facts to show that he has integrated into society: he has been married for ten years, has two children, owns a home, is employed, and attends community college. Doe filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 16, 2007, seeking a declaration that it is unconstitutional to require him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. He argues that, because the law does not require a showing that the registrant poses a risk of recidivism, it violates his procedural due process, equal protection, and privacy rights under both the United States and Maryland constitutions. Appellee, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, filed a motion for summary judgment noting that there are no factual issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>dispute in this case. The circuit court granted the motion after a hearing. Doe timely appealed to this Court on March 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Every state in the United States has some type of sex offender registration law. <em>See Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 90, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003) (\u201cBy 1996, every State, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government had enacted some [type] of [sex offender registration law].\u201d). This development was encouraged by the federal government, which conditioned a state\u2019s continued receipt of some federal crime-fighting funds on the passage of such a law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071 (originally passed as the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Title 17, 108 Stat.2038). Maryland\u2019s law requires a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d to register in person with local law enforcement every six months for the remainder of his life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Md.Code (2001, 2008 ReplVol.), Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), \u00a7 ll-707(a)(2)(i). A \u201csexually violent offender\u201d is defined to include anyone convicted of a \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d or an attempt to commit such an offense. CP \u00a7 11-701(j). The term \u201csexually violent offense\u201d includes a violation of Md.Code (2002), Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), \u00a7 3-303(a), which forbids \u201cengagfing] in vaginal intercourse with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other.\u201d <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 ll-701(k). In other words, anyone convicted of rape falls within the category of a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d for the remainder of his life. Although John Doe was convicted in 1977 and the statute was not enacted until 2001, it is to \u201cbe applied retroactively to include a registrant convicted of an offense committed before July 1, 1997, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>who is under the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2001.\u201d CP \u00a7 ll-702.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">I. Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Doe cites a footnote in <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), in which the Court of Appeals, in dicta, noted that the sex offender registration law might violate procedural due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">[T]he petition for certiorari in the case sub judice raised only the issue of whether the registration statute was a punitive one, triggering the criminal due process protections of <em>Apprendi, </em>and not the issue of whether registration and notification under the statute meet the requirements of civil due process pursuant to the balancing test enunciated in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), and its progeny. We do not, therefore, address the issue of whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a particularized risk assessment of each registrant, pursuant to specific procedures, to determine which statutorily eligible offenders pose a risk to the community prior to registration, notification, and Internet dissemination. <em>Cf. Doe v. Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 686 N.E.2d 1007, 1014 (Mass.1997) (\u201c[A registrant] is entitled to a hearing and a determination as to ... whether sex offender information concerning him should be available on request.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 792 is not punitive and does not violate the strictures of <em>Apprendi </em>should not be construed as holding that the sex offender registration and community notification statute does not violate due process in any way, particularly in light of the newly initiated Internet notification, which threatens widespread disclosure of highly personal data and may implicate social ostracism, loss of employment opportunities, and possibly verbal and physical harassment. It is arguable that widespread Internet community notification stigmatizes registrants and implicates liberty and privacy interests that would satisfy the \u201cstigma plus\u201d test utilized to analyze civil due process challenges in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>many of the federal circuits, therefore requiring certain procedural due process protections beyond those provided in the statute prior to community notification. <em>See, e.g., Noble v. Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, </em>327 Ore. 485, 964 P.2d 990 (1998) (holding that the parole board\u2019s designation of an individual as a \u201cpredatory sex offender\u201d for the purpose of the Oregon community notification statute implicated a liberty interest entitling a sex offender, as a matter of procedural due process, to notice and a hearing prior to designation); <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 762, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 1476, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989) (recognizing a privacy right in the \u201cindividual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,\u201d even if such information is available in public records); <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 706, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1163, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976); <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S.Ct. 507, 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971); <em>Doe, </em>426 Mass. 136, 686 N.E.2d at 1013-14 (discussing privacy interests in information that is publically available); Wayne A. Logan, <em>Liberty Interests in the Preventive State: Procedural Due Process and Sex Offender Community Notification Laws, </em>89 J. CRIM. L. &amp; CRIMINOLOGY 1167, 1176 n. 45 (1999); <em>see generally Shields v. Burge, </em>874 F.2d 1201, 1209 (7th Cir.1989) (referring to privacy interests in \u201cconfidentiality\u201d and \u201cautonomy\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 718 n. 13, 806 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">A year after the <em>Young </em>decision, however, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether Connecticut\u2019s sex offender registration statute violated the procedural due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003). <em>Connecticut DPS </em>overturned the Second Circuit\u2019s decision that \u201cthe Due Process Clause entitles [registrants] to a hearing \u2018to determine whether or not they are particularly likely to be currently dangerous before being labeled as such by their inclusion in a publicly disseminated registry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>6, 123 S.Ct. 1160 (quoting <em>Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety ex rel. Lee, </em>271 F.3d 38, 62 (2d Cir.2001)). The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">[E]ven assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that respondent has been deprived of a liberty interest, due process does not entitle him to a hearing to establish a fact that is not material under the Connecticut statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[Although] we [have] held that due process required the government to accord the plaintiff a hearing to prove or disprove a particular fact or set of facts[,] ... in each of these cases, the fact in question was concededly relevant to the inquiry at hand. Here, however, the fact that respondent seeks to prove\u2014that he is not currently dangerous\u2014is of no consequence under Connecticut\u2019s [sex offender registration law]. As the [Department of Public Safety] Website explains, the law\u2019s requirements turn on an offender\u2019s conviction alone\u2014a fact that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest. 271 F.3d at 44 (\u201c \u2018Individuals included within the registry are included <em>solely </em>by virtue of their conviction record and state law\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added))....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">In short, even if respondent could prove that he is not likely to be currently dangerous, Connecticut has decided that the registry information of all sex offenders\u2014currently dangerous or not\u2014must be publicly disclosed. Unless respondent can show that that <em>substantive </em>rule of law is defective (by conflicting with a provision of the Constitution), any hearing on current dangerousness is a bootless exercise.... States are not barred by principles of \u201cprocedural due process\u201d from drawing such classifications. <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 120, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 (1989) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original) .... Because the question is not properly before us, we express no opinion as to whether Connecticut\u2019s [ ] Law violates principles of substantive due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">538 U.S. at 7-8, 123 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In other words, the statute conclusively presumes that anyone convicted of a sex offense is dangerous, so it is the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>of conviction that is relevant, not dangerousness itself. The Supreme Court has held that this presumption is permissible. <em>See Smith, supra, </em>538 U.S. at 103, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (holding that \u201cAlaska could conclude that a conviction for a sex offense provides evidence of substantial risk of recidivism,\u201d without any specific finding of future dangerousness). If the statute had nothing to do with dangerousness, it would have no rational purpose, because it would not help ensure public safety to force registration on people who pose no harm to society. Thus, if the conclusive presumption violates Doe\u2019s substantive due process or' equal protection rights, he may have a claim. But his claim is not one of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Appellant attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Connecticut DPS </em>by pointing out that the internet site used by the Connecticut Department of Public Safety has a disclaimer, clarifying to the public that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">The Department of Public Safety has not considered or assessed the specific risk of re-offense with regard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion within this registry, and has made no determination that any individual included in the registry is currently dangerous. Individuals included within the registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and state law. The main purpose of providing this data on the Internet is to make the information more easily available and accessible, not to warn about any specific individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">http://www.ct.gov/dps/cwp/view.asp?a=2157 &amp; q=294474. The Maryland site has no such disclaimer, either on the website or as part of the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d for its use. But, although the Supreme Court made brief mention of the disclaimer in its opinion, <em>see id. </em>at 5, 123 S.Ct. 1160 the requirements of the statute, not the disclaimer, was the basis for the Court\u2019s decision. The Maryland statute is not distinguishable from the Connecticut statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Appellant urges us to interpret Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights more broadly than the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Amendment, and hold that additional process is required before a sex offender can be added to the Maryland registry. Article 24, which provides that \u201cno man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land,\u201d is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Dua v. Comcast Cable of Md., Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 628, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002). Therefore, we decline to interpret Article 24 more expansively in this case, as we are persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Connecticut DPS. </em>Like the Supreme Court in <em>Connecticut DPS, </em>we note, that John Doe has not brought a substantive due process claim, and does not express any opinion on that issue. <em>See Connecticut DPS, supra, </em>538 U.S. at 8, 123 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">II. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s equal protection claim, brought under both the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24. He argues that the statute is arbitrary because it lumps all past offenders together, regardless of their actual dangerousness. As a result, Doe contends, the statute violates his right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\u201cAlthough the Maryland Constitution does not contain an express guarantee of equal protection of the laws, it is well established that Article 24 embodies the same equal protection concepts found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 417, 635 A.2d 967 (1994) (citing <em>Kirsch v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>331 Md. 89, 96, 626 A.2d 372 (1993)) (additional citations omitted). The basic concept behind equal protection is that, when the government decides to treat people differently based on a particular characteristic, its distinctions must be justified. <em>See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Florida, </em>379 U.S. 184, 191, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964) (holding that the court must determine \u201cwhether the classifications drawn in a statute are reasonable in light of its purpose\u201d). The level of justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion required varies; if the government distinguishes based on a suspect class, or if a fundamental right is involved, strict scrutiny must be applied, and the government must show that the classification \u201cunder review is \u2018narrowly tailored\u2019 to achieve a \u2018compelling\u2019 government interest.\u201d <em>Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>551 U.S. 701, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007) (quoting <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, </em>515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise, we will apply rational basis review, and the burden is on the challenger to negate \u201cany reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 366, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (citations omitted). There need only be a \u201crational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\n<em>A. Level of Scrutiny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The Supreme Court has established that the \u201csuspect classes\u201d to which strict scrutiny applies are race, nationality, and alienage. <em>See Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., </em>488 U.S. 469, 494, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (\u201cThe highly suspect nature of classifications based on race, nationality, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>alienage is well established.\u201d (Quoting <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 105, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted)). This is because those particular groups have been \u201csaddled with [ ] disabilities, or subjected to [ ] a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to [ ] a position of political powerlessness,\u201d and therefore \u201ccommand extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). One could certainly argue that sex offenders are saddled with disabilities, such as the requirement that they register for life, and that they are politically powerless, since society reviles them and treats them as pariahs. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dave Newbart, <em>Registry Won\u2019t Stop Sex Crime, Offenders Say, </em>Chicago Tribune, Dec. 22, 1997, at Ml (discussing a study conducted on the opinions of sex offenders); the researcher noted: \u201cThey know that society thinks they are scum.\u201d); Andre Henderson, <em>More Sexual Offenders Serving Time: Increased Reporting of Crimes Leads to Increasing Prison Population, </em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Sept. 24, 1995, at A20 (\u201cFew members of society are as reviled as sex offenders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Yet unlike the people in the established suspect classes, who are members of the class because of an accident of birth, people classified as sex offenders had control over whether to become a class member. <em>See Kahn v. Shevin, </em>416 U.S. 351, 357, 94 S.Ct. 1734, 40 L.Ed.2d 189 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (noting that classifications requiring strict scrutiny are \u201cgenerally [based on] immutable characteristics over which individuals have little or no control\u201d). Their situation is similar to that of the illegal aliens in <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982), whom the Supreme Court held are not a suspect class because undocumented status is not an \u201cimmutable characteristic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. Instead, it is \u201cthe product of conscious, indeed unlawful, action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although some would argue that sex offenders are born with their sexual proclivities, or develop them early in life, we must assume that they possess the ability to refrain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>acting </em>on them in a way that harms others. Because their voluntary actions put them in the disfavored class, we hold that the \u201csex offender\u201d class is not suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"AhT\">We now turn to whether the registration statute implicates a fundamental right.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">Fundamental rights or interests are those \u201cexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed\u201d by the federal constitution, <em>San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 33-34, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973); <em>see Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 101, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (first amendment rights), and they, as presently delineated by the Supreme Court, include the right to vote, <em>Harper v.

Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 326, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937). The only \u201cfundamental right\u201d identified by Doe is the right to privacy, in Section IV, <em>infra, </em>which we conclude is not implicated by the statute. Therefore, we hold that rational basis review should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\n<em>B. Rational Basis Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Under rational basis review, \u201ca court \u2018will not overturn\u2019 the classification \u2018unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that [the court] can only conclude that the [governmental] actions were irrational.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 355, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) (quoting <em>Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)) (additional citations omitted). Doe concedes that the statute has a rational purpose\u2014protecting public safety. But, he argues that \u201clumping [him] in\u201d with dangerous sex offenders is so unjust, and using a past conviction as a proxy for dangerousness is so over-broad, that the statute is irrational. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">First, we note that the statute does not \u201clump together\u201d all people who have committed a sex offense. Rather, it makes distinctions between different types of offenders, labeling them as \u201coffenders,\u201d \u201cchild sex offenders,\u201d \u201csexually violent offenders,\u201d and \u201csexually violent predators,\u201d and subjecting each category to differing levels of regulation. Doe makes no allegation that he has been placed into the wrong category, or that he is being treated any differently than others labeled as sexually violent offenders. Second, the mere fact that a statute is both under-inclusive and over-inclusive, is not, without more, enough to invalidate it under this level of scrutiny. <em>See Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 323, 932 A.2d 571 (2007) (\u201cIn light of the deference owed to the General Assembly under rational basis review, we shall not declare Family Law \u00a7 2-201 unconstitutional, even though it may be under-or over-inclusive, or otherwise create a distinction based on imperfectly drawn criteria.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Regardless of whether Doe himself is dangerous, the fact that Doe has been convicted of a sex crime makes it <em>statistically </em>more likely that he will commit a sex crime in the future. While sex offenders are less likely than others released from prison to commit another crime, they are more likely than either the general public or their fellow releasees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to be convicted of a new sex crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the legislature\u2019s decision to use a prior conviction as the sole basis for deciding whether someone must be included in the registry, regardless of whether there is any specific evidence of sexual dangerousness, is not irrational. Nor does the fact that the legislature did not create an \u201cassaulter registry\u201d make the sex offender registry irrational. \u201cNormally, the widest discretion is allowed the legislative judgment in determining whether to attack some, rather than all, of the manifestations of the evil aimed at; and normally that judgment is given the benefit of every conceivable circumstance which might suffice to characterize the classification as reasonable rather than arbitrary and invidious.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 191, 85 S.Ct. 283 (citations omitted). Again, even though it is clear, given the low rate of recidivism for sex crimes, that the statute will force some people to bear the indignity of registration long after they may have ceased to be a danger to anyone, that is not enough for this Court to overturn the decision of the Legislature in this case. We hold that the statute does have a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">IY. The Right to Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152-53, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) (emphasis added), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as <em>Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, </em>141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 35 L.Ed. 734 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 564, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 8-9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 350, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), <em>see Olmstead v. United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 478, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S., at 484-485, 85 S.Ct. 1678; in the Ninth Amendment, <em>id., </em>at 486, 85 S.Ct. 1678 (Goldberg, J., concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967); procreation, <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541-542, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); contraception, <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, </em>405 U.S., at 453-454, 92 S.Ct. 1029; <em>id., </em>at 460, 463-465, 92 S.Ct. 1029 (White, J., concurring in result); family relationships, <em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944); and child rearing and education, <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>As for the right of privacy under Maryland law, the Court of Appeals has noted: \u201cIt is, of course, no longer open to question that the right of privacy is protected by the federal constitution and that where the right is applicable, regulation limiting it must be justified by a \u2018compelling state interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Walsh, </em>274 Md. 502, 512, 336 A.2d 97 (1975) (citation omitted). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the right to privacy is also protected by the Maryland Constitution, we hold that those protections are <em>in pan materia </em>with those provided by the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\u201cThe cases sometimes characterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 have in fact involved at least two different kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\u201d <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 598-600, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977) (footnotes omitted). It is the first interest that is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Doe contends that the main result of the disclosure of information about him is the harm to his reputation. The Supreme Court has held, however, that damage to an individual\u2019s reputation, without more, does not implicate an interest protected by the Constitution. <em>See Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). In <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>the plaintiff complained that police were posting signs in local businesses that accused him of being an \u201cActive Shoplifter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 96 S.Ct. 1155. The Court held that this did not violate his substantive due process or privacy rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">[W]e hold that the interest in reputation asserted in this case is neither \u201cliberty\u201d nor \u201cproperty\u201d guaranteed against state deprivation without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">The activities detailed as being within th[e] definition [of the right to privacy] were ones very different from that for which respondent claims constitutional protection\u2014matters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tionships, and child rearing and education. In these areas it has been held that there are limitations on the State\u2019s power to substantively regulate conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">Respondent\u2019s claim is far afield from this line of decisions. He claims constitutional protection against the disclosure of the fact of his arrest on a shoplifting charge. His claim is based, not upon any challenge to the State\u2019s ability to restrict his freedom of action in a sphere contended to be \u201cprivate,\u201d but instead on a claim that the State may not publicize a record of an official act such as an arrest. None of our substantive privacy decisions hold this or anything like this, and we decline to enlarge them in this manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9cs\"><em>Id. </em>at 713, 96 S.Ct. 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In the wake of <em>Davis, </em>a \u201cstigma-plus test,\u201d has been \u201cutilized to analyze civil due process challenges in many of the federal circuits.\u201d <em>Young, supra, </em>370 Md. at 718 n. 13, 806 A.2d 233. This test requires that, in addition to hurting the plaintiffs reputation, the State\u2019s conduct harm the plaintiff in some other way. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Dupnik, </em>924 F.2d 1520, 1532 n. 22 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe \u2018plus\u2019 part of th[e stigma-plus] test can be met by either the denial of a right specifically secured by the Bill of Rights (such as the right to free speech or counsel), or the denial of a state-created property or liberty interest such that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause is violated.\u201d), <em>rev. on other grounds by Cooper v. Dupnik, </em>963 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir.1992) (en banc). The Court of Appeals has noted that registration \u201cmay implicate social ostracism, loss of employment opportunities, and possibly verbal and physical harassment, which could satisfy the \u2018stigma plus\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that it does, Doe\u2019s right to privacy was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">There are two Supreme Court cases to address the right of privacy in the context of a government-created database. First, in <em>Whalen, </em>the Court upheld New York State\u2019s creation of a centralized database that recorded the names and addresses of all patients who were prescribed drugs for which there is an active black market. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>429 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>603-04, 97 S.Ct. 869. Although the Court acknowledged that \u201cthe statute threatens to impair both [the patients\u2019] interest in the nondisclosure of private information and also their interest in making important [medical] decisions independently,\u201d it felt that the invasions of privacy were minimal, similar to other invasions required by modern medicine, and that adequate safeguards were in place to protect the database. <em>Id. </em>at 600-03, 97 S.Ct. 869. In <em>Nixon v. Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977), the court rejected Nixon\u2019s claim that forcing him to turn over presidential papers and recordings violated his constitutional right to privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 97 S.Ct. 2777. The court found Nixon\u2019s claim even weaker than that in <em>Whalen </em>because of the public interest in seeing the presidential papers and because \u201cpurely private papers\u201d would be returned to Nixon. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">These two cases were relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in deciding <em>Russell v. Gregoire, </em>124 F.3d 1079 (9th Cir.1997), and upholding Washington State\u2019s sex offender registration statute against a right to privacy challenge. Although Washington, like Maryland, posts data about sex offenders on the internet, the Ninth Circuit held that this did not constitute \u201cundue dissemination\u201d because: \u201cThe information collected and disseminated by the Washington statute is already fully available to the public and is not constitutionally protected .... [or is information that is not] generally considered \u2018private.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1093-94 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>47 F.3d 716, 732-33 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc) (discussing common law invasion of privacy)). The right to privacy, in the sense of forbidding disclosure of personal matters, has generally been held not to extend to information already in the public record. For example, in <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975), the Supreme Court noted that \u201ceven the prevailing law of [the tort of] invasion of privacy generally recognizes that the interests in privacy fade when the information involved already appears on the public record,\u201d before holding that it was a violation of the First Amendment to criminalize the publication of a rape victim\u2019s name, at least where the name is available in the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>record. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 95 S.Ct. 1029; <em>accord Fla. Star v. B.J. F., </em>491 U.S. 524, 540-41, 109 S.Ct. 2603, 105 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). A person\u2019s criminal record is part of the public domain, and is largely created and held by the judicial system itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In <em>Doe v. Shady Grove Adventist Hosp., </em>89 Md.App. 351, 598 A.2d 507 (1991), this Court quoted favorably from <em>Doe v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>744 F.Supp. 40 (D.R.I.1990), which had held that the court need not permit a family to proceed under a fictitious name where they were bringing a wrongful death suit on behalf of a family member with AIDS. Further, the <em>Prudential </em>Court held that \u201cit is inappropriate for the Court to bar access to otherwise public records solely on the basis of subjective feelings of confidentiality or embarrassment of the type asserted here.\u201d <em>Prudential, supra, </em>744 F.Supp. at 41 (quoted in <em>Shady Grove, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 363 n. 6, 598 A.2d 507). Similarly, we do not believe that sex offenders have the right to keep their convictions \u201cunder seal\u201d or otherwise away from the public eye, simply because the offenders find them embarrassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Doe cites <em>United States DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989), which held that FBI-compiled \u201crap sheets\u201d should not be made available to the public via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, even though an individual\u2019s past criminal offenses are part of the public record. <em>Accord Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (FOIA case upholding <em>in camera </em>inspection of the case summaries of honor and ethics hearings at military academy in order to protect cadets\u2019 privacy interests). <em>Reporters Committee </em>is inapposite, however, because it interprets a federal statute, not the Constitution. We find those cases unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In addition to the information in the public record, the sex offender registry contains a picture of Doe and his address. These are generally not considered private because a person\u2019s image can be readily observed by any passerby and addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>are available in the phone book or on the internet, and they are not intimate details of the kind ordinarily considered \u201cprivate\u201d under the law. For all of the forgoing reasons, we hold that the sex offender registry does not violate Doe\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, nor does Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration statute violate Doe\u2019s procedural due process or equal protection rights. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">. The reasons for the violation are unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">. We use the male pronouns throughout this opinion because the vast majority of sex offenders are, in fact, male. <em>See, e.g., </em>Geneva Adkins <em>et al., </em>Iowa Dept. of Human Rights, The Iowa Sex Offender Registry and Recidivism 6 (Dec.2000) (noting that only 3-4% of Iowa\u2019s sex offender population was female, and that \"national data [suggests that! Caucasian males are the primary perpetrators of sex crimes.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. An exception applies when the distinction is based on gender, in which case the court will apply a different, intermediate level of scrutiny. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, </em>518 U.S. 515, 532-33, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996) (\u201cTo summarize the Court's current directions for cases of official classification based on gender: Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is \u2018exceedingly persuasive.\u2019 The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the Slate. <em>See Mississippi Univ. for Women, </em>458 U.S. [718,] 724, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 [ (1982) ]. The State must show \u2018at least that the [challenged] classification serves \u201cimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed\u201d are \u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\u201d \u2019 <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>446 U.S. 142, 150, 100 S.Ct. 1540, 64 L.Ed.2d 107 (1980)).\u201d). Because Doe does not allege gender discrimination, we will say no more ol intermediate scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics: \"Compared to non-sex offenders released from State prison, sex offenders had a lower overall re-arrest rate.\u201d U.S. Dept, of Justice, <em>Recidivism of Sex Offenders Released from Prison in 1994 </em>2 (Nov.2003), <em>available at </em>http://www.ojp. usdoj.gov/ljjs/pub/pdf/rsorp94.pdf. Tlieir re-arrest rate for all crimes was 43%, compared to 68% for all releasees. Sex offenders were more likely than non-sex offenders to be rearrested for sex crimes, however, at 5.3% and 1.3% respectively. We take judicial notice of the fact that the population of the United States in 1994 was over two hundred and sixty million, and note that there were between 60,000-70,000 arrests for sex crimes that year. <em>See </em>Wendy Koch, <em>Despite High-Profile Cases, Sex--Offense Crimes Decline, </em>USA Today, Aug. 24, 2005, at A1 available at http://www.usat oday.com/news/nation/2005-08-24-sex-crimes-cover_x.htm.
