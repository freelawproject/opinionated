Henriquez, appellee. Following a two-day hearing on the issues of custody, visitation, and child support, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ordered, among other things, that Mr. Henriquez pay $5,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to the House of Ruth Domestic Violence Legal Clinic (the \u201cHouse of Ruth\u201d), a non-profit organization that provided Ms. Henriquez with free legal representation at trial. On appeal, Mr. Henriquez presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>several issues for our review, which we have consolidated and reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">1. Is a court authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees in a case where a party is represented by a non-profit legal services organization that does not charge the litigant a fee for its representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">2. Did the circuit court properly exercise its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the House of Ruth when the bill for attorney\u2019s fees was not provided in discovery prior to the custody proceeding? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The parties were married in El Salvador on April 18, 1998, and they had two children during the marriage: Ana, born in 1998; and Jessica, born in 2000. Ms. Henriquez had one child prior to the marriage: Gloria, born in 1994. On December 27, 2005, Ms. Henriquez filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a Complaint for Absolute Divorce, which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>a request for the legal and physical custody of the children and \u201creasonable counsel fees and costs\u201d of the proceedings. The circuit court bifurcated the trial to consider the issues of custody, visitation, and child support separate and apart from the grounds for divorce and property disposition issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">On January 8 and 9, 2007, the court held proceedings on the custody and child support portion of the trial. At the conclusion of the first day of trial, Ms. Henriquez\u2019s attorney introduced into evidence an itemized bill for \u201cAttorney\u2019s Fees for Custody, Visitation and Support Issues Only.\u201d The bill documented counsel\u2019s work on the case for 58.34 hours, at $200 per hour, for a total of $11,668. The bill covered the time period from May 19, 2006, to January 7, 20\u00dc7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Mr. Henriquez objected to the introduction of the bill for attorney\u2019s fees. He argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">The objection is twofold so it\u2019s clear. Not only do we object to the introduction of the itemization, we object, Mr. Herrera [sic] objects to the request for counsel fees based upon the following history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">In this case, Your Honor, interrogatories, a request for production of documents, and a deposition was [sic] taken. Interrogatory No. 27, which I\u2019ve made a copy of which I won\u2019t bother the Court now, but I\u2019d like to mark and make it part of the record says, if you intend to produce or use any oral or written statements, photographs, video or sound recordings, and/or written documents in any trial or hearing of the case, please provide the following information. And then it goes on to ask for the information. In this particular case, the answer which I\u2019ll, [sic] provides no evidence or indication that there will be a statement of counsel fees. And again, the word is written documents. It\u2019s just not responsive, in fact, there\u2019s no response of course. And then there is the question of the request for production of documents, Request No. 40, a copy of which I have says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>any and all documentary evidence which you or anyone on your behalf intends to introduce at the hearing of the matter. And the response is a copy of the photograph and marriage certificate produced. Again, I asked for documentary evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Now we have asked for written documents and we have asked for documentary evidence and neither the exhibit which was marked is that or it\u2019s incorporeal evidence which we don\u2019t believe really exists. So we think that it should have been submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Counsel for Mr. Henriquez then read excerpts from Ms. Henriquez\u2019s deposition, where counsel asked Ms. Henriquez whether she: 1) had \u201cwritten any checks or paid any money to your lawyers for their legal services to you\u201d; or 2) had \u201cpaid them any money to reimburse them from [sic] any costs that they have incurred in representing you in this case.\u201d Ms. Henriquez answered these questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Counsel for Mr. Henriquez further read to the court excerpts from the deposition where Ms. Henriquez\u2019s counsel responded to his questions regarding whether there was a fee agreement. Ms. Henriquez\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t charge money for our hourly legal services.\u201d She explained that, at the end of the case, Ms. Henriquez would not owe the House of Ruth any money, with the possible exception of reimbursement for expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Based on these discovery responses, Mr. Henriquez argued that \u201cthey ought to be stopped [sic] from asking for attorneys [sic] fees since we might have conducted things a little bit differently with regard to asking questions for example of the expert. How do you get from that to an $11,000 bill? So we object to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The court asked counsel for Ms. Henriquez if she wished to respond, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: Yes, just briefly Your Honor. In terms of the interrogatories and the request for production of documents. As [counsel for Mr. Henriquez] stated, there was no specific request for any bill regarding the attorney\u2019s fees. And at the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">[THE COURT]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: At the time we produced documents there wouldn\u2019t have been much of a bill to produce anyway. And we did prepare the bill in anticipation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">[THE COURT]: Well, you have to update interrogatories as you go along so as to advise the other side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">[THE COURT]: Did you tell [counsel for Mr. Henriquez] at any time that, prior to yesterday!,] that you were going to be charging attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: In the complaint for absolute divorce it\u2019s very clearly stated that we are seeking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">[THE COURT]: No, after the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]:\u2014-attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab1\">[THE COURT]: That\u2019s why he was asking you the questions, because it was contained in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: Well, the deposition that was taken and that [counsel for Mr. Henriquez] referred to in this case was actually taken in connection with the second portion of this case, which is the divorce and property disposition portion of the case. And it was taken at a time that was after the period of discovery closed with respect to the custody merits portion of the trial, and it was actually taken after we were originally scheduled to be heard in the custody merits portion of the trial. So any questions that were asked in that deposition were to the issues as they relate to divorce of the parties and property disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Let\u2019s go back to my original question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: So, no, we had not stated to [counsel for Mr. Henriquez] anything about asking for attorney\u2019s fees in the custody portion of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC0\">[THE COURT]: All right. And do you have a fee agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: No, we do not. As the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">[THE COURT]: Are you charging [Ms. Henriquez] an hourly rate for your services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: No. The House of Ruth is a not-for-profit organization. I am sure the Court is familiar, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">[THE COURT]: Well, I don\u2019t know who employs you. I do not have any information about that one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdD\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. HENRIQUEZ]: Okay. But there is case law that states that even nonprofit organizations who do not receive fees directly from their individual clients, are still entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees in civil matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">[THE COURT]: Okay. All right. [Counsel for Mr. Henriquez], you are on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. HENRIQUEZ]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Mr. Henriquez testified that he paid his attorney a $5,000 fee to represent him at trial. In closing argument, both attorneys discussed the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Ms. Henriquez argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">Finally and just briefly, we have submitted a bill for attorneys\u2019 fees and would ask the Court to order the payment of fees by Mr. Henriquez. And the case of <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>which is a United States Supreme Court case, 465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891, permits the ordering of attorneys\u2019 fees even when a party is represented by a non-profit public interest law firm. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Mr. Henriquez responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">I would say that I think there is something fundamentally wrong when you get no answers to the discovery on a particular issue and then, as I read to the Court, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>explicitly ask it over and over again and you get the response \u201cWe don\u2019t charge.\u201d It wasn\u2019t we don\u2019t charge for this, but we charge, [sic] \u201cWe don\u2019t charge.\u201d We believe that they ought to be estopped from asking for counsel fees in view of what their representation was and that\u2019s a matter of record. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">After hearing argument from both parties, the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Ms. Henriquez. The court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">The Court also believes that there should be some award of fees for representation given that essentially Mrs. Henriquez is wholly dependent and went to a community services organization for her representation. She\u2019s virtually penniless as far as I can tell. Mr. Henriquez makes what he makes.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Any payment to counsel obviously goes out of the family pocket and into, into counsel\u2019s pocket. Mr. Henriquez has made a payment of $5,000 to [his attorney], I think that represents an exceptionally reasonable amount and I make an award of a similar amount to, for counsel fees....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">The award of fees to the plaintiff are for purposes of costs and to whatever extent attorneys\u2019 fees have been expended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">On June 20-21, 2007, over five months after the custody and child support portion of the trial concluded, the court heard testimony regarding the grounds for divorce and property disposition issues, which are not at issue in this appeal. On August 13, 2007, the court issued a Judgment of Absolute Divorce. The court ordered, among other things, that \u201cDefendant shall pay to the Plaintiffs counsel, the House of Ruth Domestic Violence Legal Clinic, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for attorney\u2019s fees----\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Mr. Henriquez contends that the circuit court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Ms. Henriquez. He advances two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>arguments in support of this contention. First, he argues that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was improper because the House of Ruth is a non-profit legal services organization that did not charge Ms. Henriquez a fee for its representation; he argues that a court is authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees only when a party actually incurs expenses for legal fees. Second, Mr. Henriquez argues that Ms. Henriquez\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is barred because she failed to disclose in discovery any information in support of a claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Ms. Henriquez, on the other hand, argues that the court properly awarded her attorney\u2019s fees, stating that it is immaterial whether a party personally incurred legal expenses. She argues that \u201cnon-paid legal counsel are entitled to court-ordered awards of attorney\u2019s fees in the same way as paid counsel,\u201d and that \u201cattorney\u2019s fee awards to private, not-for-profit legal services organizations, such as the House of Ruth, further the public interest of creating an equitable system of justice and should be upheld by this Court.\u201d With respect to the alleged discovery violation, Ms. Henriquez states that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees because the pleadings gave notice that she was seeking attorney\u2019s fees, and Mr. Henriquez\u2019s counsel did not ask questions during discovery that specifically requested information regarding the claim for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees to Non-Profit Organization</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Maryland generally follows the \u201c \u2018American rule,\u2019 \u201d which provides that \u201c \u2018each party to a case is responsible for the fees of its own attorneys....\u2019\u201d <em>Royal Inv. Group, LLC v. Wang, </em>183 Md.App. 406, 456, 961 A.2d 665 (2008) (quoting <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008)). There are exceptions to this rule, however, including when \u201c \u2018there is a statute that allows the imposition of such fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nova Research, Inc. v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., </em>405 Md. 435, 445, 952 A.2d 275 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The circuit court here awarded Ms. Henriquez attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 12-103 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d), which provides: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">(1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">(2) files any form of proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(i) to recover arrearages of child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(ii) to enforce a decree of child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">(iii) to enforce a decree of custody or visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">(b) <em>Required </em>considerations.\u2014Before a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">(1) the financial status of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">(2) the needs of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">(3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">(c) <em>Absence of substantial </em>justification.\u2014Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall award to the other party costs and counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">Mr. Henriquez makes no claim that the attorney\u2019s fee award here was not reasonable; nor does he claim that the award was not based on the factors set forth in the statute. Rather, Mr. Henriquez\u2019s sole argument is that a court cannot order an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a party who did not personally incur expenses for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\"> A court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees generally is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 468, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994) (\u201cDecisions concerning the award of counsel fees rest solely in the discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>tion of the trial judge.\u201d); <em>Malin v. Mininberg, </em>153 Md.App. 358, 435-36, 837 A.2d 178 (2003) (the \u201ctrial court \u2018is vested with wide discretion\u2019 in deciding whether to award counsel fees and, if so, in what amount.\u201d) (quoting <em>Dunlap v. Fiorenza, </em>128 Md.App. 357, 374, 738 A.2d 312 (1999)). If the court gives proper consideration to the statutory factors and the circumstances of the case, an award of attorney\u2019s fees will not be reversed \u201c \u2018unless a court\u2019s discretion was exercised arbitrarily or the judgment was clearly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. Collins, </em>144 Md.App. 395, 447, 798 A.2d 1155 (2002) (quoting <em>Petrini, </em>336 Md. at 468, 648 A.2d 1016). In this case, however, Mr. Henriquez\u2019s argument is that a court has no authority under the statute to award attorney\u2019s fees unless that party actually incurred expenses for legal fees. This contention is reviewed <em>de novo. See Nesbit v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879 (2004) (\u201cWhen the trial court\u2019s order \u2018involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609 (2002)); <em>Jones v. Rosenberg, </em>178 Md.App. 54, 68, 940 A.2d 1109 (\u201cQuestions of law decided by the trial court are subject to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 64, 949 A.2d 652 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In determining the scope of the statutory authority to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12-103, we must apply well-established principles of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-\">[O]ur primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>A.2d at 482; <em>Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). Further, whenever possible, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions which does not lead to absurd consequences. <em>See Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 53, 912 A.2d 658, 673 (2006); <em>So. Easton Neighborhood Assoc. v. Town of Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 495, 876 A.2d 58, 74 (2005) ; <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (\u201c[T]he statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, \u2018not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u2019 \u201d). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006) ; <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604-05, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004). If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Oakland v.

Mandel, </em>402 Md. 109, 128-29, 935 A.2d 671 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Accordingly, we start, as we must, with the plain language of the statute. <em>See Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 583, 886 A.2d 876 (2005) (\u201cLegislative intent must be sought in the first instance in the actual language of the statute.\u201d); <em>Price v.

The language of \u00a7 12-103(b) makes clear that there are three factors that the court must consider in determining whether to award attorney\u2019s fees in a case involving custody, support or visitation of a child: \u201c(1) the financial status of each party; (2) the needs of each party; and (3) whether there was a substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.\u201d There is nothing in the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>statute that requires a court to consider the status of the legal services provided or whether a party actually incurred legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Mr. Henriquez, in arguing that a required consideration in awarding attorney\u2019s fees is whether the party actually incurred expenses, is attempting to insert a consideration not listed by the General Assembly. This is not in accord with settled rules of statutory interpretation. <em>See Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356 (2008) (\u201c \u2018We neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 662, 911 A.2d 1245 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">By its plain terms, \u00a7 12-103 sets forth three factors that the court is required to consider before it may, in its discretion, award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The criteria set forth in the statute do not include the status of the legal services provider as a factor that must be considered by the court. Accordingly, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, there is no <em>per se </em>bar to awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a party who is represented by a non-profit organization that provides the party with free legal representation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 12-103 is consistent with that of other states that have addressed this issue in the family law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>context. In <em>Benavides v. Benavides, </em>11 Conn.App. 150, 526 A.2d 536, 537 (1987), the plaintiff requested attorney\u2019s fees in connection with her claim for child support and custody of her children. Ms. Benavides was represented by Connecticut Legal Services, Inc., a nonprofit organization. <em>Id. </em>at 537. She claimed attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,100, which the trial court found to be justified. <em>Id. </em>The court reduced the amount awarded, however, because her counsel was employed by a nonprofit organization. <em>Id. </em>The Appellate Court of Connecticut reversed, finding that the criteria set forth in the statute authorizing attorney\u2019s fees made \u201cno provision for any consideration of the status of the legal services rendered, be it private counsel or nonprofit counsel....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. The trial court, in focusing on the \u201cnonprofit status\u201d of counsel, introduced a factor not contained in the statute. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Similarly, in <em>In re Marriage of Ward, </em>3 Cal.App.4th 618, 626, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 365 (Cal.Ct.App.1992), the Court of Appeal of California held that legal services organizations providing pro bono representation to indigents are eligible to receive attorney fee awards in matrimonial matters. The court noted that the statutes authorizing a court to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees set forth various considerations for the court to consider, none of which included establishing \u201cany underlying private obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees in order to obtain an award for such fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Other states have similarly construed their statutes. <em>See In re Marriage of Brockett, </em>130 Ill.App.3d 499, 85 Ill.Dec. 794, 474 N.E.2d 754, 756 (1984) (trial court erred in refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees to legal services office on the basis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Ms. Brockett had not \u201cincurred\u201d fees; statute \u201cdoes not expressly limit a fee awarded to a legal services office\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Gaddis, </em>632 S.W.2d 326, 328 (Mo.Ct.App.1982) (Legal Aid attorney may be granted attorney\u2019s fees in divorce action; \u201crepresentation by a Legal Aid attorney is not a relevant factor in determining the propriety or amount of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d under statute authorizing an award of fees); <em>In re Marriage of Malquist, </em>266 Mont. 447, 880 P.2d 1357, 1364 (1994) (statute sets forth factors to consider in determination of whether to award attorney\u2019s fees, but no language that precludes a court from awarding attorney\u2019s fees \u201cmerely because the attorney representing the indigent party has agreed to not charge the client for his or her professional services\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Marriage of Cowan, </em>279 Mont. 491, 928 P.2d 214 (1996); <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>438 N.W.2d 544, 548 (S.D.1989) (statute authorizing courts to award attorney\u2019s fees in a divorce case provides \u201cno exception ... that denies attorney fees where a party is represented by free legal services\u201d); <em>Pearson v. Pearson, </em>200 W.Va. 139, 488 S.E.2d 414, 426 (1997) (\u201cIn our review of this statute we have not discerned an intent, express or implied, by the legislature that attorney\u2019s fees are not to be awarded to a party receiving-free legal services.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Mr. Henriquez cites no case law or legislative history in support of his contention that \u201c[t]he Family Law Article clearly contemplates that an Order for the payment of attorney fees is founded upon a party\u2019s incurring legal fees in connection with the prosecution or defense of a proceeding.\u201d Instead, he relies solely on language in F.L. \u00a7 7-107 and Md. Rule 1-341. Neither supports his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Section 7-107, which authorizes attorney\u2019s fees in divorce proceedings, provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">(a) Definition.\u2014In this section, \u201creasonable and necessary expense\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">(1) suit money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">(2) counsel fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(3) costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(b) <em>Award </em>authorized.\u2014At any point in a proceeding under this title, the court may order either party to pay to the other party an amount for the reasonable and necessary expense of prosecuting or defending the proceeding. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">(c) <em>Considerations by </em>court.\u2014Before ordering the payment, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">(1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">(2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Mr. Henriquez notes that \u00a7 7\u2014107(b) authorizes the court to order either party to pay the other party an amount for the reasonable and necessary \u201cexpense\u201d of prosecuting or defending the proceeding. He argues: \u201cThe word <em>expense </em>is defined as something <em>paid out </em>to attain a goal or accomplish a purpose ... something requiring the <em>expenditure </em>of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">This contention fails for two reasons. First, Mr. Henriquez\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7-107 is misplaced. As indicated, the attorney\u2019s fees here were awarded pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12-103, not \u00a7 7-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Second, we do not agree that the language of \u00a7 7-107 \u201cclearly contemplates\u201d that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is proper only if the party incurs legal fees. Section 7-107 is one of four statutes in the Family Law Article that relates to dissolution of a marriage and authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-107 (divorce proceedings); \u00a7 8-214 (property disposition); \u00a7 11\u20141.10 (alimony); and \u00a7 12-103 (child custody, support and visitation). Although the language of the statutes varies somewhat, we have found nothing in the legislative history for these statutes that indicates an intent that different standards apply before a judge may order an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We presume that the General Assembly \u201cintended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Indeed, each of these statutes contains essentially the same required considerations. .Under all four statutes, the court can award attorney\u2019s fees only after considering: (1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and (2) whether there was a substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding. <em>See Harbom v. </em>Harbom, 134 Md.App. 430, 464, 760 A.2d 272 (2000) (Although factors required for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7. 12-103 and \u00a7 11-110 are \u201cphrased slightly differently,\u201d the judge must \u201c \u2018undertake the same investigation before making an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>109 Md.App. 620, 633, 675 A.2d 596 (1996)). None of these statutes lists as a required consideration the status of the legal services rendered or whether a party actually incurred legal fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Mr. Henriquez\u2019s reliance on Md. Rule 1-341 is similarly unavailing. Md. Rule 1-341 provides that a court may award \u201cthe reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party\u201d as a result of the bad faith conduct of the other party. (Emphasis added). The plain language of Md. Rule 1-341, unlike the language in the F.L. statutes, limits the attorney\u2019s fees that can be awarded to fees \u201cincurred\u201d by the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>U.S. Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 131, 589 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 69, 595 A.2d 482 (1991), this Court stated that the language of Md. Rule 1-341 provides \u201cfor reimbursement of expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>actually incurred.\u201d The Court noted, however, that if a statute authorizes payment, not for fees incurred, but for a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, \u201cit is not unreasonable to base the fee on \u2018prevailing market rates\u2019 in the community, whether the prevailing party is represented by retained counsel, in-house counsel or non-profit counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 589 A.2d 485 (citing <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 889,104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In <em>Blum, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered, in a civil rights action, \u201cwhether it was proper for the [trial court] to use prevailing market rates in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to nonprofit legal services organizations,\u201d or whether attorney\u2019s fees should be \u201ccalculated according to the cost of providing legal services.\u201d 465 U.S. at 892, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541. Rejecting the contention that attorneys with the Legal Aid Society of New York should be limited to recovering attorney\u2019s fees for the actual \u201ccost of providing legal services,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 892, 104 S.Ct. 1541 the Supreme Court concluded that \u201creasonable fees\u201d \u201care to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community, regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or non-profit counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 895, 104 S.Ct. 1541. <em>Accord Shapiro v. Chapman, </em>70 Md.App. 307, 316, 520 A.2d 1330 (1987) (the prevailing party in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees even if they \u201cwere represented by a publically funded, nonprofit law office.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The Family Law statutes discussed herein provide for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And, as indicated, the plain language of the statutes shows that the trial court is not required to consider the status of the legal services rendered before awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>There are also important policy considerations that weigh in favor of allowing courts to award attorney\u2019s fees to a nonprofit legal services organization, or a pro bono attorney, in family law cases. In <em>Malquist, </em>880 P.2d at 1363, the Supreme Court of Montana explained the importance of access to an attorney in family law cases, which implicate child support and custody issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">We live in a society where, next to health care, competent legal service is likely the most essential, yet most costly, professional service that most people from time to time require. That is certainly no more evident than in domestic relations cases wherein the court\u2019s decision will likely involve important property questions and will forever alter the personal relationships and obligations of the litigants to each other. More importantly, however, at issue in many such cases are the relationships of children to their parents and the fundamental rights of those children to food, clothing, shelter, education, medical care, support, and to a safe and reasonably stable home life. The multiplicity of laws and often technical court rules and procedures governing domestic relations cases combined with the emotionally charged nature of such proceedings, present a mine field to the litigant who is too poor to hire competent counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The court noted that the \u201cprinciple of providing equal access of justice to all\u201d warrants the award of attorney\u2019s fees to persons represented by legal services organizations or a pro bono attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 1364. Accordingly, the court held that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is authorized under the statute if \u201cthe requesting party shows necessity-i.e. the inability to pay for legal representation,\u201d as well as the reasonableness of the fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1365. \u201cWhether a party incurs debt is irrelevant, and necessity is unrelated to the status of the attorney who delivers the legal services.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In <em>Benavides, </em>the Appellate Court of Connecticut noted additional policy reasons for allowing attorney\u2019s fees for nonprofit counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>We are aware that indigents are represented by legal services attorneys in a large number of family relations matters. It would be unreasonable to allow a losing party in a family relations matter to reap the benefits of free representation to the other party. A party should not be encouraged to litigate under the assumption that no counsel fee will be awarded in favor of the indigent party represented by public legal services ... or as in this case, that a reasonable fee will be discounted for the same reason. \u201cPut in another way, the public should be relieved from the financial burden of obtaining an indigent plaintiffs divorce or successfully defending against a husband\u2019s complaint, to the extent that the husband is able to pay all or part of her attorney\u2019s fees. The taxpayer has an interest in recovering where possible a portion of the costs in these situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUB\">An award of counsel fees that does not discriminate against nonprofit legal service entities will encourage nonprofit counsel to expend its resources in the representation of those clients who are unable to afford private counsel in disputed child custody and child support enforcement litigation. The purposes of such acts as the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act in Connecticut, [ ] are advanced and are made more available to the poor where there is an expectancy that the nonprofit legal services will recoup at least part of its resources through an award of counsel fees to its client. Furthermore, a realization that the opposing party, although poor, has access to an attorney and that an attorney\u2019s fee may be awarded deters noncompliance with the law and encourages settlements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">526 A.2d at 538 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Other courts similarly have cited to policy considerations in holding that a party in a family law case is not precluded from recovering attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Ward, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at 624, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 365; <em>In re Marriage of Swink, </em>807 P.2d 1245, 1248 (Colo.Ct.App.1991); <em>Benavides, </em>526 A.2d at 538; <em>Lee v.

Based on the plain language of F.L. \u00a7 12-103, and the policy concerns implicated, we hold that a court may, in its discretion and after considering the requisite statutory factors, award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in a case where a party is represented by a non-profit legal services organization, or a pro bono attorney, irrespective of whether a fee agreement exists between the client and the attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Mr. Henriquez next claims that, even if the court was authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees to the House of Ruth, the court abused its discretion in awarding fees under the facts of this case because Ms. Henriquez did not disclose in discovery that she would be seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees. He cites to an interrogatory question wherein he asked Ms. Henriquez to itemize all current debts and liabilities, and he notes that her response did not mention legal fees incurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Mr. Henriquez further cites to a Request for Production of Documents, which asked Ms. Henriquez for all documentary evidence that she intended to introduce at trial, and he notes that her response made no mention of an itemized statement for attorney\u2019s fees. Mr. Henriquez argues that Ms. Henriquez\u2019s failure to provide him with evidence of her claim for legal fees prior to trial was a violation of Md. Rule 2-401 (e).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He argues further that Ms. Henriquez not only failed to disclose a claim for legal fees in discovery, but she further \u201caffirmatively denied\u201d in her deposition that she was asserting a claim for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Ms. Henriquez argues that she properly notified Mr. Henriquez of her intention to seek attorney\u2019s fees in her Complaint for Absolute Divorce. She argues that, in discovery, Mr. Henriquez never specifically requested attorney\u2019s fees bills or related documents. During her deposition, she argues, she \u201cwas candid about not paying fees to her attorney, but <em>at no time </em>stated that she waived her claim for fees as pled in her Complaint for Absolute Divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We begin first by dispensing with Mr. Henriquez\u2019s assertion that Ms. Henriquez \u201caffirmatively denied\u201d that she was asserting a claim for attorney\u2019s fees. To be sure, Ms. Henriquez and her attorney stated at Ms. Henriquez\u2019s deposition that the House of Ruth represented Ms; Henriquez without charging her a fixed or hourly legal fee. This did not constitute a waiver of a claim for attorney\u2019s fees, however, because, as indicated <em>sv/pra, </em>and as argued at trial, attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded to a non-profit legal services organization even in the absence of a fee agreement. Mr. Henriquez never specifically asked Ms. Henriquez if she waived her claim for attorney\u2019s fees, and Ms. Henriquez never indicated that she was waiving this claim. We find the argument that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was an affirmative waiver of the claim for attorney\u2019s fees to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We also are not persuaded by Mr. Henriquez\u2019s claim that the court should have denied Ms. Henriquez\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees based on her failure to produce before trial the document itemizing the requested fees. Although Mr. Henriquez asked, in interrogatories and in a request for production of documents, for any documents Ms. Henriquez intended to produce at trial, there was no specific request for information regarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In any event, any sanction for a violation of the discovery rules is within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 57, 926 A.2d 736 (2007) (appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of discovery sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard\u201d); <em>Klein v.

In exercising its discretion, the court should consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\u201cwhether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial, the timing of the ultimate disclosure, the reason, if any, for the violation, the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering or opposing the evidence, whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>Storetrax.com, Inc. v.

The court listened to Ms. Henriquez\u2019s argument that she made a claim for attorney\u2019s fees in her Complaint, that she did not waive her claim in her deposition, and that Mr. Henriquez never specifically requested information or documents regarding attorney\u2019s fees claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Moreover, the introduction of the document itemizing the fees requested did not prejudice Mr. Henriquez because the court did not rely on it in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Ms. Henriquez. Rather, the court disregarded the $11,668 in itemized fees, and, instead, looked to the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Mr. Henriquez. The court stated: \u201cMr. Henriquez has made a payment of $5,000 to [his attorney].

The appellate court noted that the trial court, \"in exercise of its inherent equitable powers may consider factors other than those enumerated in the statutes if such factors are appropriate for a just and equitable resolution\u201d of the dispute. <em>Benavides v. Benavides, </em>11 Conn. App. 150, 526 A.2d 536, 538 (1987). In that case, however, the trial court made no effort to show how a reduction of fees solely because of counsel\u2019s nonprofit status was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 539. Accordingly, ihe appellate court found the reduction of the fee to be arbitrary and erroneous and ordered that the case be remanded to award the full amount of counsel fees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. A bill was introduced this legislative session to specifically provide authority for an award of attorney's fees for pro bono representation. S.B. 474, Reg. Sess.2009. The bill proposed that F.L. \u00a7 \u00a7 7-107, 8-214, 11-110 and 12-103 be amended to include the following language: \u201cTHE COURT MAY AWARD AN AMOUNT FOR THE REASONABLE AND NECESSARY EXPENSE OF PROSECUTING OR DEFENDING A PROCEEDING UNDER THIS SECTION TO A LAWYER, A LAW FIRM, OR AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS A PARTY FREE OF CHARGE.\u201d The bill subsequently was withdrawn; the bill file contains a note from its sponsor suggesting that the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee wanted to wait for the appellate courts to resolve whether the amendment was necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. F.L. \u00a7 \u00a7 7-107, 8-214 and 11-110 specifically authorize an award for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Section 12-103 authorizes an award for attorney's fees \u201cthat are just and proper under all the circumstances ..which the Court of Appeals and this Court have interpreted as authorizing an award of \u201creasonable\u201d fees. See <em>Petrini, </em>336 Md. at 467, 648 A.2d 1016; <em>Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. 1, 32, 767 A.2d 874 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\">. F.L. \u00a7 12-103 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees \"to either party.\u201d Mr. Henriquez does not challenge the propriety of the attorney's fee award on the ground that the order directed him to pay the House of Ruth, rather than Ms. Henriquez. F.L. \u00a7 \u00a7 7-107(f), 8-214(f), and 11-110(f), expressly provide that the court may order that the attorney\u2019s fees awarded \"be paid directly to the lawyer.\u201d Section 12-103, which was enacted before these provisions, does not include this language. Because the issue was not raised on appeal, we will not address the issue whether fee awards pursuant to \u00a7 12-103 may be made payable directly to the attorney. We note, however, that other courts have interpreted statutes with language similar to \u00a7 12-103 as allowing fee awards to be awarded to pro bono counsel to avoid a windfall to the litigant. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Astrue, </em>564 F.Supp.2d 317, 321-22 (2008) (construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, which provides that a court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \"to the prevailing party,\u201d to authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees to pro bono counsel).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">.
