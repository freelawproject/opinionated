Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>lant was arrested on February 17, 2006, with respect to that incident. Following a trial in May 2007, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted Parker of second-degree assault, in violation of Md.Code (2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 3-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), and retaliation for testimony, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 9-303.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sentenced appellant to five years\u2019 incarceration for second-degree assault and, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 9-303(e)(2), to a concurrent term of twenty years for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">This appeal followed. Appellant presents three questions for our review. Recasted and reordered, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">1. Did the trial court err by imposing a sentence of twenty years for the crime of retaliation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">2. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination of the State\u2019s key witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">3. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in declining to allow character evidence from a witness who was not in attendance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">4. If preserved, did the trial court err in admitting prejudicial testimony that the victim was placed in witness protection?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm appellant\u2019s convictions but vacate his sentence for retaliation and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">At trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of a fire in Hicks\u2019s apartment that occurred in May 2005, which resulted in Hicks\u2019s temporary loss of custody of her children. The State also sought to exclude evidence of various complaints that Hicks made to the police \u201cagainst numerous different people,\u201d which did not result in charges against them. The court granted the State\u2019s motions, but ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>appellant could \u201cask Hicks if the reason she\u2019s telling this situation is because she blames [appellant] for her children being taken away from her without allusion to the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Hicks testified that she lived in an apartment on Lennox Street in Baltimore City, located in a neighborhood that \u201cwas really drug infested.\u201d She elaborated: \u201cMeaning that drug dealers would stand in front of my doorway, in front of my kids [\u2019] window, outside preying, selling drugs in front of our kids.\u201d Hicks explained that she thought they were drug dealers because she saw \u201cthem serve a couple people .... giving things in little baggy\u2019s [sic] or clear bottles, little tiny bottles,\u201d and she believed the \u201cthings\u201d to be drugs. She added that the drug dealing occurred \u201c[r]ight by [her] doorway,\u201d inside the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Hicks recounted that between 11 p.m. and midnight on May 23, 2005, she awoke to the sound of a gunshot \u201ccoming through [her] son\u2019s bedroom window.\u201d She \u201cseen a hole through the window and [she] looked over to the wall and [she] seen the hole through the wall.\u201d Hicks called 911. The State entered photographs of the room and the window into evidence. When the prosecution asked Hicks how she \u201chandl[ed] the drug dealers\u201d before the May 2005 incident, she replied that she was \u201c[Reporting them to the police and the rental office.\u201d She recalled that the police would respond in a marked patrol car and, \u201c[ojnce the police got there, [the drug dealers] would run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">With respect to the events of November 29, 2005, Hicks stated: \u201cI was coming home from a class I had which got out at twelve o\u2019clock[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] so I got home like twelve thirty ... and seen about thirty junkies in front of my door.\u201d She asked the people \u201cto move\u201d so that she could get into her apartment. She identified appellant as one of the persons who was standing by her steps. According to Hicks, she had seen Parker outside her apartment previously, \u201cselling to junkies\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c[g]iving out testers ... samples of the ... drug product.\u201d The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Now going back to November twenty-ninth of 2005, you saw Mr. Parker and thirty junkies in front of your door. What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">[HICKS]: When I asked them to move he said, \u201cBitch wait, don\u2019t rush me. I\u2019ll move when I\u2019m finished.\u201d I stated wait right there, I have something for you. He said, \u201cYou go into the house and call the police, I\u2019ll shoot through your window like I done the first time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: What did you believe he meant by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A12\">[HICKS]: Meaning he was the one who shot through my window [in May of 2005].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, did Mr. Parker display anything when he said this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">[HICKS]: Yes, a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And how did he display it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZo\">[HICKS]: He opened up his coat and I seen a gun in his waistband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Hicks described the weapon as a \u201clittle gun\u201d with a silver handle, sticking out of the waistband of appellant\u2019s pants. When she saw it, Hicks \u201cran into the house and called the police.\u201d Hicks claimed that she was \u201c[s]cared of my life .... [b]ecause he was a drug dealer and he said he was going to shoot through my window again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">On cross-examination, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAQ\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now Mam, you stated on direct examination that there was an argument with my client, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">[HICKS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I believe the words that you used was um you stated he said I have something for you, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">[HICKS]: No. I stated I had something to say. Meaning I was going to call the police because I was known for around here to call the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you said you had never actually talked to anybody in the community or any drug dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">[HICKS]: Talk you mean conversation. I was in an argument and I don\u2019t consider that talking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Baltimore City Police Officer Karl D. Hayes responded to Hicks\u2019s 911 call in May 2005. He stated that the bullet came in through the window and \u201clodged in the wall.\u201d But, he did not arrest anyone for the incident, because \u201c[n]o one was at the scene and no one actually visually saw anyone commit this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for acquittal. With regard to the gun charges, defense counsel argued that \u201cno gun was found.\u201d With respect to the assault charges, he asserted that there was \u201cno description of shooting any specific person\u201d and \u201cno actual threat to an individual.\u201d As to the retaliation charge, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtP\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: [Hicks] never testified that she actually spoke with anybody in the community about anything about calling the police. There\u2019s no testimony that the police were ever called on several occasions besides hers. There\u2019s no actual documentation of any of it.... [N]obody knew that [she called the police multiple times]. People have to know to retaliate to something and there was no testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">[PROSECUTOR] ... [Appellant\u2019s] own words indicate that he knew that she was calling the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Appellant testified that Hicks \u201clive in the neighborhood\u201d and he first had contact with her when he \u201csaved her kids\u201d in May 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He denied that he had any contact with Hicks after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The prosecutor showed appellant Detective Schuler\u2019s notes from an oral statement that appellant gave the police on February 16, 2006, attached to a sheet that Parker signed under the statement: \u201cI am willing to answer questions, and I do not want any attorney at this time. My decision to answer questions without having an attorney present is free and voluntary on my part.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant agreed that he had signed the statement. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right, and there was a question at the end of that [conversation]. Did you know about her windows being shot out? And your response was \u201cI heard about it but I didn\u2019t do shit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">[APPELLANT]: I never said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you remember the detectives asking you about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yea I tell them that I don\u2019t know nothing about nothing. That\u2019s what I told them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Appellant denied that he showed Hicks a gun on November 29, 2005. Indeed, appellant maintained that he did not know Hicks\u2019s name and had never talked to her. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: You knew the people in the neighborhood didn\u2019t like her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">[APPELLANT]: I mean she didn\u2019t like people in the neighborhood. She\u2019d chase people....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: You knew people in the neighborhood didn\u2019t like her, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">[APPELLANT]: No I don\u2019t [know] that people didn\u2019t like her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: You knew her window was shot out, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">[APPELLANT]: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">She beefs [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] with people. She\u2019s the one with, that chased people around like I said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Appellant admitted that he pleaded guilty to drug distribution in 2004 and possession with intent to distribute in 2006, because he \u201cwas guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The defense rested and renewed its motion for acquittal, incorporating its prior arguments. The court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Appellant challenges his sentence for retaliation under C.L. \u00a7 9-303, claiming the court improperly imposed an enhanced sentence because a jury should have determined the underlying factual issues. C.L. \u00a7 9-303 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">\u00a7 9-303. Retaliation for testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not intentionally harm another, threaten to harm another, or damage or destroy property with the intent of retaliating against a victim or witness for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">(1) giving testimony in an official proceeding; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">(2) reporting a crime or delinquent act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">(c) Penalty.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person who violates this section is guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">(2) If the official proceeding or report described in subsection (a) of this section relates to a felonious violation of Title 5 of this article[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] or the commission of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 14-101 of this article, or a conspiracy or solicitation to commit such a crime, a person who violates this section is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We pause to review relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Appellant was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with witness retaliation. The Statement of Charges, dated February 15, 2006, stated that appellant \u201cdid intentionally harm/damage or destroy \u2022 property with the intent of retaliating against Kya Hicks[,] a victim or witness!,] for giving testimony in an official proceeding/reporting a crime or delinquent act,\u201d in violation of C.L. \u00a7 9-303.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>The Statement of Charges also indicated that the penalty for violation of. the statute was a maximum of five years\u2019 imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The State filed a \u201cCriminal Information\u201d on April 11, 2006. Under the heading \u201cIntimidate/Influence a Witness,\u201d it averred that appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">did by <em>THREAT, </em>try to <em>INFLUENCE and INTIMIDATE Keya [sic] Hicks, </em>a <em>VICTIM and WITNESS, </em>for reporting Drug Activity that is a felony in violation of Title 5 of Criminal Law Article Section 9\u2014303(a)(2) of the Annotated Code of Maryland; against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">[CR 9\u2014303(a)(2) ] [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>](9-303(c)(2)[) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>At the conclusion of the evidence, the court instructed the jury, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">Lastly, the defendant is charged with retaliation of testimony. In order to convict the defendant with retaliation of testimony, the State must prove; (I) that the defendant intentionally harmed another or threatened to harm another, or damaged or destroyed property and; (2) that the defendant did so with the intent of retaliating against the victim or witness because the victim or witness either gave evidence in an official proceeding or reported a crime or delinquent act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant did not object to the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">At sentencing, the State claimed that appellant \u201cwas charged under the felony retaliation for testimony\u201d and faced a maximum penalty of twenty years in prison. The defense claimed that the maximum sentence was five years. Noting that appellant \u201cwas charged under C2 not Cl,\u201d the court stated that \u201cthe penalty that exists under the charge of retaliation, as charged in this particular case, the maximum sentence is twenty years.\u201d It said: \u201cI\u2019m going to sentence him [under] the felony retaliation statute. If you have an objection you should now make that objection.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cNo, no, your Honor.\u201d Thereafter, the court sentenced appellant to five years of incarceration for second-degree assault, and to a concurrent term of twenty years for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">As noted, appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred in sentencing appellant pursuant to a sentencing enhancement that was not submitted to or passed upon by the jury.\u201d He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Having been convicted of the crime, subsection (c)(1) provides a maximum sentence of five years. Subsection (c)(2) contains a sentencing enhancement providing that if the underlying statutory violation \u201crelates to a felonious violation of Title 5 of this article or the commission of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 14-101 of this article, or a conspiracy or solicitation to commit such a crime,\u201d the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sentence is 20 years. Appellant was sentenced to 20 years incarceration. The jury was never instructed that it had to find the sentencing enhancement applicable beyond a reasonable doubt and sentencing Appellant to 20 years incarceration violates Maryland common law as well as Maryland and Federal due process principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Quoting <em>Wadlow v. State, </em>335 Md. 122, 129, 642 A.2d 213 (1994), discussed <em>infra, </em>appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c \u2018[Wjhere the 'legislature has prescribed different sentences for the same offense, depending upon a particular circumstance of the offense, [the courts] have held that the presence of that circumstance must be alleged in the charging document, and must be determined by the trier of fact applying the reasonable doubt standard.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In appellant\u2019s view, the court erred by failing to instruct the jury as to its duty to determine \u201cthe facts necessary to establish the sentencing enhancement,\u201d as required by Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Appellant also contends that the enhancement of his sentence \u201cviolates due process principles\u201d under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny. In his view, \u201cthe trial court did not have in its arsenal the option of the twenty year sentencing enhancement,\u201d because the court did not instruct the jury to determine whether \u201cthe sentencing enhancement contained in [\u00a7 9-303](c)(2) existed beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">In addition, appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court failed to instruct the jury on every element of the crime charged.\u201d In particular, he claims that the court \u201cdid not instruct the jury that it must find that \u2018the official proceeding or report [that was the subject of retaliation] relates to a felonious violation of Title 5 ... or the commission of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 14-101 ... or a conspiracy or solicitation to commit such a crime.\u2019 \u201d He posits: \u201cBy failing to instruct the jury on each and every element of the crime with which he was charged, and ultimately sentenced under, the court violated Appellant\u2019s due process right that the State \u2018prove every ingredient of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Parker adds: \u201cThe trial court did not instruct the jury on an essential element of the crime, i.e. the facts that had to be established to invoke the 20 year sentencing enhancement. The omission of this essential element constituted reversible plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The State responds that \u201cit is unclear that the Legislature created two separate offenses when it imposed a harsher penalty for witness retaliation arising out of drug felonies and crimes of violence.\u201d It posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">In the instant case, the State was not obligated to prove that Parker was aware that Hicks had made reports of drug felonies, as such; only that he was retaliating for the reports that Hicks had made. That the specific crimes she reported (drug trafficking ...) were felonies under Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article could be determined under Maryland law by the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Further, the State claims: \u201cParker was specifically charged with retaliating against a witness to a drug felony ... and sufficient evidence was presented to a jury to allow it to determine that it was Hicks\u2019s reports of drug felonies that led to the threats and intimidation against her.\u201d Moreover, it points out that \u201cthere was no claim that Parker was motivated by anything other than Hicks\u2019s police complaints regarding drug felonies!'.']\u201d Instead, asserts the State, appellant\u2019s defense focused on agency. Alternatively, the State maintains that, \u201ceven if the nature of the crime reported is an element of the crime of retaliation,\u201d appellant\u2019s jury instruction argument is unpreserved, because \u201cParker did not seek a specific instruction on that point, nor did he object to its absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE9e\">As to the <em>Apprendi </em>claim, the State points out that \u201cParker did not contest the State\u2019s evidence as to why Hicks was the victim of retaliation.\u201d It reiterates that his \u201cdefense was that [Hicks] incorrectly identified him as the person who attempted to retaliate against her.\u201d While distinguishing the facts of <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, in which the defendant did not deny criminal agency, the State \u201crecognizes that, as in <em>Apprendi, </em>the instant case allows for an increased sentence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>be imposed based upon the specific motivation of the defendant who committed the criminal act.\u201d Noting that Maryland courts have not yet considered whether <em>Apprendi </em>applies to C.L. \u00a7 9-303, it.concedes: \u201cIf this Court were to find that <em>Apprendi </em>applied, the matter should be remanded for resentencing under \u00a7 9-303(c)(l).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">As we have seen, the court sentenced Parker under \u201cthe felony retaliation statute\u201d after generally instructing the jury on the crime of retaliation, but without instructing the jury to determine whether Hicks\u2019s complaints related to drug activity, in violation of Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article. The question here is whether appellant was entitled to have a jury determine the applicability of the enhancement provision of C.L. \u00a7 9-303(c)(2), and, if so, whether the burden fell on the State to make that request. Put another way, we must first consider whether appellant\u2019s failure to raise the matter constituted a waiver of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Clearly, if appellant believed that he could be sentenced to enhancement based only upon a jury determination of the underlying elements, he would have no reason to ask for the jury to make that determination; the failure to have the jury do so would preclude imposition of an enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Logic suggests that it was incumbent on the State, as the party seeking enhancement, to ask for a jury determination of the predicate facts. Therefore, we conclude that appellant did not waive his right to challenge imposition of the enhanced sentence merely because he did not ask the court to submit that issue to the jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number> Moreover, a trial court \u201cmay correct an illegal sentence at any time\u201d under Md. Rule 4-845(a). As the Court said in <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949 (1985), \u201cwhen the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court.\u201d <em>See Stubbs v. State, </em>406 Md. 34, 48 n. 1, 956 A.2d 155 (2008); <em>Jones v. State, </em>384 Md. 669, 678-79, 866 A.2d 151 (2005); <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 293, 786 A.2d 706 (2001); <em>Moore v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 305, 313-14, 878 A.2d 678 (2005). An illegal sentence includes a \u201csentence [that] is not a permitted one for the conviction upon which it was imposed and, [therefore], is intrinsically and substantively unlawful.\u201d <em>Chaney v.

State, </em>179 Md.App. 485, 510, 947 A.2d 74 (2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We conclude that the court erred in sentencing appellant to twenty years for retaliation, because the issue pertaining to sentencing enhancement was not submitted to the jury. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The framework for our review begins with <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348. It involved a challenge to New Jersey\u2019s \u201chate crime\u201d law, which provided that, upon a defendant\u2019s conviction of an underlying crime, the defendant was eligible for \u201can \u2018extended term\u2019 of imprisonment if the trial judge [found], by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u2018[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-69, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting statute). At sentencing, Apprendi unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The Supreme Court subsequently invalidated the statute, <em>id. </em>at 491-92, 120 S.Ct. 2348, concluding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that, in state prosecutions, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The Supreme Court observed, <em>id. </em>at 482-83, 120 S.Ct. 2348:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">The historic link between verdict and judgment and the consistent limitation on judges\u2019 discretion to operate within the limits of the legal penalties provided highlight the novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.1 ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In reaching its conclusion, the <em>Apprendi </em>Court differentiated between the terms \u201csentencing factor\u201d and \u201celement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348, remarking that in <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986), it \u201ccoined the term \u2018sentencing factor\u2019 to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that could affect the sentence imposed by the judge.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 485, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The <em>Apprendi </em>Court elaborated: \u201cThe term appropriately describes a circumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific sentence <em>within the range </em>authorized by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In contrast, \u201cfacts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were ... \u2018elements\u2019 of a separate legal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483 n. 10, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The Court explained that, \u201cwhen the term \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019 is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In distinguishing between a sentencing factor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>an element, the Court indicated that \u201cthe relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect\u2014does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Ring v.

Accordingly, the Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi: </em>\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at [244, 125 S.Ct. 738],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>Fisher, supra, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706, is also instructive. There, Mary Utley was charged and convicted of child abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 35(C). <em>Id. </em>at 226, 279, 786 A.2d 706. The child abuse resulted in the death of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 786 A.2d 706. At that time, \u201c\u00a7 35C(b)(l) authorized a maximum sentence of fifteen years for child abuse and \u00a7 35C(b)(2) authorized a maximum sentence of twenty years if the abuse resulted in the death of the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 786 A.2d 706. Utley, who was sentenced to twenty years, <em>id. </em>at 279, 786 A.2d 706, claimed on appeal that her sentence could not exceed fifteen years, because Count II of the indictment, pertaining to child abuse, did not allege that the abuse caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 280-81, 786 A.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Court of Appeals thought Utley\u2019s point was \u201cwell taken as a matter of Maryland criminal cause pleading,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 280, 786 A.2d 706, and thus it did not reach the due process issue under <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 282 n. 19, 786 A.2d 706. The Court recognized that the length of the sentence could be enhanced due to the presence of \u201c \u2018a particular circumstance of the offense,\u2019 \u201d i.e., that the child died as a result of the abuse, and therefore the charging document had to allege \u201c \u2018the presence of that circumstance,\u2019 \u201d and the circumstance had to \u201c \u2018be determined by the trier of fact applying the reasonable doubt standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 786 A.2d 706 (quoting <em>Wadlow, </em>335 Md. at 129, 642 A.2d 213). Reasoning that Count II of the indictment did not allege that the abuse caused the victim\u2019s death, and \u201cthe general reference at the conclusion of Count II to \u00a7 35C\u201d did not \u201ccure the problem,\u201d <em>id., </em>because it did not provide \u201cnotice whether the State [was] seeking the enhanced penalty under \u00a7 35C(b)(2),\u201d the Court vacated \u201cthat part\u201d of Utley\u2019s conviction \u201crepresented by the sentence\u201d in issue, and remanded for resentencing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 282, 786 A.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The <em>Fisher </em>Court relied on <em>Wadlow, </em>335 Md. 122, 642 A.2d 213, in which the Court of Appeals analyzed Md.Code (1992 RepLVol., 1993 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(a) and (f) (since recodified as C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 5-602, 5-612). Section 286(a)(1), as it was then written, proscribed possession with intent to distribute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>controlled dangerous substance. Section 286(f)(l)(ii) and (f)(3) provided that, if the substance was 448 grams or more of cocaine, then it was \u201cmandatory upon the court to impose no less than 5 years\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d with additional limitations on parole. Although Wadlow\u2019s indictment charged possession with intent to distribute \u201c \u2018over 448 grams of cocaine, in violation of Article 27, Section 286(a)(1),\u2019 \u201d it made no mention of subsection (f). <em>Wadlow, </em>335 Md. at 126, 642 A.2d 213 (quoting indictment). The <em>Wadlow </em>Court held that a sentence of four years imposed under Count 1 could not be increased to five years. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 642 A.2d 213. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 128-29, 642 A.2d 213:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">In Maryland, ... we have generally drawn a distinction between sentence enhancement provisions that depend upon prior conduct of the offender and those that depend upon the circumstances of the offense. In the former situation, involving recidivism, we have made it clear that determination of the requisite predicate facts is for the sentencing judge....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">In the latter case, however, where the legislature has prescribed different sentences for the same offense, depending upon a particular circumstance of the offense, we have held that the presence of that circumstance must be alleged in the charging document, and must be determined by the trier of fact applying the reasonable doubt standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABW\">Wadlow\u2019s conduct fell into the category in which the statute provided for a greater sentence based on the \u201cparticular circumstance\u201d of the amount of narcotics that the defendant possessed. <em>See id. </em>at 126, 642 A.2d 213. The Court concluded that \u201cwhen the State seeks the enhanced penalties provided by \u00a7 286(f) it must allege the necessary fact concerning the amount, and prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 642 A.2d 213. Yet, \u201cthe jury was not called upon to decide whether the amount of cocaine involved in the conviction under Count I was 448 grams or more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 642 A.2d 213. The Court noted that \u201cthe language of Count I\u201d mentioned the quantity, but \u201cthe body of the count and statute citation referred only to a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 286(a)(1),\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and the jury instructions provided: \u201c \u2018No specific quantity is required for you to find the intent to distribute. There is no specific amount below which the intent to distribute disappears and there is no specific amount above which the intent to distribute appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">With the cases discussed above in mind, we return to C.L. \u00a7 9-303. C.L. \u00a7 9\u2014303(c)(1) provides for a five-year maximum. But, under C.L. \u00a7 9\u2014303(c)(2), if \u201cthe official proceeding or report\u201d against which a defendant retaliated \u201crelates to a felonious violation of Title 5 of [the Criminal Law] article or the commission of a crime of violence as defined in [C.L.] \u00a7 14-101,\u201d the defendant may be sentenced to a maximum of twenty years. In the Criminal Information, appellant was charged with retaliating against Hicks \u201cfor reporting Drug Activity,\u201d a violation of Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article, and it referred specifically to C.L. \u00a7 9\u2014303(c)(2). Thus, the circumstance of drug activity was alleged in the Information. Therefore, there is no issue here, as there was in <em>Fisher, </em>of a defective pleading. <em>See Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 281-82 <em>&amp; </em>n. 19, 786 A.2d 706 (vacating sentence \u201cin view of the Maryland common law\u201d and remanding for resentencing where \u201cindictment did not allege the fact that the State needed to prove in order to enhance the penalty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Complaints of illegal drug activity are, however, \u201cthe functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348, because this is the basis on which appellant was exposed \u201cto a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483 n. 10, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Yet, the jury was not asked to determine whether the evidence proved those facts. Rather, it was only instructed that \u201cthe State must prove ... [that appellant retaliated] because the victim or witness either gave evidence in an official proceeding or reported a crime or delinquent act.\u201d Therefore, the jury returned a guilty verdict for \u201cretaliation,\u201d without deciding whether Hicks\u2019s complaints concerned drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 495, 120 S.Ct. 2348, where the sentence enhancement increased Apprendi\u2019s maximum sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tence from ten years to twenty years, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe differential here is unquestionably of constitutional significance.\u201d In this case, appellant\u2019s sentence quadrupled, from five years to twenty years, an increase which is also undoubtedly \u201cof constitutional significance.\u201d The matter of illegal drug activity was not merely a sentencing \u201cfactor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494 n. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Under <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, the question of whether Hicks\u2019s complaints related to drug activity had to be \u201csubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, before the judge could sentence appellant to the greater offense of retaliation for reporting drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">To be sure, the jury had ample evidence as to the alleged drug activity that Hicks perceived, and it heard Hicks\u2019s testimony that she was \u201creporting\u201d the drug dealers \u201cto the police.... \u201d Hicks further testified that she told appellant that she \u201chad something to say. Meaning I was going to call the police because I was known for around here to call the police.\u201d But, the jury was never asked to determine whether Hicks\u2019s complaints pertained to drug activity. Rather, the jury was merely told that the State had to prove that appellant \u201cintentionally harmed another or threatened to harm another, or damaged or destroyed property,\u201d and that appellant \u201cdid so with the intent of retaliating against the victim ... because the victim ... reported a crime or delinquent act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We conclude that the Due Process Clause required that the circumstances allowing for the enhanced penalty should have been \u201csubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. That did not occur. Therefore, we shall vacate the sentence for retaliation and remand for resentencing under C.L. \u00a7 9-303(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in excluding relevant evidence and limiting cross-examination that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>have impeached the credibility of the State\u2019s key witness.\u201d We pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As noted, prior to the presentation of evidence the State moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of a fire in Hicks\u2019s home in May 2005. The fire occurred a few days before a bullet went through Hicks\u2019s apartment window, and resulted in Hicks\u2019s temporary loss of custody of her children. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [T]he charges in this case are assault and handgun charges. They arise from an incident that occurred in November of '05, but they also relate to an incident that occurred in May of '05 in which ... a bullet went through the victim\u2019s window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">The State\u2019s theory is that this was done in retaliation for the victim calling on drug dealers that are outside her home, dealing drugs outside her home.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">THE COURT: So what does that have to do with a fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANC\">[PROSECUTOR]: It doesn\u2019t, Your Honor, which is why the State is asking that any testimony that the Defense wants to elicit about a fire be excluded. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s relevant to the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Defense counsel responded that \u201capproximately two days prior to the supposed[ ] shooting through the window ... there was a [grease] fire in Ms. Hicks\u2019 house.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel indicated that \u201calthough Ms. Hicks is going to deny the fact,\u201d appellant \u201ckicked the door in\u201d and rescued her two young children, who had been left unattended. Counsel claimed that this was relevant because Hicks \u201cwas blaming\u201d appellant for the fact that her children were temporarily removed from her care after the fire. He said: \u201cAnd that\u2019s sort of a motive for her not only to make this up, but to select my client as the person.\u201d In addition, he argued that it was relevant because \u201cit shows a lack of a motive, that somebody would go and save somebody\u2019s children in a burning house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>then supposedly shoot through their window a month later because of some sort of call into the police department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The court ruled: \u201cI am going to grant the State\u2019s Motion to Exclude the fire in the victim\u2019s home. However, I will allow the Defense to ask Ms. Hicks if the reason she\u2019s telling this situation is because she blames [appellant] for her children being taken away from her without allusion to the fire.\u201d The court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">You can\u2019t mention the fire. You can\u2019t mention the fact that you just said that your client ran into the house to rescue the children. But you can ask Ms. Hicks if she\u2019s telling, making this up, the motive for her saying this is because she blames Mr. Parker for her children being removed from the home. You have to first establish that the children were removed from the home, lay a foundation. But once you\u2019ve established the foundation, then you could ask if her motive for this, what the Defense alleges is her story, is because she believes that the Defendant is somehow responsible for the children being removed from her home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Hicks if her children were living with her in May 2005, when the gunshot pierced her window. She replied that they were not living with her from April 2005 until January 2006. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cNow why were your kids not with you?\u201d and \u201cWere you aware of the incident where [appellant] saved your children?\u201d But, the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objections. At the bench, the court admonished defense counsel, stating: \u201cI was very clear that this was not to come in this case.... You made the record and I ruled and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d The court then granted the State\u2019s motion to strike \u201cany question about any saving of any children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">On appeal, appellant argues: \u201cIt was the defense\u2019s theory of the case that Ms. Hicks\u2019 [sic] was lying at trial because she blamed Appellant for losing her children. The trial court precluded testimony about the fire that Appellant alleged gave rise to Ms. Hicks\u2019 motivation to testify falsely.\u201d According to appellant, \u201cdefense counsel should have been allowed to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>examine Ms. Hicks about the fire and her resulting bias against appellant,\u201d and \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s limitation on Appellant\u2019s cross-examination of the state\u2019s key witness impeded Appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Appellant posits: \u201cOne can hardly imagine a more traumatic event than losing custody of one\u2019s children. If Ms. Hicks truly blamed Appellant for this event, it is certainly conceivable that she may have falsely accused Appellant.\u201d He adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">The \u201cconstitutionally required threshold level of inquiry\u201d included inquiry into the fire that resulted in Ms. Hicks losing custody of her children. The jury was entitled to know the circumstances surrounding that fire, that Appellant saved her children, Ms. Hicks\u2019 subsequent feelings towards Appellant and how that might affect her decision to testify falsely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Without this evidence, argues appellant, the jury lacked \u201csufficient information to make a \u2018discriminating appraisal\u2019 of Ms. Hicks\u2019 possible motives for testifying falsely.\u201d (Quoting <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 194, 695 A.2d 184 (1997)). Claiming that the court \u201ceroded the purpose of cross-examination,\u201d Parker contends that \u201creversal is mandated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The State counters that \u201cthe trial court properly exercised its discretion in limiting Parker\u2019s cross-examination of the victim on unrelated matters.\u201d It contends that the \u201cjury was <em>not </em>\u2018entitled\u2019 to hear \u2018the circumstances surrounding that fire,\u2019 \u201d because the trial court \u201cproperly determine[d] that unsubstantiated claims about rescuing children from a fire were not relevant to whether Parker threatened Hicks for her calls to police six months later.\u201d Moreover, it maintains that appellant \u201cwas permitted to explore any bias the victim may have had against him; he simply chose not to.\u201d In this regard, the State points out that appellant \u201cdid not ask Hicks if she blamed Parker for the removal of her children. Thus, he did not attempt to establish the motive for false testimony!!,] which the court had expressly allowed in its pretrial ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Cross-examination is a \u201cright guaranteed by the common law.\u201d <em>Myer v.

According to appellant, Hicks concocted the story of assault for revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">During cross-examination, Parker established that Hicks\u2019s children did not live with her from April 2005 to January 2006. Moreover, the court permitted appellant \u201cto ask Ms. Hicks if the reason she\u2019s telling this situation is because she blames [appellant] for her children being taken away from her.\u201d Appellant claims, however, that \u201ca bald question\u201d as to Ms. Hicks\u2019 motive was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to \u201cflesh out the important details,\u201d and \u201clikely would have resulted in a denial that the jury may well have accepted at face value.\u201d We cannot speculate about the answer to a question that was not posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The court must use a \u201cbalancing test\u201d to avoid \u201cstray[ing] into collateral matters which would obscure the trial issues and lead to the factfinder\u2019s confusion.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307-08, 577 A.2d 356. Here, the court was entitled to conclude that the relevance of the fire was simply too attenuated, and that establishing a foundation for the evidence would have required inquiry into tangential matters (i.e., the fire, appellant\u2019s role in rescuing the children, Hicks\u2019s loss of custody of her children, Hicks\u2019s placement of blame on appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>and Hicks\u2019s retribution). We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in limiting appellant\u2019s inquiry so as to avoid a trial on collateral matters, and to avoid \u201cconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or ... undue delay, [or] waste of time.... \u201d Md. Rule 5-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At trial, the court addressed the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude testimony from Hicks regarding what defense counsel characterized as \u201cnumerous claims\u201d filed by Hicks \u201cagainst numerous different people,\u201d which were false and resulted in stets or nolle prosequis. Claiming that the evidence was relevant, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[I]t goes towards [showing] that she makes claims against people that are false. And if through cross examination she says she doesn\u2019t do that, then I\u2019d like to hear the circumstances under which every one of these cases that she\u2019s brought have been assaults, harassments, ex partes. Why all of those have been either been [sic] nolle prossequied or put on the stet docket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The court ruled: \u201cI\u2019m going to grant the State\u2019s Motion to Exclude that. You won\u2019t be allowed to explore any\u2014if you can demonstrate that she\u2019s lied about something, that\u2019s f\u00edne, but whether she filed complaints with the police department or not is not relevant and a collateral issue in this Court\u2019s regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">During trial, appellant\u2019s counsel began to query Hicks about whether she had brought charges against a specific individual. The court asked counsel to approach the bench, at which point the prosecutor objected \u201cto this line of questioning.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">THE COURT: [Appellant\u2019s counsel], we\u2019ve already been through\u2014that\u2019s why we have motions in limine so we can resolve this.

Unless you can demonstrate that she\u2019s not telling the truth....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Appellant argues that \u201cdefense counsel should have been allowed to cross-examine Ms. Hicks about false police reports that she filed.\u201d He characterizes evidence of unfounded charges as a \u201chighly relevant topic that would have shed light on Ms. Hicks\u2019 credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">According to the State, \u201cParker\u2019s appellate contentions are ... handicapped by the fact that not only is there no support in the record for his claims, but they are in fact demonstrably false.\u201d It continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Parker characterizes the evidence as proof of \u2018false police reports.\u2019 ... The record reflects, however, that at best, what Parker was attempting to offer was proof of reports to the police that did not result in convictions. That is a far cry from proof of a false report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The State argues: \u201cPatently, neither a stet nor a nolle prosequi carries any implication whatsoever that the underlying charges are \u2018false reports.\u2019 ... Neither involves any factual finding on the merits of the charges whatsoever.\u201d Therefore, the State maintains that cross-examination regarding Hicks\u2019s complaints would not have \u201chad any bearing whatsoever on her general character for truthfulness.... \u201d In the State\u2019s view, \u201cParker\u2019s demand that he be allowed free rein to cross-examine Hicks on \u2018every one\u2019 of her prior complaints to see why the prosecutor chose to stet or nolle pros the case fails virtually every test to be applied for the admission of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Rule 5-608(b) is pertinent. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">Rule 5-608. Evidence of character of witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>(b) Impeachment by examination regarding witness\u2019s own prior conduct not resulting in convictions. The court may permit any witness to be examined regarding the witness\u2019s own prior conduct that did not result in a conviction but that the court finds probative of a character trait of untruthfulness. Upon objection, however, the court may permit the inquiry only if the questioner, outside the hearing of the jury, establishes a reasonable factual basis for asserting that the conduct of the witness occurred. The conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The flaw in appellant\u2019s position is that he did not establish that Hicks filed \u201cfalse\u201d police reports. <em>See generally </em>C.L. \u00a7 9-501(a) (knowingly making false report is a misdemeanor). As the State indicates, Parker \u201cwas attempting to offer ... proof of reports to the police that did not result in convictions.\u201d However, neither a \u201cstet\u201d nor a nolle pros is tantamount to a false report. <em>See LaFaivre v. State, </em>338 Md. 151, 155-58, 656 A.2d 789 (1995). Indeed, \u201cwhere charges have been stetted, the accused remains liable to be proceeded against under the same charging document....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 656 A.2d 789. The <em>LaFaivre </em>Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201c[W]hile a nolle prosequi discharges the defendant on the charging document or count which was nolle prossed, and while it is a bar to any further prosecution under <em>that </em>charging document or count, a nolle prosequi is <em>not </em>an acquittal or pardon of the underlying offense and does not preclude a prosecution for the same offense under a different charging document or different count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 656 A.2d 789 (quoting <em>Ward v. State, </em>290 Md. 76, 84, 427 A.2d 1008 (1981)) (emphasis in <em>LaFaivre).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Accordingly, these dispositions did not establish the falsity of Hicks\u2019s complaints. Without a basis for determining that Hicks\u2019s complaints were false, there was no evidence of her misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\"><em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 468 A.2d 319 (1983), on which appellant relies, is inapposite. Cox was tried for first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>rape; he claimed he was not the assailant. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 468 A.2d 319. There, as here, the victim\u2019s identification of the assailant was the only direct evidence establishing the identity of the assailant. <em>See id. </em>at 177, 468 A.2d 319. On cross-examination, in an attempt to establish that the victim was lying, Cox sought to question the victim about her testimony at the trial of a different defendant. <em>Id. </em>At that earlier trial, the victim testified initially that the accused criminally assaulted her, but she recanted when she was cross-examined, \u201c \u2018ad-mitt[ing] that she did not tell the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting defense counsel\u2019s proffer). The trial court precluded the proffered cross-examination, but the Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 468 A.2d 319. It remarked: \u201cWe have ... been steadfast in holding that <em>mere accusations </em>of crime or misconduct may not be used to impeach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 468 A.2d 319 (emphasis added). But, the Court observed that, in the case before it, \u201cthe witness had actually lied <em>imder oath </em>in a similar situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 468 A.2d 319 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Unlike <em>Cox, </em>in which the witness \u201crecanted the charge during cross-examination,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 177, 468 A.2d 319, there was no evidence that Hicks ever recanted as to any complaints she reported to the police. And, as we have said, the resolution of charges through stets and nolle prosequis did not establish the falsity of Hicks\u2019s complaints. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by precluding appellant from impeaching Hicks with respect to her prior complaints to the police concerning unrelated events. As the State puts it, \u201cEven if there was some connection between a stetted assault charge and Hicks\u2019 credibility, it would be so tenuous that the trial court was perfectly within its discretion to exclude it\u201d under Md. Rule 5M02. Moreover, we agree with the State that \u201cHicks is not competent to speak for the prosecutorial decisions of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Appellant contends: \u201cOfficer [Troy] Jackson should have been allowed to testify that in his opinion Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Hicks was a liar.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Again, we pause to review additional facts relevant to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The State moved <em>in limine </em>to bar evidence from the police as to phone calls made by Hicks to the police. The prosecutor explained that \u201cthe State is going to present testimony that Ms. Hicks made several phone calls to the police. I\u2019m not attempting to exclude that. What I believe the Defense is also going to attempt to do is indicate' that those phone calls were unfounded and I don\u2019t believe Defense has proper foundation testimony [for] that.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">THE COURT: What testimony are you going to try to elicit from the State with regard to phone calls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If Ms. Hicks has made an exorbitant amount of phone calls ...

I\u2019m going to\u2014grant the request to exclude any references as to how many complaints Ms. Hicks makes to the police department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>At trial, defense counsel sought to call Officer Troy Jackson as a character witness. However, Jackson did not appear in court, even though he had been \u201csummonsed.\u201d When Jackson did not appear, defense counsel did not mention that he wanted to enforce the subpoena. Instead, he proffered that the officer would testify that he responded to Hicks\u2019s home the day after the fire in May 2005, when Hicks claimed appellant had assaulted her. But, the officer did not \u201cgrant any sort of charges against [appellant]. He has been called out there numerous times for the same.... And every time he has determined that there was not a valid charge here.... \u201d According to defense counsel, Jackson \u201cwould say that [Hicks] brings unfounded charges against people. That she tries to lie on people is what he says.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney added: \u201cBecause every time he goes out there and talks to all the witnesses whenever she makes an allegation, there\u2019s either no witnesses at all or there\u2019s witnesses saying exactly the opposite and no other evidence showing anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Furthermore, she brought an IUD [sic] report, at least one against him, for not arresting people when she told him to arrest people....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\">THE COURT: And what possible relevance does that have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Again, it goes towards her credibility again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re saying instead of it being your client\u2019s word against Ms. Hicks, now you\u2019re saying it\u2019s Officer Jackson\u2019s word against Ms. Hicks in a totally unrelated incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Officer Jackson has had pri- or experience with Ms. Hicks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">THE COURT: All right. Well we\u2019re not waiting for Officer Jackson because I wouldn\u2019t let him get on the stand if that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to say anyway.... His opinion about who\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>truthfulness [sic] is not appropriate. That\u2019s what jury\u2019s [sic] are for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Appellant contends that \u201cOfficer Jackson\u2019s testimony fell squarely within the realm of Md. Rule 5\u2014608(a)(1)(B),\u201d pertaining to impeachment by a character witness. In his view, \u201cOfficer Jackson should have been allowed, pursuant to Md. Rule 5\u2014608(a)(3)(B) to explain the reasonable basis for his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The State maintains that \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the proffered testimony of the police officer lacked an adequate foundation to be admissible.\u201d Further, the State contends that \u201c[t]he proffer failed to prove that Officer Jackson had a reasonable basis for his opinion regarding Hicks\u2019s truthfulness.\u201d It adds: \u201c[W]hatever probative value the testimony may have had was outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, or misleading the jury.\u201d The State also asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The record showed, at best, that the police could not find corroboration for some of Hicks\u2019s complaints,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that for whatever reason, her complaints did not result in criminal trials. This by no means indicates that Hicks was making a false report in the prior cases, let alone in the instant case, but there was a legitimate risk that the jury might interpret it so; indeed, this was Parker\u2019s goal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In addition, the State points out that appellant did not ask the court to enforce the subpoena to compel Officer Jackson\u2019s presence. Because Jackson did not appear, it posits that any error in excluding his testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Arguably, appellant\u2019s claim is not preserved. This is because Officer Jackson did not appear at trial, and appellant never sought to compel his presence by enforcing the subpoena through a request for a body attachment. <em>See Whack v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 107, 118-19, 615 A.2d 1226 (1992) (\u201c[I]t is the responsibility of the court to issue a body attachment <em>(upon request) </em>where a duly summoned witness fails to appear.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>330 Md. 155, 622 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>1196 (1993). <em>Cf.

Given that Jackson did not appear, and appellant never sought a body attachment for him, Jackson could not have testified in accordance with the proffer of defense counsel, regardless of the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Even assuming that the issue is preserved, appellant would not prevail.

Furthermore, to admit Jackson\u2019s opinion testimony that Hicks was untruthful, the court first would have had to determine, as a \u201cthreshold\u201d matter, that there was \u201can adequate basis\u201d for Jackson\u2019s personal opinion. <em>Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. 445, 453, 397 A.2d 600 (1979); <em>see also Jensen v. State, </em>355 Md. 692, 701-02, 736 A.2d 307 (1999). The fact that suspects disappeared by the time Officer Jackson responded to Hicks\u2019s calls did not establish the falsity of Hicks\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting Hicks\u2019s statement that the detective \u201c \u2018took me back down to the police station and that\u2019s when he put me in a hotel, which is considered as witness protection.\u2019 \u201d Again, additional facts are relevant to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Hicks testified that a detective drove her around the neighborhood \u201cin an unmarked car and he said that they won\u2019t be able to see me. Because I told him I was scared and I didn\u2019t want to go back.\u201d She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">And he asked me did I see they guy who made the statement that he was going to shoot through my window. I told him no I didn\u2019t see him. He took me back down to the police station and that\u2019s when he put me in a hotel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>which is considered as witness protection. And told me, don\u2019t go back around the neighborhood. If I had to go home for anything to call\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">[HICKS]: To call them and they would issue a patrol car to escort me to my house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel asked Hicks if the May 2005 shooting incident \u201cwas ... at the time that you said you were put into witness protection,\u201d and \u201cwho was the officer that put you into witness protection?\u201d Hicks explained that Detective Stambaugh placed her in witness protection after the November 2005 incident.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A03\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now how soon after this supposed [November 2005] incident did you talk with Detective Stambaugh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">[HICKS]: I\u2019ll say when the police arrived, maybe something[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And was it at that point that you said you were put into witness protection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">[HICKS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Appellant argues that, \u201ceven if this evidence was minimally relevant, its probative value was far outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d According to appellant, witness protection is \u201ca fairly uncommon phenomenon\u201d and reference to it \u201cwas highly likely to inflame the passions of the jury.\u201d Moreover, he asserts that \u201cthe fact that the police placed Ms. Hicks\u2019 [sic] in witness protection has no bearing on whether the Appellant threatened Ms. Hicks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">The State counters that this issue is not preserved because appellant \u201cfailed to note a timely objection to the victim\u2019s remark.\u201d It maintains: \u201cNeither the State nor this Court can determine from this record which part of Hicks\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>was specifically being \u25a0 objected to by Parker.\u201d The State adds: \u201cWhat is clear is that Parker did not object immediately after the \u2018hotel\u2019 comment, but instead waited until Hicks had related comments supposedly made to her by police,\u201d such that the court could have thought he made a hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Alternatively, the State contends that the evidence was relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. In its view, the statement was relevant to prove that Hicks was in fear, an element of assault. Further, the State claims that \u201cin every case where the police arrest a defendant, it demonstrates that the police placed some credence in the accusations of a witness. That the police undertook action in light of a victim\u2019s complaints cannot be held to be unfairly prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Finally, the State maintains that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To support its view, the State insists that \u201cthere is nd possibility that the one-time use of the words \u2018witness protection\u2019 contributed to the verdict against Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that appellant\u2019s objection was timely, his claim is unavailing. Hicks\u2019s statement regarding witness protection was relevant because it helped establish fear, an element of assault under one of its common law definitions. <em>See Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. 447, 458-59, 488 A.2d 962 (1985); <em>see also </em>C.L. \u00a7 3-201 (assault defined at common law). As the State remarked in its brief, \u201cthe fact that Hicks felt so frightened that she was given alternative living quarters is probative of the element of fear, necessary to the State\u2019s case.\u201d To be sure, this was fear expressed after the fact. But, the jury could have concluded that Hicks would not have experienced fear after the incident if the incident itself had not frightened her as it was occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Relevant evidence should be excluded if its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. ...\u201d Md. Rule 5\u2014403; <em>see Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 705, 824 A.2d 123 (2003); <em>Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 19, 811 A.2d 282 (2002). In <em>Weiner v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 548, 555, 464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>A.2d 1096 (1983), <em>aff'd, </em>302 Md. 550, 489 A.2d 1119 (1985), we clarified that \u201cprejudice in this context\u201d means \u201can undue tendency to persuade the jury to decide the case on an improper basis, usually an emotional one.\u201d In our view, Hicks\u2019s testimony was not unfairly prejudicial. As the State notes, there is no evidence in the record that witness protection is \u201cfairly uncommon,\u201d as appellant insists, such that a reference to it would inflame the jury\u2019s emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement. A ruling on relevance is \u201cquintessentially\u201d within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Best v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 241, 259, 556 A.2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 70, 562 A.2d 718 (1989); <em>see Grandison v.
