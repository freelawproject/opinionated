Mr. Elliott was subsequently indicted on a variety of charges, including attempted first-degree murder of Ms. McCullough. Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in July 2007, appellant was convicted of attempted second-degree murder, in violation of Md.Code (2002, 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 2-206 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d); first-degree burglary, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 6-202; and first-degree assault, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 3-202. The court sentenced appellant to a total term of fifty years\u2019 incarceration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>This appeal followed. Appellant poses four questions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u25a0which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">1. Did the trial court err in empaneling the jury after the State admitted that it had exercised peremptory challenges on the impermissible basis of gender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">2. Did the trial court err in refusing to continue the trial to remedy the prejudice arising from the State\u2019s last-minute and incomplete production of evidence required to be disclosed under Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">3. Did the trial court err in refusing to dismiss the indictment or afford other relief to remedy the State\u2019s bad-faith failure to preserve evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">4. Did the trial court err in refusing to clarify the jury\u2019s confusion about the intent requirement of attempted murder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the State improperly exercised its peremptory challenges. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial. Accordingly, we decline to address Questions Two and Four, as they are not likely to recur. For the benefit of the parties and the court, however, we shall address the third question.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Elliott and McCullough were married in August 2004. In June 2005, after the parties had already separated, McCul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>lough purchased a house in Germantown. About \u201ctwo or three months\u201d later, McCullough told Elliott that he could \u201cstay\u201d at her house until he could \u201cget [himjself together.\u201d He later refused to leave. Accordingly, on January 3, 2006, McCullough gave Elliott thirty days\u2019 notice to vacate her house. On January 27, she obtained a temporary protective order against Elliott because he was volatile, abusive, and had threatened to kill her. She obtained a final protective order on February 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">At around 7:17 a.m. on Sunday, February 5, 2006, Elliott left a voice message for McCullough, stating that he needed to talk to her. McCullough testified that she \u201cgot out of the bed\u201d at around 8 a.m. that morning. She soon heard banging coming from downstairs; \u201cimmediately\u201d she \u201cknew\u201d it was Elliott. She retreated to the bathroom, but Elliott \u201ckicked through the door\u201d and started stabbing her. McCullough screamed, hoping the neighbors would hear her. With her hand, she tried to block the knife. Nevertheless, Elliott stabbed her hand and then stabbed her wrist, where the knife was stuck until Elliott yanked it free. Elliott also stabbed McCullough in the chest. Blood was everywhere.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>McCullough testified that when she \u201cwoke up\u201d the knife was still in her chest. She pulled it out and slid to the bottom of the stairs, where she was able to reach her cell phone. She called 911, and told the dispatcher she had been stabbed. But, McCullough did not recall whether she mentioned that it was her husband who had stabbed her. She lay on the floor, which was covered in glass, and was in and out of consciousness. When the police arrived, McCullough identified Elliott as the person who had stabbed her. She also indicated that he had been wearing a blue or black crew neck shirt, a coat, boots, and \u201ca New York hat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The prosecutor asked: \u201cWho is the person who did this to you?\u201d McCullough responded: \u201cAndre Elliott.\u201d She also identified the knife used during the attack and a New York Yankees hat recovered from appellant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On cross-examination, McCullough confirmed that \u201c[t]here was a diary that was in [her] apartment that was taken ... [a]nd sometime after the incident ... given back.\u201d She also agreed that she received \u201ca copy or copies of the diary\u201d from Detective Ana Erazo, and was not instructed to preserve the material. McCullough subsequently \u201cdiscarded the diary\u201d and \u201cshredded the copies.... \u201d Defense counsel did not ask about the contents of the diary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Shortly after 8 a.m. on February 5, 2006, Patrol Officer John Chucoski responded to McCullough\u2019s 911 call. The front door of the house was locked, but some of the windows were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>shattered. The police found McCullough \u201clying in a pool of blood. There was large amounts of blood on her, on the ground below her and coming down the stairs and on the walls.\u201d Officer Chucoski noted that there was also blood in the bedroom, where a knife was found on the floor. He described McCullough as upset and in pain. Another officer asked McCullough who assaulted her, and she responded that \u201cit was her husband, Andre Elliott.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Forensic Specialist Collette Sarns-Gaunt of the Montgomery County Police Department Forensic Services Section collected evidence from the house, including a kitchen knife, approximately eight inches long, found in the master bedroom, and \u201ca diary or a journal located ... next to the bed .... in the master bedroom.\u201d Sarns-Gaunt testified that she took the diary because \u201cdiaries usually speak to the person\u2019s state of mind.\u201d Moreover, she explained that she believed she \u201chad arrived on what was going to become a homicide,\u201d and \u201cfelt that [the diary] was important if the victim did not survive.\u201d She read parts of the diary and gave a copy of it to the lead investigator, Detective Erazo. Sarns-Gaunt also collected \u201ca bathrobe with suspected blood,\u201d as well as swabs, of blood from the inside of the front door and where the victim lay just inside the front door. She explained that she \u201cswab[s] blood mostly because blood is not usually present, so it seems out of place----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Ms. Sarns-Gaunt also assisted in searching Elliott\u2019s car. Among other items, the police seized a New York Yankees hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Detective Kenneth Halter testified about the message left on Ms. McCullough\u2019s voice mail at 7:17 a.m. on February 5, 2006. He claimed he was familiar with Elliott\u2019s voice, and identified the voice on the message as Elliott\u2019s. After the attack, he played the message for Ms. McCullough; she identified Elliott\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Forensic Specialist Kimberly Clements testified that the knife found in the victim\u2019s bedroom was examined for fingerprints; no latent prints of value were found. Forensic Biolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>gist Erin Farr testified that the DNA profiles from the knife blade and the handle matched McCullough\u2019s DNA, not Elliott\u2019s DNA. She explained that the DNA from the blood on the knife could \u201cmask or overpower ... the DNA from something of a lesser amount,\u201d i.e., the testing would only detect the DNA from the blood without detecting \u201csome other kind of DNA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">After the State rested, appellant moved \u201cfor a judgment of acquittal on the first degree attempted murder charge\u201d and \u201csecond degree, lesser included attempted murder.\u201d He alleged that the evidence of premeditation and specific intent to kill was insufficient for those charges, and submitted as to the other counts. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Appellant called Detective Ana Erazo, who worked for the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s Family Crimes Division and was the lead detective on the case. She stated that the blood on the diary was not tested for Elliott\u2019s DNA. Detective Erazo received two copies of the diary from Ms. Sarns-Gaunt, but she did not read the diary.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Once the decision was made to return the diary to McCullough, Detective Erazo retrieved the original and returned it to the victim on March 6, 2006. Erazo returned the copies to McCullough on April 27, 2006. Detective Erazo did not direct Ms. McCullough to preserve either the diary or the copies. She testified that her understanding of the significance of the diary was that it may have been useful if Ms. McCullough had not survived; because she survived, the diary was no longer needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And in investigations in the Family Crime[s] Division do you sometimes obtain copies of or originals of victim diaries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-12\">[ERAZO]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Are you aware whether there\u2019s a standard practice in the Family Crimes Division as to what to do when you do obtain a copy of a victim diary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZR\">[ERAZO]: No.... We don\u2019t ... have that I\u2019m aware of in my unit within the Family Crimes. You\u2019ve got to understand the Family Crimes has several different sections. And they\u2019re all very different crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Erazo testified that she did not discuss the diary with McCullough. Although the diary \u201ccame up during one of the meetings that we had within my division with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d no one informed her of its contents. And, as noted, Erazo claimed that she \u201cdidn\u2019t read it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Erazo about her \u201cunderstanding of the significance of the journal.\u201d The detective replied: \u201cWe thought the victim was going to die and that would\u2019ve been a good piece of evidence to have.\u201d She maintained that the State returned the diary \u201c[b]ecause the victim ... survived.\u201d The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHG\">[PROSECUTOR]: [Y]ou need to investigate a case with a mind towards the State prosecuting its case if the victim does not want to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">[ERAZO]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And forensic evidence can be important in a case to show what happened, especially if the victim does not testify, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">[ERAZO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: And that could include evidence of a journal [or] DNA evidence if the victim does not testify, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">[ERAZO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">On redirect, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Erazo whether the State had a meeting on March 22, 2006, \u201cto consider what evidence to use if there was no victim cooperation.\u201d Erazo responded in the affirmative. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now you\u2019d agree with me that the reason that victim diaries can be important for example in homicide cases is because it might give you some leads about the crime that was committed, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGx\">[ERAZO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It might tell you who did it, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">[ERAZO]: In other cases, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Appellant did not testify. The defense rested and \u201crenewed] it\u2019s [sic] motion for judgment ... for the reasons previously stated and on the evidence submitted.\u201d The court again denied the Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">With regard to jury instructions, the court denied appellant\u2019s request for a spoliation instruction, pointing out that defense counsel never asked McCullough what she wrote in the diary, and observing that \u201cthere really isn\u2019t any evidence of spoiliation [sic] in this case.\u201d Defense counsel responded that the blood spatter on the diary was \u201can additional reason ... why we think that the spoiliation [sic] instruction ought to be given.\u201d The court ruled: \u201cWell, you\u2019re not going to get it for that reason. There was blood everywhere in this case and a substantial amount of it was tested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In closing argument, defense counsel pointed out inconsistencies between McCullough\u2019s testimony and that of other witnesses, and argued: \u201cShe can\u2019t keep it straight, ladies and gentlemen, and those are the symptoms of a mistaken witness that\u2019s not telling the truth. She\u2019s wrong.\u201d Moreover, he noted that no DNA evidence linked appellant to the crime. According to defense counsel, it was \u201ccommon sense in a case like this you would read the diary of a victim,\u201d yet the State had returned the diary and copies of it to McCullough, who \u201cdiscarded\u201d the diary and \u201cdestroyed\u201d the copies. He contended that the State\u2019s \u201cexplanation for why they returned this diary doesn\u2019t hold water. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Appellant contends that the \u201ccourt erred by failing to remedy the constitutional violations arising from the State\u2019s gender-based exercise of its challenges.\u201d As Elliott observes, the State \u201cexercised the first six of seven strikes against men,\u201d and, in total, \u201cexercised eight of its nine peremptory strikes (88.8%) against men.... \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant twice objected to the State\u2019s peremptory challenges against men. Relying on <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and its progeny, he argues: \u201cThe trial court erred in empaneling a jury over objection after the State\u2019s admitted exercise of peremptory challenges on the impermissible basis of gender.\u201d Before reviewing the parties\u2019 contentions in detail, we pause to review what transpired below with respect to jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">After the State had exercised seven of its ten allotted strikes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the following ensued at the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I\u2019m not certain, but I believe the State used six of its seven ... strikes on men.... [T]he issue I\u2019m raising is whether they\u2019ve used a disproportionate number of those strikes on men. I believe it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>six out of seven but I would need to consult the official records. I just don\u2019t want to waive the issue, Your Honor. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">THE COURT: Very well. I\u2019ll consider that an objection. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Twelve jurors and two alternates were seated. The following colloquy transpired at the bench, before the jury was sworn:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to preserve the issue of using strikes on men ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">THE COURT: Is there any specific reason[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I believe they used all but one of their strikes on men. 1 would have to look at my notes to verify that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019d actually like to respond to that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av7\">THE COURT: Yes, Go ahead, Madam State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL-\">[PROSECUTOR]: First of all, they have to show a pattern of discrimination and they haven\u2019t. And I would also like to say that they used most of their strikes on women[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and then when we started using our strikes, <em>we had a panel of men and felt the need to balance out the jury. So if we did use more strikes on men, it would be because we wanted a balanced jury, ivhich I believe we have. </em>I guess it\u2019s more men than women on the jury now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">THE COURT: Yes. Okay. Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">THE COURT: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>According to appellant, the State \u201cproffer[ed] a patently gender-based explanation for its strikes against men\u201d and \u201cadmitted that it was striking men <em>because they were men\u201d </em>which \u201cwas <em>not </em>gender-neutral, as required by <em>Batson\u201d </em>He argues that by its \u201cadmitted exercise of peremptory challenges on the impermissible basis of gender .... \u2022 the State violated [the] constitutional mandates\u201d of the United States Constitution and Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Pointing to \u201c[t]he State\u2019s unfounded suggestion that defense counsel exercised gender-based strikes,\u201d appellant notes that \u201cthe State never raised a <em>Batson </em>objection.\u201d Moreover, he characterizes as \u201castounding\u201d the \u201cState\u2019s suggestion that one party\u2019s constitutional violation justifies another party\u2019s constitutional violation.... \u201d In his view, the State\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d to create a gender-balanced jury \u201cdoes not cure\u201d the State\u2019s <em>Batson </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Appellant posits that \u201c[t]he appropriate remedy for the State\u2019s <em>Batson </em>violation\u201d is to \u201cset aside his conviction.\u201d In his view, \u201ca limited remand to determine whether a permissible rationale for the strikes existed is not appropriate,\u201d because there is no question whether the State had a gender-neutral rationale; \u201cthe State admitted that its peremptory strikes were gender-based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The State counters that \u201cElliott failed to perfect his challenge to the State\u2019s use of peremptory strikes and he also acquiesced to the trial court\u2019s empaneling the jury without having ruled as to each challenged juror.\u201d Elaborating, the State observes that, \u201cafter the State responded, during the second exchange, to Elliott\u2019s stated belief that \u2018[the State] used all but one of [its] strikes on men,\u2019 Elliott did nothing but say thank you to the judge.\u201d In its view, appellant failed to ensure \u201cthat the trial court considered his objection under the <em>Batson </em>three-part test as to each challenged juror. Elliott, in effect, acquiesced to the court\u2019s tacit action to overrule his numbers objection and has no basis for appealing those actions now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Alternatively, the State claims that \u201cthe remedy of granting a new trial is not warranted when a limited remand would permit the trial court to conduct a proper hearing on the parties\u2019 respective claims of gender discrimination in the use of peremptory strikes.\u201d According to the State: \u201cEach party should be required to show, as to each challenged juror, their respective prima facie case of alleged gender discrimination in juror selection,\u201d and \u201cthe State should be permitted to articulate its reasons for striking a juror.... \u201d In its view, \u201ca limited remand would permit the trial court an opportunity to consider fully and properly, under the three-part test, the objection raised as to each challenged juror after the other (or striking) party has articulated its basis for exercising a strike against the juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Further, the State argues that even though it \u201cstated a preference for a balanced jury, the State should be permitted the opportunity to demonstrate to the trial court whether it had legitimate permissible reasons for striking a particular juror.\u201d In this regard, the State maintains that if it struck a juror \u201cfor both permissible and impermissible reasons it would be up to the trial court to determine if the strike was appropriate or not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In his reply, appellant insists that he preserved his <em>Batson </em>challenge because \u201cthe defense objected twice on <em>Batson </em>grounds, and ... the trial court twice considered, and twice rejected, the challenge.\u201d He reiterates that his objection to the State\u2019s exercise of its nine strikes \u201cestablished a prima facie case because it demonstrated a pattern sufficient to support an inference of discrimination,\u201d in violation of federal and State law. Moreover, he argues that because \u201cthe State volunteered its explanation\u201d for striking jurors, \u201cthe question whether a prima facie case of impermissible motivation has been established was moot.\u201d In that circumstance, argues appellant, \u201cthe defense no longer needed to prove that the State\u2019s strikes were gender-based once the State admitted that to be true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>In addition, referring to defense counsel\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d remark, appellant claims that, \u201cwhen defense counsel objects and is heard on a jury-based challenge, ultimate acceptance of or acquiescence to the empaneling of the jury does not result in waiver.\u201d He maintains that \u201ccounsel\u2019s \u2018thank you\u2019 merely indicated counsel\u2019s obedience to the court\u2019s overruling of the <em>Batson </em>objection.\u201d In the alternative, he asks this Court to \u201cexercise its discretion to review the <em>Batson </em>challenge for plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Preliminarily, we are satisfied that there is no merit to the State\u2019s contention that appellant failed to preserve his <em>Batson </em>challenge. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Maryland Rule 4-323(c), governing objections to nonevidentiary rulings, provides, in part: \u201cFor purposes of ... appeal of any ... ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d Here, the record reflects that appellant twice objected on <em>Batson </em>grounds, and the trial court twice rejected his challenge. Notably, \u201c[a] <em>Batson </em>objection is timely if the defendant makes it no later than when the last juror has been seated and before the jury has been sworn.\u201d <em>Stanley and Trice v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 69, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988). That is precisely what occurred here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We also reject the State\u2019s claim of waiver by acquiescence. First, as appellant points out, \u201c[t]he suggestion that counsel risks waiving objections by maintaining a courteous and professional dialogue with the court is at odds with the legal profession\u2019s standards of conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rules of Profl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Conduct, Preamble \u00a7 9 (lawyer must \u201czealously ... protect and pursue a client\u2019s legitimate interests ... while maintaining a professional, courteous and civil attitude toward all persons involved in the legal system\u201d). Second, although defense counsel thanked the court after it heard argument on the State\u2019s use of its jury strikes, defense counsel\u2019s response \u201c Vas merely obedient to the court\u2019s ruling and obviously [was] not a withdrawal of the prior <em>[Batson] </em>objection. ...\u2019\u201d <em>Ingoglia v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 659, 664, 651 A.2d 409 (1995) (concluding that \u201cacceptance\u201d of venire panel did not waive earlier challenge to court\u2019s refusal to pose a particular voir dire question) (citation omitted); <em>see Miles v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 360, 377, 594 A.2d 1208 (concluding that defense counsel\u2019s statement, \u201c \u2018my client and I are satisfied with the selection process,\u2019 \u201d did not waive prior objections regarding voir dire, <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 94, 599 A.2d 447 (1991)). Notably, in contrast to <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 618, 667 A.2d 876 (1995), in which the defendant\u2019s \u201cattorney said that the second jury panel was \u2018acceptable,\u2019 \u201d defense counsel did not affirmatively represent that the jury was acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">We turn to the merits. In the landmark case of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), the Supreme Court examined peremptory challenges and held that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race[.]\u201d To the contrary, a \u201cdefendant [has] the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to non-discriminatory criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85-86, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The underlying purpose of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny is to protect the parties\u2019 right to a fair trial; the venire person\u2019s right not to be excluded on an impermissible, discriminatory basis; and to preserve public confidence in the judicial system. <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 404, 406-09, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In <em>Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993), the Court of Appeals extended the rationale of <em>Batson </em>to sex-based peremptory strikes as a matter of State constitutional law. It said, <em>id. </em>at 270, 623 A.2d 648:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">The equality of rights under law, without regard to gender, bestowed by Art. 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, flowing through the equal protection guarantees of Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>467[476] U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), prohibits the State in a criminal prosecution from using peremptory challenges so as to exclude a person from service as a juror because of that person\u2019s sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Subsequently, in <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994), the Supreme Court reached the same result. It determined that the Equal Protection clause \u201cforbids peremptory challenges on the basis of gender,\u201d because \u201cgender, like race, is an unconstitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In evaluating a claim that peremptory challenges were exercised in an impermissibly discriminatory manner, trial courts must follow a three-step process. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 328-29, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995); <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991); <em>Parker v. State, </em>365 Md. 299, 308, 778 A.2d 1096 (2001); <em>Whittlesey v.

The Court explained in <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 625-26, 667 A.2d 876 (some citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>First, the complaining party has the burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the other party has exercised its peremptory challenges on an impermissibly discriminatory basis, such as race or gender....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">Second, once the trial court has determined that the party complaining about the use of peremptory challenges has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden [of production] shifts to the party exercising the peremptory challenges to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case by offering race-neutral explanations for challenging the excluded jurors. The \u201cexplanation must be neutral, related to the case to be tried, clear and reasonably specific, and legitimate.\u201d <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 78, 542 A.2d 1267, 1280 (1988). The reason offered need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. \u201cAt this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the ... explanation.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395, 406 (1991). It is insufficient, however, for the party making the peremptory challenges to \u201cmerely deny[ ] that he had a discriminatory motive or ... merely affirm[ ] his good faith.\u201d <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>[514 U.S. at 769,] 115 S.Ct. at 1771.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">Finally, the trial court must \u201cdetermine[ ] whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 768,] 115 S.Ct. at 1771. This includes allowing the complaining party an opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons given for the peremptory challenges are pretextual or have a discriminatory impact. It is at this stage \u201cthat the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant....\u201d <em>[Id.] </em>\u201cAt that stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbV\"> As noted, the first step requires the party claiming discrimination in the jury selection process to make \u201ca prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The \u201c[r]elevant circumstances that \u2018might give rise to or support or refute\u2019 such showing include \u2018a \u201cpattern\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>strikes against ... jurors [of the cognizable group] in the particular venire....\u201d\u2019 <em>Mejia v. State, </em>328 Md. 522, 533, 616 A.2d 356 (1992) (citation omitted). The fact that the persons struck are members of a cognizable group may be sufficient for a <em>prima facie </em>case, depending on \u201chow, if at all, the State responded to the proffer or assertion\u201d that the persons struck were members of that group. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 616 A.2d. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Once the party challenging the use of peremptory strikes makes the requisite <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden shifts in the second step to the striking party to articulate a neutral explanation for the exercise of the strikes. <em>Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 767, 115 S.Ct. 1769. Although \u201ceach strike,\u201d and the reason given for it, \u201cmust be examined in light of the circumstances under which it was exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes,\u201d <em>Chew v. State, </em>317 Md. 233, 245, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989), the Fourth Circuit has explained that <em>\u201cBatson </em>... does not require <em>individualized </em>explanations for peremptory strikes.... [A] court may ... find that the prosecutor has complied with <em>Batson </em>based on an overall explanation that is found satisfactory as to each of the challenged strikes.\u201d <em>Evans v. Smith, </em>220 F.3d 306, 314 (4th Cir.2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The third step \u201cincludes allowing the complaining party an opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons given for the peremptory challenges are pretextual or have a discriminatory impact.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 626, 667 A.2d 876; <em>see Parker, </em>365 Md. at 309, 778 A.2d 1096. \u201cmile the complaining party [bears] the ... burden of proving unlawful discrimination,\u201d the trial court makes the ultimate determination as to whether the stated reasons were pretexts for discrimination. <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 626-27, 667 A.2d 876. Because the trial court\u2019s assessment of a <em>Batson </em>claim is factually intensive, we defer to its factual determination. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 667 A.2d 876. Such findings will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 364-65, 369, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395; <em>Harley v. State, </em>341 Md. 395, 402, 671 A.2d 15 (1996) (per curiam); <em>Gilchrist, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>340 Md. at 627, 667 A.2d 876; <em>Brogden v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 423, 433, 649 A.2d 1196 (1994). Nevertheless, if \u201cthe relevant facts are not in dispute,\u201d the appellate court \u201cmay exercise [its] independent constitutional judgment to determine what should be concluded from those facts.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. at 539, 616 A.2d 356; <em>see Stanley, </em>313 Md. at 71, 542 A.2d 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The State asserts that, \u201c[e]xcept for merely stating the numbers, [appellant] articulated no other relevant facts, that in their totality, would demonstrate a discriminatory purpose by the State in exercising its peremptory strikes.\u201d It relies on <em>Ball v. Martin, </em>108 Md.App. 435, 457, 672 A.2d 143, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 472, 677 A.2d 565 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In <em>Ball, </em>108 Md.App. at 439, 672 A.2d 143, after defense counsel struck the only African-American venireperson, the plaintiff asserted a race-based <em>Batson </em>challenge. Following a <em>Batson </em>hearing, the court overruled the objection. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 672 A.2d 143. Then, the plaintiff stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to put one more thing on the record.... [A]ll of his strikes were of women.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court did not hold another <em>Batson </em>hearing or otherwise address the plaintiffs assertion. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the plaintiff challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the court\u2019s failure to address the gender-based challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 672 A.2d 143. This Court held that the plaintiff \u201cwaived any gender-based objection for failure to raise it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457, 672 A.2d 143. Quoting from <em>Johnson v. Nadwodny, </em>55 Md.App. 227, 238, 461 A.2d 67 (1983), the <em>Ball </em>Court explained, 108 Md.App. at 457, 672 A.2d 143:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201c[T]he judge did not expressly deny the motion and procedurally we find that the judge was never asked to rule upon the motion.... [I]t is the responsibility of the movant to bring them to the attention of the trial judge prior to the conclusion of the trial.... [W]e ... consider that she has waived her rights to have a ruling on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"><em>See also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 654, 529 S.E.2d 769, 780-81(Va.) (\u201cThe fact that the prosecution has excluded African-Americans by using peremptory strikes does not itself establish ... a prima facie case under <em>Batson. </em>A defendant also must identify facts and circumstances that raise an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ence that potential jurors were excluded based on their race.\u201d) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 981, 121 S.Ct. 432, 148 L.Ed.2d 439 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In our view, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Ball </em>is misplaced. The defendant in <em>Ball </em>never responded to the plaintiffs allegation that he used his strikes against women. Here, the State responded, acknowledging that the reason for its strikes was, indeed, gender-based; it sought to create a gender-balanced jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\"><em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. 522, 616 A.2d 356, is informative with respect to the import of undisputed facts in the context of a Batson challenge. In that case, the defendant was convicted of attempted rape and second degree assault by a jury that was empaneled after the court overruled his challenge to the State\u2019s exercise of a peremptory strike. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 616 A.2d 356. The defendant had alleged in his challenge that the defendant was Hispanic and the potential juror whom the State struck was the only Hispanic person in the venire. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 616 A.2d 356. The Court of Appeals \u201cgranted certiorari to consider what proof a moving party is required to produce to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination against Hispanics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 616 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Noting that \u201cneither the State nor the court expressed any disagreement with the petitioner\u2019s proffer of the preliminary fact that a venireperson was the only Hispanic in the venire,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201ca <em>prima facie </em>showing of <em>that fact </em>was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 616 A.2d 356. Further, it determined that the defendant made a <em>pnma facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination because the State struck the only Hispanic person in the venire. <em>Id. </em>However, because the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge \u201cwithout affording the prosecution the opportunity to provide racially neutral reasons\u201d for its strike, the Court ordered a limited remand for the trial court to perform the proper <em>Batson </em>analysis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 616 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We agree with appellant that \u201cthe first prong of Batson,\u201d which requires a <em>prima facie </em>showing of an improper peremptory challenge, is not at issue. This is because, in response to appellant\u2019s challenge, the State immediately volunteered its gender-based reason for its strikes. That concession relieved appellant of the obligation to prove that the State\u2019s strikes were gender-based. As the Court recognized in <em>Edmonds v. State, </em>372 Md. 314, 332, 812 A.2d 1034 (2002), once the State \u201coffered explanations for its peremptory challenges,\u201d the first prong of <em>Batson </em>was \u201cmoot\u201d and therefore \u201cnot at issue.\u201d <em>See also Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 369, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (recognizing that where prosecutor defended strikes without prompting, court had no occasion to rule and \u201cpreliminary issue of ... <em>prima facie </em>showing [was] moot\u201d); <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 628, 667 A.2d 876 (same). Alternatively, we agree with appellant that he satisfied the first prong \u201cby pointing to a pattern\u2014eight of nine strikes used against men\u2014sufficient to support an inference of intentional discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">As to the second prong of <em>Batson, </em>which required the State to provide a neutral reason for its strike, unrelated to race or gender, we again agree with appellant, who argues: \u201c[T]he State\u2019s unambiguous admission that it exercised eight of its nine peremptory challenges because the challenged jurors were men and it preferred women to fill the remaining spaces so as to obtain a \u2018balancefd] jury\u2019 ... directly violated <em>Batson\u2019s </em>second requirement because it was not gender-neutral[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The question, then, is whether the State\u2019s desire to obtain a gender-balanced jury violated <em>Batson </em>and its progeny. We agree with appellant that the State\u2019s objective, however well intentioned, \u201cwas no more permissible than would be the exercise of a peremptory strike against a black prospective juror in order to ensure that the jury reflected the racial make-up of the community as a whole.\u201d <em>See </em>Heather <em>K. </em>Gerken, <em>Second-Order Diversity, </em>118 Harv. L.Rev. 1099, 1114 (2005) (stating that <em>\u201cBatson </em>prohibits using peremptory chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>lenges\u201d to \u201cremedy ... gender imbalances on individual juries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>277 F.3d 164, 207-12 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 835, 123 S.Ct. 145, 154 L.Ed.2d 54 (2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit underscored that efforts to balance the composition of a jury nonetheless violate <em>Batson, </em>because such conduct requires exclusion of prospective jurors on a prohibited basis (i.e., religion or race). In <em>Nelson, </em>the defendant was acquitted on state criminal charges, and was later charged with federal hate crimes related to the fatal stabbing of a Jewish man. <em>Id. </em>at 170-72. The federal trial court believed that the state trial had resulted in an acquittal \u201c \u2018because the ... jury did not represent the community,\u2019 \u201d and decided that it would empanel a representative jury. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72 (quoting district court). Therefore, it replaced an excused African-American juror with another African-American juror, rather than the Caucasian first alternate, and it replaced another empaneled Caucasian juror with a Jewish juror, also selected out of order from the alternate list. <em>Id. </em>at 172. The court justified its action by reference to its desire for a balanced jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The Second Circuit held that the exclusion of jurors based on race or religion was an \u201cerror ... made plain by the reasoning [of] <em>Batson,\u201d </em>that \u201ccould not constitutionally have been achieved at the instigation of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207. Of import here, it also said: \u201c[Although the motives behind the district court\u2019s race-and religion-based jury selection procedures were undoubtedly meant to be tolerant and inclusive rather than bigoted and exclusionary, that fact cannot justify the district court\u2019s race-conscious actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">As appellant points out, the Supreme Court \u201chas signaled that use of a peremptory strike for the purpose of gender-balancing would not be constitutionally tolerable.\u201d He cites <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. 333, 126 S.Ct. 969, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006), to support his assertion. There, the record seemed to suggest that \u201cone of the prosecutor\u2019s aims in striking [the juror] was achieving gender balance on the jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 340, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>126 S.Ct. 969 and the Supreme Court observed that the trial court \u201ccorrectly, disallowed any reliance on that ground.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 336, 126 S.Ct. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In our view, the State\u2019s explanation does not pass muster under <em>Batson. </em>The State had the burden of providing a gender-neutral explanation for its strikes. It failed to do so. Instead, it remarked that \u201cwhen [the State] started using [its] strikes,\u201d there was \u201ca panel of men,\u201d and it felt the \u201cneed to balance out the jury.\u201d By striking men to reduce the number of men on the jury, \u201ca discriminatory intent [was] inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation,\u201d and that explanation could not be deemed gender-neutral. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859. \u201cNo matter how noble [the State\u2019s] intentions, such a strategy would offend Batson.... \u201d <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>421 F.3d 503, 524 (7th Cir.2005) (Kanne, J., dissenting). <em>See Nelson, </em>277 F.3d at 207-12 (noting that \u201cjurymandering\u201d violates <em>Batson). </em>Therefore, the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s challenge to the empaneling of the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>We must next determine whether to remand for a <em>Batson </em>hearing. <em>Tyler, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648, provides guidance. In that case, the defense \u201cchallenged the composition of the jury\u201d on the grounds of race and gender. <em>Id. </em>at 267, 623 A.2d 648.

The Court observed that \u201cthe trial judge flatly rejected defense counsel\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges based on gender discrimination without requiring' the prosecutor to explain his conduct,\u201d as required under <em>Batson.

The Court concluded: \u201cIn the face of what the prosecutor said at trial, he is not entitled to come forward at this time in an attempt to present a neutral explanation for challenging women jurors. Tyler [is] entitled to a new trial without further ado.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In <em>Mejia, </em>328 Md. at 540-41, 616 A.2d 356, as we have seen, the Court ordered a limited remand because the State was not afforded an opportunity to explain the basis of its strikes. That is not the situation here. Here, the prosecutor stated that, \u201cwhen we started using our strikes, we had a panel of men and felt the need to balance out the jury.\u201d The prosecutor added: \u201c[W]e wanted a balanced jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Because the State acknowledged its gender-based motives, a limited remand is neither necessary nor appropriate. The State is not entitled to a second chance to provide a gender-neutral explanation. Rather, Elliott is \u201centitled to a new trial without further ado.\u201d <em>Tyler, </em>330 Md. at 271, 623 A.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Upon retrial, the issue pertaining to the diary is likely to arise again. Therefore, we shall address it for the benefit of the parties and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Referring to the diary, appellant argues: \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the indictment based on the State\u2019s intentional non-preservation of evidence.\u201d We pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">On August 11, 2006, appellant filed a request for discovery. He sought \u201cdiscovery and inspection [of][a]ny material or information tending to negate the guilt of the Defendant as to any offense charged,\u201d and made a \u201cspecific demand,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>for \u201c[a]ll evidence going to the lack of credibility of any government witness.. .. \u201d At a hearing on December 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>2006, appellant moved to compel the production of the diary-recovered at the scene. The court denied the motion, because the diary no longer \u201cexist[ed],\u201d in that it had \u201cbeen thrown away\u201d by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Thereafter, appellant moved for sanctions on February 28, 2007, alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">The State in this case has allowed exculpatory evidence to be destroyed. At issue is the complaining witness\u2019 diary, which was found at the scene of the crime covered with blood spatter. The blood spatter was not tested by the State, and the Defense was denied the opportunity to test the blood spatter due to the destruction of the diary by the complaining witness after having the diary returned to her by detectives in this case with the State\u2019s attorney\u2019s approval. In addition, the contents of the diary could have been exculpatory under a number of different theories of the Defense case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Appellant pointed out that the diary was \u201clogged into evidence,\u201d and that he had \u201crequested the diary ... during the December 27, 2006, Motions Hearing.\u201d He complained that \u201cthe original diary and a photocopy of the diary contents were returned to Ms. McCullough\u201d because the State \u201c \u2018did not need it,\u2019 \u201d and McCullough then \u201cshredded the copy of the diary and disposed of the original diary.\u201d Therefore, he asked the court to dismiss the indictment, disqualify McCullough, and instruct the jury \u201cthat exculpatory evidence was destroyed in this case by the State and that the destroyed evidence should be viewed in favor of the Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The court held an evidentiary hearing on July 20, 2007, with respect to the Motion for Sanctions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellant called SarnsGaunt and questioned her about the search of McCullough\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>home on February 5, 2006. Sams-Gaunt testified that she thought the diary had evidentiary value because \u201cit spoke to the emotional state of the victim prior to the event.\u201d SamsGaunt photocopied the diary and read it. Although SarnsGaunt did not \u201cremember the exact details\u201d or the \u201cwording\u201d of the diary passages that she read, she \u201cgot the impression that the victim was in fear of her safety.\u201d When asked if she discussed the diary with anyone in the police department, Sarns-Gaunt recalled only that she drew it to the \u201cattention\u201d of one of the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then stated to the court: \u201cWe\u2019re learning for the first time ... that the State actually did read it. We\u2019ve always believed and been led to believe, I\u2019m not suggesting it was dishonest, but that nobody read the diary.\u201d He asserted that the diary was \u201ca piece of evidence that we would very much like to have and we don\u2019t have.\u201d The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">[W]hat this is shaping up as is both the prosecutors and the police are being accused of misconduct.... That\u2019s a pretty serious allegation that you have a heavy burden to prove. And if there is any misconduct here, it will be dealt with ... swiftly and appropriately. But I\u2019m not going to allow a fishing expedition to see if there was prosecutorial misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The defense called Lieutenant James Humphries, Deputy Director of the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s Family Crimes Division, and asked about the \u201cstandard practice\u201d concerning diaries recovered from a crime scene. He replied: \u201cThe standard practice is, if they\u2019re taken as evidence, generally speaking, they would be reviewed by the investigating officer to see whether or not they have any type of evidentiary value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Defense counsel also called Ms. McCullough, who testified that she wrote about appellant and \u201c[n]othing else\u201d in her diary. McCullough claimed, consistent with her later trial testimony, that she \u201cthrew [the diary] away\u201d and \u201cshredded\u201d the copies. She explained that she \u201cneeded to quickly remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>[her] property ... from the home so that [she] could put it on the market to sell it.... \u201d Asked why she did not write about anyone but appellant in her diary, McCullough explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axi\">I wrote about things that were on my mind. And I, he had isolated me, and was very controlling, and had ran pretty much everyone out of my life, so that any thoughts that I might have had were only of him. In addition to that, I was going through so much, so much trouble, you know, dealing \u2022with him in a relationship, and that was the only thing on my mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel also called Detective Erazo, who testified: \u201cI went through all the paperwork in the envelope [containing the diary], and I put the copy of the journal in my case file.\u201d Erazo returned the diary to McCullough, indicating that the State \u201cdidn\u2019t need it and she could have it back if she wanted it.\u201d Erazo acknowledged that the diary was discussed on February 16, 2006, at \u201ca meeting in reference to the case,\u201d attended by the prosecutor, Lieutenant Humphries, and others. She elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">We were going through what evidence and things that we had for the case. And when the journal came up, I asked if they wanted it returned or anything done with it. And they said, \u201cJust go ahead and return it.\u201d Ms. Koch and Ms. Chase discussed it and then gave me the release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">With regard to the contents of the diary, appellant\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">I think the inference to be drawn from the fact that the journal and the copies were given to her, at the initiation of the police, I think the inference is inescapable that that was so that I as the defense lawyer for Mr. Elliott, or whoever else was defending him, wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.... I\u2019d love to be able to read that, but I don\u2019t have it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">* 4: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">Ms. McCullough does not remember everything she wrote down. There might be inconsistent statements. Her diary might tell us who really did this. It might tell us how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>she hated Andre Elliott. It might tell us about her own psychological issues, relationships that she had with others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">As to the blood on the diary, appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that, under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 896 A.2d 973 (2006), it would be \u201cexculpatory if it\u2019s not Mr. Elliott\u2019s blood.... And we don\u2019t have a chance to test that.... [I]t could have been the blood of the real perpetrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The State countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">[T]he purpose of that meeting at that time was to go through all of the evidence, because there was a lot seized, fully understanding that we probably would not need all of the evidence seized, but to sort of run through and figure out what evidence we would need....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">At that time, you heard testimony, Detective Erazo said to us do you need the diary, they\u2019ve seized the diary. It was seized because at that time they believed that they were processing a murder scene....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">... Ms. Chase and I conferred. The decision was made, as is often made, we do not need the diary. So because no one had read the diary, to our knowledge, Detective Erazo was told she could return the diary to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">... [CJertain pieces of evidence have different evidentiary value when you have a life [sic] victim versus a dead victim. A live victim can speak for herself____ A diary speaks for a dead victim---- A diary would be inadmissible, most likely, with a live victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">And the burden that they have is not that the diary may be exculpatory, and not that it may be material. They have to prove that it would have been material. Brady material is that it must be material to show, to proving that ... the defendant\u2019s not guilty.... And they just haven\u2019t done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-15\">With regard to the blood on the diary, the prosecutor said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>[T]he blood on the diary was consistent with all of the other blood within the room. That there were other pieces of evidence seized from the room that can and were tested. That the defense is saying that they did not have the ability to test the diary, test the blood on the diary. But they had the ability to test any other item seized from the room. They have chosen not to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">... They\u2019ve chosen not to test anything else. That gives us no reason to believe that they would have tested the diary, the blood on the diary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In rebuttal, appellant\u2019s counsel said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t test the knife because to [his] knowledge that\u2019s the only other blood sample taken from the room. They tested it, and it did not have Mr. Elliott\u2019s DNA[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">Well, I don\u2019t find that there\u2019s any bad faith in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">But that\u2019s not the end of the analysis. Prosecutors can engage in conduct that is not appropriate, and in those cases it\u2019s appropriate for the court to impose a certain sanction, even if there isn\u2019t bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\"><em>Hi </em>* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">... What we have here is the possibility that there might have been some evidence that could have been exculpatory. If that were the standard, that argument could be made in virtually every single criminal trial, because there is always something collected on a crime scene that is not used in the trial. The prosecution, the State doesn\u2019t use every single item that is collected. It is not at all unusual that certain items are returned to victims, having been viewed as having no prosecutorial value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">... [T]hey don\u2019t know what was in the diary, any more than they know what the results would have been on other items in the room that were not tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Now, with respect to the issue of prosecutorial misconduct, the court addresses that in DeLeon[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ]And I\u2019ve already alluded to it, but let me just say with respect to prosecutorial misconduct generally, the court says, \u201cactual prejudice must be shown before any sanction or reversal of a conviction can be properly imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">And they talk about Brady. I\u2019m not so sure that we even get to the issue of Brady here, because there\u2019s been no proffer, or no argument of what exactly it is that the government threw away.. .. This is just a belief that there could have been evidence in the journal that could have been exculpatory, but we don\u2019t know what it was, or even if there was any such evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">... I find that there would have to be an egregious violation of the discovery rules, and serious prosecutorial misconduct, for a court to dismiss an entire indictment.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">Not only do 1 find no bad faith, but I don\u2019t find any misconduct in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">And so for those reasons, the motion for sanctions is denied....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">Now, with respect to jury instructions, we will discuss that [at trial] with respect to whether or not the facts are such that an instruction on spoliation is appropriate....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">With this background, we turn to the parties\u2019 contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Appellant asserts that, by failing to preserve the diary as evidence, the State violated his due process rights, as articulated in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988); and <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 696, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>According to appellant, \u201c[t]he <em>Youngblood </em>doctrine permits a defendant ... to establish a due process violation if (1) the item in question is \u2018potentially useful evidence\u2019 and (2) the State\u2019s failure to preserve it was in bad faith.\u201d He insists that \u201c[t]he diary was such \u2018potentially useful\u2019 evidence\u201d because \u201cit was splattered with blood from the crime scene\u201d and \u201cthe diary entries about Mr. Elliott might have been used to impeach Ms. McCullough, the State\u2019s key witness, for example, by revealing her motive to testify against Mr. Elliott.\u201d By photocopying the diary, argues appellant, \u201cthe Department treated it as important evidence.\u201d Further, he claims that, \u201cby the State\u2019s admission, the evidence was the \u2018voice\u2019 of an essential witness who might not be willing to cooperate.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au9\">Claiming that bad faith can be established without \u201cshowing that the State acted with malice or intent to harm the defendant,\u201d Elliott offers many grounds to support his claim of bad faith non-preservation. In particular, he points to \u201cthe State\u2019s violation of and disregard for its duty to preserve evidence, its violation of protocol relating to preservation of evidence, and its internally inconsistent rationale for its decision to return evidence to a key witness.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cthe State\u2019s violation of standard protocol establishes bad faith.\u201d He argues that the State made a \u201cconscious decision ... to break protocol\u201d and \u201cdiscard\u201d the diary \u201cwithout ever having read the diary to determine whether the information contained therein was inculpatory, exculpatory, or neutral.1-1\u201d According to appellant, \u201c[t]he State had a clear and affirmative obligation to preserve materials that have potential evidentiary value,\u201d yet \u201cthe State ... returned the diary based on the untested <em>belief </em>that it was not exculpatory.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cthe State\u2019s conduct\u2014its deliberate departures, on two occasions,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] from police protocol regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>evidence preservation\u2014indicates that the State did not want the diary to be available to Mr. Elliott during discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Further, appellant complains that the State erroneously believed that \u201cits duty to preserve collected evidence ceased once the State had accumulated the evidence it believed to be sufficient to prove its case.... \u201d Yet, he points out that it would not have been difficult for the Department to retain the diary, because it \u201cwas not sizable; it did not require refrigeration or other special storage conditions; and it was not contraband.\u201d With regard to the State\u2019s rationale \u201cfor its deliberate decision to return the diary,\u201d appellant posits: \u201cThe State\u2019s evolving account of what happened to the diary ... indicates that the State did not want to produce the diary in discovery.\u201d In his view, the State offered \u201cshifting stories about how many copies of the diary there were, when they were returned to Ms. McCullough, whether anyone had read the diary, and who participated in meetings about the diary....\u201d Further, appellant alleges that \u201cthe court applied an erroneous legal standard,\u201d by faulting appellant for not demonstrating the contents of the missing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">As to his due process rights under <em>Brady, </em>appellant maintains that \u201cthe State was responsible for identifying and disclosing material, exculpatory evidence,\u201d such as the diary. He explains: \u201cTo establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must demonstrate that the withheld evidence was \u2018favorable to the defense\u2014either because it is exculpatory ... or because it provides grounds for impeaching a witness\u2014and ... that the suppressed evidence is material.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Conyers v. State, </em>367 Md. 571, 597, 790 A.2d 15, <em>cert. denied, 537 </em>U.S. 942, 123 S.Ct. 341, 154 L.Ed.2d 249 (2002)) (Citations and quotation marks omitted). In his view, \u201cthe State effectively acknowledged that the blood-spattered diary would have been exculpatory,\u201d by asserting \u201cthat the blood on the diary was the \u2018same blood\u2019 as the blood on the knife, the testing of which excluded Mr. Elliott as the source!)]\u201d He reiterates that \u201cthe diary could have been used to show Ms. McCullough\u2019s bias against Mr. Elliott or motive to testify against him\u201d because McCullough testified at the motion hearing that she regularly wrote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>about her \u201c \u2018trouble\u2019 \u201d with appellant. Moreover, appellant contends that \u201cevidence of Ms. McCullough\u2019s motive to testify against Mr. Elliott ... \u2018may [have made] the difference between conviction and acquittal.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Conyers, 367 </em>Md. at 606, 790 A.2d 15 (citations and quotation marks omitted)). He declares that \u201chad the jury not credited Ms. McCullough\u2019s testimony, it would not have been able to convict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The State counters: \u201cThe trial court properly refused to dismiss the indictment on the basis of alleged bad-faith non-preservation of evidence.\u201d It alleges that Elliott did not establish that the State acted in bad faith in regard to the non-preservation of the diary, because \u201cnothing in the due process clause confers an \u2018absolute duty\u2019 on the part of the police \u2018to retain and preserve all material that might be of conceivable evidentiary significance in a particular prosecution.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281.) Moreover, the State maintains that \u201cthe diary was clearly not <em>Brady </em>material.\u201d It explains: \u201cThe possibility that there might have been some evidence that could have been useful to the defense is simply not enough to make the diary subject to <em>Brady.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In addition, the State observes that Elliott had an opportunity at trial to question Ms. McCullough about the contents of the diary, yet he did not do so. Moreover, the State contends that it \u201cis not required to test every item that had blood on it.\u201d It posits: \u201cThe fact that the blood on this one piece of evidence was not tested does not mean that the State acted improperly in the preservation of evidence. The blood on the diary was consistent with the blood found in the bedroom, including on the knife.... \u201d Further, the State points out that appellant \u201cdid not request to test the blood on other items that were seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, 373 </em>U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused ... violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>363 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Md. 333, 768 A.2d 675 (2001) (same). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation a defendant must show: (1) the State suppressed or withheld evidence, whether inadvertently or willfully; (2) the evidence at issue was favorable to the defense, either because it was exculpatory, provided a basis for mitigation of sentence, or provided grounds for impeaching a witness; and (8) the suppressed evidence was material to the guilt or punishment of the defendant, thereby prejudicing the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">To \u201censure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur,\u201d the State is required to \u201cdisclose evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trialf.]\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 675, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Such disclosure requirements extend to \u201chelpful impeachment evidence as well as directly exculpatory evidence on the merits. ... \u201d <em>Adams v.

Lee, </em>178 Md.App. 478, 484, 943 A.2d 14 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In our view, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Brady </em>is misplaced. In that case, 373 U.S. at 84, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before trial; the defense had no knowledge of the information.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here, Elliott knew of the existence of the diary well before trial. To be sure, he did not know of its contents, and the diary was unavailable for testing, because the State did not preserve it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>As discussed <em>infra, </em>it was not known whether the diary was exculpatory. Because the issue raised by appellant concerns the State\u2019s \u201cfailure to preserve potentially useful evidence,\u201d we shall examine the State\u2019s conduct under <em>Youngblood, </em>not <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, the defendant was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with sexual assault of a ten-year-old' boy. The prosecution \u201cdisclosed relevant police reports to [the defendant], which contained information about the existence of [a rectal] swab and the [victim\u2019s] clothing,\u201d as well as laboratory reports. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. Although the swab and clothing were made available to the defendant, the prosecution did not refrigerate or freeze the clothing. <em>Id. </em>As a result, months later, when semen stains were discovered on the clothing, the criminologist could not obtain blood group substances or analyze the semen to determine the perpetrator\u2019s identity. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The state appellate court reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions \u201con the ground that the State had failed to preserve semen samples from the victim\u2019s body and clothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider, under the Due Process Clause, the prosecution\u2019s duty to preserve potentially useful evidentiary material. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Recognizing that the State \u201ccomplied\u201d with <em>Brady </em>and <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), and noting that the prosecution made the physical evidence available to the defense, <em>id. </em>at 55, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, the Supreme Court considered whether there was \u201csome constitutional duty over and above that imposed by cases such as <em>Brady </em>and <em>Agurs. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. The Court distinguished the circumstances in which <em>Brady </em>applies, i.e., \u201cwhen the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence,\u201d and the circumstances of the case before it, which presented \u201cthe failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the result of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. It concluded that when the contents of the evidence are unknown, because of the State\u2019s failure to preserve the evidence, a defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated upon proof that the prosecution acted in bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. The Supreme Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Brady, </em>makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence. But we think the Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it <em>could have been subjected </em>to tests, the results of which <em>might have exonerated </em>the defendant. Part of the reason for the difference in treatment is found in the observation made by the Court in <em>[California v.] Trombetta, </em>[467 U.S. 479, 486, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984)], that \u201c[w]henever potentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost, courts face the treacherous task of divining the import of materials whose contents are unknown and, very often, disputed.\u201d Part of it stems from our unwillingness to read the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requirement of the Due Process Clause, <em>see Lisenba v. California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941), as imposing on the police an undifferentiated and absolute duty to retain and to preserve all material that might be of conceivable evidentiary significance in a particular prosecution. We think that requiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of the police both limits the extent of the police\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable bounds and confines it to that class of cases where the interests of justice most clearly require it, <em>i.e., </em>those cases in which the police themselves by their conduct indicate that the evidence could form a basis for exonerating the defendant. We therefore hold that unless a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve <em>potentially useful </em>evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFi\"><em>Patterson, </em>356 Md. 677, 741 A.2d 1119, illuminates the concept of bad faith. Patterson was charged with driving and narcotics offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 741 A.2d 1119. In a search subsequent to his arrest, police recovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket in the trunk of the car that Patterson was driving. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 741 A.2d 1119. At trial, Patterson sought to show that the jacket was not his by trying it on and demonstrating that it did not fit him. However, it was not available; the State only offered into evidence a photograph of the jacket. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 741 A.2d 1119. On cross-examination, it was established that \u201cthe jacket was never held as evidence by the police, that the jacket was not the kind of evidence typically held as evidence by their agency, and that neither officer was aware of the jacket\u2019s current whereabouts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681-82, 741 A.2d 1119. The trial court denied Patterson\u2019s request for a spoliation instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 741 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">On appeal, Patterson alleged that the court erred in denying the spoliation instruction, and thereby denied him due process of law. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 741 A.2d 1119. Relying on <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, the Court said: \u201c[Tjhere is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of the police. The officer testified that he dealt with the jacket according to standard police procedure. There was no evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 741 A.2d 1119. It elaborated, <em>id. </em>at 696, 741 A.2d 1119:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">Petitioner offers no evidence that the police purposely suppressed or destroyed the jacket. The record reveals that the police accurately reported the existence of the jacket during the inventory search of the vehicle. While the defendant may have considered the jacket to be relevant evidence, there is little evidence that the police considered it to be evidence, and ever held it as evidence.... [N]ot only is there no evidence that the police destroyed the jacket, petitioner has not established what the police motive or intent behind destroying the jacket would be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant suggests that the actual contents of the diary would have shed light on the victim\u2019s motive to testify against appellant. It is, of course, speculation that what McCullough wrote in her diary \u201cmight have exonerated the defendant.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. Sams-Gaunt alone read the diary, \u201cas [she] was copying\u201d it, but she could not recall what she had read. The victim testified at the motion hearing on July 20, 2007, explaining that she wrote only about appellant and \u201c[n]othing else,\u201d explaining that he \u201cwas very controlling\u201d and she had \u201cso much trouble ... dealing with him in a relationship.... \u201d Surely, passages to that effect are not exculpatory. Nor has appellant suggested any basis to believe that the diary included any information that would have provided a motive for the victim to fabricate her claim that it was appellant who stabbed her on February 5, 2006. To the contrary, the victim\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d in testifying against appellant was established by her clear recollection of the events of February 5, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">It is also salient that appellant had the opportunity at trial to delve into the contents of the diary on cross-examination, but chose not to do so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nevertheless, appellant did establish that McCullough\u2019s diary was seized by the State, which later returned it to the victim, and that the victim destroyed it. Appellant then argued in closing that McCullough \u201cdestroyed\u201d the diary, and that \u201ccommon sense\u201d required the State to read and preserve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">It is also total speculation that the blood spatter on the diary was exculpatory. To be sure, the blood on the diary \u201ccould have been subjected to tests,\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281, such as DNA analysis. Yet, the blood on the diary was a far cry from the only blood at the crime scene. There was evidence that blood was found all over the bedroom where McCullough was stabbed; on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>walls and the stairs of the house; and in the kitchen, where the victim was found with \u201clarge amounts of blood on her [and] on the ground below her.\u201d Although the knife, blood swabs from the inside of the front door, and from where the victim lay, as well as \u201ca bathrobe with suspected blood,\u201d were collected from the crime scene, the State only tested the knife for DNA evidence. This suggests that the State did not return the diary to avoid testing it. And, of import here, given that appellant never asked the State to test any other evidence, there is no basis to credit his claim that he wanted to test the diary\u2014the one item that happened to be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Furthermore, there was no evidence whatsoever that the assailant was injured or bled during the attack. This makes it unlikely that any of the blood at the crime scene, including the blood on the diary, was that of the assailant. Put another way, the blood that was tested belonged to the victim; a test indicating that the blood on the diary was not appellant\u2019s would not have exonerated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The court below credited the State\u2019s claim that the diary was recovered in the event that McCullough did not survive the attack. As the prosecutor explained, the State collected \u201ca lot\u201d of evidence, \u201cfully understanding that [it] probably would not need all of the evidence seized, but to sort of run through and figure out what evidence [it] would need.\u201d Similarly, Sarns-Gaunt testified, \u201cI believed I had arrived on what was going to become a homicide,\u201d and she thought the diary \u201cwas important if the victim did not survive.\u201d With McCullough available to testify, however, the State did \u201cnot need the diary,\u201d and returned it to McCullough. <em>Youngblood </em>stated that \u201crequiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of the police ... limits the extent of the police\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable bounds.... \u201d 488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281. The trial judge, as fact finder, determined that minor inconsistencies in the State\u2019s account of how or why it decided to return the diary were not sufficient to establish bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Nor did the State violate protocol in handling the diary. To be sure, Lieutenant Humphries testified that the \u201cstandard practice\u201d for a diary recovered from a crime scene was for the investigating officer to review it for \u201cany type of evidentiary value.\u201d Yet, Detective Erazo explained that the Family Crimes Division \u201chas several different sections\u201d to handle \u201cvery different crimes,\u201d and in her section there was no standard practice for handling such items.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In sum, the State\u2019s decision to return the diary and copies of it to McCullough was not proof of bad faith. The court below found that the State did not act in bad faith; that finding was not clearly erroneous. Without proof of bad faith, appellant did not establish a due process violation under <em>Youngblood. </em>We conclude that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
