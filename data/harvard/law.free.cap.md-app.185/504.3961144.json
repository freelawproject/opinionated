On August 12, 2004, Michael David Blackburn was involved in a motor vehicle accident allegedly caused by the negligence of Patrick Joseph Quinn;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">2. Mr. Blackburn allegedly suffered serious injuries as a result of the incident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">3.

That at the time of the incident, the Plaintiff was covered under a personal- automobile policy with the Defendant, Erie Insurance Company, which provided uninsured/under insured motorist benefits in the amount of $250,000 per person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">7. At the time of the incident, the alleged tortfeasor, Quinn, was insured by State Farm Insurance Company under a policy of insurance providing liability limits of $100,000 per person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">8.

That the parties request that the Court determine under statute what the proper reductions are from the Erie Insurance UM/UIM policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Both the Blackburns and Erie filed motions for summary judgment based on the agreed statement of facts. The Circuit Court for Frederick County granted the summary judgment motion filed by Erie on February 29, 2008. As part of that judgment, the court declared \u201cthat the liability of ... [Erie] is $3,694.34.\u201d The court also filed a seven-page written opinion in which it explained its reasons for ruling against the Black-burns and in favor of Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The issue that separates the parties is the correct interpretation of Maryland Code (2006 RepLVol.), Insurance Article, \u00a7 19-513(e), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">(e) <em>Reduction due to workers\u2019 compensation </em>benefits.\u2014Benefits payable under the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient has recovered benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or the federal government for which the provider of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits has not been reimbursed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Section 19-505 of the Insurance Article deals with personal injury protection coverage and section 19-509 concerns uninsured/underinsured motor vehicle coverage. <em>See Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Asso., </em>309 Md. 167, 178, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987) (dealing with section 541(c) of Article 48A of the Maryland Code (1957,1986, Repl.Vol.), which was the section of the Maryland Insurance Code that governed uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage prior to its re-codifieation into the present Insurance Article).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Erie now interprets section 19-513(e), as applied to the facts here presented, as meaning that it is obligated to pay the Blackburns zero dollars under the uninsured/underinsured provisions of its policy. Erie\u2019s position is based on the following calculations: the Blackburns had uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $250,000 and it was entitled to deduct $100,000-the amount that the Blackburns received from Quinn\u2019s insurer\u2014from that figure. Erie further contends. it was entitled to deduct the sum of $218,909.38. That $218,909.38 figure was calculated by deducting $27,396.28 (the amount that the Blackburns paid back to the federal government) from $246,305.66 (the amount that Mr. Blackburn had received in worker\u2019s compensation benefits from the federal government). Given the fact that $218,909.38 exceeded $150,000 by more than $68,000, it is Erie\u2019s position that it owes nothing to the Blackburns.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It is important to note that Erie\u2019s present position is slightly different from the position it took in the circuit court. In the circuit court, Erie admitted that it owed $3,694.34 to the Blackburns. That admission was based on the assumption that the Blackburns had repaid the U.S. government the entire amount that they received from State Farm, i.e., $100,000.00. Erie\u2019s calculations in the circuit court were as follows: $250,000 minus $100,000 (paid by State Farm equals $150,000. From this fig\u00fare Erie deducted $146,305.66, which was the part of the workers\u2019 compensation lien that Erie believed that Blackburn had not repaid the government\u2014 $150,000.00-$146,305.66 equals $3,694.34).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The Blackburns admit that even though the underinsured policy limits set forth in their policy with Erie was $250,000, Erie was entitled to deduct the $100,000.00\u2014the amount that they received from State Farm. The Blackburns contend, in essence, that when the U.S. government received $27,396.28 it closed its lien against them and, as a consequence, the federal government had been fully reimbursed. Therefore, according to the Blackburns, Erie owes them $150,000.00. Appellants express that argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The workers\u2019 compensation provider, in this case, voluntarily agreed to accept a portion of the recovery from Mr. Quinn\u2019s liability policy as reimbursement for the benefits it had provided to Mr. Blackburn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">If the United States is satisfied with the payment by Mr. Blackburn, Erie has no cause to assert that the government has not been reimbursed. Nor should Erie be allowed to escape its contractual obligations to pay for underinsured motorist coverage because the United States did not demand a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for the benefits that it had provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Circuit Court for Frederick County, in declaring the rights of the parties, rejected the Blackburns\u2019 interpretation of section 19-513(e), saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">When the Court considers the statute as a whole, including its amendment and other statutes in the scheme, the Court finds that under the circumstances and facts of this case, satisfaction of the lien is not synonymous with reimbursement as contemplated by \u00a7 19\u2014513(e). To do otherwise would defy common sense. It would result in a duplication of benefits, indeed a windfall, to the Plaintiff.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Section 3 9\u2014513(e) of the Insurance Article was amended in 2001. Prior to the amendment, section 19\u2014513(e) read: \u201cbenefits payable under the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient has recovered benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or the federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Recently, the Court of Appeals interpreted the word \u201crecover\u201d as used in section 19\u2014513(e) to mean \u201c \u2018to get,\u2019 \u2018to obtain,\u2019 \u2018to come into possession of,\u2019 \u2018to receive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parry v. Allstate Insurance, Co., </em>408 Md. 130, 145, 968 A.2d 1053 (2009) (citing <em>inter alia, State Farm Mutual v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>283 Md. 663, 671, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The 2001 amendment added to that last provision the words \u201cfor which the provider of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits has not been reimbursed.\u201d Section 19-513(e) has not been amended since 2001. Therefore, the statute reads in pertinent part: \u201cBenefits payable under the coverages described in ... \u00a7 19-509 of this subtitle shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient has <em>recovered </em>benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or federal government for which the provider of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits has not been reimbursed.\u201d (Emphasis added). Plainly appellant recovered $246,305.26 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits and his employer was reimbursed for only $27,396.28 of its payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The purpose of the amendment is set forth in Chapter 392, Laws of Maryland, as follows: \u201cFor the purpose of limiting the reductions available to personal injury protection and uninsured motorist insurers to the extent that the workers\u2019 compensation insurer is able to recover benefits paid under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or the federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">A clear example of the situation the amendment sought to remedy is provided by the case of <em>State Farm Mut. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 392 A.2d 1114, (1978). At issue in the State Farm case was the correct interpretation of Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Article 48A, section 543(d), which was the predecessor statute to section \u25a019-513(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals set forth the pertinent facts in <em>State Farm </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">Patrick Morris was employed on July 31, 1974, by the Washington Gas Light Company. While driving his own automobile in the course of his employment, Morris\u2019s vehicle was struck in the rear. Consequently, he sought and recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in the amount of $379.50 from his employer\u2019s insurance carrier. Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>quently, Morris pursued a tort claim against the negligent third party, and this resulted in a settlement. Out of the settlement proceeds, Morris reimbursed $379.50 to the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, as required by Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 58. Morris then filed a claim for PIP benefits in the amount of $1,119.28 against his own automobile insurance carrier, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. State Farm paid only $739.78, maintaining that under \u00a7 543(d) of Art, 48A, the $1,119.28 PIP benefits should be reduced by the $379.50 workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which Morris received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">Morris filed a protest with the Insurance Commissioner, arguing that since he paid back to his employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier $379.50 out of the proceeds of the settlement with the tortfeasor, he had not \u201crecovered\u201d workmen\u2019s compensation benefits within the meaning of \u00a7 543(d). A hearing on the protest was held on August 26, 1975, attended by Morris and his attorney as well as by a representative of State Farm and its attorney. More than thirteen months later, on October 5, 1976, the Insurance Commissioner rendered a decision, holding that Morris\u2019s receipt of the $379.50 workmen\u2019s compensation benefits was \u201conly a technical, and not a true receipt, a [receipt] in name only, and certainly does not fall within the purview of the Statute as monies \u2018recovered.\u2019 \u201d The Commissioner ordered State Farm to pay Morris $379.50 plus interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">283 Md. at 665-66.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In the <em>State Farm, </em>case, the Court rejected the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s theory \u201cthat a claimant who has in fact obtained certain monetary benefits, has nevertheless failed to \u2018recover\u2019 those benefits if he must later, out of different proceeds, covering the same loss, repay an equivalent sum of money.\u201d The <em>State Farm </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">The critical words in the statute are \u201chas recovered.\u201d The general meaning in law of the verb \u201cto recover\u201d is \u201cto get,\u201d \u201cto obtain,\u201d \u201cto come into possession of,\u201d \u201cto receive.\u201d <em>Garza v. Chicago Health Clubs, Inc., </em>347 F.Supp. 955, 962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(N.D.Ill.1972); <em>Covert v.

Flour Mills Co., </em>103 Kan. 703, 704, 176 P. 143, 144-145 (1918); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>p. 1440 (rev. 4th ed.1968); <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, </em>p.2081 (2d ed. unabridged, 1961). In a narrower sense, \u201cto recover\u201d means \u201cto succeed in a [legal] proceeding,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Nero International Dictionary of the English Language, supra, </em>or \u201cto obtain in any legal manner in contrast to voluntary payment,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra. See also Union Petroleum S.S. Co. v. United States, </em>18 F.2d 752, 753 (2d Cir.1927), <em>cert denied, </em>274 U.S. 760, 47 S.Ct. 770, 71 L.Ed. 1338 (1927); <em>Garza v. Chicago Health Clubs, Inc., supra, </em>347 F.Supp. at 962; <em>Covert v. Randles, supra, </em>53 Ariz. at 231, 87 P.2d 488. Under either the general meaning of the word or the more narrow meaning, Mr. Morris, the insured, \u201crecovered\u201d workmen\u2019s compensation benefits when he received $379.50 from his employer\u2019s insurance carrier as a result of his claim under the workmen\u2019s compensation law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s theory is that a claimant, who has in fact obtained certain monetary benefits, has nevertheless failed to \u201crecover\u201d those benefits if he must later, out of different proceeds covering the same loss, repay an equivalent sum of money. The accepted definition of the verb \u201crecover\u201d simply does not support this concept. Interpreting \u00a7 543(d) in such a manner would be ignoring the plain language of the statute and \u201cresorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of ... limiting ... its operation.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 596, 380 A.2d 1052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">283 Md. at 671-72, 392 A.2d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As can be seen, at least arguably, the State Farm Court reached an unfair result by forcing the insured to reimburse the personal injury protection insurance carrier for monies the insured had already repaid to the workers\u2019 compensation carrier. To remedy that problem, section 19-513(e) was amended to allow the carrier to deduct only the monies that the insured had not already paid back.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>As mentioned earlier, the Blackburns contend that the United States Government, as the workers\u2019 compensation provider, \u201cvoluntarily agreed to accept a portion of the recovery from ... [State Farm\u2019s] policy as reimbursement for the benefits it had provided to Mr. Blackburn.\u201d Although it is not outcome determinative, it appears that the agreement on the part of the federal government was not, as suggested by the appellants, \u201cvoluntary,\u201d at least if the word is used to suggest that the government, for some reason, charitably agreed to take less than what it was owed. This is made clear by 5 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 8132 (Lawyers Ed.1987), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00a7 8132. Adjustment after recovery from a third person.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter [5 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 8101 et. seq.] is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages, and a beneficiary entitled to compensation from the United States for that injury or death receives money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement by him or in his behalf, the beneficiary, after deducting therefrom the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States and credit any surplus on future payments of compensation payable to him for the same injury. No court, insurer, attorney, or other person shall pay or distribute to the beneficiary or his designee the proceeds of such suit or settlement without first satisfying or assuring satisfaction of the interest of the United States. The amount refunded to the United States shall be credited to the Employees\u2019 Compensation Fund. If compensation has not been paid to the beneficiary, he shall credit the money or property on compensation payable to him by the United States for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to retain, as a minimum, at least one-fifth of the net amount of the money or other property remaining after the expenses of a suit or settlement have been deducted; and in addition to this minimum and at the time of distribution, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee proportionate to the refund to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Unlike the situation in <em>State Farm v. Ins. Comm\u2019n, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation carrier in this case was not paid back, dollar for dollar, what it paid out to Mr. Blackburn in workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Section 19\u2014513(e) is unambiguous. That section, insofar as is here pertinent, provides that benefits payable under policies providing underinsured motor vehicle coverage \u201cshall be reduced to the extent that the \u25a0 recipient [Mr. Blackburn] has recovered benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or the federal government for which the provider of the worker\u2019s compensation benefits <em>has not been reimbursed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). As shown by the stipulated facts, the federal government has not been \u201creimbursed\u201d for more than $218,000.00 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits it paid to Mr. Blackburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The word \u201creimbursement\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201cre-payment.\u201d A \u201cuseful starting point\u201d in determining the plain meaning of a statutory term is that term\u2019s dictionary definition. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Sci. Applications Int\u2019l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 202, 950 A.2d 766 (2008) <em>(quoting Ishola v. State, </em>404 Md. 155, 160, 945 A.2d 1273 (2008)). The <em>Merriam-Webster Dictionary </em>defines \u201creimburse\u201d as \u201c1. to pay back to someone; repay. 2. To make restoration of or equivalent to.\u201d The <em>American Heritage College Dictionary </em>defines \u201creimburse\u201d as \u201c1. to repay (money spent); refund. 2. To pay back or compensate (another party) for money spent or losses incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">It is true, as appellants stress, that the lien held by the federal government has been satisfied. But the accepted definition of the word \u201creimburse\u201d simply does not support appellants\u2019 argument that a carrier has been fully \u201creimbursed\u201d when it has not been repaid for all the monies it advanced to Mr. Blackburn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>We recognize, of course, that the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage is to \u201cassure financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorist.\u201d <em>Lane v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, </em>321 Md. 165, 169, 582 A.2d 501 (1990). But, as was observed in <em>Johnson v. Nationwide, </em>388 Md. 82, 95, 878 A.2d 615 (2005), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">purpose, however, is not without limits. The words of the statute itself delineate the extent of the statute\u2019s reach. <em>See Stearman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>381 Md. 436, 449, 849 A.2d 539, 547 (2004) (noting that the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting the compulsory insurance statutes was not to assure <em>complete </em>insurance recovery for all victims of automobile accidents and reaffirming that the purpose did not extend beyond the prescribed statutory minimum coverage regarding the household exclusion); <em>see also Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757, 762 (1995) (noting that the court \u201cmay not disregard the plain meaning\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 878 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the plain language of section 19-513(e) allowed Erie to calculate the benefits payable under the underinsured motorist provisions of its policy by deducting from its $250,000.00\u2014limits: 1) the amount that the Blackburns received from State Farm, and 2) the monies paid out by the federal government as workers\u2019 compensation benefits that Mr. Blackburn did not repay the government (over $218,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The above holding, ordinarily, would mean that we would vacate the judgment entered by the circuit court to the extent that the court declared that Erie owed the Blackburns $3,694.34. A problem arises with such a disposition, however, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">First, Erie filed a memorandum of law in the circuit court in which it stated: \u201cErie\u2019s liability to Plaintiff Blackburn is $3,694.25 ($250,000-$100,000, pursuant to \u00a7 19-509(g)=$150,000; $150,000-($246,305.75-$100,000), pursuant to \u00a7 19\u2014513(e)=$3,694.25).\u201d Ordinarily, a party cannot take a position in an appellate court that materially differs from the position taken in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Secondly, and perhaps more important, Erie never filed a cross-claim. And, without a cross-claim being filed, we have no authority to amend the judgment so as to benefit an appellee. Accordingly, we will adopt an alternative suggestion made by Erie, which is that we simply affirm the judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Frederick County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-16\">.

Mr. Janquitto summarizes the progression of the statutory scheme as follows, <em>id. </em>at 314 (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">The 1981 and 1983 amendments modified the underlying purpose of the UM statute. Before the introduction of reduction underinsured motorist coverage in Maryland, courts uniformly stated that the purpose of UM coverage was to place the insured in the same position he or she would have occupied if the uninsured tortfeasor maintained the minimum amounts of required security mandated by Title 17 of the Transportation Article. In light of the 1981 and 1983 amendments, the UM statute is now designed to place the injured insured in the same position he or she would have occupied if the tortfeasor maintained liability insurance in amounts equal to the injured insured\u2019s uninsured motorist limits. Thus, the financial responsibility provisions of Title 17 are no longer the benchmark. Rather, the injured insured\u2019s uninsured motorist limits are now the guide. This is a substantial change in the public policy, and, in this regard, it is no longer accurate to state that the UM statute is designed solely to protect victims from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists. A motorist may, under the current statute, be financially responsible, yet still, by statutory definition, be uninsured because he or she is not as financially responsible as the injured motorist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In the present case, Blackburn purchased from Erie uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage providing benefits with a limit in the amount of $250,000 per person. Accordingly, under Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, Blackburn was entitled to be placed in as good a financial position as he would have enjoyed if the negligent driver had maintained liability insurance with a limit of $250,000 per person. The statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>construction adopted by the majority opinion does not achieve such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The majority opinion interprets the statutory offset described in Maryland Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Insurance Article, \u00a7 19-513(e) in a manner that is, in my view, (a) not consistent with the expressed legislative purpose set forth in the enacting statute, and (b) not consistent with the overall objective of underinsured motorist insurance, <em>i.e., </em>permitting the insured to recover an amount based upon his own policy\u2019s UM limits rather than the tortfeasor\u2019s inadequate policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">As Mr. Janquitto points out in \u00a7 8.10(C) of his treatise at 419, \u00a7 19-513(e) \u201cis designed to prevent double recovery.\u201d That being so, Mr. Janquitto notes that the offset is intended to be applied in a manner that nevertheless enables the injured party to receive the benefit of the underinsured motorist coverage for which he has paid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">Section 19-513 (e)\u2019s offset provision reflects a legislative intent that the injured worker\u2019s UM claim be excluded by the availability of workers\u2019 compensation benefits only to the extent necessary to avoid a double recovery. To hold that an injured worker is restricted to filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim and to pursuing the uninsured motorist, from whom he or she will, no doubt, not be able to collect even if he or she obtains a judgment, is inconsistent with the public policy of providing a full recovery to a victim of an uninsured motorist. UM coverage and workers\u2019 compensation provide separate and distinct types of coverage, but workers\u2019 compensation benefits certainly do not compensate the injured worker fully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 421 (footnotes omitted). In one of the footnotes to the above quoted passage, Mr. Janquitto emphasizes that \u201c[w]orkers\u2019 compensation benefits do not provide for pain and suffering, but UM coverage does.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421 n. 582. The purpose of Maryland\u2019s uninsured motorist insurance statute remains the same even when the victim receives workers\u2019 compensation benefits: \u201cThe UM Statute, with the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>offset, is designed to place the insured in the position he or she would have occupied had the tortfeasor had liability insurance in an amount equal to the insured\u2019s UM coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Mr. Janquitto gives the following hypothetical to illustrate the correct result when the workers\u2019 compensation lien has been satisfied out of the amount paid pursuant to the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy, <em>id. </em>at 424-25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">The following hypothetical illustrates this situation: An insured is seriously injured while working. His damages exceed $100,000. The insured has collected $20,000 in workers\u2019 compensation. The tortfeasor has a liability policy that provides $50,000 of coverage. The insured has a motor vehicle policy that provides $100,000 of UM coverage. The policy allows an offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits received by the insured. The insured collects the $50,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer and satisfies the workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s subrogation interest by repaying the $20,000. The insure[d] then seeks $50,000 from his or her UM insurer, which claims that its policy and the UM Statute allow for a reduction of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. From this, the UM insurer takes the position that it owes $30,000 ($100,000 uninsured motorist limit minus $50,000 from the tortfeasor minus $20,000 of workers\u2019 compensation). This position is untenable because the spirit of the UM Statute would be violated if the UM insurer were allowed to take the offset. Again, the analysis must focus on what the insured would have received had he or she been injured by a tortfeasor with $100,000 of liability coverage. The answer is that the insured would have netted $100,000 ($20,000 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits plus $100,000 in liability coverage minus $20,000 to pay back the workers\u2019 compensation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The extra wrinkle that is presented by Blackburn\u2019s case is that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2014more precisely, the United States Department of Labor, acting pursuant to the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act\u2014accepted an amount less than the total benefits paid, and accepted such lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>amount in full satisfaction of its right to seek reimbursement of any amounts paid to Blackburn. Erie argued that, under \u00a7 19-513(e), it was entitled to reduce its UM liability to its insured by the entire amount of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to Blackburn over and above the amount which Blackburn paid in full satisfaction of the lien, notwithstanding the fact that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier has waived any further claim for reimbursement of benefits. So, even though Blackburn owes no further reimbursement to the workers\u2019 compensation provider, Erie claims that it is still entitled to reduce its underinsured motorist benefit by the amount for which the workers\u2019 compensation provider waived reimbursement. The majority opinion adopts Erie\u2019s position as correct. The result is that the victim of the auto accident, Blackburn, ends up with uncompensated damages for which his own underinsured motorist carrier escapes responsibility, even though there is no outstanding balance for which the workers\u2019 compensation provider seeks any further reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">This result does <em>not </em>place the insured in as good a position as he would have occupied if the tortfeasor had maintained similar policy limits of $250,000. Under a scenario in which the negligent driver maintained policy limits of $250,000, Blackburn would have received $246,305.66 from the workers\u2019 compensation provider, and he would have received the $250,000 policy limits from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier, out of which he would have had to reimburse the workers\u2019 compensation provider $27,396.28 to satisfy its lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The net recovery to Blackburn would have been $468,909.38 (i.e., $246,305.66 plus $250,000 minus $27,396.28). That is $150,000 more than the amount the majority opinion holds that Blackburn is entitled to (which was $318,909, based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>$246,805.66 from the workers\u2019 compensation carrier, plus $100,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier, minus the $27,896.28 paid to satisfy the lien of the workers\u2019 compensation carrier).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The difference in these results cannot be justified by a policy consideration of avoiding double recovery by the accident victim. It is agreed in this case that Blackburn\u2019s damages would not be fully compensated in either event. There would be no double recovery by Blackburn under either scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The recent Court of Appeals decision in <em>Lynne Parry, Personal Representative of the Estate of Mark Parry, Deceased v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>408 Md. 130, 968 A.2d 1053 (2009), does not alter my view. The <em>Parry </em>ease gave no indication that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s right of reimbursement in that matter had been satisfied by compromise. Indeed, the <em>Parry </em>case indicates in footnote 6 that the Court of Appeals did not consider the reimbursement limitation in \u00a7 19-513(e) to be pertinent to the issues there under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">When \u00a7 19-513(e) was most recently amended, Chapter 392 of the Laws of 2001 specifically stated that the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d was <em>\u201climiting the reductions available </em>to personal injury protection and uninsured motorist insurers <em>to the extent the workers\u2019 compensation insurer is able to recover benefits paid </em>under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of a state or the federal government.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not need to resort to any aids to statutory construction to divine the General Assembly\u2019s intent. The legislature\u2019s intent is stated explicitly in the enactment itself. And that expressed purpose is <em>to limit the offset </em>that may be taken by an uninsured motorist insurer <em>to the extent </em>that the workers\u2019 compensation insurer <em>\u201cis </em>able to recover\u201d (emphasis added) the benefits that have been paid. The limitation in \u00a7 19-513(e), as amended, should be read in a manner that is consistent with that stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Plainly, at all times since Blackburn made his claim upon Erie for underinsured motorist benefits, because the lien had already been fully satisfied, the amount which Blackburn\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer \u201cis able to recover\u201d for benefits paid is zero dollars. And that should have been \u201cthe extent\u201d of the reduction available to Erie for the workers\u2019 compensation offset under \u00a7 19-513(e). A contrary construction of the statute results in a windfall of nearly $150,000 to Blackburn\u2019s underinsured motorist insurance carrier. I consider that result contrary to the legislature\u2019s purpose and untenable. I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">. Although it is possible the Department of Labor would have required reimbursement in an amount greater than the $27,396.28 it accepted in full satisfaction of its lien if it had known that the tortfeasor's policy limits were $250,000, we have no evidence of that in the record, and must assume, for current purposes, that the lien could have been compromised for the same amount as it was in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
