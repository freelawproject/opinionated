Cons. 5 a. 2 s. The rule is that a Court of Appeals, as such, may award a mandamus, whenever it is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or necessary to enable it to exercise appellate jurisdiction. <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch, 175. In such cases,;the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>with only an appellate jurisdiction, except as to ambassadors, &amp;c., will issue writs of mandamus to the pther <em>United States </em>Courts: as, if a district judge refuse to enforce obedience to his sentence, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>5 Cranch, 115; \u2014 or if he direct the proceedings in a cause to be finally stayed, <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Dorgenois, </em>7 Cranch, 577; \u2014 or order the repeal of a patent in a summary way, and refuse to record the proceedings antecedent to the rule to show cause, and to issue a scire facias to the patentee, &amp;c. Ex parte <em>Wood, </em>9 Wheat. 603. But if the issuing of the writhe an exercise of original jurisdiction, not within the constitution, that Court will not grant it: as, if it is to be directed to the secretary of state to enforce the delivery of a commission, <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>supra; \u2014 or to the register of a land-office, requiring him tq enter an application for land agreeably to an act of congress, the writ having been refused by the highest State Court. <em>M'Cluny </em>v. <em>Silliman, </em>2 Wheat. 369. Whether that Court will, in any case, direct a mandamus to a state Court, is not yet decided. \u2014 A judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Virginia </em>was reversed by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>and the cause remanded. The state Court refused to o-. \u00a1bey the mandate, and to that refusal there was a writ of error. The Supreme Court, deeming it unnecessary to express an opinion respecting its authority to issue a mandamus to a state Court, reversed the judgment on the mandate, and affirmed the judgment of the district Court of the state, which had been reversed by the appellate Court. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter's </em>lessee, 1 Wheat. 304. In commenting on the case last cited, Chancellor <em>Kent </em>expresses his opinion, that the Court might have there issued the writ. He says, that if the appellate jurisdiction be founded, as it no doubt was in that case, on a solid basis, it would seem to carry with it, as of course, all the coercive power incident to every such jurisdiction, and requisite to support it. 1 Kent\u2019s Comm. 301. When the judges of the Circuit Court of the <em>United Stales </em>differ in opinion as tto the execution of the mandate, the point is certified to the Supreme Court for decision, as in other cases. <em>Skillern's </em>Ex\u2019rs v. <em>May's </em>Ex\u2019rs, 6 Cranch, 267. \u2014The <em>Antelope, </em>11 Wheat. 413. If the mandate he executed in a manner different from its directions, the usual remedy is an appeal, or writ of error, according to the nature of the case, <em>Himely </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>5 Cranch, <em>313. </em>\u2014 Dunlop v. <em>Hepburn, </em>3 Wheat. <em>231. </em>\u2014 Campbell v. <em>Pratt, </em>5 Wheat. 429. In such cases, only the proceedings subsequent to the mandate are brought up, and there is no inquiry into the merits of the original determination. <em>Himely </em>v. <em>Rose, supra. </em>\u2014 Browder v. <em>M'Arthur, </em>7 Wheat. 58. But the original proceedings are always before the Court, so far as is necessary to determine any new points in controversy, not terminated by the original decision. The <em>Sania Maria, </em>19 Wheat. 442.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b171-11\">WHEN the judgment of a Circuit Court is reversed, and the proceedings up to a certain point are set aside at the costs of, the defendant in error, and- the cause is remanded for further proceedings; if the Circuit Court refuse to render a judgment for the costs according to the mandate, this .Court will grant a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rule to show cause why a mandamus should not issue <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.
