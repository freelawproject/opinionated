Goodwin, 18 Johns. R. <em>187. </em>\u2014 The <em>United States </em>v. Peres, 9 Wheat. 579.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b274-12\">It has been frequently held, on indictments for misdemeanors, thatifthe Verdict be so imperfect that no judgment can be given on it, the Court may award a <em>venire facias de novo. </em>Vide 1 Chitt.

When the testimony was closed, the prisoner called upon the Court to instruct the jury to find a verdict in his favour, should they be of opinion that the offence proved amounted to burglary. This instruction was refused. The jury having retired, and not being able to agree, separated without leave of the Court. Upon this, the prisoner moved for a discharge. The Court overruled bis motion; discharged the jury against his consent; and awarded a. <em>venire facias de novo, </em>returnable instan ter. The prisoner was then tried and convicted.</p><p id=\"b273-8\"><em>-Held, </em>that there was no error in the proceedings <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p><p id=\"AUs\"> The common law doctrine was formerly said <em>to </em>be, that a Jury ose\u00e9 sworn and .charged, in any criminal case, could not be discharged without giving a verdict. 3 Co. Inst. 110. And it was contended, that this doctrine is recognized by the following clause in the constitution of the <em>United Stales: </em>\u201cNor shall any person be subject, for the same offence, to be twice put inject pardy of life or limb.\u201d Amend. Cons. <em>U. S. </em>art. 5. It is now considered, however, that the common law is, <em>that no one shall be twice tried for the same offence ; </em>and that this is the principle <em>recognized by the </em>American constitution.</p><p id=\"b274-11\">If the term limited by law be about to expire,\u2019 and there be no probability of the jury\u2019s agreeing before the Court must adjourn, they may be discharged* and the prisoner be subsequently tried. <em>The People </em>v. Goodwin, supra. So if, during the trial, a juror or the prisoner be taken suddenly ill, and be unable to attend, <em>the jury </em>may <em>be </em>discharged, and a new trial ordered. Thus, in a, capital case, where a jui\u2019or fell down in a fit and was carried out of Court, the jury were discharged against the prisoner^ consent, though the evidence for the prosecution had been nearly gone through. The jurors\u2019 names were again called, and a twelfth was put into the box. They were all sworn de novo, the prisoner having his right of challenge. The witnesses were also sworn anew. The prisoner Was convicted. Afterwards, in the Exchequer Chamber, the judges, eleven being present, were unanimously of opinion that the proceedings were correct, <em>flex v. </em>Edwards, 3 Camp. 207. There is, also, the following case: An indictment for an assault, with intent to- commit a rape. The examination of the prosecutrix W\u00e1s-nearly concluded, when the prisoner fainted away, and was assisted out of Court.- The prisoner\u2019s counsel were willing that the trial should proceed; but the Court, considering that without the prisoner\u2019s consent the case could not go on in his absence, discharged the jury. Afterwards, during the same term, the <em>prisoner being </em>sufficiently recovered, the jury and witnesses were re-sworn, the trial proceeded as in other cases, and the prisoner was Convicted. <em>Rex </em>v. Streek, 2 Carr. &amp; Payne, 413.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
