Per Best, C. J., in <em>Stead et al. </em>v. <em>Salt, </em>3 Bing. 101. To confess, judgments does not seem to be any part of the ordinary business of a trading company: not more so, certainly, than entering into a submission to arbitration ; which, agreeably to the case cited above, one partner cannot do, ss as to bind the firm, This letter point \u2014 that one partner cannot by a submission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>to </em>arbitration bind his co-partner \u2014 is considered in a note to <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>ante, p. 9, to be unsettled; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em>there cited, deciding that he may! When that note was written, the report of the late case of <em>Stead et al. </em>v. <em>Salt, </em>supra, had not reached this country; nor had the case of <em>Karthaus </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>1 Peters, 222, 228, to the same effect, been then decided. As to the authority of one partner to bind another, vide <em>Posey </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>ante, p. 99, and <em>note. </em>\u2014 Flood <em>v.
