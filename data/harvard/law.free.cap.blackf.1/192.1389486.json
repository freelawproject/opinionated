Plea of payment setting out, conformably to the statute, a charge, inter alia, of 200 dollars on a contract by which the plaintiff had agreed with the defendant, that if the latter would finish, at his own charge, a- boat which they had jointly undertaken to build, he would deliver him 100 barrels of pork to transport to New-Orleans, and pay him freight therefor at 2 dollars per barrel. The defendant avers performance on his part, and a breach on the part of the plaintiff.</p><p id=\"b208-16\"><em>Held, </em>that this plea is insufficient under our statute of set-off} the contract stated sounding only in unliquidated damages.</p><p id=\"b208-17\"><em>Held, </em>also, that <em>there is no material </em>difference between the debts which may be pleaded in payment under our statute, and those which may be set off under the statutes of 2 &amp; 8 Geo, 2. 1 Tidd, 602-3. \u2014 2 Johns. R. 150 <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p><p id=\"b209-3\"> So, If <em>the </em>action be for unliquidated damages, and not for a debt due, \u00a3he defendant cannot set off a debt against the plaintiff\u2019s demand. 3 Stark. Ev. 1311. To authorize a set-off, says Ch. <em>Kent, </em>the debts must be between the parties in their own right, and must be of the same kind or quality, and be clearly ascertained or liquidated. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>3 Johns.
