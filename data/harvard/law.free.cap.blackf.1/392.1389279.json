Stat. 1823, p, 132.</p><p id=\"b408-11\">After judgment, twenty years are allowed in <em>England </em>for bringing a writ of error. Tidd, 1064. In the Supreme Court of the <em>United Stales, </em>five years are allowed. Gordon\u2019s Dig. Art. 525. Five years is the time in this state. Stat. 1823, p. 133. There are exceptions in favour of infants, &amp;c. Ibid. The plea of the statute of limitations concludes by praying that the plaintiff may be barred of his writ of error; and the judgment, if for the defendant, is in accordance with the prayer of the plea. 1 Arch. Pr. 256, 258. There cannot be a judgment of affirmance in such case, because the plea, like that of a release, <em>\u00bfs </em>a confession of errors. 2 Will. Saund. 101, v, <em>note.</em></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
