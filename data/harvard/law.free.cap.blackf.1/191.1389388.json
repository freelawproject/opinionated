Parol proof-of this defence was rejected; and per Ld. <em>Ellenborough, </em>The parol condition is quite inconsistent with the wriiten instrument. The condition for a renewal entirely contradicts the instrument which the defendants have signed. There may,\u201d after a bill is drawn, be a binding promise for a valuable consideration to renew it when due; but if the promise is cotemporaneous with the drawing of the bill, the law will not enforce <em>it. This </em>would be incorporating with a written contract an incongruous parol condition, \u2014 which is contrary,to first principles. <em>Hoare etal. </em>v. <em>Graham et al</em>. 3 Camp. 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b207-10\">AN assignee against an assignor of a sealed note.
