Per Ld. <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Dormer </em>v. <em>Fortescue, </em>2 Atk. 282, 284. \u2014 So, <em>in Chancery, </em>it is an established rule in pleading, that a defendant cannot plead or answer, and demurto the same matter: the former will overrule the latter. It is inconsistent for a defendant to say, he ought not to answer to a bill; and yet to answer to it fully. The rule appears in all the books that treat on the subject. 3 P. Wms. 80, 81. 2 Atk. 284. Coop. Tr. of Pl. 113. Beames\u2019 Plead. 40. \u2014 Per <em>Kent, </em>C., 6 Johns. Ch. Rep, 214, Vide Stat. 4 <em>Anne. </em>\u2014 Ind. Stat. 1817, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>27; 1823, p. 292. In <em>Va. </em>it is held, that, under their statute, a defendant may plead and demur to the same count. <em>Waller\u2019s </em>Ex\u2019rs v. Ellis, 2 Munf. 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b93-10\">THE Court in this case held, that although a'defendant may demur to one count of a declaration, and plead to another, yet that he cannot demur and plead, at the same time, to the same count. 5 Bac.
