He seeks a new trial on the grounds that (1) the judge improperly refused to give instructions on withdrawal from a joint venture, (2) the judge improperly instructed the jury on an aspect of joint venture not pursued by the Commonwealth at trial, (3) the judge erred in allowing the prosecution to present evidence that the defendant was incarcerated prior to the murder, and (4) the prosecutor wrongfully argued facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\"><em>Facts. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. In October of 2003, while the defendant was in jail, his girlfriend at the time broke up with him. In January of 2004, she began dating the victim. During the remainder of the defendant\u2019s incarceration, the now ex-girlfriend received many letters from the defendant, pleading with her to resume the relationship. After he got out of prison in February of 2004, the defendant began to harass the ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, the victim, on the telephone and by confronting them in person, on multiple occasions. At these encounters, he threatened to kill her, members of her family, and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">At around 9 p.m., April 1, 2004, the fatal confrontation between the victim and defendant occurred. The defendant went to the ex-girlfriend\u2019s apartment with a companion, Luis Penn, the codefendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the defendant knocked at the door, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>told that the ex-girlfriend was not there. The defendant then went outside, where he saw the victim\u2019s car. The two occupants of the car, neither of whom was the victim, got out and questioned the defendant as to why he was following them. The defendant took out a gun and told the two men to leave, and that \u201cit\u2019s not with you.\u201d One of the men told him to put down the gun and use his hands, pulling up his shirt to show the defendant that he was unarmed. Shortly thereafter the victim emerged from the ex-girlfriend\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The victim stepped between the defendant and the two men; an argument ensued about the ex-girlfriend. One of the men continued to yell at the defendant to \u201cfight like a man.\u201d The defendant summoned the codefendant over and gave him the gun. After the defendant punched the victim, a fight erupted between the two; all the while the codefendant pointed the gun at the other two men, one of whom left the scene to call the police. The fight moved up the street. The victim broke away from the defendant. A man who was pumping gasoline about a block away saw the codefendant and the victim engage in a face-to-face argument for about thirty seconds, and then he saw the codefendant shoot the victim in the head. He did not see the defendant. The man called 911 on his cellular telephone; he then followed the codefendant to see if he recognized him.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>Withdrawal instruction. </em>The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence of a joint venture, and that the codefend-ant was solely responsible for the victim\u2019s death. He requested an instruction on withdrawal from a joint venture. In light of the lack of evidence demonstrating that the defendant communicated to the codefendant his intention to withdraw from the enterprise, the judge, apparently concluding that there was an insufficient basis to support the withdrawal theory, declined to give the instruction at the close of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Assuming that the defendant properly preserved all issues relating to the withdrawal instruction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we think there was insufficient evidence at trial to warrant a withdrawal instruction. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>conclude, as did the trial judge, that the events immediately leading to the victim\u2019s death happened very quickly, and no \u201cappreciable interval between the alleged termination and the fatal shooting, a detachment from the enterprise before the shooting has become so probable that it cannot reasonably be stayed, and such notice or definite act of detachment that [the] other principal[] in the attempted crime [had] opportunity also to abandon it\u201d occurred here. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, </em>403 Mass. 194, 201 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>302 Mass. 547, 555 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><em>Joint venture instructions. </em>During deliberations, the jury sent the judge a note asking: \u201cDoes [the defendant] have to be [] present at the time of actual \u2018murder\u2019?\u201d In response, the judge instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201ca joint venturer . . . has to be present at or near the scene. But. . . you don\u2019t have to be right at the location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201c[T]he Commonwealth does not have to prove that the defendant was actually present at the scene at the time that the gun was shot, as long as the Commonwealth shows that the defendant was present; that is, was at or near the general vicinity of the crime, at \u2014 at some point during the joint venture. The joint venturer does not have to be there at the culmination of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The defendant contends that in attempting to clarify the \u201cpresence\u201d element of joint venture, the judge inadvertently instructed the jury on a separate theory of the crime, thus depriving the defendant of notice and a chance to defend against it. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 388-389 (2004), discussing the two types of joint venturer liability. We noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caramanica, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 380 (2000), that there is some confusion associated with the need for \u201cpresence\u201d in joint venture cases. While \u201cpresence is <em>not </em>required where a defendant actually \u2018aids or abets\u2019 in the commission of a crime[,] presence generally <em>is </em>required where a conviction is sought on the basis that a defendant \u2018shared\u2019 the principal\u2019s criminal intent (i.e., \u2018mental state\u2019), and may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>merely stood by, but by agreement was ready to assist if necessary\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 381. The parties agree that the Commonwealth submitted evidence only of the latter type of joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The trial judge has \u201cdiscretion ... to choose the form of expression best adapted to make the law intelligible to the jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. 495, 507 (1983). When the jurors asked for clarification on the element of presence, the judge first consulted with the attorneys, and the defense counsel raised no objection. Therefore, to reverse we must find that there was a flaw in the instructions and that the flaw caused a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>430 Mass. 746, 750 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. By describing \u201cpresence\u201d to mean \u201cat or near the general vicinity of the crime ... at some point during the joint venture,\u201d the judge correctly stated the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 34 n.5 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>405 Mass. 326, 329 (1989) (\u201cIt is well settled . . . that individuals may be considered present for joint venture purposes even where they are only \u2018in the vicinity of the crime\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. at 388 (\u201cA defendant need not be at the scene of a crime throughout its occurrence in order to be found a joint venturer\u201d). The judge\u2019s instructions did not change the elements of joint venture from those that the Commonwealth proved at trial, and did not deprive the defendant of the notice required for him to defend against the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Following the reasoning of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lafayette, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 537 (1996), since the defendant here (1) initiated the animosity between himself and the victim; (2) brought the gun to the altercation; (3) threatened on multiple occasions to kill the victim, even stating, \u201cThis is how I want to catch you,\u201d as he pointed the gun at the victim\u2019s head; (4) proceeded to beat up the victim after handing the gun to his companion; and (5) did not engage in any other \u201cwithdrawal\u201d behavior, his presence at the time of the fatal shot is of no consequence in a determination whether he was a joint venturer. Furthermore, the defendant \u201cacted with knowledge of the [crime] and with the intent to assist in the commission of that crime so as to accomplish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>its objective,\u201d which was to harm the victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 646 (2002). Moreover, as already mentioned, the jury were warranted in finding that the defendant made no communication to the codefendant of his lack of intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the victim. In short, his willingness and availability to help his companion (or in this case, his acquiescing to his companion\u2019s shooting of the victim) have been established on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Reference to prior incarceration. </em>The prosecution may not introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, including past incarcerations, \u201cfor the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged .... [It] must be excluded unless it comes within one of the permitted uses, such as to show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986), and cases cited. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404(b) (2008-2009). As the judge observed in his limiting instructions, the evidence was relevant to the location and <em>unavailability </em>of the defendant when the breakup with his girlfriend occurred, and the involuntariness of his absence from the area. The evidence provided context rather than motive, particularly because the ex-girlfriend testified that the defendant did not threaten her or the victim until after he got out of jail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the judge abused his discretion in concluding that this evidence could be admitted under a limiting instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge cautioned the jury strongly against making any connection between the evidence of the defendant\u2019s incarceration and the charge on which he was being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Moreover, there was ample evidence of the contentious relations of the defendant, his ex-girlfriend, and the victim in the two months between the defendant\u2019s release from prison and the murder, from which the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant\u2019s motive for the murder arose from his extreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>reluctance to end his relationship with the ex-girlfriend. Thus, we may fairly conclude that, if the admission of evidence of incarceration was error, \u201cthe error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect,\u201d and that \u201cthe judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><em>Closing argument. </em>In light of the previous discussions regarding the definition of the \u201cpresence\u201d element of joint venture, and the use of the defendant\u2019s prior incarceration, we believe that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s statements here did not exceed the bounds of fair inference from the evidence, and the jury \u2014 admonished by both the judge and counsel to apply their common sense and experience in their deliberations \u2014 did not have to engage in impermissible conjecture in order reasonably to draw the commonsense inference suggested by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 31-32 (2005), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-13\"> Penn was found guilty after a separate jury trial of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> The Commonwealth contends otherwise and argues that our review of some aspects of the defendant\u2019s argument is limited to a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>448 Mass. 501, 506 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> As the defendant properly preserved the error, we review \u201caccording to a nonprejudicial error standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-10\"> Though it is conceivable that the evidence could have been sanitized in some manner to describe the defendant\u2019s unavailability without reference to his incarceration, it is likely that any attempt to do so would have created more confusion than illumination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
