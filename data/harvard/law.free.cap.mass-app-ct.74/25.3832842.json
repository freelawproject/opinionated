(Mid-America), and Clinton C. Goff on the basis of the forum-selection clause set out in his, Karty\u2019s, subscription agreement with Mid-America, which required that the parties resolve any disputes arising thereunder in Kentucky. A Superior Court judge ruled that the clause was enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>and allowed Mid-America\u2019s motion to dismiss. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(3), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). Karty\u2019s argument on appeal is that because he was fraudulently induced to enter into the subscription agreement, the forum-selection clause should not be enforced. Since Karty\u2019s amended complaint fails to contain any allegation that the forum-selection clause was obtained by fraud, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">1. <em>The applicable standard of review. </em>Although the motion to dismiss was based upon a claim of improper venue and brought pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), the judge properly treated the motion as one brought under rule 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). See <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 789-790 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1173 (2006) (motion to dismiss based on forum-selection clause properly treated under rule 12[b][6]). In reviewing a rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of an action, we accept as true the allegations in the complaint as well as any inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Otherwise put, a motion to dismiss brought under rule 12(b)(6) is to be denied unless \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting from <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). See <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 282 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">2. <em>The alleged facts. </em>We recite the facts as set out in Karty\u2019s amended complaint as well as the pertinent provisions of the subscription agreement attached to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Karty is a resident of Massachusetts and Mid-America is a Nevada corporation. In November, 2005, Karty submitted information to an Internet Web site seeking information about investment opportunities. Mid-America responded and sent Karty a prospectus and other materials concerning its sale of interests in a limited liability partnership organized to drill and to operate oil wells in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In its prospectus, as well as in subsequent oral and electronic mail communications, Mid-America or its employees and agents represented the nature of an investment by Karty as one that guaranteed three oil producing wells and assured him that if those wells did not produce oil, Mid-America would drill new wells at its own expense. Mid-America also made representations to Karty relating its history of success in oil drilling ventures, the strength of its financial condition, the amount of income Karty could expect as a result of any investment he might make, and the time frame within which he would receive his first payment of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">On or about December 17, 2005, Karty executed a subscription agreement with Mid-America for the purchase of one unit of a limited liability partnership known as Eagle Oil #5, LLP (Eagle). In that agreement, Karty represented that he was an \u201caccredited investor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the success of that venture did not live up to Mid-America\u2019s representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Initial reports that Eagle had struck oil were followed by continuing reports of production delays accompanied by assurances that such issues would promptly be resolved, that production would \u201cramp [up] shortly.\u201d By the summer of 2006, drilling efforts had failed to yield an oil producing well. Moreover, Karty discovered that Mid-America had misrepresented certain information related to the cause of production delays, avoided or delayed disclosure of information calling into question the viability of Eagle\u2019s wells, and grossly overstated the success and profitability of Mid-America\u2019s other drilling projects while, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the same time, soliciting his investment of additional funds in Eagle or in one of its other drilling projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In July, 2006, Karty brought the present action in which he alleged fraud in the inducement of the subscription agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More specifically, Karty alleged that Mid-America had fraudulently induced his investment by misrepresenting its financial conditions, its history of success in oil drilling ventures, and Eagle\u2019s profit potential</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Section l.N(l) of the subscription agreement signed by Karty reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cI understand and accept that all provisions of this Agreement are made in Warren County, Kentucky, and that exclusive venue and jurisdiction for all matters in dispute shall also be in Warren County, Commonwealth of Kentucky. All disputes and breaches hereunder shall be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association then pertaining in Bowling Green, Kentucky.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">3. Discussion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While sitting in admiralty in <em>The Bremen </em>v. <em>Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1 (1972), the United States Supreme Court considered the enforceability of a forum-selection clause contained in an international towage agreement. There the Court departed from the historic disfavor of such clauses and held that such a clause contained in a \u201cfreely negotiated private international agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, is \u201cprima facie valid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, and should be enforced unless the party seeking to avoid the clause demonstrates that enforcement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>clause would be \u201cunreasonable and unjust,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, that the agreement was \u201cunaffected by fraud, undue influence, or overweening bargaining power,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, or that enforcement would \u201ccontravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. In <em>Scherk </em>v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 519 n.14 (1974), the Court emphasized that <em>The Bremen </em>was not to be read</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201c[to] mean that any time a dispute arising out of a transaction is based upon an allegation of fraud ... the [forum-selection] clause [in a contract] is unenforceable. Rather, it means that an arbitration or forum-selection clause in a contract is not enforceable if the <em>inclusion of that clause in the contract </em>was the product of fraud or coercion\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It was observed in <em>Haynsworth </em>v. <em>The Corp., </em>121 F.3d 956, 962 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1072 (1998), that Federal courts \u201chave not hesitated to apply <em>[The </em>Bremen\u2019s] enforceability standards in non-admiralty cases.\u201d When faced with the question of the enforceability of a forum-selection clause, Federal courts consistently have held that general allegations of fraud in the inducement of a contract are an insufficient basis for declining to enforce the clause, and that a party seeking to avoid a forum-selection clause on grounds of fraud must show that inclusion of that clause in the contract was the result of fraud. See, e.g., <em>Haynsworth </em>v. <em>The Corp., supra </em>at 963 (fraud and overreaching must be specific to a forum-selection clause to invalidate it; allegations of fraud as to the contract as a whole or as to portions other than the forum-selection clause are insufficient; claims of fraud or overreaching must be aimed straight at the forum-selection clause to succeed). See also <em>Marano Enterprises of Kansas </em>v. <em>Z-Teca Restaurants, L.P., </em>254 F.3d 753, 757 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>Lipcon </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>148 F.3d 1285, 1296-1297 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1093 (1999); <em>Afram Carriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moeykens, </em>145 F.3d 298, 301-302 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied sub nom. <em>de Penta </em>v. <em>Afram Carriers, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 1141 (1999); <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>135 F.3d 1289, 1296-1297 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 943 (1998); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Kingsley Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 969 </em>F.2d 953, 960 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1021 (1992); <em>Moses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>v. <em>Business Card Exp., Inc., </em>929 F.2d 1131, 1138 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 821 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Karty has not provided us with any Massachusetts precedent or authority that squarely addresses the question whether general allegations of fraud in the inducement of a contract constitute a sufficient basis for declining the enforcement of a forum-selection clause. There is, however, language in Supreme Judicial Court decisions that indicates that the \u201cfraud\u201d exception to the enforceability of forum-selection clauses is more limited than Karty contends and that Massachusetts is in accord with Federal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Mailboxes Etc. U.S.A., Inc., </em>419 Mass. 572, 574-575 (1995), the court adopted the view expressed in Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 (1988 revision) (\u201cThe parties\u2019 agreement as to the place of the action will be given effect unless it is unfair or unreasonable\u201d). In so doing, the court made particular reference to \u00a7 80, comment c, which provides that a court will decline to enforce a forum-selection clause \u201cif it finds that <em>the provision was obtained </em>by fraud, duress, the abuse of economic power or other unconscionable means\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Mailboxes Etc. U.S.A., Inc., supra </em>at 575 n.5, quoting from Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 comment c (1971 &amp; rev. 1989). See <em>Cambridge Biotech Corp. </em>v. <em>Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics, </em>433 Mass. 122, 130 &amp; n.8 (2000), wherein a fomm-selection clause was upheld absent any showing that enforcement of that clause would be unfair or unreasonable while also noting that the party resisting enforcement of the clause had failed to allege that it had been obtained by fraud, duress, or the abuse of economic power or other unconscionable means.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from all that we have said that because the allegations set out in Karty\u2019s complaint and amended complaint speak only to fraud in the inducement as to the entire subscription agreement and fail to allege or set out any facts concerning the specific question whether the forum-selection clause was obtained by fraud, we see no error in the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\"> The standard for the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) was modified in <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008). As therein stated, a complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . [based] on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, quoting from <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Application of the standard enunciated in <em>Iannacchino </em>would not change the result we reach in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> The fact that the judge considered the subscription agreement in ruling upon the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss did not convert the motion to dismiss into a motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 n.4 (2004) (where plaintiff alleging securities fraud had notice of offering memorandum and subscription agreement and alleged reliance upon them in framing complaint, attachment of such documents to motion to dismiss did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>convert that motion to one for summary judgment). See also <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. Fisher, 387 Mass. 889, 892 (1983); 11 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 56.30[4] (3d ed. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\"> As set out in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 846 (8th ed. 2004), an \u201caccredited investor\u201d is \u201c[a]n investor treated under the Securities Act of 1933 as being knowledgeable and sophisticated about financial matters, especially] because of the investor\u2019s large net worth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> Karty\u2019s complaint, as amended, also set out claims of breach of contract, conversion, fraud, negligent and intentional misrepresentation, and violations of G.

The judge concluded that the courts of both jurisdictions \u201capply a substantially similar standard\u201d in determining the enforceability of such clauses and relied on Massachusetts authorities in allowing the dismissal of Karty\u2019s action. Because Karty does not argue this question on appeal, we do not consider it. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Moreover, it appears from the record before us that Karty relied upon Massachusetts and Federal authorities in the Superior Court. See <em>TAL Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>CSC Consulting, Inc., </em>446 Mass. 422, 431 (2006), regarding the doctrine of the \u201claw of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
