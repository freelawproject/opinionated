The issues arise from a stop, patfrisk, and arrest of the defendant on a porch and in the common area of an apartment house in the Mission Hill section of Boston. The patfrisk produced a handgun and ammunition. After the defendant\u2019s arrest, police officers also found a substance believed to be marijuana and a pill of apparent Class E character in the possession of the defendant. The defendant sought to suppress that evidence as well as statements made to officers after his arrest. We affirm the judge\u2019s order suppressing the evidence and statements. The ground of decision is that the stop and patfrisk lacked the support of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><em>Background. </em>In the absence of clear error, the motion judge\u2019s findings are final. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990). We supplement those findings with uncontested testimony from the motion hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), and cases cited (appellate courts \u201cmay supplement a judge\u2019s finding of facts if the evidence is uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony\u201d). In this instance, the detail and clarity of those findings are especially helpful for the application of appropriate doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The only two witnesses to testify at the hearing were Boston police Officer Michael Flaven and Marielis Rosado, the defendant\u2019s female companion at the time of the events in question. At the end of the hearing the judge stated, \u201cI found the officer to be very credible, and I thank him for his honesty.... I find him to be a credible, hardworking officer who was investigating a legitimate 911 call.\u201d At the same time, the judge derived critical findings from Rosado\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980) (\u201cThe determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses . . .\u201d). Although the judge\u2019s findings describe Rosado as the defendant\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d Rosado did not use that term to describe their relationship. Nevertheless, in light of the testimony of the two witnesses, which the judge credited either explicitly or implicitly, the finding that Rosado was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>On Saturday, September 2, 2006, at approximately 5:00 a.m., Officer Flaven and Officer McDonough received a dispatch on their police radio stating that a 911 caller had reported an attempted breaking and entering of a residence at 13 Sachem Street in the Mission Hill neighborhood. The dispatcher described the suspect as a twenty-four year old white male wearing blue jean shorts and a gray T-shirt with orange stripes and \u201csome kind of writing on the front.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In uniform and in a marked police vehicle, the officers drove past 13 Sachem Street and did not see any evidence of an attempted breaking and entering. The officers had not noticed any pedestrians or moving vehicles in the vicinity until Officer McDonough saw the defendant walking on Hillside Avenue, which runs perpendicularly to Sachem Street. The officers noticed that the defendant was wearing a white T-shirt under a long-sleeved, multicolored, button-down shirt and was accompanied by a woman, later identified as Marielis Rosado.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The officers wanted to question the defendant to determine whether he was involved with the attempted breaking and entering reported in the dispatch. The series of one-way streets in the neighborhood required them to drive around the block to approach the defendant. When they reached him, he was walking with Rosado on Darling Street, which runs in parallel to Sachem Street and perpendicularly to Hillside Avenue. As he walked, the officers drove alongside him. One of the officers asked him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>his name. He replied truthfully, \u201cJose.\u201d The officers noticed that the defendant was Hispanic and had light-colored skin. He appeared to be in his early twenties. He appeared also to be nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">After the defendant\u2019s response, the officers stopped their vehicle and got out. They followed the defendant and Rosado up a set of stairs onto the front porch of 30 Darling Street, a small three-story apartment house where Rosado lived. As Officer Flaven approached the defendant, he noticed that the defendant\u2019s shirt was long-sleeved and gray with \u201ca little bit of blue in it,\u201d as well as with vertical \u201corange stripes.\u201d Officer Flaven noticed also that the defendant had a cast on his arm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant had not attempted to flee from the officers nor had he made any furtive gestures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">On the porch, the officers asked the defendant for identification. He produced a Massachusetts identification card. As they examined the card, the defendant and Rosado entered the apartment house. The defendant then locked the building\u2019s front door.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He stood behind Rosado, put his hands on her hips, and whispered something in her ear.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He then walked up the flight of stairs inside the front door.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Rosado remained immediately inside the door. Officer Flaven told her, \u201cOpen the door or I\u2019ll fucking kick it in.\u201d She was afraid that, if she did not open the door, the officer would have forcibly entered the building and caused property damage. So she unlocked and opened the door. Officer Flaven entered the building and climbed the stairs to meet the defendant. He grasped the defendant and brought him downstairs and outside. Officer McDonough conducted a patfrisk of the defendant and found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>loaded handgun. Officer Flaven then asked the defendant for his license to carry a firearm. The defendant told the officers that he did not have one. They placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">As the officers led the defendant away from the building, he said to Rosado, \u201cBye, bye baby, see you later. I am going away for a long time.\u201d At the police station, Officer Flaven advised the defendant of his Miranda rights. The defendant told the officer that he had found the gun and that he carried it because he had been shot at twice. Police searched the defendant during the booking process and found marijuana and a small blue pill. With regard to the pill, the defendant, without being asked, told Officer Flaven, \u201cIt\u2019s Viagra. The girl I was with tonight. I was going to use it with her.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The motion judge concluded that the officers had not seized or stopped the defendant when they had stood on the porch with him, asked for identification, and received his identification card. She concluded further that Officer Flaven\u2019s warrantless entry into 30 Darling Street was unlawful because it lacked the support of probable cause and exigent circumstances or consent. She suppressed all evidence seized from the defendant and all of his postarrest statements as the products of the unlawful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>From the findings by the motion judge, we \u201cmake an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles\u201d to those facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996). The reviewing court may affirm a suppression decision upon any ground supported by the record, even if the motion judge did not rely upon it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503 n.7 (1996), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eggleston, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 363, 367 n.4 (2008), <em>S.C., </em>453 Mass. 554 (2009). We conclude that the stop and frisk of the defendant lacked the support of reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution standards of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974). That deficiency provides an independent and alternative basis for suppression of the evidence and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>1. <em>The stop and frisk, </em>a. <em>The stop. </em>Under Massachusetts law, a police officer has seized a person \u201cif, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 791 (1985), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.). When an officer pursues a person and the pursuit, viewed objectively, indicates that the person is not free to leave the area without responding to the officer\u2019s inquiry, the officer has seized that person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 789 (1996). An officer may seize a person if he reasonably suspects that the \u201cperson has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. at 405. That reasonable suspicion must \u201cbe based on specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406. \u201cThe facts and inferences underlying the officer\u2019s suspicion must be viewed as a whole when assessing the reasonableness of his acts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 764 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We must allow officers \u201cto take account of the possibility that some descriptive facts supplied by victims or witnesses may be in error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emuakpor, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 198 (2003), quoting from 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.4(c), at 241 (3d ed. 1996); 4 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 201 (3d ed. 1996). Thus, reasonable suspicion can exist \u201cabsent a full match-up of all parts of the description.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Yet \u201c[njeither evasive behavior, proximity to a crime scene, nor matching a general description is alone sufficient to support the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a stop and frisk.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">At no point during the encounter did the officers reasonably suspect that the defendant had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 405. The defendant\u2019s appearance did not sufficiently resemble the dispatcher\u2019s description of the person who had allegedly attempted a breaking and entry. The defendant is Hispanic and has light-colored skin. The dispatcher described the suspect as white. The defendant was wearing a white T-shirt under a long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sleeved, button-down shirt, and he had a cast on one arm. His shirt was multicolored, with both blue and gray elements and some orange stripes. The dispatcher described the suspect as wearing a gray T-shirt, with orange stripes and with script on the front. The dispatch did not refer to a long-sleeved shirt or to an arm cast. The defendant was wearing long pants, not blue jean shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The presence of Rosado, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, has significance. The dispatcher did not cite the accompaniment of a woman. When the officers first spotted the defendant, he was with Rosado. Her presence, viewed objectively, decreased suspicion that the defendant was the person who allegedly had attempted the breaking and entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">b. <em>The frisk. </em>An officer may frisk a person for weapons if a reasonably prudent person in the officer\u2019s position \u201cwould be warranted in the belief that the safety of the police or that of other persons was in danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. at 406. \u201c[T]he officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>but the officer must be aware of specific facts warranting a reasonable person to fear for his safety. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. at 102 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Here, the officers\u2019 observations do not support a reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra. </em>The dispatcher did not report that the person who attempted the breaking and entering was armed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 11, 18 (2005), and cases cited (lack of reports of weapons at crime scene was one factor contributing to conclusion that frisk was unlawful). Nor did any element of the defendant\u2019s conduct suggest that he had a weapon or that he intended to harm anyone. The officers did not see the defendant assault, or attempt to assault, anyone. See <em>ibid, </em>(no observation of assaultive conduct was another factor contributing to conclusion that frisk was unlawful). He made no furtive gestures, such as grabbing his waistband or shielding part of his body from the police, and the officers did not observe a bulge in his clothing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 601 (1992) (officers\u2019 observation of defendant reaching into his pants was one factor supporting lawful frisk); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 371-372 (2007) (defendant shielding bulge in his jacket from police contributed to finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra </em>(frisk unlawful where, in addition to other factors, police did not see bulge or furtive gestures).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, a reasonable person would not have feared for his safety after witnessing the defendant\u2019s behavior. See <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. at 102; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 512-514 (2009) (insufficient facts to support reasonable inference that defendant was armed and dangerous). More than any other factor in this case, the invalidity of the frisk bars the resulting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">c. <em>Countervailing evidence. </em>The defendant\u2019s proximity, in both time and location, to the reported attempted breaking and entering would draw police attention. The streets of Mission Hill were deserted at 5:00 a.m. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Car-rington, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 529 (1985) (two factors supporting probable cause for arrest were early morning hour and short distance between location of stop and crime scene); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 476, 480 (2007) (stop was proper where motor vehicle was driving away from crime scene within minutes of crime and was only vehicle on road). The defendant\u2019s abandonment of his identification card by retreat behind a locked door created some suspicion. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 645 (1988) (flight from police after consenting to search and before police pursuit provides reasonable suspicion). Nonetheless, the combination of those factors did not accumulate to a level of reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed, was committing, or was about to commit, a crime. Nor did that combination equal a reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We do not decide whether the officers seized the defendant on the porch prior to his entry of 30 Darling Street, although that conclusion could be reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 175-176 (2001) (officer\u2019s pursuit of defendant by leaving cruiser, approaching him after being rebuffed, and ordering him to \u201c[c]ome here\u201d was highly relevant in determining whether defendant was seized); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. at 370-371 (defendant not seized because officers used conversational tone, did not block defendant\u2019s path, and did not order defendant to stop or answer questions), and cases cited. At the latest, the defendant was seized when Officer Flaven grasped him on the stairway.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A reasonable person would not feel free to leave when a police officer had mounted a flight of stairs and taken hold of him after ordering his companion to open a locked door and threatening to kick it in. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1989), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554 (opinion of Stewart, J.) (two examples of police conduct evidencing seizure are \u201cphysical touching of the person of the citizen\u201d and \u201cuse of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled\u201d). It makes no difference, though, whether we determine that the seizure or stop occurred when Officer Flaven grasped the defendant or at an earlier point in time. Under either analysis, the officers did not have reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in criminal conduct or a reasonable belief that he was armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>2. <em>Unwarranted, entry of the residential building. </em>At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the judge invited the oral argument of all counsel upon the issues of both the validity of the stop and frisk and the police entry into the residential building without a warrant. The Commonwealth responded that the entry had resulted both from the consent of Rosado because she had unlocked and opened the door and from the exigent circumstance of the defendant\u2019s likely flight and escape through another exit. The Commonwealth made no reference to the rationale of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dora, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144-148 (2003), that the tenants of a multi-unit residential building enjoyed only a qualified or diminished expectation of privacy in its common area hallways and therefore only reduced constitutional protection against police entry and search in those places, even trespassory police entry.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judge invited posthearing memoranda upon all suppression issues. The Commonwealth, as appellant, has not included in its record appendix any written memorandum demonstrating its presentation of a subsequent <em>Dora </em>argument to the judge. It had the duty to do so or else suffer the waiver of the argument on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Best, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 729 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacobbe, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 149 (2002). After her thorough subsidiary findings, the judge rested her decision of suppression exclusively upon the ground that the police entry into the hall and stairway had constituted the invasion of a dwelling without freely given consent and without probable cause to search in exigent circumstances. Her discussion contained no reference to the authority or reasoning of <em>Dora. </em>On appeal, the Commonwealth has relied upon the authority of the <em>Dora </em>reasoning in its brief and oral argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>From the record we infer that the Commonwealth did not provide, and therefore waived, any <em>Dora </em>argument to the motion judge. Even if it had done so, and even if we were to find <em>Dora </em>applicable to the present facts so as to justify police entry into the hall and stairway, the ensuing stop and frisk would independently remain unjustified and the resulting evidence suppressed for the reasons covered above.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">3. <em>Statements. </em>The defendant\u2019s postarrest statements were results of the unjustified stop and frisk. They too require suppression. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 795-796 (1985) (evidence excluded as tainted product of sequence in which \u201cinitial stop was improper and the subsequent actions occurred as an immediate and direct result of that illegality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The specific supported findings of the motion judge show that the disputed contraband and statements resulted from an invalid stop and frisk and required suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> The judge\u2019s findings state that \u201c[tjhe suspect was described in the broadcast as a 24 year old white male wearing a gray T-shirt with an orange stripe.\u201d In the recording of the dispatch, which the judge heard at the motion hearing, the dispatcher says that the suspect was \u201cwearing a gray t-shirt with orange stripes. There\u2019s some kind of writing on the front of the shirt . . . and blue jean shorts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">If police rely upon a radio broadcast or dispatch to conduct a threshold inquiry, the Commonwealth must demonstrate a basis of reliable information in support of the transmitted information. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riggieri, </em>438 Mass. 613, 615-617 (2003). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 867, 872, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1021 (2005). If the source of the broadcast information is anonymous, the Commonwealth may cure the unreliability of the informant by police observation or corroborating details of the broadcast information. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 19 (1990). In the present case, no evidence indicated the reliability of the broadcast and no observation of the police supported the report of an attempted break-in. These deficiencies weaken the basis for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity of the defendant discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> Officer Flaven testified to the defendant\u2019s appearance as the officers approached him on foot.

I agree with the majority that on this record there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that at the time of the patfrisk of the defendant the police had a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts and the reasonable inferences that follow therefrom that the defendant was armed and dangerous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would not address the separate question, which is not necessary to our decision, whether there was reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to support the stop of the defendant in the apartment building prior to that patfrisk.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> I would also note that in his very limited testimony about the patfrisk Officer Flaven did not suggest that either he or his partner had any subjective suspicion that the defendant was armed or dangerous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
