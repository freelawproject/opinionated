L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and threatening to commit a crime, G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, but only as to the charge of threatening to commit a crime. He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of both convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>We rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), omitting some details that will be addressed in our analysis below. On April 27, 2007, Paul Emmett was seated in the lobby of the Worcester police station when the defendant, Stephen M. Hokanson, entered. It was about 2:45 p.m. The defendant sat next to Emmett. Emmett testified that the defendant then made reference to things having been different \u201cwhen so-and-so was police chief ... it wasn\u2019t like this.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At this time the defendant lowered his voice and began talking about the poor shooting skills of the officers, to which he could personally attest, having \u201cshot with them.\u201d He later repeated these comments while standing. Emmett described the defendant\u2019s demeanor at this time as \u201cpretty volcanic,\u201d and \u201cterribly upset, terribly angry about something.\u201d The defendant then sat down, leaned over, gesturing by pointing a simulated \u201ctrigger-finger,\u201d and whispered to Emmett: \u201cThe next time I come in here, boom, boom, boom, boom. Every fuckin\u2019 one of them. Nobody will be standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Emmett then proceeded to try to get the police officers\u2019 attention without alerting the defendant. The defendant then stated, \u201cNow, that guy in Texas, he was a good shot. It\u2019s a shame what he did, but he was a good shot.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Emmett then got up to try to get the attention of an officer, but was unable to do so. He left the lobby in search of a police officer, but instead encountered some sort of \u201cdelivery guy.\u201d Just then, the defendant walked past Emmett with a cigarette in his mouth and left the building. Emmett testified that \u201cat that moment [I decided] to just grab the first person I could and tell them, \u2018That guy just threatened to shoot a bunch of you officers.\u2019 \u201d And he did in fact do that. The response was swift; several officers went outside and surrounded and pat frisked the defendant, fearing he was armed. The defendant, not wanting to be pat frisked, was uncooperative, and began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cflailing\u201d and \u201cshouting.\u201d An indeterminate number of people gathered around to see \u201cwhat was going on.\u201d At trial, Officer Ronald Remillard, one of the responding officers, testified that the people were \u201calarmed.\u201d Remillard then arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">2. <em>Disturbing the peace. </em>The defendant contends that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support a conviction of disturbing the peace. \u201cAs used in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended by St. 1943, c. 377, the phrase \u2018disturbers of the peace\u2019 is construed in accordance with the common-law definition of the offense, mating it a crime \u2018to disturb the peace of the public, or some segment of the public, by actions, conduct or utterances, the combination of which constitute[s] a common nuisance.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 493 (1971).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 711, 714 (2007). A two-part test is used to determine whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes disturbing the peace. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734-735 (1977). \u201cIt proscribes activities which, first, most people would find to be unreasonably disruptive, and second, did in fact infringe someone\u2019s right to be undisturbed. The first prong is normative and protects potential defendants from prosecutions based on individual sensitivities. The second prong requires that the crime have a victim, and thus subjects potential defendants to criminal prosecution only when their activities have detrimental impact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cTime and place are factors to be considered in determining whether activities are \u2018unreasonably disruptive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra </em>at 714-715, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, supra </em>at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Under this two-part test, the defendant\u2019s actions constituted a disturbance of the peace. After confronting the defendant, Officer Ronald Remillard testified that the defendant was \u201cshouting,\u201d \u201cflailing,\u201d \u201cagitated,\u201d and \u201cuncooperative.\u201d In addition, Remillard testified that there was heavy foot traffic in the area and that a group of people who appeared \u201calarmed\u201d began to gather. Thus, the fact finder could reasonably have inferred that the average bystander would have found the defendant\u2019s conduct at the time of his arrest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cflailing\u201d and \u201cshouting\u201d outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of a police station \u2014 \u201cunreasonably disruptive,\u201d as evidenced by the bystanders\u2019 alarm. See <em>Federico, supra </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">3. <em>Threatening to commit a crime. </em>The defendant contends that his words and actions did not constitute a threat because he did not intend for his words to be communicated by Emmett. Put another way, the defendant asserts that absent evidence demonstrating his express purpose to have a third party communicate his words, he should not have been convicted. We disagree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">A threat, although undefined in the statute, has been formulated in the case law to mean \u201can expression of intention to inflict a crime on another and an ability to do so in circumstances that would justify apprehension on the part of the recipient of the threat.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maiden, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 434 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milo M., </em>433 Mass. 149, 151 (2001). See G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. Though not explicitly stated, communication is a critical element \u201cof the threat in the sense that it must be uttered, not idly, but to the target, to one who the defendant intends to pass it on to the target, or to one who the defendant should know will probably pass it on to the target.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maiden, supra </em>at 435. When the threat is communicated directly, there is usually very little doubt about intent. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 724-725 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 980 (2001). The issue, however, is more difficult to resolve when an intermediary is involved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furst, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 285 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>When an intermediary separates the defendant from his intended target, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant intended that the threat be communicated through the intermediary. ... In such cases, the defendant\u2019s intent need not be express and may be proved by circumstantial evidence. . . . \u2018Thus, when a defendant utters a threat to a third party who \u201cwould likely communicate it to [the ultimate target],\u201d ... the defendant\u2019s act constitutes evidence of [his] intent to communicate the threat to the intended victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[i]n analyzing a putative threat, we eschew a technical parsing of the words used and instead consider the entire context in which a statement is made, including the defendant\u2019s actions and demeanor at the time, and prior communications between the defendant and the recipient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 520, 528 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We need to address only the question whether the defendant\u2019s conduct evidenced an intent to communicate his threat through the intermediary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think a reasonable fact finder could draw the inference that a defendant who enters a police station should reasonably have expected that a stranger who saw him point his finger at a group of police officers and pantomime the killing of those officers, while uttering the words, \u201c[t]he next time I come in here, boom, boom, boom, boom. Every . . . one of them. Nobody will be standing,\u201d would communicate that threat to the officers. It appears that the defendant would have no expectation of silence on Emmett\u2019s part. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 282 (2002) (the defendant communicated her intentions to the intermediary, an attorney, whom she believed \u201cto be in league\u201d with the intended target, also an attorney). Combining these actions \u2014 the defendant\u2019s \u201cvolcanic\u201d posturing in a police station (shortly before uttering those words), his prior statement that he was a better shot than the policemen \u2014 with a \u201cclimate of apprehension,\u201d the statements of the defendant\u2019s apparent intent, and the probable awareness that he was communicating with someone (here, a stranger) who would likely pass it on to the targets, leads to the conclusion that the evidence constituting a threat was more than sufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maiden, supra </em>at 435. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (2007) (conviction upheld where the defendant disclosed to a court-ordered therapist his intention to kill the intended target after the therapist told him such disclosures were not privileged and would be communicated to the \u201cappropriate authorities\u201d). Moreover, the threatening gesture was made in a public area, plainly visible to the police officers themselves. Though there is nothing in the record to indicate that any police officer observed the gesture, the lack of any attempt at concealment belies any suggestion that the defendant merely sought to confide solely in Emmett. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maiden, supra </em>at 434. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furst, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. at 285-286 (conviction overturned where the intermediary was solicited to murder the intended target, not to communicate the threat), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 387 (2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., supra </em>at 525-526. There, \u201c[t]he question . . . [was] whether a defendant can be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt where ... the alleged threat was communicated to its purported target by a third party to whom the communication of the threat by the [defendant] was itself indirect.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 525. Included among the factors the court suggested might be permissible to support an inference of a defendant\u2019s intention to communicate a threat were whether the \u201c[defendant] made his comment at an abnormal vocal level, glanced at [the intermediary] or other nonparticipants as he made it, gestured in an attention-seeking fashion, or knew that [the intermediary] regularly eavesdropped on conversations and dispersed overheard comments to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527. Here, Emmett was no eavesdropper; the defendant sat down, closed the distance between himself and Emmett, and spoke to him directly while gesturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> The defendant\u2019s failure to move for a required finding of not guilty on the second count does not limit our review, as \u201cfindings based on legally insufficient evidence are inherently serious enough to create a substantial risk of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> Emmett testified that he thought the defendant apparently was referring to the police officers conducting a vote in the background.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> Emmett testified that he believed the defendant was referring to the Virginia Polytechnical Institute and State University shootings that had taken place eleven days earlier on April 16, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> The defendant\u2019s attempt to draw a parallel between a footnote in <em>Federico </em>and the instant case misses the mark. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra </em>at 715 n.5. Although this court affirmed Federico\u2019s conviction of disturbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the peace in <em>Federico, </em>the court refused to do so on \u201cthe basis of his conduct at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that where the evidence adduced failed to demonstrate that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct [was] disruptive, violent or threatening,\u201d it was insufficient to support a conviction. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the Commonwealth presented evidence that showed that the defendant was not only \u201cuncooperative,\u201d but that he was \u201cflailing\u201d and \u201cshouting,\u201d and that he caused a \u201ccommotion.\u201d The circumstances described in the <em>Federico </em>footnote are distinguishable from the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> To satisfy intent, we look at more than a defendant\u2019s specific intent that his threats be made to the target; we also look at whether he \u201cshould reasonably have expected that it would be communicated to [the target] by [Emmett].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maiden, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 434 (2004). To adopt the defendant\u2019s standard would create situations where a defendant who conveys to an intermediary a threat to harm another (the target), but who does not expressly instruct the intermediary to convey that threat to his intended target, would have the simple explanation that it was not his purpose to have the threat communicated. That is not the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\"> We are satisfied that all the other elements constituting a threat are present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> In <em>Troy T., </em>the court held that an \u201ceavesdropper\u201d has an \u201conerous\u201d burden to prove that the defendant intended to use her as an intermediary to communicate to the target, absent \u201cany contextual details that might substantiate such an inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
