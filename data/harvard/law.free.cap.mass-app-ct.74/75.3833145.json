Subsequent to the jury trial, the same judge heard the remaining two indictments. These two charged drug offenses and were dependent on the admission of an audio-video recording that the defendant claims was inadmissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">1. <em>Violation of G. L. c. 94C on indictments tried to a jury. </em>Pointing to the statutory definitions of \u201cdispense\u201d and \u201cultimate user\u201d in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, the defendant claims that his convictions were not supported by the evidence. He does not seriously dispute that there was evidence that he prescribed the drugs and that the prescriptions were not written in good faith for legitimate medical purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, he asserts what he terms an issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>law, namely, that he cannot be convicted of illegally dispensing the drugs, under the definitions in \u00a7 1 of c. 94C. Those definitions in relevant part state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201c \u2018Dispense\u2019, [means] to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject. . . by a practitioner or pursuant to the order of a practitioner, including the <em>prescribing </em>and administering of a controlled substance. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201c \u2018Ultimate user\u2019, [means] a person who lawfully possesses a controlled substance for his own use or for the use of a member of his household. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1972, c. 806, \u00a7 3; G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The defendant argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the convictions for false prescribing by unlawfully \u201cdispensing\u201d controlled substances because the evidence fails to establish that the \u201cultimate users\u201d were lawful possessors of such substances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the statute presents difficulties when only the definitions of \u201cultimate user\u201d and \u201cdispense\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are examined, the defendant\u2019s conclusion is not in accord with the interpretation given to the statute by our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Recognizing that G. L. c. 94C poses certain problems, our cases emphasize that the separate provisions of the statute must be read in context with its other provisions in order to construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the statute as a harmonious whole. General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a), as amended through St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 7, the statute the defendant principally is charged with violating, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201c(a) Any person who knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, dispenses, or possesses with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance in Class B of section thirty-one shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years, or in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half years, or by a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than ten thousand, dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">As noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 812 n.3 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32G, standing alone, would appear to prohibit the delivery by a physician to a patient of medically necessary prescriptions in all instances. However, those sections must be read in conjunction with G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 26. When read together, the several sections provide that a registered physician is authorized to prescribe medically necessary controlled substances if required procedures are followed, but not otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 595 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 226 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 946 (1977), the defendant made an argument similar to the contention of the present defendant. Pointing to the statutory definitions, he argued that a practitioner can be charged with dispensing only when the delivery is a lawful one. <em>Id. </em>at 225. The court, however, noted, \u201cIf \u2018dispensing\u2019 only can be a lawful act under G. L. c. 94C, it is difficult to explain why the word appears in \u00a7 32 to describe unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim and emphasizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that the word \u201clawful,\u201d while originally contained in the statutory definition, was deleted by the Legislature in 1972, the court held that \u201c[a] physician who issues a prescription not intending to treat a patient\u2019s condition in the usual course of his practice of medicine does not issue a valid prescription, and he thus violates \u00a7 32.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232. \u201cA physician who unlawfully issues a prescription for a controlled substance may \u2018dispense\u2019 a controlled substance. . . . There is nothing in [the] definition which indicates that the controlled substance or the prescription must be delivered lawfully.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. The court then gave an expansive interpretation of \u201cultimate user,\u201d holding that undercover police officers given unlawful prescriptions, i.e., prescriptions not for legitimate medical purposes, were in lawful possession of the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 230-231.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Subsequently, the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 4 n.4 (1987), stated, \u201cBoth [G. L. c. 94C,] \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 32A[,] are involved in the crime of unlawful dispensing of a controlled substance.\u201d Section 19(a), as amended through St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201cA prescription for a controlled substance to be valid shall be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice. The responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances shall be upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding responsibility shall rest with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. An order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research is not a prescription within the meaning and intent of section one and the person knowingly filling such a purported prescription, as well as the person issuing it, shall be subject to the penalties provided by sections thirty-two, thirty-two A, thirty-two B, thirty-two C, thirty-two D, thirty-two E, thirty-two F, thirty-two G, and thirty-two H, as applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Without mention of the term \u201cultimate user,\u201d the court in <em>Chatfield-Taylor </em>explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he essential elements of the crime of unlawful dispensing of a controlled substance are set out in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19\u201d (footnote omitted). 399 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>at 4. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 318, 321 (1999), is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7 2.49.5, Supplemental Instruction (c) (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 1999 &amp; Supp. 2003), are in accord, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018dispense\u2019 means the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance to an ultimate user by a practitioner, or pursuant to the order of a practitioner, including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The jury instructions do not define ultimate user. The comment to the instruction, other than setting forth the full definition of dispense in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, refers only to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. at 321-322, and to note 3 of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. at 812, set forth above, to the effect that when read together the several sections of the statute provide that a registered physician is authorized to prescribe medically necessary controlled substances if required procedures are followed, but not otherwise. \u201cDispense\u201d in our cases has thus been construed to encompass the elements in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, without reference to the definition of ultimate user.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">This also is the prevailing view under the Federal law. The Federal Controlled Substance Act defines \u201cdispense\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in language more problematic than the Massachusetts definition and has a very similar definition for \u201cultimate user.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802 (10), (27) (2006). Both the Massachusetts statute and the Federal statute define \u201cdistribute\u201d as to deliver, other than by administering or dispensing, a controlled substance. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11) (2006).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Without discussing the form of the indictment that charged the defendant with \u201cknowing and unlawful distribution and dispensation\u201d of controlled substances, the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 124 (1975), held that the defendant, a registered physician, could be prosecuted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 for dispensing or distributing controlled substances. Prior to that decision, the United States Courts of Appeals for the First and the Ninth Circuits, based on the term \u201clawful\u201d in the Federal statutory definition of \u201cdispense,\u201d see note 9, <em>supra, </em>held that \u201cdistribution\u201d is the offense committed by a defendant physician who writes prescriptions not in the course of professional medical practice. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Badia, </em>490 F.2d 296, 298 (1st Cir. 1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Black, </em>512 F.2d 864, 866 (9th Cir. 1975). Later cases in both circuits diluted the distinction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Limberopoulos, </em>26 F.3d 245, 247 (1st Cir. 1994) (conspiring to dispense); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Feingold, </em>454 F.3d 1001, 1003, 1010-1011 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1067 (2006) (convicted of distribution but broad language). The majority of United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue have affirmed convictions in cases charging \u201cdistribution\u201d as well as in cases charging \u201cdispensing\u201d or have upheld cases charging \u201cdispensing or distribution.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The model Federal jury instructions for dispensing, see 3 Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal 56-15 (2008) (set forth in the margin<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>), contain the words \u201cdispensed or distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>buted,\u201d but do not mention \u201cultimate user.\u201d The comment to the instruction states: \u201cThe better view, and the one adopted here, is that dispensing is the distribution of drugs by a practitioner, and so, that a practitioner can be charged with either dispensing or distributing. Thus, as far as practitioners are concerned, \u2018the terms dispense and distribute . . . have no functional difference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56-40, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fellman, </em>549 F.2d 181, 182 (10th Cir. 1977). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. at 227 n.6, after discussing Federal cases that distinguish between distributing and dispensing, the Supreme Judicial Court expressed a similar view, stating: \u201c[T]he choice of words should not be permitted to become crucial, and judicial time can be better spent trying to resolve more important questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">After considering both the Massachusetts and Federal cases, we conclude that the most rational construction of this problematic statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the one which best furthers the intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Legislature, is to construe G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, which deals comprehensively with prescriptions, as an amplification of the words \u201cincluding the prescribing . . . of a controlled substance,\u201d contained in the definition of \u201cdispense.\u201d As stated by our cases, \u00a7 19 sets forth the elements of the offense of dispensing in the circumstances of physicians writing prescriptions for other than a legitimate medical purpose.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendant may not claim prejudice by this construction. The indictments were clear and sufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Comins, 371 Mass. at 224-225; G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 38. The defendant\u2019s actions were unlawful under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19. Whatever the label, the defendant knew which of his actions were involved, and the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was evident from the start. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 57 (1982) (no possible risk of a miscarriage of justice because indictments alleged distribution rather than dispensing).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">2. <em>Medicaid violations. </em>As the defendant points out in his brief, the \u201cMedicaid Fraud\u201d indictments depend upon the \u201cFalse Prescribing\u201d indictments. Accordingly, since we have upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>those convictions in part 1 of this opinion, the Medicaid fraud convictions as well as the larceny conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">3. <em>Motion to suppress audio-video recording. </em>The recording in question was not in evidence at the jury trial, but was only in evidence for the bench trial. The motion judge (who was also the trial judge) found that the recording of the defendant made on July 1, 2005, was obtained as part of an investigation that \u201cwas [Fjederally run from start to finish.\u201d His subsidiary findings support this ultimate finding and were not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, he was correct in ruling that the admissibility of the tape was governed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gonzalez, 426 Mass. 313, 314 (1997).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-16\"> The headings of the indictments charging violation of G. L. c. 94C contained the term \u201cIllegal Prescribing Class B [or C]\u201d and listed the specific drug. The text of each indictment stated that on a certain date the defendant \u201cdid knowingly or intentionally distribute or dispense [the specific drug] in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>[G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a) or \u00a7 32B(a)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\"> The basis for the larceny conviction was that the defendant falsely informed Medicaid that certain office visits by patients were legitimate. The defendant does not make a separate argument as to the larceny conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> The defendant was also convicted of possession of controlled substances. He does not argue that this conviction should be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> Having scant hope of an acquittal on the two jury-waived offenses in the face of the audio-video recording showing his improper actions, the defendant entered into a \u201cStatement of Agreed Facts\u201d that, he claims, would preserve his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress the audio-video recording. In the statement of agreed facts the defendant admitted that he had prescribed OxyContin and hydrocodone to a named patient for several months with the understanding that the patient would fill the prescriptions and give some of the tablets to the defendant. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19(6) (\u201cNo prescription shall be issued in order for a practitioner to obtain controlled substances for supplying the practitioner for the purpose of general dispensing to patients\u201d). The defendant\u2019s statement also acknowledged that a specific prescription was not written in good faith for a legitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The defendant\u2019s appeal from the convictions tried to a jury and the appeal from the bench trial convictions were consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> The charges which resulted in convictions by the jury involved patients who were given prescriptions for OxyContin, roxicodone, or other narcotics. After examining the defendant\u2019s records, two physicians (experts) testified that the prescriptions were not issued in good faith or for a legitimate medical purpose. This conclusion was based on the facts that in some instances the defendant prescribed oxycodone to patients even after they tested positive for other illegal drugs and negative for oxycodone. He prescribed narcotics for other patients whom he knew had been heroin abusers or whom he knew had been seeking drugs on the street or from a hospital. He failed to test one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>patient for drugs at all and tested three of them only after a visit from the Medicaid fraud control unit. There was testimony from a former receptionist that he could on average see fifty to eighty patients a day. When asked how many patients he saw, the defendant answered, \u201cIt can vary from 20 to 50, occasionally 70.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-15\"> The defendant raised this issue several times by motion for a required finding of not guilty after the Commonwealth\u2019s opening, and after the Commonwealth rested. He also objected to the judge\u2019s charge. In his motions, he argued that the defendant also could not be found to have \u201cdistributed\u201d controlled substances because \u201cdistribution\u201d requires a finding of possession either actual or constructive, and there was no evidence that he possessed the drugs. At the defendant\u2019s request the judge, after his main jury charge, specifically told the jury that the offense with which the defendant was charged was limited to \u201cdispensing\u201d and that the word \u201cdistributing\u201d was surplusage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b111-16\"> In other sections of G. L. c. 94C, including other definitions, the use of the term \u201cultimate user\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1 may be appropriate. See, e.g., G.

I agree with the majority that the defendant\u2019s convictions for Medicaid fraud and larceny should stand, and that his motion to suppress was properly denied. I must respectfully dissent, however, from the portion of the majority opinion that affirms the defendant\u2019s convictions under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A(a) and 32B(a). In my view, the express text of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, precludes a ruling that the crimes of dispensing and distributing are interchangeable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Massachusetts cases addressing that point directly are in agreement. Here, whether correctly or otherwise, the illegal prescribing indictments were presented to the jury strictly as dispensing charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unambiguous statutory text and pertinent Massachusetts case law are in accord that dispensing, by defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tion, does not occur unless the recipient of the controlled substance belongs to a narrow, statutorily defined, class of people. That requirement may indeed be hypertechnical. It remains, however, an element of the offense presented to the jury. Moreover, as the majority acknowledges, defense counsel assiduously brought this point to the attention of the prosecutor and trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that those who received the defendant\u2019s supposed prescriptions belonged to the class of people to whom controlled substances have the capacity to be dispensed, and that dispensing therefore had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I agree. The Commonwealth presented no evidence directly on the point, and the evidence that it presented on other points, where relevant, tended to show that the recipients of the defendant\u2019s false prescriptions were not people to whom the delivery of controlled substances would constitute dispensing as that term is defined by statute. Neither the prosecutor nor the judge acknowledged the statutory definition of dispensing, and despite the defendant\u2019s objections the jury were not instructed that the word carried a specialized meaning distinct from that which it has in everyday parlance. For these reasons, I would reverse the illegal prescribing convictions for want of legally sufficient evidence. Even if the evidence were sufficient, I would set aside the verdicts on the illegal prescribing charges and remand for a new trial, as the jury instructions provided in this case omitted an element required to establish the crime of dispensing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 689 (2002). In turn, I shall discuss the statutory definition of dispensing and then explain why, in my view, the construction adopted by the majority is inconsistent not only with the text of the statute itself, but also with applicable Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">1. <em>Definition of dispensing. </em>The defendant was charged with violating G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A and 32B. These sections criminalize <em>all </em>knowing or intentional manufacture, distribution, or dispensation of certain controlled substances, along with the possession of these substances with an intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense them. Section 19(a) of G. L. c. 94C, inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1, exempts from criminal liability all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>dispensing that occurs by means of a prescription, which by the \u00a7 19 definition is \u201cissued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing each are terms of art defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. For our purposes, any delivery that is not a dispensation is a distribution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To dispense is \u201cto deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject or to the agent of an ultimate user or research subject by a practitioner or pursuant to the order of a practitioner, including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance and the packing, labeling, or compounding necessary for such delivery.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1972, c. 806, \u00a7 3. Dispensing via delivery to a research subject or to an agent of any kind shall not be discussed further, as there is no evidence that any such delivery occurred in this case. Therefore, if the defendant dispensed, he must have done so to an \u201cultimate user.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An ultimate user, as defined by \u00a7 1, is \u201ca person who <em>lawfully </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>possesses a controlled substance for his own use or the use of [specified others]\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence established that the patients to whom the defendant allegedly dispensed were not lawful possessors, and therefore could not have been ultimate users. The result, then, would be that no dispensing had occurred. The defendant contends that the patients could not have been lawful possessors because G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 33(6), as amended through St. 1974, c. 102, renders it criminal to \u201cknowingly or intentionally acquire or obtain possession of a controlled substance by means of forgery, fraud, deception or subterfuge, including . . . nondisclosure of a material fact in order to obtain a controlled substance from a practitioner.\u201d There is evidence suggesting such machinations by some of the patients. But, more to the point, the burden here is on the Commonwealth, which ignored the necessary element and, consequently, offered neither such evidence below nor argument here, so that the record does not permit a finding that any of the patients to whom the defendant allegedly dispensed would have been a lawful recipient (and, hence, an ultimate user) of the controlled substances at issue. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). As such, the convictions for dispensing are not supported by the evidence and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">2. <em>Construction of G. L. c. 94C. </em>As an initial matter, I agree with the majority that the various sections of G. L. c. 94C, when read together, make it clear that \u201ca registered physician is authorized to prescribe medically necessary controlled substances if required procedures are followed, but not otherwise.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 80. However, it does not therefore follow that all conceivable transgressions of that rule constitute dispensing, which has an unambiguously particularized meaning. Some transgressions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>may constitute dispensing, but others will constitute distributing. The distinction itself may seem trivial, but the principle that requires it to be observed is fundamental. The courts must ensure that convictions have integrity, and that process entails demanding proof of all elements, trivial or otherwise, beyond a reasonable doubt. The specter of prosecutors being found to have come \u201cclose enough\u201d is not an eventuality to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">It is unlikely, therefore, that the court\u2019s admonition in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 227 n.6 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 946 (1977), that \u201cthe choice of words [i.e., dispense or distribute] should not be permitted to become crucial,\u201d was intended to mean that courts should overlook the express text of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, and treat the words \u201cdispense\u201d and \u201cdistribute\u201d as synonyms. First, the purpose of the court\u2019s comment was to encourage amendment of the statute. Second, the principal question presented in <em>Comins </em>was whether any doctor, in any circumstance, could be charged with the offense of dispensing. The comment, it seems, was addressed strictly to that aspect of the controversy. When the time came to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence as to each element of dispensing, the court treated the \u201cultimate user\u201d requirement quite seriously. Indeed, part of the court\u2019s holding was that undercover police officers, when acting within the scope of their investigatory duties, qualified as ultimate users within the meaning of \u00a7 1. <em>Id. </em>at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I acknowledge the majority\u2019s citation to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 4 (1987), wherein the court stated that \u201c[t]he essential elements of the crime of unlawful dispensing are set out in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, which states that \u2018[a] prescription for a controlled substance [is valid if it is] issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted). The issue in <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>however, was whether the evidence at trial sufficed to prove that the defendant was a practitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. The elements of the offense were, quite simply, not in dispute. Similar is the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317 (1999), relied upon by the majority for the same proposition. The elements of dispensing were not contested in <em>Pike, </em>where the sufficiency of the evidence dispute concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>whether the prosecution had carried its burden to show bad faith or lack of medical purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">By contrast, where the court has addressed the issue squarely, it has stated with absolute clarity that lawful possession by the recipient of controlled substances is an element of the crime of dispensing. I have already discussed the <em>Comins </em>case, <em>supra. </em>Even more compelling is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 812 (1984), wherein the court held that a physician, who prescribed controlled substances to himself without medical justification, could not be convicted of dispensing because he did not possess the controlled substances lawfully and thus did not satisfy the definition of an ultimate user. The court there stated that \u201ca physician \u2018dispenses,\u2019 within the meaning of our controlled substances statute, only if he or she prescribes a controlled substance for someone whose possession will be lawful.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Notwithstanding the various interpretations given to the analogous provisions of the Federal Controlled Substances Act in the United States Code, it is my conclusion that the Massachusetts statute, and pertinent decisional law, compel a result other than that reached by the majority. As such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">3. <em>Charges for Medicaid fraud and larceny. </em>In connection with the various prescriptions and office visits found by the jury to have been without an intended medical purpose, the defendant was convicted of Medicaid fraud (G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 40) and larceny over $250 (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30). These crimes, unlike that of unlawful dispensing, do not have an \u201cultimate user\u201d element. The Commonwealth presented evidence sufficient to prove each element of these crimes, and therefore I agree with the majority that these convictions must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> The offenses are, very much to the contrary, mutually exclusive. The statute defines \u201cdistribute\u201d as \u201cto deliver other than by administering or dispensing . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> Addressing the jury, the judge said: \u201c[Yjou\u2019ll see language in [the indictments] about an allegation that the Defendant did dispense or distribute; and you may have noted in my elements as I listed them, I talked only about dispensing. That word distribute is surplus. There is a technical definition of distribute that may apply in other types of drug law crimes. It\u2019s not of concern here in our case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> The Commonwealth clearly met its burden of proving that the \u00a7 19 exemption did not apply, as there was abundant evidence that the purported prescriptions were not issued with an intent to advance a valid medical purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> See note 1, <em>supra. </em>I take no position whether the defendant should have been charged with dispensing, distributing, or some combination of both, as that determination would require information beyond the scope of the record. Such confusion and uncertainty can be eliminated altogether by bringing prosecutions like the present under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, which incorporates by reference the penalties set forth in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 32A, 32B, 32C, 32D, 32E, 32F, 32G, and 32H, as applicable, and does not implicate the dispensing-distributing dichotomy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> Unlike the majority, I do not read the final two clauses of the definition \u2014 i.e., those addressing prescribing, administering, packing, labeling, and compounding \u2014 to expand, in any way, the more general definition set out by the preceding clauses. As the prefatory word \u201cincluding\u201d indicates, these clauses merely list some common instances of dispensing that are entirely consistent with the general definition. The clauses do not expand the concept of dispensing to include actions not covered by the general definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The majority emphasizes that the definition of dispensing expressly includes prescribing. While true, that observation is inapposite because, as the majority acknowledges, the defendant issued no prescriptions within the meaning of the statute. That conclusion is compelled by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, which states, in relevant part: \u201cAn order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research is not a prescription within the meaning and intent of [\u00a7 1] . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> The rationale for the decidedly counterintuitive ultimate user (or research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>subject or agent) element is elucidated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 812 n.3 (1984). \u201cThe primary purpose of the prohibition against dispensing [i.e., against delivery to one who would be in lawful possession notwithstanding the illegality of the delivery itself] is to require practitioners to register with the Commissioner of Public Health . . . and to keep records and maintain inventories.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The offense of dispensing is a device by which to hold doctors criminally liable where their conduct, but not necessarily that of their patients, is wrongful. In other words, the delivery is criminal but the corresponding receipt and resulting possession are not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
