L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, moved to suppress evidence seized from his person and from the motor vehicle he had been operating when stopped by the police. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the judge made findings and allowed the motion to suppress. After receiving leave from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), the Commonwealth appeals from the judge\u2019s order. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">1. <em>The suppression hearing. </em>We recite the facts taken from the judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by uncontroverted facts adduced at the hearing that were explicitly or implicitly credited by the judge, in order to complete the sequence of the events in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>423 Mass. 517, 518 n.1 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337-338 (2007). On March 13, 2007, at approximately 10:30 p.m., State Trooper Sean Barry was driving on St. James Avenue in Springfield in an unmarked police cruiser behind the defendant, who was operating a Chevrolet Impala. When the defendant failed to come to a complete stop at an intersection marked with a stop sign, Bany activated his lights and pulled the car over. There was one passenger in the car, David Gainey, seated in the front passenger seat. Upon request, the defendant provided Barry with a valid driver\u2019s license and, in lieu of a registration, a rental agreement from Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company (Enterprise). From his vantage point outside the driver\u2019s door, Barry could see Dutch Masters cigars and laundry dryer sheets on the floor of the car\u2019s back seat area. Although these items were not inherently incriminating, Bany knew that Dutch Masters are often used to smoke marijuana and that dryer sheets are often employed to mask the odor of marijuana. However, Barry did not smell marijuana or see signs of drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Upon a closer examination of the rental agreement, Barry saw that it was expired and that the car was overdue by one day. When Barry made an inquiry of the vehicle through the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), it was revealed that the same car had been \u201cqueried\u201d by the Barnstable police department within the last thirty days. Through another trooper with whom he worked, Barry had specific knowledge of narcotics being transferred between Springfield and Barnstable through the use of rental cars. At this point, Barry requested that a canine unit be dispatched to the scene. Barry\u2019s partner, Trooper Gallant, was able to contact Enterprise and confirm that the rental agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>for the car had expired the day before. According to the defendant, a trooper asked for the car keys, which the defendant provided, and the trooper told him that Enterprise did not \u201cwant [the defendant] in the vehicle.\u201d After this exchange, State Trooper Brian Gladu arrived with the canine.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Trooper Gladu placed a \u201cdrug collar\u201d around the dog\u2019s neck, which, along with verbal commands, indicates to the dog that he will attempt to smell the presence of drugs. When Gladu walked the dog around the car\u2019s exterior, the dog stopped at the driver\u2019s door and jumped at the window, which indicated the presence of either marijuana or narcotics. Gladu then instructed Barry and Gallant to remove the defendant and Gainey from the car to permit the dog to smell the car\u2019s interior. Inside the car, the troopers found a plastic bag of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine in the area where the defendant had been reaching. When the defendant was pat frisked, marijuana was found in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">2. <em>The judge\u2019s decision. </em>The judge determined that the initial stop of the defendant for the motor vehicle infraction was lawful. However, she held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201c[o]nce the license was produced and there was no report that the car was reported stolen, this driver should have been sent on his way with a citation. The cigars and dryer sheets are items commonly sold and owned for innocent purposes. There was no odor of marijuana or other observations to link these items to possible use with controlled substances. Detaining the driver for 15 minutes or 1 hour beyond the point of checking the license and car status was not justified. The search was unlawful and the fruits of the search will be suppressed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>When reviewing a motion to suppress, we afford substantial deference to the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact and will not disturb them absent clear- error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978). \u201cOur review of the application of constitutional principles to those facts, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>is plenary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaupp, </em>453 Mass. 102, 105 (2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catanzaro, </em>441 Mass. 46, 50 (2004). The initial stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was, as the judge properly found, justified in this case because the trooper saw the defendant\u2019s failure to stop at a stop sign in violation of G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 9. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 673 (2001). The only issue presented here is whether the continued detention of the properly licensed defendant, while the police investigated the car\u2019s expired rental agreement and summoned a canine unit, was reasonable and proportional to the unfolding circumstances that suggested the defendant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity beyond the violation for which he was initially detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the touchstone of our analysis of police conduct that results in a search or seizure is whether that conduct was reasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 346 (1989). The reasonableness of the particular conduct at issue here involves an evaluation of whether the police exceeded the permissible scope of the stop, which is an issue of proportion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 323 (2001). \u201cThe degree of suspicion the police reasonably harbor must be proportional to the level of intrusiveness of the police conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 116 (1996). \u201cIn order to expand a threshold inquiry of a motorist and prolong his detention, an officer must reasonably believe that there is further criminal conduct afoot, and that belief must be based on \u2018specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. 72, 77 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 243 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judge determined that whether the duration of the stop was fifteen minutes or one hour, once the defendant produced a valid license and the police had no report that the car was stolen, the police were required to send the defendant on his way with a citation for the motor vehicle infraction. If the defendant\u2019s driving documents had been in order, we would agree. But they were not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although found by the judge and undisputed by the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the judge seemingly ignored the fact that the rental agreement for the car had expired. This supports an articulable suspicion beyond the scope of the initial stop, justifying further investigation into the defendant\u2019s authority to operate the car. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a). Telephoning Enterprise to determine the status of the car was reasonable and proportionate to the circumstances. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Henley, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">When the police made contact with Enterprise, they were informed that the rental company no longer authorized the defendant\u2019s use of the rental car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this point, which, according to the defendant, occurred before the canine unit arrived, the police could have impounded the vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henley, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 5 (police properly impounded rental car on highway where neither the driver nor the passengers were authorized by the rental agreement to operate the car). Permitting the defendant to remain in the car until the canine unit arrived was also a reasonable and proportionate response to what had unfolded in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Furthermore, although the police could have impounded the vehicle because the defendant was no longer authorized to use the rental car, the police were not required to immediately take those actions. Instead, given the escalating suspicion that emerged over the course of the stop, it was reasonable for them to utilize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the drug-detecting canine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. at 323. In circumstances more compelling than in <em>Feryenord, </em>where the type of criminal activity that might have been \u201cafoot\u201d was \u201cdecidedly uncertain,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. at 80, the suspicion here was specifically related to drag activity. As the judge found, there was a box of cigars and dryer sheets in the car. While the judge is correct that cigars and dryer sheets are commonly used for lawful purposes, it is also true that \u201ca combination of factors that are each innocent of themselves may, when taken together, amount to the requisite reasonable belief.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 545 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>450 Mass. 818, 824 (2008). The otherwise innocent presence of cigars and dryer sheets must be evaluated along with Trooper Barry\u2019s articulated knowledge that Dutch Masters cigars are often used to smoke marijuana and that dryer sheets are often employed to mask the odor of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In addition, the judge found that the Barnstable police had \u201cqueried\u201d the car within the last thirty days. This fact implies that the car had recently drawn enough attention from the Barn-stable police to trigger a license plate check. These facts and inferences gain significance when coupled with Barry\u2019s testimony that he knew that rental cars were being used to transport narcotics between Springfield and Barnstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Faced with facts supporting his suspicion that the defendant was involved in criminal activity, and that the defendant was no longer authorized to use the rental car, Barry was permitted to exercise his judgment as to what resources were available to him and diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel his suspicion of drug activity. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. at 80. Requesting a canine unit was a reasonable and less intrusive alternative to immediately impounding the vehicle or conducting a full search of the car. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. at 324. The fact that the duration of the stop was no longer than one hour also supports the reasonableness of the troopers\u2019 actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judicial second-guessing of that exercise of judgment, especially in a rapidly developing situation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>is inappropriate. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, supra. </em>Finally, once the dog indicated the presence of narcotics in the car, the police had probable cause to search it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra. </em>The marijuana found in the defendant\u2019s pocket was properly seized incident to his arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clermy, </em>421 Mass. 325, 328 (1995). The order suppressing the marijuana and cocaine was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> Without making a specific finding as to the duration of the encounter, the chosen range was most likely based on the judge having noted that \u201cTrooper Barry testified that the stop and search was conducted within 15-20 minutes . . . [and the defendant] and Mr. Gayney <em>[sic] </em>testified that they were detained over an hour.\u201d As the judge chose one hour as the end of the range, she implicitly did not credit the testimony that the encounter lasted longer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> It is important to distinguish this case from the cases on which the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ant relies where the driver of a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation produces a valid driver\u2019s license and registration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 505 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60, 61-62 (1982). \u201cWhere an officer conducts an uneventful threshold inquiry giving rise to no further suspicion of criminal activity, he may not prolong the detention or expand the inquiry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. at 78 n.5. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. at 243-244; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158-159 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> The Commonwealth did not argue, and we therefore do not address, the issue whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a vehicle that he did not own and was not authorized to operate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henley, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 5 n.6, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>396 Mass. 711, 714-715 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>424 Mass. 409, 411-412 (1997) (\u201cdefendant has the burden of establishing that the government has intruded on his . . . reasonable expectation of privacy, thus establishing that a search has taken place\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\"> We need not decide whether the fact that Enterprise no longer authorized the defendant to operate the rental car provided the police with probable cause to arrest him for use of a motor vehicle without authority in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. at 78-81, the court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>that the thirty-minute stop was not unreasonable. There, the defendant driver did not produce a valid driver\u2019s license and the car was registered to another person, but there was no indication that the defendant was not authorized to use the vehicle, and the type of criminal activity he may have been involved in was uncertain. As noted by the court, <em>id. </em>at 81 n.11, some jurisdictions have found detention lasting more than sixty minutes to be reasonable under the circumstances. See <em>ibid., </em>citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>77 F.3d 522, 532 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 991 (1996), and cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>519 U.S. 1093 (1997) (\u201cseventy-five minutes reasonable where defendant gave evasive responses to official inquiries\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moffatt, </em>450 N.W.2d 116, 118-119 (Minn. 1990) (\u201csixty-one minute stop permissible\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>72 F.3d 507, 515-516 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Early </em>v. <em>United States, </em>518 U.S. 1007 (1996) (upholding sixty-two-minute stop); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Soto-Cervantes, </em>138 F.3d 1319, 1322-1324 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 853 (1998) (detention for sixty-five minutes permissible where, apart from initial investigation of drug activity, police suspected defendant was an illegal alien, requiring further investigation with immigration officials).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
