The basis for the board\u2019s denial was its determination that the intersection of the proposed private way leading to High Street, a public way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>violated the city\u2019s centerline offset requirement (offset requirement)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that a waiver of that requirement should not be granted. On the applicants\u2019 appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, the judge, sitting jury-waived, ordered entry of judgment for the board. On their appeal from that judgment, the applicants argue that the judge was in error in finding and concluding that approval of their plan required a waiver of the offset requirement and, in the alternative, that if approval of their plan did require a waiver, the judge erred in ruling that the board\u2019s denial of the waiver was proper. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">1. <em>The facts. </em>As established by the documentary and testimonial evidence before us, the applicants\u2019 property is known and numbered as 223 High Street. Prior to 1980, the locus was part of a larger parcel of land owned by Virginia Hamilton (Hamilton land). Subsequent to Hamilton\u2019s death, the Hamilton land was conveyed on August 26, 1981, to J. Normand and Diane Jutras subject to the condition that \u201c[a]ny development of said premises shall be designed in such a manner as to protect the natural setting and no more than four dwellings are to be constructed thereon.\u201d A few days later, the futrases conveyed the land to the Jutras Family Trust (Jutras).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Jutras thereafter submitted a definitive subdivision plan (the 1982 plan) prepared by Paul Turbide of Port Engineering Associates, Inc. The 1982 plan called for the division of the Hamilton land into three lots, two of which were required to be accessed from High Street. As designated on the proposed 1982 plan, the two lots to be accessed from High Street were Lot 2A and the lot labeled as \u201cN/F Diane C. Jutras\u201d (the Jutras lot). The third lot, Lot 2B, eventually became the applicants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">According to the 1982 plan, the only access to Lot 2B from High Street would be by a proposed private way off High Street. At the time of Jutras\u2019s submission of the plan to the board, the private way did not satisfy the city\u2019s then-existing offset requirement of 125 feet. To gain the board\u2019s approval of a waiver of the offset requirement as it related to the private way, Jutras agreed to certain conditions, which were recorded as covenants at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Essex County registry of deeds with reference to the 1982 plan. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The conditions imposed by the board required that dwellings on Lot 2A and the Jutras lot remain single-family dwellings and front on High Street, and that any further subdivision of the land comply with the city\u2019s subdivision rules and regulations. Turbide testified in the Superior Court that the purpose of the first condition was to ensure that only one lot, Lot 2B, would derive access from the private way while the other two lots would be accessed directly from High Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Lot 2B was purchased by the applicants in November of 1991; prior to that time, a dwelling had been constructed on Lot 2A, which, contrary to the conditions for approval of the 1982 plan, does not front on High Street. The private way shown on the 1982 plan has never been built. Instead, both the applicants\u2019 Lot 2B and Lot 2A gain access to High Street from a gravel driveway that coincides in small part with the private way shown on the 1982 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On June 3, 2002, the applicants filed an application for definitive subdivision approval of a plan (the 2002 plan) to subdivide Lot 2B into three lots.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their requested subdivision would increase the number of lots utilizing the private way to four, that is, Lot 2A and the three lots to be created by the subdivision of Lot 2B. As of December 9, 1998, \u00a7 6.8.9 of the board\u2019s rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land (rules and regulations) required the offset to be a minimum of 150 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The centerline of the private way at the point of its intersection with High Street, measured perpendicularly, is less than 150 feet from the centerline of Kent Street where it intersects with High Street to the east of the applicants\u2019 property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sequently, the applicants needed to obtain a waiver of the offset requirement for approval of their definitive subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Turbide assisted the applicants in preparing their preliminary plan. In so doing, he identified seven minor waivers that would be necessary for approval of the proposed subdivision. However, as the board informed him, he failed to identify the need for a waiver of the offset requirement for the private way necessary for approval of the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">When the applicants thereafter submitted an application for approval of a definitive plan, again prepared with Turbide\u2019s assistance, the board held meetings on July 17, 2002, and October 9, 2002, for the purpose of discussing and considering the applicants\u2019 plan. Two days later, on October 11, 2002, the board unanimously voted to deny the application for approval of the plan and so notified the applicants. The board\u2019s disapproval of the plan was based upon its determination that the plan failed to depict compliance with \u00a7 6.8.9 of its rules and regulations pertaining to centerline offset requirements. As also determined by the board, a waiver of the offset requirement was \u201cnot in the public interest, or consistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">After a jury-waived trial during which the judge took a view of various properties as they related to the offset requirement and traffic concerns, the judge found and concluded that the applicants were required to obtain a waiver of the offset requirement before obtaining the board\u2019s approval of their definitive subdivision plan and that the board did not abuse its discretion in denying the applicants\u2019 request for the required waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing the board\u2019s disapproval of the applicants\u2019 subdivision plan and the denial of their request for a waiver of the offset requirement, the judge and we are \u201cconfined to the reasons for disapproval of the subdivision plan stated by the planning board.\u201d <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 831, 836 (2002), quoting from <em>Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Weston, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 742 (1998). On the applicants\u2019 appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>judge was required \u201cto conduct a hearing de novo, find the relevant facts, and . . . determine the validity of the board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Fairbairn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Barnstable, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 173 (1977). It was the applicants\u2019 burden to show that the board had acted improperly in disapproving their subdivision plan. Compare <em>Selectmen of Ayer </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ayer, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 545, 548 (1975) (burden of proof on party alleging subdivision improperly approved). Based upon our review of the materials before us and for the reasons set out below, we conclude that the judge correctly determined that the applicants had failed to meet their burden of showing that the board abused its discretion in denying them a waiver of the offset requirement and approval of their subdivision plan. See <em>Loring Hills Developers Trust </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. 343, 352 (1978) (single reason supporting denial of approval sufficient to uphold board\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">a. <em>The waiver requirement. </em>According to the applicants, approval of their subdivision plan was not dependent upon a waiver of the centerline offset requirement. They argue that because the private way had been approved previously under the 1982 plan, they needed no further approval under their 2002 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As previously stated, the applicants\u2019 property includes Lot 2B and the private way from the 1982 plan. Although the private way did not meet the centerline offset requirement, the board waived that requirement and approved the 1982 plan on the specific condition that any further subdivision of the land comply with future rules and regulations of the board. That condition and others to which Jutras agreed were recorded as covenants at the Essex County registry of deeds with reference to the 1982 plan. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The judge found that the applicants\u2019 2002 subdivision plan reflected at least one change to the private way. Both the applicants and the board acknowledge that the 2002 proposed plan reflects a change in the location of the cul-de-sac. However, the point at which the private way fronts on High Street remained intact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More significant, however, is the fact that the applicants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>2002 plan would violate the recorded covenants made in gaining board approval of the 1982 plan by allowing four lots rather than one to front on the way depicted in the 2002 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It was the board\u2019s obligation to ensure that all aspects of the applicants\u2019 proposed 2002 subdivision plan were in compliance with the 1998 rules and regulations, particularly in light of the 1982 covenant between the board and Jutras requiring compliance with controlling board rules and regulations pertaining to any further subdivision of the land. Because the applicants failed to sustain their burden, compare <em>Selectmen of Ayer </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ayer, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. at 548, of showing that their proposed subdivision did not violate the terms of the 1982 covenants concerning their land, we conclude that it was necessary for them to obtain a waiver of the board\u2019s 1998 rules and regulations with which the plan failed to comply. Taken together, the covenants meant that the 1982 waiver from the offset requirement was limited to a subdivision wherein only one lot would gain access to High Street by means of the private way. While the applicants might be able to rely on the 1982 waiver to finally constmct the private way shown on the 1982 plan (a question not presented to us, and which we need not decide), it does not entitle them to expand the three-lot subdivision approved in 1982 to a five-lot subdivision, as proposed on the 2002 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">b. <em>The board\u2019s denial of the waiver. </em>We review the board\u2019s decision to deny the applicants a waiver of the offset requirement while keeping in mind that its decision \u201ccannot be disturbed unless it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary,\u201d <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970), and that a planning board may grant a waiver \u201cwhere such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Section 81R provides planning boards with a considerable amount of discretion in determining whether to require or to waive strict compliance with their rules and regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Mac-Rich Realty Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Southborough, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 79, 85-86 (1976). Moreover, a board is not required to make findings in support of its discretionary decision to waive regulations. <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 808 (1981). However, \u00a7 81R requires that the court consider two factors in determining whether a board\u2019s grant of a waiver was an appropriate exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 808-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The first factor concerns consideration of the board\u2019s duty to ensure that the grant of a waiver is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d As stated in <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, supra </em>at 809:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cIf, in a given case, [the board\u2019s decision] is one as to which reasonable minds might in good faith differ, without doubting the reasonableness of the opposing view, the conclusion reached by the planning board should be sustained on judicial review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Because \u00a7 81R delegates authority to planning boards, the only question left to this court is whether the board exceeded its authority in denying the applicants a waiver of the offset requirement. The applicants\u2019 burden to show that the board\u2019s refusal to grant them a waiver of that requirement on the basis that it was not in the public interest to do so is a burden that has been described as \u201cnearly insupportable.\u201d <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Wayland, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 657 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The second factor to be considered under \u00a7 81R is whether a waiver would be inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. Our standard of review on this point is \u201cmore exacting.\u201d <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 809. Here the waiver of a regulation will be upheld as proper unless the inconsistency promoted by the waiver is determined to be substantial. See <em>ibid. </em>For example, we have held that a board abused its discretion in waiving a regulation requiring the \u201cowner of record\u201d of the land to sign the subdivision plan and be present at the board\u2019s hearings on the plan. See <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Yarmouth, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 104, 108-109 (1991). Although courts in some instances have held that a planning board abused its discretion in granting a waiver of its rules and regulations, it is a rare occurrence for a court to disturb a board\u2019s discretionary decision to deny a waiver of compliance based upon its strict adherence to its rules and regulations. See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 171 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 359 (1996) (\u201c[w]e are aware of no reported case or other authority that orders or requires a board to grant a discretionary waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">To overturn the board\u2019s denial of the applicants\u2019 request for a waiver of the centerline offset requirement would also require us to conclude that the granting of a waiver would not have been inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. Compare <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 808-809. <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 836, 838-839, presents a rare example of a judicial determination that a board abused its discretion in denying a request for a waiver on this basis. Our decision there was based upon evidence showing that no safety implications were in fact raised by the proposed waiver of the limitation of dead-end roads to 500 feet, that similar waivers had been granted in the past, and that the board acted in bad faith in attempting to limit the number of lots in the proposed subdivision to fewer than were otherwise permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The applicants in the case before us presented no such compelling evidence; we cannot say that it was unreasonable for the board to find that the grant of a waiver would be inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M; note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>As established on the materials before us, which include the judge\u2019s observations made during a view of the streets in question on a weekday at about 9:30 a.m., High Street and Kent Street, both of which are major and extremely well-traveled city streets, intersect very near to where the private way would front on High Street. Moreover, evidence of the fact that board members may have inquired about the applicants\u2019 plans for future development of their property falls far short of constituting sufficient evidence to show that the requested waiver was denied on the basis of evidence comparable to that found by the court in <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">It is for these reasons that we conclude on the materials before us that it cannot be said that the applicants have sustained their burden of showing that the board\u2019s denial of a waiver of the centerline offset requirement was based upon considerations other than those imposed by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R, that is, for purposes of ensuring that any grant of a waiver would be made based on the public interest and consistent with the intent and purpose of the board\u2019s own rules and regulations. Contrast <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, supra </em>at 838-839.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">c. <em>The Hamilton deed. </em>Whether the applicants\u2019 subdivision plan violated the restriction set out in Hamilton\u2019s deed to the futrases, the applicants\u2019 predecessor in title to Lot 2B, became an issue at trial. As earlier recited, the provision in question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201cThis conveyance is subject to the following restriction^] which shall be binding on the grantees, their heirs, administrators and assigns:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cAny development of said premises shall be designed in such a manner as to protect the natural setting and no more than four dwellings are to be constructed thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">It is to be recalled from our previous recital of the facts that if the applicants\u2019 subdivision plan were approved by the board, the approved plan would allow for five dwellings on the Hamilton land.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Based on that provision, the judge concluded that no more than four buildings were to be situated on the Hamilton land from 1981 into the future. In so concluding, the judge also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>determined that even were one to accept the proposition that the duration of the validity of this condition was limited to thirty years, the applicants would be precluded from approval of their subdivision plan until, at least, 2011. In arriving at these conclusions, the judge opined that her conclusions \u201cmay be an appellate] issue\u201d for either the board or the applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Not surprisingly, both the board and the applicants have addressed the question whether the judge erred in accepting and applying a thirty-year limitation period on the duration of the condition in issue. Although we appreciate the judge\u2019s thorough and detailed explanation of the reasons for her ultimate ruling, we have no need to reach this question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">As previously discussed, judicial review of the board\u2019s decision is confined to the reasons therein stated. See <em>Musto </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 836. The record before us establishes that the reason the board denied the applicants\u2019 proposed subdivision plan was its failure to comply with the centerline offset requirement set out in the board\u2019s 1998 rules and regulations in effect at the time of the submission of the applicants\u2019 2002 subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> \u201cCenterline offset\u201d refers to the distance between the centerlines of two streets intersecting a public way at different points. The centerline offset requirement ensures safe access and egress to lots within a subdivision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\"> Prior to filing the 2002 plan, the applicants had submitted a request for preliminary subdivision approval upon which the board took no action. Submission of a preliminary plan for a residential development is not required. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81S. However, an applicant might wish to submit a preliminary plan to test a planning board\u2019s reaction. See Eno &amp; Hovey, Real Estate Law \u00a7 24.11 (4th ed. 2004). Approval or disapproval of a preliminary subdivision plan has no legal consequence \u201cbeyond freezing zoning requirements for a definitive plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 24.10 n.2, at 678-679. Should an applicant submit a preliminary subdivision plan and within seven months thereafter seek definitive subdivision approval, the zoning laws in effect at the time of the filing of the preliminary plan will control. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\"> One hundred and six feet is the offset number stated in the judge\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of fact.
