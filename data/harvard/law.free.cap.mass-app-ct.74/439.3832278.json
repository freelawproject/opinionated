Assistance, </em>423 Mass. 399, 404 (1996), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kokoska, by Kokoska </em>v. <em>Bullen, </em>519 U.S. 1057 (1997), quoting from H.R. Rep. No. 265, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 72 (1985), and the desire of \u201cpersons with some means, perhaps even considerable means, to preserve their assets in the face of the large medical expenses faced . . . by elderly persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Approximately six months after entering a nursing home in December, 2005, Muriel Doherty (Muriel) applied for MassHealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Medicaid benefits. MassHealth denied Muriel\u2019s application, reasoning that Muriel had available to her assets far exceeding the modest $2,000 allowable under applicable law. See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.003(A)(1) (2004). Muriel disagrees, contending that, because her assets are held by an irrevocable trust, she is essentially indigent and eligible for public benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Muriel amended and restated an existing family trust,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declaring that trust to be irrevocable and herself to be the trust\u2019s sole settlor. Muriel also removed herself as trustee, directing her nephew and niece, the successor trustees, to distribute the trust\u2019s income to her. Muriel specified that under no conditions were the successor trustees to \u201cmake . . . distributions of principal from the Trust, to [Muriel] or on behalf of [Muriel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The history and legal framework governing Medicaid eligibility has been the subject of considerable discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For present purposes, it suffices to observe that Muriel\u2019s trust, being restated in 2000, is subject to the post-1993 statutory-regulatory scheme. In such circumstances as those presented here, MassHealth\u2019s task was to determine whether \u201c[a]ny portion of the principal\u201d held by Muriel\u2019s trust could \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d be paid \u201cto or for [Muriel\u2019s] benefit.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.023(C)(1) (1999).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B) (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As previously noted, MassHealth concluded that, in at least certain circumstances, the trust instrument allowed Muriel\u2019s trustees to distribute trust assets to Muriel or for her benefit, thereby rendering Muriel ineligible to receive Medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At first blush, MassHealth\u2019s conclusion seems a bit odd insofar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>as trust Art. V.A.2 explicitly provides, as noted, that the trustee may \u201cmake no distributions of principal from the Trust, to or on behalf of\u201d Muriel. But as MassHealth strongly presses upon us, this clause may not be read in isolation; rather, it must be construed and qualified in light of the trust instrument as a whole. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>396 Mass. 424, 429 (1985). Taking this maxim to heart, we observe that trust Art. XXII generally provides that the trustee may, \u201cin its sole discretion\u201d and notwithstanding \u201canything contained in this Trust Agreement\u201d to the contrary, \u201cpay over and distribute the entire principal of [the] Trust fund to the beneficiaries thereof, free of all trusts,\u201d so long as the trustees, \u201cin [their] sole judgment,\u201d determine that the \u201cfund created . . . shall at any time be of a size which . . . shall make it inadvisable or unnecessary to continue such Trust fund.\u201d Similarly, trust Art. XTV.H gives to the trustee the power to \u201cdetermine all questions as between income and principal and to credit or charge to income or principal or to apportion between them any receipt or gain. . . notwithstanding any statute or rule of law for distinguishing income from principal or any determination of the Courts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Again, in trust Art. II, Muriel directed the trustee to \u201caccumulate the Trust principal to the extent feasible, due to the un-foreseeability of\u201d Muriel\u2019s \u201cfuture needs\u201d and \u201cwithout regard to the interests of the remaindermen.\u201d The trust also specifically provides that Muriel retains at least some powers over the trust corpus, including, as provided in Art. IV, the power to \u201cappoint any part or all of the principal of the Trust fund to any one or more of\u201d Muriel\u2019s descendants or siblings. Similarly, in trust Art. V.C, Muriel retained the right to reside in her home, originally a part of the trust\u2019s corpus, during her lifetime, also retaining an effective veto power over any potential sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Muriel argues, with some persuasiveness, that these and other similar provisions are, at most, economically meaningless administrative boilerplate, that in light of the explicit provision to the contrary they do not confer upon the trustees any discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>authority to invade principal for Muriel\u2019s benefit. To some extent, this is so. We doubt, for example, that the trustees may, willy-nilly, simply characterize a trust asset as \u201cincome\u201d and thereby, free of fiduciary fault, convey that asset to Muriel free of trust. See and compare <em>Worcester County Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>King, </em>359 Mass. 231, 233-234 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Yet we remain unconvinced that Muriel\u2019s niece and nephew are unable, in any reasonably foreseeable circumstance, to invade trust assets for Muriel\u2019s benefit. When considered as a whole, what strikes us most strongly is that Muriel\u2019s trust constitutes a remarkably fluid legal vehicle, intelligently structured to provide both Muriel and the trustees maximum flexibility to respond to Muriel\u2019s changing life needs. Indeed, embedded in the trust\u2019s governing recitation is not only an explicit assessment that public or other charitable benefits will likely be insufficient to provide Muriel the quality of life she might desire, but the corollary implicit direction for the trustees, in such case, to invade assets to make up that difference. Which is not to say that specific trust provisions do not confer this authority,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but is rather simply to observe that the trust vehicle, considered as a whole, evidences Muriel\u2019s expectation or intent that the trustees will invade trust assets when necessary to ensure Muriel\u2019s comfort. In this light, we cannot say that MassHealth\u2019s determination \u2014 that the whole of the trust\u2019s corpus constitutes a \u201ccountable asset\u201d for the purpose of determining Muriel\u2019s Medicaid eligibility \u2014 is as matter of law infirm. We leave for another day Muriel\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, we take this opportunity to stress that we have no doubt that self-settled, irrevocable tmsts may, if so structured, so insulate trust assets that those assets will be deemed unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>to the settlor. See and compare <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>433 Mass. 628, 633 (2001). Neither do we question Muriel\u2019s bona fides. To the contrary, Muriel\u2019s trust is a carefully crafted, entirely appropriate estate planning device. But neither the trust\u2019s validity nor her good intentions determine the present question. In our view, Muriel\u2019s trust, as structured, allows the trustees a degree of discretionary authority that would, if sanctioned, permit Muriel to enjoy her assets, preserve those assets for her heirs, and receive public assistance, to, in effect, \u201chave [her] cake and eat it too.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>423 Mass. at 403. Congress has declared a contrary intent, that Medicaid benefits be made available only to those who genuinely lack sufficient resources to provide for themselves. We perceive no reason in this case to deviate from that mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> At the time, her trust held assets of about $630,000 and was each year paying to Muriel income of about $27,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Cohen, </em>423 Mass. at 401-407. See also <em>Lebow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>433 Mass. 171, 172-173 (2001); <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>433 Mass. 628, 629-632 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> We need not determine whether trust income paid to Muriel constitutes \u201ccountable income\u201d within the meaning of 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.009, as Muriel concedes that it does. At least for present purposes, MassHealth does not argue that such income renders Muriel ineligible to receive Medicaid benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\"> \u201cIn the case of an irrevocable trust \u2014 (i) if there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual, the portion of the corpus from which . . . payment to the individual could be made shall be considered resources available to the individual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> Compare with trust Art. V.A: \u201cDuring [Muriel\u2019s] lifetime, [Muriel\u2019s] rights with respect to the income and principal of the Trust shall be as follows: (1) the TRUSTEE shall pay the entire net income from the [trust] to or for the benefit of [Muriel], in quarterly or more frequent installments, during her lifetime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> As the motion judge observed, for example, trust Art. XXII, quoted at greater length above, confers upon the trustees authority to distribute the trust\u2019s assets whenever, in their sole discretion and notwithstanding \u201canything contained in this Trust Agreement... to the contrary,\u201d they deem it \u201cinadvisable or unnecessary to continue such Trust fund.\u201d Contrary to Muriel\u2019s urging, we do not read the phrase \u201cdistribute the entire principal of such Trust fund to the beneficiaries thereof\u201d as limiting the class of beneficiaries entitled to receive principal to the trust\u2019s \u201cprincipal beneficiaries.\u201d The trust establishes no such beneficiary class. In any case, and as we read the phrase, \u201cbeneficiaries thereof\u201d modifies \u201cTrust fund,\u201d not \u201cprincipal,\u201d thus allowing distributions to the Trust fund\u2019s beneficiaries, of whom Muriel is one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
