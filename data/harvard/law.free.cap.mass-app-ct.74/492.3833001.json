The will provided that the entirety of his estate would go to the four daughters of his brother, Stephen Hernon. The testator\u2019s niece Christina, daughter of a second brother, Peter Hernon, objected to the will, claiming that it was the product of undue influence. After trial, a Probate and Family Court judge agreed, concluding that Stephen Hemon had exercised undue influence over the testator. Stephen, the named executor of the will, now appeals, claiming that the contestant, Christina, lacks proper standing to contest the testator\u2019s will, that the judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to Stephen, and that the judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The late John Hernon had no children and never married. He was one of four brothers, and his brother Joseph, who also had no children, predeceased him. His brother Peter had two sons, Nicholas and Patrick, and one daughter, Christina. All three of Peter\u2019s adult children were expressly omitted from the testator\u2019s will. At the time the will was written, the testator\u2019s brother Stephen had four adult daughters (one of whom, Melissa,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was his wife\u2019s child from a previous marriage), to whom the testator\u2019s will left the entirety of his sizeable estate in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">2. <em>Standing, </em>a. <em>Individual standing. </em>On November 29, 2005, the return day for the testator\u2019s will, Christina filed an appearance on her own behalf that was timely under Rule 2 of the Rules of the Probate Court (2006). However, because Christina\u2019s father, the testator\u2019s brother Peter, was alive at the time of the testator\u2019s death on September 19, 2005,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Christina was not the testator\u2019s heir at law when he died, and therefore lacked standing to object individually to the will. <em>Frilich </em>v. <em>Alstein, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 720, 720 (1975) (niece and nephew of decedent \u201cwere not next of kin,\u201d and therefore niece and nephew \u201clacked standing as interested persons, either to bring or oppose a petition for administration of this estate\u201d). Nevertheless, Christina filed an affidavit of objections to the will on or about December 28, 2005. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Stephen subsequently moved to strike that affidavit, along with her filed appearance. The parties, however, later agreed to remove that motion from the hearing list and proceeded to trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">After trial, Stephen again moved to strike Christina\u2019s appearance and moved for a new trial, whereupon Christina opposed those motions and moved to amend her appearance, so as to reflect her status as administratrix of her father Peter\u2019s estate. The judge allowed Christina\u2019s motion to amend her appearance and denied Stephen\u2019s posttrial motion to strike and motion for a new trial,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> essentially holding that Stephen was estopped from bringing a standing challenge posttrial, as he chose to withdraw his original motion and proceed to trial, and as \u201cno harm has inured to either party as a result of Christina\u2019s status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s rulings, and thus proceed as though Christina had properly objected ab initio to the will in her capacity as administratrix of Peter Hemon\u2019s estate. See <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Arlington, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1007 (1985) (\u201cfact that the original plaintiff may not have had standing or presumptive standing ... is not a reason for denying an amendment to allow the substitution of parties who have standing\u201d); Rule 7 of the Rules of the Probate Court (2006) (\u201cThe Court in its discretion may allow the parties to amend their pleadings ... or any act to be done . . . and may in all cases impose just and reasonable terms upon the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">b. <em>Standing as administratrix of Peter\u2019s estate. </em>Stephen next argues that Christina does not have standing in her capacity as the administratrix of her father\u2019s estate because her father Peter was alive for approximately five weeks after the testator\u2019s will was submitted to probate<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the guardian of his estate did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>contest the will during that period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stephen argues that an unas-serted will contest does not survive a party\u2019s death and, therefore, that Peter\u2019s right to contest the will died with Peter. Christina argues the opposite, maintaining that a will contest, even an unas-serted one, is a property right that descends to the party\u2019s estate upon death.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Whether an unasserted will contest survives death is a novel question in this State. In <em>Sheldone </em>v. Marino, the Supreme Judicial Court recognized that \u201ca will contest is in the nature of a property right and, thus, survives the contestant\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Shel-done </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>398 Mass. 817, 819 (1986) (will contest actions survive death even in the absence of statute). Contrast <em>Pine </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>404 Mass. 411, 417-418 (1989) (privacy interest violated by wiretap is ephemeral personal right and does not survive death in absence of statute). In <em>Sheldone, </em>unlike here, the will contestant had filed an objection prior to his death, and thus the <em>Sheldone </em>court addressed only the survival of an asserted will contest. Nonetheless, the court made no attempt to confine its ruling <em>only </em>to asserted will contests. Instead, it relied on \u201cthe analysis of several other jurisdictions,\u201d none of which purport to limit the survival of will contests only to those asserted during a contestant\u2019s lifetime; indeed, the cases suggest the opposite.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Most importantly, the <em>Sheldone </em>court thought persuasive and relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the analysis of <em>In re Estate of Field, </em>a California Supreme Court case which upheld the validity of an unasserted will contest. See <em>In re Estate of Field, </em>38 Cal. 2d 151, 154 (1951). Given the <em>Field </em>court\u2019s express language that \u201cno such distinction may be made\u201d between an asserted and an unasserted will contest, <em>id. </em>at 155, we may presume the omission of any limiting language in <em>Sheldone </em>to have been intentional. We now take the logical step of adopting the reasoning of <em>In re Estate of Field, </em>and conclude that \u201c[s]o long as the right survives as a right of property, the result may not be made to depend on whether the contest was commenced before the owner of the right died.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our decision today also comports with the spirit of G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which, as the court in <em>Sheldone </em>stated, \u201cdoes not operate to restrict the types of actions which survive but was intended to expand on the number of actions which do survive.\u201d <em>Sheldone </em>v. <em>Marino, supra </em>at 819. In concluding that a will contest is one of the \u201cactions which survive by the common law,\u201d under G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, the <em>Sheldone </em>court noted that its decision \u201cis in accord with the decision in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>[379 Mass. 212, 215 (1979)].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Harrison, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that an action in tort for intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>infliction of emotional distress survived the injured party\u2019s death under G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, such that the injured party\u2019s widow, in her capacity as administratrix of her deceased husband\u2019s estate, could proceed with the cause of action. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 219. After conducting a statutory analysis, the court in <em>Harrison </em>concluded that a party\u2019s vested property rights to bring a cause of action survive his death. The court did not limit this survivability principle to only those actions commenced before the party\u2019s death. We therefore hold that Peter\u2019s right to contest the testator\u2019s will, a property right which vested in Peter upon the testator\u2019s death, survived Peter\u2019s subsequent death, such that Christina could assert the claim on behalf of Peter\u2019s estate within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">3. <em>Burden of proof and validity of judge\u2019s findings. </em>Stephen correctly points out that it was Christina\u2019s sole burden at trial to prove all the elements of the undue influence claim, namely \u201cthat an (1) unnatural disposition has been made (2) by a person susceptible to undue influence to the advantage of someone (3) with an opportunity to exercise undue influence and (4) who in fact has used that opportunity to procure the contested disposition through improper means.\u201d <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>446 Mass. 814, 828 (2006), quoting from <em>Tetrault </em>v. <em>Mahoney, Hawkes &amp; Goldings, </em>425 Mass. 456, 464 (1997). After careful review of the record, we cannot say that the judge shifted this burden onto Stephen in any way, or that the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, particularly given his explicit credibility determinations. See <em>Matter of the Estate of Moretti, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 650-651 (2007) (findings will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">a. <em>Unnatural disposition. </em>Stephen argues that Christina failed to meet her burden of showing that an unnatural disposition occurred here. He contends in this regard that, because Christina never put the issue of the testator\u2019s relationship with Melissa (Stephen\u2019s stepdaughter) in issue, the judge could not have properly found that the testator\u2019s bequest to Melissa was unnatural. Stephen takes too narrow a view of the evidence. The judge specifically credited Christina\u2019s testimony that blood relations meant a great deal to the testator and that he had strong feelings about the fact that his nephews Nicholas and Patrick were the sole males to carry on the Hemon name. The judge also found cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ible the affidavit and testimony of the testator\u2019s long-time friend Arthur Roach, who related that he had had many conversations with the testator about the testator\u2019s estate plan, during which time the testator had always expressed his intent to split his estate evenly between both Peter\u2019s and Stephen\u2019s children. Based on this credible testimony, the judge could properly conclude that the testator\u2019s exclusion of his nephews Nicholas and Patrick, as heirs to the Hemon name, made the disposition unnatural on the whole, regardless whether Melissa\u2019s inclusion was also unnatural.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">b. <em>Susceptibility to undue influence. </em>Stephen also suggests that the testator was not susceptible to undue influence, pointing both to testimony by the testator\u2019s attorney that the testator was strong-willed as well as evidence that the testator was known to ignore medical advice. The judge, however, viewed the testator\u2019s tendency to check himself out of hospitals against medical advice as evidence of his \u201cdeep desire to remain in his own home\u201d and his \u201csignificant dislike of nursing homes and hospitals,\u201d rather than as conclusive evidence that he was not susceptible to undue influence. The judge credited Roach\u2019s testimony that the testator believed he had \u201cno other choice\u201d than to have Stephen move into his home to care for him, despite the \u201cdistant and strained\u201d relationship the two shared, supporting the view that the testator felt quite dependent upon Stephen. Once installed in the testator\u2019s home, Stephen drove the testator to many of his appointments, including the July 21, 2005, appointment at his lawyer\u2019s office, two months before he died, to execute his will. The judge also found credible testimony by Joseph Hemon\u2019s widow that Stephen refused to put the testator on the phone with some of his friends when they called in August of 2005, and that John had expressed fear of Stephen\u2019s anger, quickly hanging up the phone on Roach when he heard Stephen approaching. Insofar as these challenged findings are supported by evidence the judge deemed credible, Stephen has not shown them to be clearly erroneous and the judge could properly find the testator was susceptible to undue influence by Stephen.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The judge also specifically credited Roach\u2019s testimony that he had a telephone conversation with Stephen (shortly before the testator\u2019s death and while Stephen was living with the testator) wherein Stephen stated, \u201cJohn will do exactly what I want when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>it come[s] to his will or I\u2019m out of here.\u201d Conversely, the judge generally did not find Stephen to be a credible witness and specifically did not believe his testimony to the effect that he did not recall making this statement. The judge also credited Roach\u2019s testimony that the testator believed Stephen \u201cwas always concerned with, and had a \u2018lust\u2019 for money,\u201d and noted that Stephen had pursued legal claims against the estates of two other relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">c. <em>Opportunity to exercise undue influence and exercise in fact. </em>Stephen undisputedly lived alone with the testator in the last months of his life while the testator was in frail and failing health, which gave Stephen ample \u201copportunity to exercise undue influence\u201d over the testator. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>446 Mass. at 828. Combined with the aforesaid evidence, we conclude there was evidentiary support sufficient to sustain the judge\u2019s determination that Stephen in fact exercised this opportunity, such that the testator\u2019s will was the product of undue influence exerted upon the testator by Stephen.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because an unasserted will contest survives a party\u2019s death, Christina Hemon\u2019s claim on behalf of her father Peter\u2019s estate was proper. As our review of the record also reveals ample evidentiary support to meet all four elements of an undue influence claim, we now affirm the ruling of the Probate and Family Court judge below and conclude that Stephen Hemon did exercise undue influence over the testator in the creation of the testator\u2019s July 21, 2005, last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\"> Now deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> Peter died on November 21, 2005, eight days before the return day for the testator\u2019s will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> We note that Stephen\u2019s own failure to pursue this standing challenge at the outset of the case disposes of his argument that upholding the judge\u2019s ruling would generally allow appearances to be entered \u201cmany months after the Return Day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> To the extent Stephen claims the judge erred in denying his revised motion for leave to file supplemental documents in support of his motion for a new trial, we consider the issue to be waived as it fails to rise to the level of appellate argument required by Mass.R.A.P 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> The will was submitted to probate on or about October 12, 2005, and as previously noted, Peter died on November 21, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> Peter was incapacitated in the last years of his life, with Christina serving as the guardian of his person and a court-appointed attorney serving as the guardian of his estate.

A finding of unnatural disposition does not require the influencer to take personally under the will, and this court has allowed for the possibility that the influencer may seek to procure a will that is favorable to another. <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>50 Mass.
