His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal in 1986. Before us is the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the allowance, in 2006, of the defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial. We affirm the order of the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">I. <em>Introduction. </em>In 1984, the then nineteen year old Bernard Baran was working as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a preschool day care center in Pittsfield known as the Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC). Over a several week period that October, six children between the ages of two and four (Boy A, Girl B, Boy C, Boy D, Girl E, and Girl F) accused him of molesting them, and he was thereafter charged with six counts each of rape of a child and indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen. Trial by jury in this notorious case followed within three months; Baran was convicted on January 30, 1985, of three counts of rape of a child and five counts of indecent assault and battery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to concurrent life sentences for each of the rape convictions and to concurrent eight- to ten-year sentences on each of the indecent assault and battery convictions, the latter to be served concurrently with the life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>At trial, the defendant was represented by a lawyer whom his mother hired for him by mistake: the name of the lawyer she retained resembled that of the criminal defense attorney she set out to hire. In all, Baran\u2019s mother paid the lawyer through trial less than a thousand dollars; he did not retain an investigator or experts nor advise that this be done. The defendant was represented on appeal by two lawyers in a prominent local firm. One of them was the attorney whom Baran\u2019s mother had originally intended to retain as trial counsel. The other, unbeknownst to her, had only recently stopped representing the family of Girl E in connection with a civil suit against ECDC predicated upon Baran\u2019s alleged acts. In the direct appeal, counsel argued only preserved errors. Despite a trial record displaying what Baran\u2019s present counsel contends were multiple serious shortcomings on the part of trial counsel, appellate counsel neither raised the matter on direct appeal nor sought a new trial on the ground of the ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions in a rescript opinion, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 989 (1986). Further appellate review was denied, 397 Mass. 1103 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Eighteen years later, in 2004, new counsel brought the defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial, doing so after four years of persistent discovery efforts that were precipitated at least in part by the intervening destruction of predecessor trial and appellate counsel\u2019s files. Motion counsel accordingly attempted to reconstruct the files and information that were or would have been available to the defendant\u2019s trial and appellate counsel and, to that end, sought information and documents from the district attorney and participants in related civil cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By the time motion counsel became involved in late 2000, other things had changed as well. The trial judge had retired and the trial prosecutor had himself become an associate justice of the Superior Court who frequently sat in Berkshire County, where Baran\u2019s trial had been held. Given these circumstances, a Superior Court judge from outside the county was specially designated to handle postconviction discovery and related matters as well as the 2004 motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The postconviction discovery process yielded, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>things, certain documents and materials that trial counsel had never seen as well as information and documents, not part of the trial record, that were known to but not used by trial counsel. By way of example, among the materials not seen by trial counsel were five lengthy unedited videotapes of interviews conducted by the district attorney\u2019s office in October and November, 1984, of children A, B, C, D, and F<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; the district attorney ultimately turned these videotapes over to motion counsel in September, 2004. Also among the materials unknown to trial counsel were documents generated by police and the Department of Social Services (DSS) concerning contemporaneous accusations made by Boy A and Girl E that they had each been molested by their respective mother\u2019s boyfriends; these documents, never produced by the district attorney, were discovered by motion counsel in the civil case files. Among the materials known to but not used by trial counsel, thus not becoming part of the trial record, was a pediatrician\u2019s report of her examination of Girl E referencing the prior molestation of Girl E by the mother\u2019s boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">When filed, the motion for new trial, with supporting memo-randa, documents, and videotapes, exceeded one thousand pages and rested on four grounds: the trial judge made numerous errors, including the admission of unreliable evidence; there had been multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct; there was newly discovered evidence; and the defendant had received the ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel. The motion judge also had before him the Commonwealth\u2019s written submissions in opposition, ten volumes of trial transcript plus trial exhibits, and the 1985 appellate briefs. In addition, the motion judge heard testimony from six witnesses over five days; he limited that hearing to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Three of the witnesses were attorneys who had been associated with the law firm that served as Baran\u2019s appellate counsel and testified as to that firm\u2019s representation of Girl E and her mother in a contemplated civil suit against ECDC just prior to taking on Baran\u2019s appeal. The defendant testified, as did his mother, and the motion judge heard extensive testimony from child psychologist Dr. Maggie Brack, a recognized authority in the areas of sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>gestibility, memory, and child interviews. The motion judge denied motion counsel\u2019s request to call the trial prosecutor as a witness, and defendant\u2019s trial counsel was not called by either party, due to his reported state of poor health.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Although four grounds were offered for the motion for new trial and many of the asserted errors readily fall into more than one legal category, the motion judge ordered a new trial solely on the basis of the ineffective assistance rendered by trial and appellate counsel. The motion judge\u2019s findings portray a defense attorney who, simply put, was in way over his head. Setting out his findings and rationale in a comprehensive decision entered on June 16, 2006, the motion judge concluded that trial counsel\u2019s representation of Baran was gravely deficient in numerous respects both before and during trial and that these fundamental failings likely deprived Baran of an available substantial defense. While some of these deficiencies were apparent from the trial record, yet not raised on direct appeal, the magnitude and metastatic effects of the central deficiency \u2014 trial counsel\u2019s grievous failure to have investigated and prepared his case \u2014 were not apparent from the trial record. Whether considered separately or cumulatively, whether viewed as the ineffective assistance of counsel or as errors creating the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the motion judge determined that \u201cthe cumulative weight of these errors\u201d created an overriding uncertainty whether the defendant had received a fair trial; a new trial was accordingly necessary. The defendant was thereafter admitted to bail, having served twenty-two years of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On appeal, the Commonwealth contends that the motion judge abused his discretion in ordering a new trial under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), maintaining that counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance and that justice had not miscarried. In assessing the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions, we are mindful that the motion judge was not the trial judge and that he based his decision in no small part on the documentary trial and appellate record. We are also mindful that, in addition to reviewing the motion exhibits, he heard testimony from six witnesses and that this, too, was interwoven into his decision. Accordingly, we have reviewed the entire record, including the videotaped interviews of the child complainants, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>while deferring to the motion judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses he heard, regard ourselves as being in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the remainder of the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>451 Mass. 310, 325 (2008). Having said this, we are satisfied that the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact are firmly anchored in the evidence of record and rely on them as appropriate in what follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">II. <em>Background. </em>The family of Boy A was the first to accuse the defendant of molestation. In mid-September, 1984, either the boy\u2019s mother or her then-boyfriend, David, lodged a complaint with ECDC objecting to Baran, a homosexual man, being allowed to care for young children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mother A had complained about this to her social worker in early August of that year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 5, 1984, Boy A\u2019s family reported Baran to the police for having touched Boy A\u2019s penis, and the next day took the boy for a medical examination; a throat culture tested positive for gonorrhea. The mother of Girl E, a friend of Boy A\u2019s mother, was present at the A family\u2019s home when Mother A received the call reporting the results of the gonorrhea throat culture.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Girl B\u2019s mother, who served on the ECDC board and was herself the apparent victim of a childhood sexual assault, received a telephone call from a friend who worked at ECDC informing her of the A family\u2019s allegations against the defendant. She questioned Girl B about the defendant and thereupon contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>police to report her suspicion that the defendant had molested her daughter. After police and a DSS worker interviewed Girl B that evening, the defendant was arrested on October 7, 1984, for indecent assault and battery of Boy A and Girl B.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">These accusations were well publicized after October 9, 1984, through local and State media. On October 10, Baran gave rectal, throat, and penile samples for gonorrhea testing; the test results were negative. On October 11, the DSS conducted a puppet show at ECDC designed to inform the children there about the difference between appropriate and inappropriate forms of touching. At about the same time, ECDC sent letters to the parents of children in its care, informing them of the charges against the defendant, and the possibility that their own children might have been abused. Following these events, four additional complainants came forward (Boys C and D, and Girls E and F). On November 7, 1984, the grand jury returned indictments against Baran for rape of a child (five counts) and indecent assault and battery on a child (five counts)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; the defendant was arraigned on November 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Before they testified at trial three months later, the six children were interviewed many times by various people, including parents, DSS personnel, police officers, a rape crisis center counselor, and prosecutors. Interviews of the children at the district attorney\u2019s office in October and November, 1984, were videotaped<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with the intention of substituting the videotapes for live testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>both at the grand jury and at trial, although the children did eventually testify at trial. The grand jury were shown edited versions of the videotaped interviews, containing very small portions of the full videotaped interviews. Trial counsel saw only the edited grand jury versions of the videotapes, and he did not view them until after trial began. The edited grand jury versions omit, among other things, statements in which the children deny that Baran had done anything to them and statements where they accuse others at ECDC both of abuse and of witnessing abuse. The unedited videotapes show the behavior of the children, the extent to which they were distracted and non-responsive during the interviews, the degree to which their parents participated in the interview process, and the range of interviewing techniques used.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The motion judge found that the defendant did not file any discovery motions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On November 28, 1984, the prosecution filed its certificate of discovery listing the names of thirty-eight prospective witnesses, nine of whom were police officers and three of whom were physicians; confirming the transmission to trial counsel of certain listed police and other reports; disclosing that undescribed \u201cphysical evidence in this case\u201d was available for trial counsel\u2019s inspection at the police department; and representing that there was no exculpatory evidence other than what might be contained in the materials furnished.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Trial counsel did not file any motions in limine or motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>suppress, and nothing in the record suggests that he ever interviewed any of the Commonwealth\u2019s listed witnesses. As of the first day of trial, he had not spoken with several possible defense witnesses, had not decided whether to call a medical expert, and did not have a list of his own witnesses ready for jury voir dire purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Until moments before calling her to testify for the defense at trial, trial counsel professed not to have known about or spoken with a witness who corroborated some aspects of Ba-ran\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Trial counsel filed a motion for a bill of particulars on January 17, 1985, days before trial began on January 21. Along with his motions to sever and to dismiss, the motion for a bill of particulars was heard and denied on January 18, the same day on which the trial judge later conducted a competency hearing of the children.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Trial counsel waived Baran\u2019s presence at this hearing and acquiesced in the decision to hold the competency hearing in chambers. The judge found all six children competent to testify.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Trial began on January 21 and continued through the January 31 sentencing. On the first day of trial, the prosecutor filed complaints charging Baran with rape and indecent assault and battery of Boy C. Trial counsel agreed to waive Baran\u2019s right to an indictment, stating to the judge that it was \u201cthe practical thing to do since you had not severed the trial,\u201d and a written waiver of indictment was filed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Trial counsel did not request a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>continuance, although fewer than three months had passed since the defendant had been indicted on the other charges. There was no colloquy with Baran to determine whether he knew what rights he was giving up by proceeding on the basis of complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The prosecution called twenty-nine witnesses to testify, including the six children who were then three to four years old, each accompanied to the stand by a parent who testified directly after the child testified<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; five staff members of ECDC; four police detectives; two DSS investigators; three physicians; and a child psychotherapist.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The courtroom was closed to the press and public while the children testified; the trial judge made no particularized findings on the record concerning the need for such closure. The Commonwealth elicited out-of-court statements made by the children from parents, doctors, and various investigators<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; trial counsel\u2019s objections to aspects of such testimony were infrequent and sporadic. Trial counsel did not use any videotapes, edited or unedited, in his cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, and made sparing use of leading questions or impeachment materials even with adult witnesses for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Trial counsel moved, successfully, at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case for a required finding of not guilty as to the Boy A rape and indecent assault and battery counts, and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the Boy D rape count; the trial judge also ruled that, with respect to Girl F, the jury could find the defendant guilty of either rape or indecent assault and battery, but not both. By this point, the jury had heard extensive testimony, without objection, from a number of witnesses as to the gonorrhea in Boy A\u2019s throat, which the prosecutor had underscored in his opening<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; none of the other children were so afflicted. Trial counsel did not move for a mistrial at this point; nor did he seek to strike the testimony that supported the Boy A counts. The trial judge instead informed the jury simply that they were no longer to consider the indictments relating to Boy A.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">During the defense case, trial counsel called six witnesses, including the defendant, his sister, and a friend. Trial counsel did not consult with or call any experts, either with respect to the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts or to assist him in presenting evidence on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The theory of defense, which trial counsel largely failed to develop or implement, was that the defendant had not touched any of the children inappropriately in any way, that he had not had the opportunity to do any of the things he stood accused of doing at ECDC, and that the children\u2019s accusations stemmed from the A family\u2019s homophobia followed by widespread hysteria, as well as the improperly suggestive ways the children were interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The jury deliberated four hours before returning guilty verdicts on three counts of rape of a child and five counts of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On direct appeal, appellate counsel argued only preserved errors, claiming that the trial judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to sever and for a bill of particulars; mling that the child complainants were competent to testify; permitting the prosecutor to ask leading questions of the child complainants; and admitting fresh complaint evidence from sixteen witnesses. We affirmed the convictions in a rescript opinion, discerning neither error nor abuse of discretion as to the errors claimed. In apparent reliance on the record on appeal,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we stated, incorrectly as it turns out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cThe defendant had been supplied with . . . copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>every police report, witness statement and report of the Department of Social Services in the possession of the prosecution. The prosecutor had offered to make the videotaped interviews of the victims available to the defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 990. Further, in discounting the claimed error in the admission of fresh complaint evidence, we thought such evidence particularly relevant given trial counsel\u2019s efforts \u201cto insinuate by questioning and argument that the testimony of the victims had been influenced by parents, social workers and members of the prosecution team.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">III. <em>The defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. </em>The defendant claimed in his motion numerous errors by the trial judge,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the prosecutor,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and his attorneys, relying as well on certain evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>asserted to be newly discovered.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> With respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant identified numerous significant missteps by his trial and appellate counsel,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>some of which the motion judge did not address. In allowing the motion for new trial, the motion judge observed that, \u201c[wjhile many alleged errors had their genesis in [trial counsel\u2019s] failure to properly investigate and prepare for a significant trial involving notorious allegations of child sexual abuse, the errors did not become manifest until during the trial.\u201d The motion judge focused his attention on six areas of what he determined to be significantly defective and damaging performance by counsel: (1) trial counsel\u2019s failure to prepare adequately for trial by (a) failing to obtain or use the unedited videotapes, and (b) failing to retain or consult with investigators and experts; (2) trial counsel\u2019s failure to (a) challenge testimony by Commonwealth witnesses that vouched for the veracity of the child complainants, or (b) object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument in aid of the same end; (3) trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek to exclude immaterial and highly prejudicial evidence, particularly as to gonorrhea; (4) trial counsel\u2019s failure to protect the defendant from improper fresh complaint evidence or to object to the trial judge\u2019s handling of such evidence; (5) trial counsel\u2019s failure to protect the defendant by not demanding, but instead waiving, indictment as to the Boy C charges; and (6) trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial as well as appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In directing attention to these errors, all involving either a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>failure to prepare properly for trial or to protect the defendant properly during trial, the motion judge observed that the credibility of the six children \u2014 three or four years old at trial \u2014 was \u201cthe central issue of the case for both the prosecution and the defense.\u201d The only viable defense strategy was to undermine their credibility, but no such defense \u201cwas realistically given. No preparations or effort was made to explain to the jury the dangers of multiple interviews, preconceived agenda, or leading questions; nor was there any effort by counsel to uncover and/or demonstrate the inconsistencies between the children\u2019s multiple statements.\u201d Trial counsel\u2019s suggestions, by way of ineffective cross-examination and argument to the jury as to the children\u2019s suggestibility, were inadequate to the task. The motion judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201c[Wjhile the case against Mr. Baran was largely one-sided, the evidence was not overwhelmingly] convincing. The defendant made no admissions nor was there any objective, scientific evidence that linked the defendant to these offenses. None of the day care staff or parents testified to ever having seen him touch a child inappropriately. None of the complaints by the children of sexual abuse came spontaneously but rather only after some questioning or prompting, most by direct questioning and some by leading questions, i.e., where did Bemie touch you. Each parent/witness was permitted to give fresh complaint evidence, as were the civilian and police investigators. Moreover, notwithstanding a sequestration order that had been entered, a parent was able to accompany his or her child to the witness stand and then follow the child to the witness stand shortly thereafter as [a] fresh complaint witness [], without any voir dire or other efforts to limit the[] expected testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">A. <em>Standard of review. </em>The defendant raised the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for the first time in this, his first motion for new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 810 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 90 n.1 (1974) (\u201cthe preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a motion for new trial\u201d). Of the errors identified by the motion judge as con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>stituting the ineffective assistance of counsel, the most fundamental and pervasive claim is that trial counsel failed to investigate and prepare adequately for trial. We accordingly apply the familiar two-part test for determining whether a new trial may be granted on the basis of attorney error: whether the performance of counsel falls below the standard of an \u201cordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and whether any misstep deprived the defendant of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Safe-rian, supra </em>at 96.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We also consider whether there is \u201csome showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>As to the remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the basis for at least some of the asserted claims was counsel\u2019s failure to preserve error. We proceed, for the sake of simplicity, by considering whether such errors of counsel gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 293-295 (2002). When analyzing a claim under this standard of review, \u201c[w]e review the evidence and the case as a whole,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Azar, 435 Mass. 675, 687 (2002), asking four questions: \u201c(1) Was there error? ... (2) Was the defendant prejudiced by the error? . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(3) Considering the error in the context of the entire trial, would it be reasonable to conclude that the error materially influenced the verdict? . . . [and] (4) [Can it be inferred] from the record that counsel\u2019s failure to object or raise a claim of error at an earlier date was not a reasonable tactical decision?\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 298. With these principles in mind, we review the six areas of deficient performance by counsel identified by the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">B. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>1. <em>Failure to prepare for trial. </em>The motion judge concluded that foremost among trial counsel\u2019s shortcomings in this regard were both his failure to obtain and use the unedited videotapes and his failure to involve experts. The stage was set for this, at least in part, by trial counsel\u2019s failure to master the materials the Commonwealth had provided him, most notably, but by no means exclusively, the edited videotaped interviews of the children that the grand jury had seen. Had he looked at these in a timely way \u2014 instead of waiting, as he did, until trial was under way \u2014 it would have been evident that the edited videotapes were just that, and competent counsel would then have sought the unedited versions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">After viewing all of the videotapes, after reviewing the trial transcript of the children\u2019s testimony, and after having heard and credited Dr. Brack\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> at the evidentiary motion hearing, the motion judge concluded that the unedited tapes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\u201c[standing alone, without further comment from an expert, . . . would likely have had impact on the jury\u2019s consideration of the credibility of the children, and perhaps more significantly on the credibility of the interviewers as well, especially considering their arguably overly-simplistic characterization of their interviews of the children. When seen in conjunction with the leading nature of the direct examination of the children during the trial, it might well have supported the defense claim of suggestiveness by the repetitive manner of the questioning of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Although the utility of then-available expert assistance<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> would have been underscored had trial counsel obtained the unedited videotapes, the desirability of such assistance even absent the unedited videotapes was nonetheless manifest. As the motion judge observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cAn expert would have been of assistance to the defendant to explain to the jury why the techniques known to counsel or evident during the trial and used to question the children were harmful. At the very least, an expert could have helped [trial counsel] prepare to cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s experts who conducted the interviews with the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u201c[E]ven without the unedited videotapes,\u201d the motion judge noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201can expert . . . would likely have found evidence in the documents that existed at the time to support testimony that the context and manner in which this case was generated and investigated . . . created problems in the reliability of the interviewing techniques, such as the parents being given suggestions as to how to question their children, the multiple interviews, the leading questions and interviewers with preconceived agenda.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The motion judge credited Dr. Brack\u2019s testimony concerning the many potential problems, recognized as such at the time of trial,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in the interviewing of child witnesses, the uncertain reliability of their disclosures when interviewed improperly, and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>opinion that the unedited videotapes evidenced a number of such problems. But with or without the unedited videotapes, trial counsel\u2019s failure to involve an expert manifestly disadvantaged his client. As the motion judge observed, \u201c[Wjithout an expert, the defense had no one capable of explaining to the jury the reasons why children should not be interviewed in the manner they were.\u201d Without such expertise, trial counsel did not know how to cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses effectively and was \u201cunable to counterbalance the critically important and powerful opinions given by the Commonwealth\u2019s experts [Dr. Suzanne King and psychotherapist Jane S atollo] on the truthtelling of child sexual abuse victims.\u201d Without such expertise, trial counsel\u2019s questions to witnesses and his closing argument about suggestibility fell prey to being dismissed by the prosecutor in his closing argument, and later by this court, as merely untoward \u201cinsinuations].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Commonwealth contends, however, that trial counsel was not ineffective in these respects. The Commonwealth takes issue, first, with the weight the motion judge placed on the relevance of the videotapes. The most reliable disclosures that children make about sexual abuse, it argues, are their first disclosures, and the videotaped interviews were no more relevant in this regard than the children\u2019s subsequent trial testimony. Accordingly, the children\u2019s trial testimony adequately demonstrated to the jury their contradictory statements and their hesitancy to accuse Baran of abusing them, arguably making merely cumulative the inconsistencies the jury could have seen on the unedited tapes. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues, the motion judge\u2019s reliance on Dr. Brack\u2019s expertise was misplaced insofar as she was not qualified as an expert in child sexual abuse. In any event, the Commonwealth contends, trial counsel effectively raised the issue of the children\u2019s suggestibility and the deficiencies in interviewing techniques, having brought them to the attention of the jury through cross-examination and argument; no expert was needed to explain such matters to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>These contentions are not persuasive. Like the motion judge, we have viewed the unedited videotaped interviews and reviewed the trial testimony of the children. The latter does not duplicate the former<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>; nor does the trial testimony in any way render the unedited videotapes a less potent tool in the hands of competent counsel. The videotaped interviews were done within weeks of the children\u2019s initial disclosures, none of which were spontaneous,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and the unedited videotapes contain both denials that the defendant had abused them and allegations that others had; such information was not conveyed to the jury during the children\u2019s trial testimony. The unedited videotapes, not seen by the jury or trial counsel, also vividly demonstrate how the children were questioned and would have provided counsel with support for the contention that the children had been coached. It was eminently reasonable for the motion judge to have concluded that Dr. Brack, whose testimony he credited, had relevant expertise and that appropriate use of the unedited videotapes might have proven a real factor in jury deliberations. So, too, his conclusion was reasonable that the assistance of experts could have rendered cross-examination of certain of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses more telling, and provided trial counsel with a means of rebutting powerful testimony by the government\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">By permitting the Commonwealth to be the sole purveyor of expert medical and psychological evidence to the jury, trial counsel ceded a distinct, if not decisive, advantage to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The failure of trial counsel to explore these issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>through better pretrial preparation,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> including the hiring of investigators and experts, effectively deprived the defendant of not merely a \u201csubstantial ground of defence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96, but perhaps his only possible defense. These omissions, standing alone, would justify affirming the motion judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. 437, 442 (1987), and cases cited (\u201c[fjailure to investigate the only defense a defendant has, if facts known to or with minimal diligence accessible to counsel support that defense, falls beneath the level of competency expected\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 167 (2006). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caban, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 182-183 (1999). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 395 (1997) (defense counsel\u2019s failure to employ forensic expert for purpose of developing primary defense theory \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>2. <em>Vouching for the complainants \u2019 veracity, </em>(a) <em>Failure to object to experts\u2019 vouching. </em>At the time of trial, it was well-settled that, as a general matter, vouching for the credibility of witnesses was improper. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villalobos, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905-906 (1979). As the court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>390 Mass. 89, 100-101 (1983), \u201c[w]e look to the jury after an adversary trial to make the decision as to what testimony to believe.\u201d With respect to expert testimony in sexual assault cases, the general rule was that an expert witness could not indicate that she \u201cbelieved the victim had been raped and had not fantasized or invented the rape.\u201d <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDon-ough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 176 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We note, however, that in the specific context of child sexual abuse, experts were accorded broader latitude, at least at the time this case was tried. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 987, 987 (1988). This relaxed standard notwithstanding, it was nonetheless not permissible at the time of trial for an expert to opine directly on the credibility of a witness, see, e.g., <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982), including child witnesses in sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197 (1987), also tried in 1985, the court concluded that the question whether children, as a class, are likely to fabricate allegations of sexual abuse was not a proper subject for expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 201-202. Such testimony, the court determined, \u201cimpermissibly intrude[s] upon the vital function of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. See <em>ibid., </em>citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Azure, </em>801 F.2d 336, 341 (8th Cir. 1986) (court abused discretion in permitting a doctor to opine on the credibility of an alleged child victim of sexual abuse). \u201cEvaluations of credibility are, of course, within the exclusive province of the [jury].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Judged by the foregoing standards, there were multiple occurrences of impermissible testimonial vouching on the part of witnesses for the Commonwealth. Psychotherapist Jane Satullo, for example, was permitted to testify, without objection or contradiction by any other expert, that children of the age of the children here \u201cin order to repeat a story and to tell the details again, the same[,] it needs to be a true story.\u201d At another point, the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>witness opined that \u201cany child who is able to tell a story and repeat its details over a period of time then there is validity to that story.\u201d Later, during cross-examination, Satullo stated that \u201cchildren have withheld the name of the person [who sexually assaulted them] out of fear but there haven\u2019t been any cases of young children falsely accusing somebody.\u201d None of these statements drew any objection from defense counsel, despite their obvious infirmity.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Similarly, the treating psychiatrist for Girl B, Dr. Suzanne King, was permitted to testify that Girl B was too young to be \u201cable to describe in graphic detail some sexual event unless she actually experienced it,\u201d and that the child\u2019s \u201cemotional overlay is not something that she could make up.\u201d Finally, the witness was permitted to state both that \u201ca child of that age is not really at a stage where they can talk about something that they haven\u2019t experienced . . . ,\u201d and that \u201c[w]hat she says actually occurred in terms of being sexually abused.\u201d Again, none of this testimony drew objections from trial counsel.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The admission of this evidence was improper and plainly prejudicial. Even the trial judge, during a side bar conference, expressed his belief that portions of the expert testimony were problematic.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This warning from the judge, however, did not result in any apparent increased vigilance by trial counsel. The motion judge concluded \u2014 and we agree \u2014\u2022 that the failure to lodge timely objections to the many instances of such improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>vouching resulted in the jury being exposed to significant improper testimony \u2014 testimony that may well have tipped the balance in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor on the crucial question of the complainants\u2019 credibility. This is particularly so absent the children\u2019s unedited videotaped interviews or countervailing expert testimony. In these circumstances, trial counsel\u2019s inaction amounted to error.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Although the Commonwealth disputes the characterization of the experts\u2019 testimony as vouching, it contends that such testimony did not in any event give rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because the government\u2019s case did not rest solely on the children\u2019s credibility. Here, the Commonwealth points to evidence that Baran was the only male staffer at ECDC and the only one named Bemie (the name to which the children frequently referred as their abuser), that he had opportunity to be alone with children A through F, that Girl B\u2019s hymenal injury was consistent with penetration by adult fingers,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> that several children exhibited behaviors consistent with abuse, and that the testimony of Boys C and D corroborated each other as to Baran being their abuser.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The question before us is not the sufficiency of the evidence, however. As the motion judge observed, although the evidence presented at trial was one-sided, it was hardly overwhelming, the aforesaid evidence notwithstanding. To be sure, while the Commonwealth\u2019s case did not rest solely on the children\u2019s credibility, it rested very largely upon it and upon the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses who gave percipient, fresh complaint, and expert testimony. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to vouching \u2014 particularly when seen as one of multiple lapses by counsel \u2014 was error resulting in a substantial risk of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>miscarriage of justice; it prejudiced Baran, likely influenced the verdict materially, and was not a reasonable tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">(b) <em>Failure to object to improper closing argument. </em>The motion judge concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument contained numerous defects, none of which drew an objection from trial counsel. In the first instance, the argument contained elements designed to bolster improperly the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 352 (1998) (describing general proscription against prosecutorial vouching). For example, the prosecutor expressed his view that the parents, who had endured a \u201cterrible nightmare,\u201d would never permit their traumatized children \u201cto come to court and testify before sixteen jurors about the horrible bloodcurdling things that these little children\u201d revealed unless the allegations were true. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaudry, </em>445 Mass. 577, 586-587 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorette, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 742 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 1014 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 824 (2009). The prosecutor continued, \u201cAnd furthermore, even if they would, they couldn\u2019t. Maybe one parent . . . could brainwash a child . . . [b]ut [not] five.\u201d There were no factual bases in the trial record for such statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 284, 292 (2003). The cumulative effect of such statements was to vouch for the credibility of the complainants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 296-297 (2008) (prosecutor may not express personal belief in veracity of witnesses or rely on extrajudicial evidence in attesting to their credibility). These errors were particularly toxic in view of the testimonial vouching, outlined above, that pervaded the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. Having failed to object to the testimonial vouching for reasons that have no evident tactical basis, trial counsel was equally complacent about these closing remarks by the prosecutor, none of which occasioned any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s closing also contained a number of passages apparently designed to inflame the jurors\u2019 passions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 312 (2005), quoting from Lawless, Prosecutorial Misconduct \u00a7 9.21 (3d ed. 2003) (\u201cArguments aimed at arousing the passions or sympathies of the jury are the paradigm example of prosecutorial misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>during closing argument. Such arguments distract juries from their true fact-finding function and are highly improper\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 424 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 693 (1983). The prosecutor began his closing by exhorting the jury to return a guilty verdict \u201cin the name of justice and decency.\u201d He went on to state that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201c[if] ever there was a case where the ends of justice literally cry out for a guilty verdict, this is that case . . . because truth is the mother of justice and in this case truth came literally from the mouths of babes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">At another point, the prosecutor stated that, \u201c[w]ith the chances [the defendant] had[,] he could have raped and sodomized and abused those children whenever he felt the primitive urge to satisfy his sexual appetite.\u201d The defendant, according to the prosecutor, \u201cwas like a chocoholic in a candy store, and indeed, for him perpetrating these despicable acts was like taking candy from a baby.\u201d The prosecutor concluded his closing with the admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t win or lose cases. The only ones who win are the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who win when justice is done. And the only ones who lose are the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who lose when justice is thwarted. ... I beseech you \u2014 I beg you \u2014 think of those children and bring back a verdict of guilty on each and every one of these charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u201cI can sit down now, knowing the fate of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in th[is] case ... is in good hands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Not only did the prosecutor improperly encourage the jury to determine the verdict on the basis of sympathy for the complainants, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 494-495 (1997) (appeals to sympathy for victim in closing provides basis for reversal), but he also indicated that the jury would be answerable to the public should they elect to return a not guilty verdict, a result that the prosecutor implied would amount to a \u201cthwart[ing] \u201d of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 564, 572-573 (1991), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Rakiey, </em>504 U.S. 922 (1992) (reversible error for prosecutor to imply that jurors, in deciding verdict, are answerable to community). As with the foregoing instances of vouching, none of these statements was met by any objection from defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Through what the motion judge generally described as trial counsel\u2019s \u201clack of . . . attention,\u201d the prosecutor was permitted, in his closing, to undermine the defendant\u2019s case through improper means. The cumulative effect of the government\u2019s presentation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 911-912 (1983) (cumulative effect of inflammatory and misleading remarks requires reversal), was likely to \u201csweep jurors beyond a fair and calm consideration of the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>254 Mass. 520, 531 (1926). Trial counsel\u2019s failure to safeguard the defendant\u2019s interests by obtaining a curative charge or, at a minimum, by preserving these points for review cannot be viewed as a reasonable tactical decision. Trial counsel\u2019s errors with respect to vouching in the evidence admitted and argument made gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">3. <em>Failure to exclude prejudicial evidence. </em>Among the many ways that trial counsel failed to protect his client, the motion judge found particular fault with counsel\u2019s treatment of certain irrelevant and highly prejudicial evidence. This evidence, which counsel never tried to exclude, concerned both Boy A\u2019s gonorrhea of the throat and the defendant\u2019s sexual orientation. The motion judge concluded that \u201c[n]o reasonable trial strategy can justify counsel\u2019s failure to object to the gonorrhea evidence from the outset.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>423 Mass. 436, 447-448, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1015 (1996). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choeurn, </em>446 Mass. 510, 521 (2006). He reached the same conclusion as to the subject of Baran\u2019s homosexuality, which was first introduced by trial counsel. Since Baran\u2019s sexual orientation had no relevance to the charged crimes, the prosecutor could not have offered such evidence himself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Capone, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 611 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The government offered no evidence permitting even the inference that Boy A had been forced to submit to oral sex by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Baran, nor was there any evidence that Baran had gonorrhea at any relevant time. Yet, notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s inability to identify for the jury another source of Boy A\u2019s infection,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and knowing that he had no experts of his own, trial counsel nonetheless offered no objection to the Commonwealth\u2019s opening,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> which should have alerted him to the likely consequences of his strategy. Nor did he then object to the Commonwealth\u2019 s disturbing evidence that gonorrhea had been found in Boy A\u2019s throat or the medical evidence the government presented regarding the ease and speed with which gonorrhea can be cured and its greater frequency in the population of homosexual men. Finally, notwithstanding the unexpected opportunity to recover from these trial errors afforded by the allowance of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>motion to dismiss the counts as to Boy A, trial counsel did not move for a mistrial or to strike all the gonorrhea evidence once the counts relating to Boy A were dismissed at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. To the contrary, trial counsel pressed on, inexplicably having Baran acknowledge during the defense case that he had previously been infected with a venereal disease, and later arguing the gonorrhea evidence in closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On appeal, the Commonwealth does not contend that the evidence of sexual orientation or gonorrhea was relevant to establishing Baran\u2019s guilt. Instead, it takes the position that such evidence was of value to the defendant, allowing trial counsel to argue in closing that because Boy A was, but Baran was not, infected with gonorrhea at the time of Baran\u2019s arrest, Baran could not have assaulted Boy A or, by extension, the other children. Further, the Commonwealth argues, trial counsel could pursue the defense that homophobic bias and hysteria accounted for the accusations leveled against Baran. On this view, trial counsel followed a reasonable defense strategy and made effective use of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">That trial counsel\u2019s strategy in this regard was manifestly unreasonable, however, can perhaps most simply be shown by the trial prosecutor\u2019s devastating closing remarks, reproduced below,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> which left that ill-conceived strategy in mins. This was an entirely predictable result given the admission of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that the Commonwealth had promised in its opening, coupled with trial counsel\u2019s failure to present countervailing medical testimony rebutting the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, along with his decision to introduce his client\u2019s homosexuality and prior exposure to venereal disease. We agree with the motion judge\u2019s assessment that \u201cthis was a risk-laden strategy that ... no ordinary fallible criminal defense attorney would have concluded . . . would be to the defendant\u2019s advantage to adopt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As noted earlier, see note 23, <em>supra, </em>trial counsel\u2019s performance must be judged by the standards of the time and not by today\u2019s standards. The Commonwealth advances a view that simply disregards the reality of the times. In 1984, when the trial occurred, private consensual homosexual sex was criminalized in many States, and homosexuality, particularly male homosexuality, often described as a \u201ccrime against nature,\u201d was routinely linked with criminality, child molestation, indecency, deviance, pathology, uncontrolled urges, moral turpitude, and pedophilia. See, e.g., <em>Boutilier </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>387 U.S. 118, 122 (1967); <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 196 (1986) (Burger, C.J., concurring) (\u201cCondemnation of [homosexual] practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>998 F.2d 1247, 1252 &amp; n.6 (4th Cir. 1993); <em>Guam </em>v. <em>Shymanovitz, </em>157 F.3d 1154, 1160-1161 (9th Cir. 1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>507 N.W.2d 847, 852 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993). Compare <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003) (\u201cThe petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime\u201d); <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 349 (2003) (Greaney, J., concurring) (\u201cThe plaintiffs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>members of our community, our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends. . . . We share a common humanity and participate together in the social contract that is the foundation of our Commonwealth\u2019 \u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">It is also well to remember that it was in the 1980\u2019s that alarming information as to the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerged. At the time, this devastating disease affected primarily gay men and caused considerable panic in the general population. Not yet treatable and its transmission not well understood, the disease was greatly feared and those who contracted it faced ostracism. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 663 (1996), <em>S.C., </em>424 Mass. 301 (1997), quoting from <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Hous. Commn., </em>212 Cal. App. 3d 1242, 1252 (1989) (\u201cThe \u2018devastating effects of [AIDS] and widespread lack of knowledge about it have produced deep anxieties, and considerable hysteria, about the disease and those that suffer from it\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>424 Mass. at 305 (\u201cthe widespread ignorance about the nature of this disease and the accompanying prejudices against persons suffering from it or . . . merely alleged to suffer from it, pose dangers to the accuracy and fairness of the legal process\u201d). Without having otherwise properly prepared for a trial where very small children would testify to unspeakable acts, it was in this larger context that trial counsel made his decision to identify Baran\u2019s sexual orientation and not to contest evidence as to gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease. By doing so, he facilitated the speculative, stereotypical, and deeply insidious links between homosexuality, gonorrhea, and child molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We understand the argument that it was reasonable for trial counsel to have raised preemptively the subject of Baran\u2019s sexual orientation, allowing counsel some control over the information and permitting him both to filter out biased prospective jurors (see note 10, <em>supra) </em>and to raise parental and communal homophobia as the reason for the charges brought against Baran. Had trial counsel vigilantly excluded the gonorrhea evidence, and had he taken steps to equip himself for cross-examination with impeachment tools and expert witnesses, the reasonableness of that approach \u2014 while terribly risky given the times and the numerous child molestation charges \u2014 might be a closer question. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that was not trial counsel\u2019s strategy and the question is not a close one: in the circumstances and in the context of the entire trial, the strategy implemented was manifestly unreasonable and would not have been adopted by an ordinary fallible criminal defense attorney. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. As it was, the combined missteps with respect to the explosive topics of gonorrhea and the defendant\u2019s homosexuality, compounding the already significant prejudice that either alone would cause, likely had a material effect on the jury and gave rise to a substantial risk that justice miscarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">4. <em>Failure to object to fresh complaint evidence. </em>On direct appeal, appellate counsel claimed error in the admission of fresh complaint testimony from too many witnesses. We held in 1986:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">\u201cProper instructions on the limited use to which fresh complaint evidence could be put were given at the conclusion of the testimony of the first fresh complaint witness, and the jury were reminded of those instructions on several occasions in the course of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The instructions were repeated in the charge. The testimony complained of assumed particular relevance when considered in light of the various attempts by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to insinuate by questioning and argument that the testimony of the victims had been influenced by parents, social workers and members of the prosecution team. The cases decided in the wake of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-397 (1976), do not support the notion that fresh complaint evidence should be excluded in cases such as the present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-16\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 991. While mindful of this, the motion judge nonetheless concluded that trial counsel had failed, in numerous respects, to protect Baran from improper fresh complaint evidence. To the extent that he faulted trial counsel for not requesting contemporaneous limiting instructions with respect to each witness, given this court\u2019s decision and others of the time, we do not share the motion judge\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-18\">We take a different view, however, with respect to counsel\u2019s failure to make efforts to limit the scope of the fresh complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>evidence. As the court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. at 396:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201c[A defendant] is entitled to have it impressed on the jury that the [fresh complaint] testimony may be used for corroborative purposes only; it cannot be used as hearsay to fill gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case. Usually it will be merely repetitive of the victim\u2019s testimony at the trial. . .\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Notwithstanding this principle, DSS investigator Palumbo, who provided fresh complaint evidence for Boys C and D, and the father of Boy D, for example, testified to additional acts allegedly committed by the defendant, and not described by the complainants, and were permitted to testify to other occasions, not described by the complainants, on which the defendant allegedly committed sexual assaults. Such gap-filling fresh complaint testimony was a powerful credibility enhancing device, yet trial counsel did little to protect his client from it. Had trial counsel been attentive and minimally well-prepared, he should have detected these embellishments and lodged appropriate objections. There was no discernible advantage to the defendant in refraining from objection. His failure to do so, together with his failure to object to the judge\u2019s erroneous and incomplete instructions on fresh complaint,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> was attorney error, as was appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the points on appeal. Particularly when considered in light of the errors already discussed <em>supra, </em>this error contributed to the creation of a substantial risk that justice miscarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">5. <em>Failure to insist on indictment. </em>The defendant was not formally charged with respect to Boy C until the first day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>trial.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges as to Boy C, trial counsel agreed to waive the defendant\u2019s right to an indictment, stating his belief that it \u201cwas the practical thing to do,\u201d and obtained a written waiver from the defendant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 &amp; n.6 (1982) (\u201cA grand jury finding of probable cause is necessary if indictments are to fulfil their traditional function as an effective protection \u2018against unfounded criminal prosecutions.\u2019 . . . \u2018The right of individual citizens to be secure from an open and public accusation of crime and from the trouble, expense and anxiety of public trial, before a probable cause is established by the presentment and indictment of a grand jury, in case of high offences, is justly regarded as one of the securities to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive public prosecutions . . . .\u2019 <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329, 344 [1857]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">It is possible, nonetheless, that in some cases, waiving the right to an indictment may confer strategic advantages on a defendant. Chief among these is the opportunity to demand a preliminary hearing. In the context of such a hearing, a defendant has the opportunity to learn the details of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against him, and to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses, providing an invaluable opportunity for discovery. Here, inexplicably, and despite the fact that trial counsel conceded that he had \u201cvery little information\u201d on the newly added complainant, no preliminary hearing was demanded. Moreover, counsel made no motion for a continuance to permit him additional time for discovery or preparation. Despite the fact that the newly added charges both carried the maximum penalty of life in prison (the sentence which, as to one of the charges at least, ultimately was imposed), trial counsel elected to proceed directly to trial. The defendant derived no advantage from this decision, one that epitomizes the utter lack of regard for proper preparation and zealous advocacy for the important rights of his client that characterized trial counsel\u2019s performance throughout the proceedings. His conduct in this regard amply reflects the \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention\u201d required by the <em>Saferian </em>standard, 366 Mass. at 96, to obtain relief on the basis of ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>representation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>449 Mass. 576, 586 (2007).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the decision to waive the right to an indictment, without seeking a meaningful quid pro quo, ultimately did not prejudice the defendant, and so cannot provide a basis for relief. Such a claim is necessarily grounded on the mistaken premise that the defendant has no claim to relief simply because his trial counsel, even if provided with the opportunity to achieve some strategic advantage for his client, would likely have squandered it due to his ineffectiveness. The standard we use, however, is an objective one, and we look to the ordinary fallible lawyer, and not to defendant\u2019s trial counsel, as our touchstone. Requiring the Commonwealth to obtain an indictment would have provided the defendant, in the ordinary course, with additional time to prepare his case; alternatively, a preliminary hearing might have provided some useful foreshadowing of the Commonwealth\u2019s trial evidence and might well have prompted inquiry as to the unedited videotapes. Even if this particular defense counsel may not have capitalized on these opportunities, it was <em>objectively </em>attorney error to have ignored them altogether. With other such errors, it created the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">6. <em>Failure to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial. </em>The record reflects and the parties appear to agree that, during the testimony of the children, the courtroom was closed to the public. Nothing in the record suggests that this was done upon motion of the Commonwealth or after any hearing at which the necessity of such action, or its impact on the rights of the defendant, was considered. Moreover, there is no evidence that the judge\u2019s decision in this regard was supported by any written findings.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As a result, and as discussed more fully below, the court failed to follow the procedures delineated in both <em>Globe Newspaper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>457 U.S. 596 (1982), and <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984). To the extent that trial counsel failed to take steps to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial as articulated in these decisions, and to the extent that appellate counsel failed to raise the issue on direct appeal, one fully developed at the time of trial, the motion judge found, and we agree, that they were fatally remiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">7. <em>Summary, ineffective assistance. </em>Many of the individual errors identified above would, standing alone, likely provide a sufficient independent basis for granting the defendant a new trial. In particular, defense counsel\u2019s apparent failure to engage in any meaningful preparation for what was indisputably a complex, high-stakes trial represented a more or less complete abandonment of his professional obligations to the defendant. While trial counsel may have had some good ideas, he failed utterly in developing and implementing them. The strategic choices trial counsel made were not informed choices, made after investigation of the law and facts. His inability to undermine the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses speaks both to his lack of preparation and his quite limited trial skills. Ultimately all these factors converged, resulting in cascading and pervasive error, with zealous advocacy yielding to acquiescence and accommodation. In the end, we need not consider whether any single instance of nonfeasance meets the standard required to obtain a new trial on the basis of attorney error. It is enough to say that, in the aggregate, trial counsel\u2019s performance, followed by appellate counsel\u2019s, unquestionably fell below the minimum constitutional requirements imposed by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. at 115.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>66 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>App. Ct. 167 (2006). To the extent that the standard of review is whether counsel\u2019s errors gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we are satisfied that the errors prejudiced Baran, materially influenced the verdict, and were not reasonable tactical decisions. The motion judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">C. <em>Other issues. </em>1. <em>Public trial. </em>As already noted, the trial judge closed the courtroom to the press and public during the most crucial phase of the trial proceedings, the testimony of the child complainants. He did so without making any findings to warrant the closure. At the time of trial, the tight to a public trial was well established as a matter of Federal constitutional law. Irrespective of whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this regard, the motion judge was also warranted, on this independent basis, in granting the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>457 U.S. 596 (1982), involving the testimony of minor victims of sexual offenses, the Supreme Court determined that, notwithstanding a State statute mandating closure, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution requires courts to consider on a case-by-case basis whether closure of a courtroom to the public, including the press, is warranted, with a strong presumption in favor of a public trial. As the Court observed: \u201c[T]he State\u2019s justification in denying access [to the public] must be a weighty one. Where ... the State attempts to deny the right of access in order to inhibit the disclosure of sensitive information, it must be shown that the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\u201d 457 U.S. at 606-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Applying similar principles, the Supreme Court in <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. of Cal., </em>464 U.S. 501 (1984), concluded that a trial judge had erred in closing jury voir dire proceedings to the public and in sealing the transcripts of same.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> A few months after <em>Press-Enterprise </em>was decided, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Court revisited the question of the right to a public trial in <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39 (1984). However, unlike <em>Globe Newspaper </em>and <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>both of which focused on the First Amendment, the Court in <em>Waller </em>considered instead the public trial rights conferred by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The <em>Waller </em>Court began its analysis by adverting to these earlier First Amendment cases and observing: \u201c[T]here can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.\u201d 467 U.S. at 46. The Court then set out a four-part test for determining when proceedings may be closed to the public consistent with the Sixth Amendment: \u201c[T]he party seeking to close [a] hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. After finding that \u201cthe State\u2019s proffer was not specific as to [the potential harm created by an open hearing], ... the trial court\u2019s findings were broad and general, . . . [and t]he court did not consider alternatives to . . . closure of the entire hearing,\u201d the Supreme Court ordered a new hearing in Waller.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In the present case, nothing of record establishes that any of the prophylactic procedures mandated by the First and Sixth Amendments, as articulated in the Supreme Court decisions just described, were followed. Specifically, there is nothing in the record indicating what specific harm \u2014 what \u201coverriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>\u2014 was avoided through closure of the trial,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and no suggestion that interested parties, including the press, had the \u201copportunity to be heard on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>question of their exclusion.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper, </em>457 U.S. at 609 n.25 (citation omitted). Moreover, there is no dispute that the trial judge made no record \u201cfindings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>464 U.S. at 511. Indeed, as we have noted, there were no findings whatsoever. \u201cThe presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest <em>based on findings </em>that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated <em>along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly </em>entered\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 510. We are unable to undertake such an inquiry here and, in these circumstances, conclude that the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional right to a public trial, as this right was defined at the time of trial, was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201cGenerally, the appropriate relief for violations of the constitutional right to a public trial is a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 196 (1994), citing <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. at 49. A violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is a structural error and not susceptible to harmless error analysis. See <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 49 n.9 (\u201cThe parties do not question the consistent view of the lower federal courts that the defendant should not be required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief for a violation of the public-trial guarantee. We agree with that view\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patry, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 476 (2000) (same). Thus, \u201conce a petitioner demonstrates a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, he need not show that the violation prejudiced him in any way. The mere demonstration that his right to a public trial was violated entitles a petitioner to relief.\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>483 F.3d 48, 63 (1st Cir. 2007), quoting from <em>Judd </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1315 (11th Cir. 2001).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Our conclusion in this regard is bolstered by the fact that the judge closed the courtroom during the most crucial phase of the trial proceedings, the testimony of the child complainants. The evidence provided by the children represented the core of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant, constituting as it did the only direct evidence of his guilt. The policy interests underlying the right to a public trial include the opportunity that open hearings provide for \u201cscrutiny of the judicial process\u201d and the tendency for public proceedings to \u201c discourage [] false testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. at 192-193. These considerations had especial application in the particular circumstances of this case. The judgments cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">2. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>The motion judge did not address the defendant\u2019s contention that prosecutorial misconduct independently warranted a new trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. at 912, and made few findings relevant to the issue. In his motion, the defendant had called attention to prosecutorial vouching for government witnesses, improper closing argument, the failure to disclose significant exculpatory evidence in the government\u2019s possession, and intentionally presenting false and misleading evidence to the grand jury. Notwithstanding the absence of findings, the record provides support for certain of these contentions, as we have already noted in our discussion of vouching and improper argument. The record is less clear on the remaining points, though nonetheless troubling in certain respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>While the record does not settle the question whether the unedited videotapes were deliberately withheld by the prosecution, there are indications in the trial transcript consistent with that contention, e.g., the trial prosecutor\u2019s provision, after trial was underway, of edited rather than unedited tapes of Boy C\u2019s interview as well as the prosecutor\u2019s recognition that what trial counsel had in his possession and reviewed during trial were the edited videotapes.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The unedited tapes, evaluated in the context of the entire record, are exculpatory and material insofar as they \u201ccreate[] a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>388 Mass. 98, 110 (1983), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112 (1976). See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963). The unedited tapes reveal significant vacillation and uncertainty on the part of many, if not all, of the children interviewed, as well as considerable material from which it could be inferred that the children\u2019s testimony was coached. Particularly powerful are the numerous instances in which various complainants deny that the defendant had engaged in any misconduct. At a minimum, these tapes would have provided significant grist for impeachment of the children\u2019s testimony as well as of those who had interviewed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Also troubling in this regard is the prosecutor\u2019s apparent failure to produce various police reports and other materials that, among other things, might have supported the inference that one or more of the complainants had been sexually abused by another \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>evidence that might have been used either for impeachment or to rebut allegations of age-inappropriate sexual knowledge.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> See generally <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 696 (2004) (\u201cA rule . . . declaring \u2018prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,\u2019 is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As to the grand jury presentment, the motion judge found that only a composite videotape, containing edited versions of the interviews, was shown to the grand jury. Our review of the composite tape and comparison of it to the unedited counterparts reveals a somewhat distorted portrayal of the children\u2019s allegations, the composite tape omitting significant exculpatory content. As the motion judge stated in his memorandum and order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cAll [of] the edited versions [shown to the grand jury] omit statements of denial and statements indicative of suggestiveness .... The unedited versions [of the videotapes] contain statements in which the children deny that Mr. Ba-ran had done anything to them and statements where they accuse other persons of abuse. They also containf] statements which accuse[] other people of witnessing these alleged acts \u2014 evidence which counsel could have used to . . . [challenge] the veracity of the allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The motion judge offered numerous illustrative examples culled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>from the transcripts of the unedited videotapes, including the following excerpt from the interview with Boy A,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> which was omitted from the grand jury version:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201c[Cjould [you] tell me a little bit more about what Bernie did to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">A.: \u201cHe didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cYeah. I know, you showed me. You showed me where he pulled down your pee pee stick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">A.: \u201cHe didn\u2019t now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it now, though. Did he, did he do it more than one time, do you know?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">A.: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">Father: \u201cNo, you\u2019re a good kid. So can you tell her if Bernie said anything, or if you said anything?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">A.: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cYou don\u2019t know. Okay. Maybe you\u2019ll remember some other time and you can tell me. Maybe you don\u2019t remember right now. Maybe it will come back to you, what Bernie said to you. When you went to the doctor yesterday, was your pee pee okay?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">A.: \u201cYup.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">The motion judge also provided this example from Boy D\u2019s interview, which was likewise omitted from the grand jury version:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-16\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cOkay. We were talking about when you went to ECDC, right [boy nods yes], do you remember when you were there a long time ago [boy nods yes], do you remember <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>being touched with bad touch? [Boy nods yes.] Yeah? Who touched you [i]n a bad touch way?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">A.: \u201c[A classmate].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201c[Your classmate] did? Do you remember any big people, adult people who touched [another classmate] in a bad way that made him feel kind of funny inside, like that person shouldn\u2019t do that to me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">A.: \u201cMary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAre you sure it was Mary? [Boy nods yes.] Yeah?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">These examples, as well as others cited by the motion judge, appear typical of the type of material omitted from the composite videotape presented to the grand jury. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. 810, 817 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The defendant also points to evidence (see notes 21 and 24, supra) that the trial prosecutor, before trial, turned over certain material from his case files to the law firm representing Girl E and her mother, the same law firm that later represented Baran on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Motion counsel raised the issue of prosecutorial misconduct as both an independent basis for a new trial and a sufficient basis to dismiss the charges with prejudice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, 316 </em>Mass. 811, 819-820 (1978) (\u201cAprosecuting attorney\u2019s obligation is to secure a fair and impartial trial for the public and for the defendant. His obligation to the defendant in this regard is as great as is his obligation to the public. The district attorney is vital to the administration of justice and to the vindication of constitutional rights\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, 373 </em>Mass. 438 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983); <em>Donavan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 13, 15 (1997). While preserving the issue on appeal, motion counsel nonetheless pressed only to retain the remedy the motion judge had awarded; no other remedy is warranted on the present record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>453 Mass. 653, 665-666 (2009) (\u201cdelineating] limited circumstances for dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ing a complaint due to prosecutorial misconduct: ... if the governmental conduct resulted in such irremediable harm that a fair trial. . . is no longer possible. . .; [or] where the prosecutor\u2019s conduct is otherwise so egregious that dismissal is warranted to deter similar future misconduct\u201d [citations omitted]). Given that the motion judge is no longer on the Superior Court bench, that two other independent bases warrant the allowance of a new trial, and that it is unclear whether a retrial will be sought, we conclude that a remand at this time for further evidentiary hearings and findings would not serve the interests of judicial economy.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion. </em>We do not lightly affirm the order granting a new trial. For that reason, we have painstakingly examined the record, the motion judge\u2019s decision, and the legal issues on which it is based.

Thus, it is impossible to determine from the record alone whether the unedited videotapes were part of the \u201cphysical evidence\u201d provided. The motion judge did not make any findings in this regard, or as to whether the</p>\n<p id=\"AaA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>unedited tapes were otherwise made available to trial counsel before or during trial, or whether they were deliberately withheld by the Commonwealth. There is no disagreement that trial counsel never in fact viewed the unedited videotapes; what remains unresolved is why this was so. As already noted, the motion judge limited the evidentiary hearing to the issue of ineffective assistance and did not permit the trial prosecutor to be called as a witness; this, in effect, precluded further exploration of the matter. Although the evidentiary basis for his contention is not obvious from the record on appeal, the district attorney (who was not the trial prosecutor) argued at the 2005 hearing on the motion for new trial that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">\u201calthough [the unedited videotapes] were not provided and apparently not turned over to trial counsel at the time, they were not deliberately withheld . . .

They weren\u2019t hidden from him at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">For purposes of ineffective assistance analysis alone, it does not matter whether the Commonwealth made the unedited videotapes available or withheld them. The motion judge found that, had trial counsel \u201csimply viewed the edited tapes seasonably in advance of trial. . . given any degree of perceptivity and thought, such a viewing would have likely suggested that each interview was but a portion of a longer interview.\u201d The ordinary fallible lawyer would then have sought the unedited videotapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\"> Upon request by trial counsel, however, the judge informed potential jurors during individual voir dire that they would be hearing evidence that might tend to show the defendant was homosexual or had homosexual tendencies and inquired of them whether a witness\u2019s homosexuality would cause them to believe the testimony of that witness any more or less, and whether they could be impartial on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> On the morning of January 18, 1985, before the competency hearing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Boy A and the other complainants that would take place later that afternoon, an investigator from DSS interviewed Boy A and his foster mother in connection with a report under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (51A report). Boy A and his younger half-brother had been placed in foster care by the end of October, 1984, and Boy A had recently told his foster mother, apparently spontaneously, that his mother\u2019s then-boyfriend, John, had earlier orally raped the boy. (Boy A, who had been diagnosed with gonorrhea of the throat in October, 1984, had not reported in his unedited videotaped interview on October 7 that Baran had orally raped him; nor did he so testify in his subsequent trial testimony.) The investigator knew about Boy A\u2019s involvement in the Baran prosecution and spoke at 4:00 p.m. on January 18 about Boy A with fellow DSS investigator Patricia Palumbo; Palumbo told the investigator that Boy A had been \u201coff the wall\u201d at the competency hearing in the judge\u2019s chambers and attributed his behavior to overload that day due to the DSS worker\u2019s earlier visit. The 51A report concerning Mother A\u2019s boyfriend John was substantiated in a January 21, 1985, report under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (51B report). Boy A testified at Baran\u2019s trial on January 24, and Patricia Palumbo testified on January 28. The jury returned its verdicts on January 30, the same day the allegations concerning John were referred to the district attorney for prosecution. Baran\u2019s trial concluded with sentencing on January 31, 1985. Trial counsel was not informed of Boy A\u2019s disclosures about John, the 51A and 5 IB reports, or the referral for prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\"> The judge\u2019s lingering concerns about the competency of Girl F, the youngest of the children, were alleviated after he and counsel on the first day of trial watched a videotape of the child\u2019s November 3, 1984, interview recorded at the district attorney\u2019s office. It is not clear from the record which version of the videotape they viewed, edited or unedited. The motion judge found that, while there is a \u201cfull\u201d and an edited version of the Girl F videotapes, it remains unclear whether a videotape of the entire interview of Girl F has in fact been found. As he noted, \u201cThe longest video currently available to the defendant of [Girl F] is still significantly shorter than the other full interviews and seems to start midway through the interview.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> Having been provided at the time by the Commonwealth with only two one-page police reports concerning Boy C, trial counsel, after waiving indictment, requested that the prosecutor provide any other available information as to Boy C.

The third physician, Dr. Jeffrey Ross, was a pathologist who opined as to gonorrhea and its transmission and treatment. The child psychotherapist, Jane Satullo, was employed at the local rape crisis center, and conducted a puppet show as well as the videotaped interviews of Boy A and Girl B in October, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> To the extent that we stated in 1986 that no more than one fresh complaint witness had been permitted to testify as to the content of any one complaint, we were mistaken. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>21 Mass.

Such information includes (a) the recent affidavit of a pediatrician proffering an expert opinion, based on current medical knowledge, that the ruptured condition of the hymen of Girl B, observed and described by Dr. Sheeley in 1984 and 1985 as being consistent with penetration by adult fingers, is instead consistent with normalcy; (b) recantations by three of the six children (two made to therapists within months of the defendant\u2019s conviction and one made to high school classmates) and by the boyfriend of Boy A\u2019s mother who first reported Baran to the police; and (c) information concerning the sexual abuse history of another of the complainant\u2019s mothers. The defendant also claimed as newly discovered the information learned during the posttrial discovery process as to (d) appellate counsel\u2019s conflicts of interest, particularly with respect to the firm\u2019s representation of Girl E and her family during and after the defendant\u2019s trial, but before taking on the defendant\u2019s appeal; and, in that context, the fact that, prior to the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial prosecutor, without informing defense counsel, shared some portion of his case file on the Baran matter with members of the firm representing Girl E and her family (which, as noted, later represented Baran on direct appeal). See note 24, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\"> The defendant faulted trial counsel for failing to conduct any meaningful pretrial discovery or investigation or to master such information as the Commonwealth did make available. Had trial counsel mastered the information made available, had he interviewed the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and investigated potential defense witnesses, and had he sought out information and material in the Commonwealth\u2019s control, motion counsel contended that trial counsel would have discovered the unedited videotapes (if not already made available to him); other instances of abuse (i.e., committed by persons other than the defendant) that might have accounted for age-inappropriate knowledge on the part of the child complainants; widespread use of improperly suggestive interview techniques; exculpatory medical evidence; financial incentives underlying some of the claims of abuse; and multiple sources of bias against the defendant. The defendant also faulted trial counsel\u2019s failure to hire any expert witnesses in a case fraught with issues as to which expert testimony might have provided exculpatory evidence, particularly given the Commonwealth\u2019s use of multiple expert witnesses. Other claims of ineffective assistance included trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial once the counts involving Boy A were dismissed; request limiting instructions with respect to a significant volume of fresh complaint testimony; assert the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial; attempt to exclude hearsay evidence offered by the complainants\u2019 parents and those who interviewed the children; object to the substitution of an undisclosed witness, Dr. King (who treated Girl B and gave expert testimony), or request information about King\u2019s credentials and experience, the factual basis for her opinions, and her treatment records as to Girl B; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>move for dismissal of the indictments on the basis of irregularities in the grand jury presentment; and prepare adequately for trial, including reviewing such videotapes as were available to him of pretrial interviews with the child complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">As to appellate counsel, the defendant claimed that his attorneys were ineffective insofar as they failed to reveal to the defendant a significant and disabling conflict of interest, i.e., that their firm had previously represented Girl E and her family in a civil suit predicated upon the defendant\u2019s alleged acts. Motion counsel maintained that, as a result of this conflict, appellate counsel failed to investigate or use exculpatory evidence relating to other perpetrators of sexual assaults upon Girl E. In this regard, appellate counsel arguably would independently have known from their representation of the E family that in October, 1984, Girl E told her mother and Dr. Sheeley, who both then reported to the police, that Mother E\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cChino,\u201d had molested Girl E in the summer of 1984. See note 24, <em>infra. </em>Finally, the defendant asserted that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to identify numerous obvious missteps (as outlined above) on the part of his trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b306-4\"> The Commonwealth correctly maintains that defense counsel\u2019s performance must be judged by the standards of the time \u2014 almost twenty-five years ago \u2014 when the trial occurred, not by reference to the standards of today. To meet the constitutional requirements of effectiveness, an attorney need not be clairvoyant as to either future shifts in the legal landscape or unforeseen advances in scientific or medical knowledge. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 644 (1997). As the court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 442 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978), \u201c[a] strategic or tactical decision by counsel will not be considered ineffective assistance unless that decision was \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 <em>when </em>made\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 867, 875, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1021 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\"> The Commonwealth argued to the motion judge, but does not argue on appeal, that the defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance were waived. We note, however, that even if the Commonwealth had continued to argue waiver in its appeal to this court, a finding that counsel on direct appeal had a disabling conflict of interest would, to whatever extent it might matter, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 31 n.12 (1999), make the waiver rule inapplicable, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra, </em>would supply the standard of review. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 49-50 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Although the motion judge did not make findings as to whether appellate counsel had such a conflict of interest when the law firm undertook to represent Baran in his direct appeal, the record would support such a finding. See <em>Gos-sels </em>v. <em>Fleet Natl. Bank, </em>453 Mass. 366, 368 n.9 (2009). On January 3, 1985, a member of the firm that later represented Baran on direct appeal received from the trial prosecutor, as requested, a copy of search warrant materials in the Baran matter; this was several weeks before the start of Baran\u2019s trial and neither Baran nor his trial counsel was copied on the correspondence. By the beginning of February, 1985, an associate at the firm had resigned from the ECDC board due to a conflict arising from her firm\u2019s representation of clients contemplating suit against ECDC. Those clients were Girl E and her mother. On behalf of the E family, and following the Baran trial, the same attorney who later wrote Baran\u2019s appellate brief requested documents from Dr. Sheeley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>and the district attorney concerning Girl E and Mother E, including with his request a signed release by Mother E. The foregoing would support the reasonable inference that appellate counsel began their representation of Girl E before the Baran trial took place, at which both Girl E and Mother E testified, or immediately thereafter, and that appellate counsel received the documents requested from Dr. Sheeley if not also from the district attorney. At a minimum, this would include Dr. Sheeley\u2019s notes dated October 13, 1984, referring to Girl E\u2019s sexual abuse in the summer of 1984 by \u201cChino,\u201d Mother E\u2019s boyfriend. See note 52, <em>infra. </em>The identification of a molester other than Baran would be detrimental information in the related matter of a civil suit arising solely out of Baran\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Appellate counsel began their representation of Baran in May, 1985, by which time they had apparently ceased representation of Girl E and her mother. Appellate counsel did not raise the \u201cChino\u201d allegation in any respect in their appellate brief on behalf of Baran nor question the financial bias underlying the testimony of Mother E and Girl E; trial counsel had not raised either issue at trial, and neither was part of the trial record. A lawyer from appellate counsel\u2019s firm testified before the motion judge that he had no memory as to what was in the file the firm had received from trial counsel. Appellate counsel, however, would nonetheless have independently known about the \u201cChino\u201d allegation by virtue of their prior representation of Girl E and her mother, but could not use it on Baran\u2019s behalf. This suggests a situation of competing loyalties occasioned by the acquisition of privileged information that extant Rules of Professional Conduct proscribed in the absence of a waiver by the client. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101, as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981), and Canon 5, DR 5-105(A) &amp; (C), as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 503-505, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985), and cases cited. The appellate lawyer who wrote Baran\u2019s brief acknowledged that Baran had not signed a written waiver. While counsel had no memory as to whether he or the other lawyer on the direct appeal had in fact disclosed to Baran the firm\u2019s prior representation of Girl E and her mother, he testified that it would have been his practice to do so. Both Baran and his mother, however, whose testimony the motion judge credited in other respects, testified that no such disclosure had been made. Whether regarded as an actual conflict of interest or a potential conflict on the part of appellate counsel resulting in actual prejudice, the foregoing testimony would have permitted either finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\"> The motion judge accepted Dr. Brack\u2019s expertise as relevant after taking into account her professional credentials, experience, affiliations, and extensive record of publications.

As to the former, for example, trial counsel failed to uncover a letter dated October 23, 1984, from the lawyer for Boy C\u2019s family to ECDC contemplating a civil lawsuit. The latter type of information, if pursued, could have been used both to explain any age-inappropriate sexual knowledge evidenced by the complainants and to counter the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis in his closing that the child complainants should be believed because \u201ca child of such tender years simply does not have the cognitive ability to make up or fabricate a story about sexual abuse . . . three and four year old children simply wouldn\u2019t talk about these types of things unless they really happened.\u201d For example, the fact that Girl E appears to have acknowledged that acts ascribed to the defendant were congruent with those committed by her mother\u2019s boyfriend would have provided strong potential basis for cross-examination. In this regard, we note the motion judge\u2019s finding that trial counsel had been placed on notice of the possible existence of police and DSS records relating to other instances of sexual abuse involving Girl E. Specifically, the judge found that medical notes prepared by Dr. Jean Sheeley, the pediatrician who examined Girl E in October, 1984, were turned over to trial counsel. The notes contain Girl E\u2019s disclosure to the doctor that her mother\u2019s boyfriend had earlier done the \u201csame thing\u201d to her in a West Springfield motel. See note 52, <em>infra. </em>Although the nonproduction of other materials to trial counsel concerning Girl E and Boy A (see <em>ibid, </em>and note 11, supra) likely contravened <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>trial counsel was also ineffective in not seeking out further information at least as to Girl E on his own initiative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\"> We ultimately need not reach this question in view of the other significant missteps by defense counsel, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> Although even the edited videotapes contained some inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainants, trial counsel did not use them to undermine Satullo\u2019s testimony regarding the veracity of the children\u2019s testimony concerning sexual abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Dr. King\u2019s name did not appear on the Commonwealth\u2019s witness list, yet trial counsel made no effort to have her testimony excluded. Nor did trial counsel make any serious effort to challenge the foundation underlying King\u2019s expert opinions or her qualifications for offering same, having not even requested copies of her treatment records for Girl B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> With respect to Satullo\u2019s statement that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for a child to repeat a false story consistently, the judge stated at side bar that the testimony \u201ccould be misunderstood by the jurors.\u201d The judge thereafter instructed the jury, as to Satullo specifically, that an expert \u201cwould not have been permitted and did not refer to the specific testimony of certain witnesses in this case . . . [and that] whether anyone is telling you the truth in a trial on the witness stand is exclusively the province of jurors.\u201d He did not instruct similarly with respect to Dr. King\u2019s opinion on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> In the case of both King\u2019s and Satullo\u2019s testimony, the prejudicial impact of the vouching was compounded by the fact that these witnesses were both percipient and expert witnesses; King had treated one of the complainants, and Satullo had interviewed two of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> In addition to examining Girl B on October 8, 1984, and generating medical notes that the prosecutor turned over to trial counsel, Dr. Sheeley also did a more extensive gynecological examination of Girl B on January 16, 1985, right before trial and unbeknownst to trial counsel. When trial counsel, with the earlier medical notes in hand, attempted to cross-examine Sheeley as to her opinion that Girl B had suffered a full rupture of her hymen consistent with full penetration, he learned for the first time and to his client\u2019s disadvantage of the recent examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> Indeed, the latter point itself turns on the credibility accorded the minimalist testimony of Boys C and D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b319-4\"> As noted elsewhere (see note 11, <em>supra), </em>there was evidence that Boy A had been orally raped by his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the same time frame in which the alleged attacks by the defendant occurred, but such evidence was not disclosed to defense counsel by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b319-5\"> In his opening, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cDr. Sheeley will . . . tell you that she took some cultures from [Boy A]\u2019s rectum and from [his] mouth and you\u2019ll hear that the culture taken from [his] throat was chemically analyzed and [it] was found that little [Boy A], four years of age, had gonorrhea in his throat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cFinally, you will hear that as part of the investigation the Pittsfield Police Department obtained a warrant authorizing them to take Mr. Ba-jan to the Berkshire Medical Center for purposes of determining if he had gonorrhea. That was done on October 10, 1984, six days after the first case came to light. You\u2019ll hear the test results were negative. On October 10th of \u201884, Bernard Baran did not have gonorrhea, there\u2019s no dispute about that. But, you\u2019ll hear something else, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cYou\u2019ll hear from a doctor named Jeffrey S. Ross that gonorrhea is the kind of disease that can be cured relatively easily and very quickly; that with proper medication it could be eradicated and cleared up in a matter of days, in some cases virtually overnight. You\u2019ll hear how gonorrhea is spread. It\u2019s possible for a person who has gonorrhea to give it to one sex partner and not to another depending on the type of contacts and a number of other factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cSo, because [Boy A] had gonorrhea in his throat and because no other child, thank God, had gonorrhea, I ask you to listen carefully to that evidence because you might find it to be very important and that, in a nutshell, is what the Commonwealth will attempt to prove during the course of this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> Notwithstanding the fact that there had been no testimony at trial that Ba-ran had orally raped Boy A, and, in any event, a required finding as to all the charges concerning Boy A had entered at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, defense counsel and the prosecutor continued to focus on the facts surrounding Boy A right through the closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The prosecutor argued, \u201c[Trial counsel] says: \u2018No, it can\u2019t be. It can\u2019t be. [Boy A] had gonorrhea in his mouth and Bernard Baran didn\u2019t have gonorrhea.\u2019 Well, in the first place you heard Dr. Sheeley and Dr. Ross say that it is entirely possible for a person who has gonorrhea to give it to one sex partner and not to another. It depends upon the type of contact for one thing. A person who has gonorrhea on his penis is not going to give it to a child by putting his finger into the child\u2019s private area. It\u2019s not going to be spread that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u201cYou heard the doctors say that gonorrhea is the kind of disease that can be cured very easily and quickly. With the proper treatment it takes twelve to twenty-four hours, sometimes forty-eight hours. Bernard Baran did not have gonorrhea on October 10th, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have it when he raped these children. Remember he was bailed out on October 7th at 2:00 p.m. He was tested three days later on October 10th after 7:00 p.m. If he had it don\u2019t you think the first thing he would have done upon being bailed out is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>have it treated to get rid of it and three days is adequate time. We know that from the medical testimony. But don\u2019t stop there. If he had it at any point before October 6 he would have gotten rid of it the next day. It\u2019s entirely consistent for him to have had it when he abused [Boy A] and the next time he had access to a child, for him to have gotten rid of it. It\u2019s perfectly consistent and perfectly logical to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cRemember Dr. Ross told you that people who have had it once before have a greater chance of getting it a second time by virtue of their life style. You recall Bernard Baran\u2019s own testimony that when he was fourteen or fifteen he had venereal disease. What does that tell you? That tells you why [Boy A] had gonorrhea in his throat. Poor little boy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> Trial counsel also erred in failing to object to the judge\u2019s instructions on fresh complaint testimony. At the time of trial, the law required a trial judge to instruct that, in order for fresh complaint testimony to be considered for corroborative purposes, the jury must find that a complaint was, in fact, fresh. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sherry, 386 Mass. 682, 690-691 (1982). The trial judge here, rather than stating that a complaint must be made \u201creasonably promptly,\u201d see <em>id. </em>at 691, or using some other approved formulation, instead stated cryptically \u2014 and only during his preliminary instructions on the topic \u2014 that the complaint must be received \u201cduring a certain period of time.\u201d His final charge omitted any reference to the timeliness requirement altogether. This was an important omission, and one that should have caught the attention of trial and appellate counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> See notes 6 and 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> It is worth recalling that despite the large number of complainants and witnesses, the complexity of the medical and psychological evidence, and the gravity of the charges, trial counsel proceeded to trial approximately nine weeks after the defendant was indicted, a period that included the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year holidays.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> There is nothing of record regarding the trial judge\u2019s decision to close the courtroom to the public during the testimony of the complainants. The record does reflect the fact that defense counsel objected when the trial judge proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>partitioning the courtroom during the complainants\u2019 testimony such that neither the defendant nor the jury would be able to observe the complainants directly while they were in the witness box. However, the record also indicates that on at least two occasions when the judge ordered the courtroom closed, defense counsel lodged no contemporaneous objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> This may, in fact, be one of those rare cases \u201cwhere the defense was so botched,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. at 115, that it is unnecessary even to inquire closely whether and in what manner precisely a better effort \u201cmight have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\"> In particular, the <em>Press-Enterprise </em>Court faulted the trial judge for failing to disclose the basis for his decision and for failing to consider less restrictive options. In reversing the judge\u2019s impoundment order, the Court stated: \u201c[a]ssuming that some jurors had protectible privacy interests in some of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>answers, the trial judge provided no explanation as to why his broad order denying access to information at the voir dire was not limited to information that was actually sensitive and deserving of privacy protection. Nor did he consider whether he could disclose the substance of the sensitive answers while preserving the anonymity of the jurors involved.\u201d 464 U.S. at 513.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"><em> Waller </em>involved a pretrial hearing. The right to a public trial inheres even more strongly in the context of regular trial proceedings, and <em>Waller </em>has been so construed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 193-194 (1994). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 44, 47-49 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> During a side bar colloquy during which the trial judge discussed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>counsel a proposal to partition the courtroom during the complainants\u2019 testimony, the judge never indicated that he had any specific or serious concerns about their ability to testify in open court. Rather, the judge indicated that the children \u201cmay not feel comfortable\u201d in the courtroom as ordinarily configured. Apart from the fact that the judge cited no basis for his assessment, such mild, general concerns would hardly amount to the sort of \u201ccompelling interest\u201d required to justify closure. Indeed, in the context of minor sexual assault victims, the requisite compelling interest has been defined as \u201ca significant risk of psychological harm or trauma.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. at 194. Based on the judge\u2019s statements, such a risk does not appear to have been present here. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 241 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> We note further that, while the right to a public trial is one that may be waived, the Commonwealth did not make this argument on appeal. In any event, based on the evidence before us, and consistent with the findings of the motion judge, who heard testimony from the defendant and his mother on this point, we conclude that no waiver was tendered. Moreover, we find troubling the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the absence of findings should somehow preclude a determination that the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional rights were violated. In the first instance, as noted above, the absence of findings, in and of itself, violates the constitutionally mandated procedures set out in these cases. Moreover, the record provides at least some basis for drawing conclusions as to the judge\u2019s assessment of the complainants\u2019 mental state. See note 49, <em>supra. </em>Finally \u2014\u2022 and most important \u2014 a closed trial is presumptively unlawful, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. 432, 435 (1969), and constitutes error per se in the absence of an affirmative showing that closure of the type here comports with applicable procedural safeguards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> The process of obtaining the unedited videotapes posttrial was long and arduous. Motion counsel\u2019s efforts to obtain the unedited videotapes were documented by the motion judge. Motion counsel first requested the unedited tapes on December 4, 2000. A year later, an interim order entered requiring the Commonwealth to file within one month certificates as to the existence of the tapes or any objections to their production. After three extensions requested by the Commonwealth, and a hearing before the motion judge, a second interim order entered on October 25, 2001, which, inter alia, directed counsel to confer and to draft a protective order. The motion judge noted that \u201cthere was delay in obtaining the agreement of the Commonwealth to the protective order,\u201d which was submitted to court on April 4, 2002. Although by that time three tapes had been located (two of which were edited grand jury tapes), they were not sent to the defendant until a further order issued from the court on July 23, 2004. At a subsequent discovery hearing on September 17, 2004, the prosecutor reported that he had found five unedited tapes in a box of old \u201cDUI\u201d tapes, and delivered them to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\"> As previously discussed, see notes 22, 24, and 31, <em>supra, </em>there was evidence as to Girl E that the Commonwealth failed to disclose regarding her abuse by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cChino.\u201d Detective McGuire of the Pitts-field police department, who testified at trial, knew as of October 13, 1984, that Girl E had disclosed to Dr. Sheeley that day not only molestation by the defendant but also earlier molestation of the same kind by her mother\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Chino. The same day, October 13, the detective took statements from Girl E and Mother E about the defendant which, however, did not mention the Chino disclosures (these statements were later produced to trial counsel). Also on October 13, the detective reported to DSS the allegation that, in early July, 1984, at a West Springfield motel, Chino had orally raped the girl and touched her genitalia. DSS later substantiated this 51A report and referred the matter to the district attorney on October 18, 1984. Neither the 51A and 5 IB reports nor the referral for prosecution as to Chino were provided to trial counsel. Nor was trial counsel provided a copy of Detective McGuire\u2019s November 7, 1984, letter to a sergeant in the West Springfield police department detailing Girl E\u2019s disclosures about Chino. As to evidence that Boy A had been abused by his mother\u2019s boyfriend, see notes 11 and 39, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> As we have noted, the case against Baran began with the A family\u2019s allegations. The excerpts from the unedited videotapes of Boy A\u2019s interview foreshadow his testimony at trial where, as the motion judge noted, \u201cDue to Boy A being unable to testify to criminal acts alleged to have been committed upon him, the court allowed a required finding of not guilty [on] the two counts in which he [was] the complainant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> Nothing we have said should be understood as precluding the defendant from bringing a motion seeking to dismiss the indictments pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> Although the defendant did not bring his motion for new trial until eighteen years after his direct appeal was decided, we note that the passage of time \u201cdoes not invalidate such motion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 636 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>411 Mass. 579, 585-586 (1992). Nor has the Commonwealth argued that the delay was deliberate or strategic. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra </em>at 585. The filing of the motion was preceded by four years of what the motion judge described as \u201can intensive effort on the part of defense counsel ... to obtain discovery . . . some of which had been . . . kept in the custody of the clerk and others likely kept, if at all, in the possession of the Commonwealth.\u201d Given the evidence of appellate counsel\u2019s conflict of interest (see, e.g., note 24, <em>supra), </em>and other circumstances discussed earlier, such as the apparent withholding of DSS and police reports (see, e.g., note 52, <em>supra), </em>and the delay in producing the unedited videotapes (see note 51, <em>supra), </em>consequences attendant to the delay in bringing the new trial motion cannot be attributed to the defendant.
