(LP-Milford), had underpaid its unemployment contributions for the period from the fourth quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 2004. The total assessment against LP-Milford, including interest, was $83,043.05. A District Court judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision in a review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On appeal, LP-Milford claims that (1) the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the assessment against LP-Milford was based upon an improper retroactive application of an amendment to G. L. c. 151 A, the \u201cUnemployment Insurance Law,\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74, as amended through St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7 588; (3) the board\u2019s chairman engaged in impermissible witness coaching at a hearing; and (4) the division\u2019s notice of hearing, dated March 3, 2005, was defective. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>LP-Milford and Lincoln Pharmacy of West-boro (LP-Westboro) are Massachusetts corporations with common ownership. Richard Aronovitz is the sole shareholder of both corporations and holds the titles of president, treasurer, clerk, and director with each. LP-Milford was incorporated in 1977 to operate drug stores, and at one point, it operated seven locations with approximately 200 employees. At the time of the hearings before the board, however, LP-Milford only operated two locations, which were liquor stores instead of drug stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">LP-Milford and LP-Westboro were both registered as employers under the Unemployment Insurance Law, formerly known as the Employment and Training Law. The division assigned separate employer numbers to LP-Milford and LP-Westboro. At the beginning of each calendar year, the division assigned each employer a separate and different contribution (tax) rate as required by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 14. Under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 14, an employer makes contributions to the unemployment trust fund according to its \u201cexperience rate,\u201d which is computed annually, based on the employer\u2019s payroll in the prior twelve months, the payments made to the fund in the past, and the payments made to its former employees for unemployment benefits. Because the experience rate is recalculated on an annual basis, having a lower payroll amount in a given year will ordinarily result in a lower experience rate for the following year.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In 2002, the division\u2019s research department noticed that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>when filing their contribution reports pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14, and 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.03 (1994, 1997), LP-Milford and LP-Westboro, two corporations with common ownership, were shifting almost their entire payroll, on an annual basis, to the corporation assigned the lower contribution rate. The following table illustrates the payroll-shifting that occurred between the two corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In July and September of 2002, the division conducted an audit during which it examined the financial records of both corporations, including checking accounts, payroll records, W-2 forms, Federal unemployment tax returns (forms 940), and disbursement journals. After conducting the audit, the division combined the accounts of the two corporations into one account in LP-Milford\u2019s name, and recalculated new contribution rates applicable to the consolidated account. On September 27, 2004, the division mailed LP-Milford a \u201cstatement of account\u201d for overdue contributions, overdue workforce training fund contributions, and interest, in the amount of $105,614.03, for the period from the first quarter of 1997 through the first quarter of 2004. LP-Milford refused to pay the adjusted amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On October 13,2004, the division mailed LP-Milford a \u201cnotice of certified assessment\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 15(e), which contained a revised assessment totaling $83,043.05 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 2004, with interest computed through October 13, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon receiving the notice, LP-Milford filed a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>petition for reassessment with the division, claiming that the notice was erroneous. After a hearing, a review examiner issued a decision affirming the total due on the notice. LP-Milford filed an application for further review with the board. After hearings, the board upheld the review examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. A </em>party aggrieved by the board\u2019s final decision may appeal to the District Court pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. Judicial review of the board\u2019s decision is in accordance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. Review is confined to the administrative record. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5). The burden is on the appealing party to demonstrate the invalidity of the board\u2019s decision. See <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474 (1989). We review the board\u2019s decision to determine whether it was unsupported by substantial evidence, arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise based on an error of law. See <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Technology </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. The applicable standard of review is \u201chighly deferential to the agency\u201d and requires the reviewing court to accord \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 695-696 (1998), quoting from <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257-258 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">3. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>LP-Milford argues that the board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. The board concluded that (1) LP-Milford was the sole employer for all employees reported as employed by either LP-Milford or LP-Westboro from 1994 through the first quarter of 2004 and (2) Aronovitz intentionally shifted the payroll to the account of the corporation with the lower contribution rate to avoid paying at a higher contribution rate. We conclude that the board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The board heard the testimony of the auditor from the division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>who examined the financial documents of both LP-Milford and LP-Westboro. The auditor found that all wages paid to employees since 1994 were reported within the financial records as having been paid by LP-Milford. She found that all revenue from the operating stores run by LP-Milford were reported as income in LP-Milford\u2019s financial records. LP-Westboro\u2019s financial records, on the other hand, showed only minimal income for \u201cmanagement fees\u201d and did not show payroll expenses. This evidence supports a finding that LP-Milford was the sole employer of all employees reported under the accounts of either LP-Milford or LP-Westboro from the fourth quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">LP-Milford argues that the board used a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in weighing the evidence because although it discredited Arono-vitz\u2019s testimony based on Aronovitz\u2019s failure to support his testimony with documentary evidence, it credited the testimony of the division\u2019s auditor without requiring the auditor to support her testimony with similar documentation. This argument is without merit. At both hearings, the contents of the financial documents reviewed by the division were uncontroverted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; LP-Milford refuted only the conclusions made by the division based on the contents of the financial documents. There was no need for the board to require the division to produce the documents where the contents were not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">We also find no error in the board\u2019s determination that Arono-vitz\u2019s testimony, without supporting documentation, was insufficient to challenge the auditor\u2019s findings. At a hearing before the board, Aronovitz explained that the financial documents reviewed by the division did not accurately reflect the payrolls of LP-Milford and LP-Westboro because LP-Milford paid LP-Westboro\u2019s employees on LP-Westboro\u2019s behalf as permitted under Federal law. It was LP-Milford\u2019s burden, then, to produce financial documents that accurately reflected the payrolls of each company. See <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employ-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>merit Security, </em>396 Mass. 226, 231 (1985). LP-Milford failed to produce such documents. The board\u2019s reasons for disbelieving Aronovitz\u2019s testimony are adequate. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 470-471 (1981), quoting from Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 607 (1965) (\u201c[Ejvidence of a party having the burden of proof may not be disbelieved without an explicit and objectively adequate reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">LP-Milford also argues that the board\u2019s finding that LP-Westboro had no employees was not supported by substantial evidence because the record includes testimony from Aronovitz that the transfer of the payroll to LP-Westboro included the transfer of supervisors, who hired and controlled LP-Westboro employees. This argument misses the mark. The question before the board was whether there existed an employment relationship as defined in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(/c), and, if so, whether that employment relationship existed with LP-Milford or LP-Westboro. The board did not believe Aronovitz\u2019s testimony that the employees at issue (including supervisors who hired employees) were employed by LP-Westboro, and not LP-Milford. \u201cWe defer to the board on issues of credibility and the weight of evidence.\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Unemployment Assistance, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 516, 520 (2007). Moreover, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>the companies\u2019 financial documents support a finding that all the employees at issue in this matter were employees of LP-Milford. Although Aronovitz, who was president of LP-Westboro, presumably hired employees, he was also the president of LP-Milford, and there is insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that employees who may have been hired by Arono-vitz were hired to work for LP-Westboro and not LP-Milford.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In concluding that Aronovitz intentionally shifted the payroll between LP-Milford and LP-Westboro to avoid paying unemployment insurance contributions at a higher rate, the board found that Aronovitz knew, or could have easily calculated, in advance, the annual contribution rate for each corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At both agency hearings, Aronovitz explained that he annually switched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>payrolls between LP-Milford and LP-Westboro to satisfy \u201c[S]tate wage and hour division\u201d requirements and for other internal business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">At the first agency hearing, Aronovitz stated that he shifted employees between LP-Milford and LP-Westboro to avoid paying overtime under State wage and hour rules that required an employer to pay overtime on a Sunday if that employer had seven or more employees in any one location during the preceding week. Aronovitz did not explain how shifting employees on an annual basis was necessary to avoid paying wages that were determined on a weekly basis. The board found that Aronovitz\u2019s explanations were not credible. We will not disturb the board\u2019s decision to discredit Aronovitz\u2019s explanation. See <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>445 Mass. 291, 301 (2005), quoting from <em>Herridge </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>420 Mass. 154, 161 (1995) (\u201cthe task of assessing the credibility of witnesses is one uniquely within an agency\u2019s discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s findings that (1) LP-Milford was the sole employer for all employees reported as employed by either LP-Milford or LP-Westboro from 1994 through the first quarter of 2004, and (2) Aronovitz intentionally shifted the payroll to the account of the corporation with the lower contribution rate in order to avoid paying contributions at a higher contribution rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">4. <em>Legitimate tax avoidance. </em>LP-Milford argues that even if LP-Milford and LP-Westboro annually switched employees between the two companies to minimize unemployment contributions, the companies\u2019 conduct constituted permissible tax avoidance. We disagree. LP-Milford reported its own payroll under LP-Westboro\u2019s account and paid unemployment contributions based on these false reports. The board found that LP-Milford had violated the Unemployment Insurance Law, which requires employing units to \u201ckeep true and accurate records of all individuals employed,\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 45,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to pay contributions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>based on wages of those employees, see 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.03(3) (1994). Because the division is the agency charged with enforcing the Unemployment Insurance Law, its interpretation of G. L. c. 151A is afforded substantial deference. See <em>Le-Beau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>422 Mass. 533, 537 (1996). \u201cThe party appealing that inteipretation has the burden of proving it invalid.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>LP-Milford has failed to show error. The division properly exercised its authority under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 15(e), to assess against LP-Milford contributions that were due as a result of its unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">5. <em>Effect of 2005 amendment. </em>LP-Milford, which was sanctioned for underpaying its unemployment contributions from 1998 through 2004, argues that the division impermissibly sanctioned it for \u201cpayrolling,\u201d which was not unlawful until St. 2005, c. 138, an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Law, went into effect in 2006. See <em>Paraboschi </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>258 Mass. 531, 533 (1927) (general rule is that statutes are prospective in their operation). It argues that the enactment of the changes embodied in St. 2005, c. 138, known as the State Unemployment Tax Avoidance Act (SUTA), indicate the Legislature\u2019s belief that the prior statutory framework did not prohibit the practice of payrolling. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">SUTA amended c. 151A to add \u00a7 14N, which defines pay-rolling as \u201cthe practice where 1 employer reports its payroll under another employer\u2019s account.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14N(k)(7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Section 6 of SUTA provided that it would \u201ctake effect with respect to calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2006.\u201d Although LP-Milford\u2019s conduct constitutes payrolling under \u00a7 14N, because payrolling involves the reporting of false information to the division, it was prohibited prior to the enactment of \u00a7 14N under the law that required employing units to \u201ckeep true and accurate records of all individuals employed,\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 45, and to pay contributions based on wages of those employees, see 430 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.03(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We are not persuaded by LP-Milford\u2019s argument that the enactment of the changes embodied in SUTA indicate the Legislature\u2019s belief that the prior statutory framework did not prohibit the practice of payrolling. It is not unusual for the Legislature to amend a statute \u201csimply to clarify its meaning.\u201d <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 103 (1983). In this case, SUTA provides the commissioner with instructions for the assessment of employer contributions under various circumstances involving tax avoidance schemes, including pay-rolling, and gives the commissioner the authority to impose certain civil penalties upon employers found to have knowingly engaged, or advised a person to engage, in payrolling. We think that, in enacting \u00a7 14N, the Legislature intended to provide the commissioner with more detailed instructions for the enforcement of the law proscribing payrolling and to increase the deterrent effect of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">6. <em>Witness coaching. </em>LP-Milford argues, for the first time on appeal, that during a hearing held by the board, its chairman engaged in impermissible witness coaching. A party is not entitled to raise arguments on appeal that could have been raised, but were not raised, before the court below. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 128 (2001). Nor is a party entitled to review of an issue not presented before an administrative agency. <em>Ibid. </em>LP-Milford\u2019s argument is waived. Were we to consider the argument, however, we would find it unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">During the hearing, the following exchange \u2014 involving LP-Milford\u2019s counsel, the chairman of the board, and the division\u2019s witness \u2014 occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AHE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The chairman was not in error. LP-Milford\u2019s attorney presented a question to a lay witness that involved a legal conclusion; the attorney asked the lay witness to testify regarding the facts that support a finding of an employer-employee relationship under G. L. c. 151 A. The chairman properly instructed the witness to limit her testimony to only those matters within her knowledge. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.01(10)(d)(2), 1.02(10)(f) (1998). Moreover, assuming error, LP-Milford has failed to show how any such error resulted in prejudice. See <em>Fisch </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>437 Mass. 128, 133 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">7. <em>Notice. </em>Finally, we address LP-Milford\u2019s argument that the division\u2019s notice of hearing, dated March 3, 2005, was defective because the notice did not accurately state the sections of c. 151A that the division sought to apply. An agency conducting an adjudicatory proceeding must give all parties \u201csufficient notice of the issues involved to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(1), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. The division\u2019s notice of hearing listed G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 14A, and 15(e). Section 14 concerns rates and contributions in general, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>relied upon by the division for its authority to determine the correct rates and contributions owed by LP-Milford. Section 14A is clearly inapplicable as it applies to nonprofit organizations. Section 15(e), which was denoted with a capital \u201cE\u201d (\u201c15[E]\u201d) only because the notice was in all capital letters, is the applicable section upon which the division relied for its authority to assess additional contributions from LP-Milford.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Although the notice did not state the grounds upon which the division had sought to exercise its authority under \u00a7 15(e), LP-Milford received a letter from the division, dated June 22, 2004, stating (1) the applicable law, i.e., that \u201c[e]ach entity must file and pay unemployment insurance contributions on behalf of its own employees, which should accurately reflect the employer account for whom employment services are performed;\u201d (2) that a review of the filings of LP-Milford and LP-Westboro to the division indicated \u201ca switching of the majority of employees to the account with the lowest contribution rate;\u201d and (3) the division\u2019s conclusion that there existed a \u201cpattern of misreporting wages under [LP-Westboro\u2019s account].\u201d LP-Milford was aware of the issues that would be discussed at the hearing. In addition, LP-Milford has failed to show any prejudice flowing from the alleged notice defects. See <em>Fisch </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">A six-year statute of limitations prevented the division from making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>assessment of underpaid contributions for periods before 1998.

The crucial fact is that LP-Westboro\u2019s financial records showed only minimum income and did not show payroll expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> The board noted that, toward the end of each year, the division calculates contribution rates for individual employers and notifies them in February of their annual rate and the data used to calculate that rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 45, as amended through St. 1990, c. 177, \u00a7 296, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cEvery employing unit shall keep true and accurate records of all individuals employed by him and such other information as the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>missioner deems necessary for the effective administration of this chapter.
