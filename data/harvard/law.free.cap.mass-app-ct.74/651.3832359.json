(RA), began operating an amusement park on about thirty-four acres of land (the land) in Millbury. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>use continued until 1995, when the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (authority) took the parcel by eminent domain for the construction of a highway interchange. In connection with that taking, the authority hired Calvin Hastings to appraise the land (Hastings appraisal). Apparently on the basis of that appraisal, the authority offered RA a pro tanto payment of $1.95 million.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because RA was a displaced business, the authority was also required, under G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 7, to compensate RA for the cost of relocating its personal property or, in the case of personal property that RA did not choose to relocate, for any actual direct loss on the property (ADLP) not exceeding its estimated cost of relocation. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.09 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbQR\">RA chose to cease operations rather than relocate and, thus, was required to put its personal property up for auction. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.09(20)(a). After the auction, the authority was obligated to make an ADLP payment to RA in an amount to be determined by deducting the auction proceeds (about $63,000) from the preauction fair market value of RA\u2019s personal property and then selecting the lesser of that amount or the \u201cestimated moving expenses which would have been incurred had the personal property been moved.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.09(20)(b)(l). The present controversy arose when RA claimed that certain items, notwithstanding their classification as valueless real property fixtures in the Hastings appraisal, constituted compensable personal property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The controlling statute, G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 863, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defines \u201cpersonal property\u201d as \u201ctangible property situated on the real property vacated or to be vacated by a displaced person and which is considered personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>and is non-compensable as real property.\u201d Section 1 further provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cIn the case of an owner of real property, the determination as to whether an item of property is personal or real <em>shall depend upon how it is identified in the acquisition appraisals </em>and the closing or settlement statement with respect to the real property acquisitions; provided, that no item of property which is compensable under state and local law to the owner of real property in the real property acquisition may be treated as tangible personal property in computing actual direct losses of tangible personal property\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Relying on the italicized language above, the authority took the view that the Hastings appraisal conclusively established, for purposes of G. L. c. 79A relocation compensation, which assets of RA were to be regarded as real property. RA disagreed and sought review by the bureau of relocation in the Department of Housing and Community Development (bureau). See G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. See also G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In a series of decisions, the bureau ruled that the Hastings appraisal was not conclusive on the classification of RA\u2019s assets and found that Hastings had used a legally erroneous standard to distinguish real property from personalty. The bureau therefore reclassified some of the disputed items as personal property and determined, in each instance, the amount of the resultant ADLP payment. Ultimately, the bureau concluded that the authority owed RA an additional $827,953 in ADLP payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The authority timely sought review of the bureau\u2019s decisions in Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. RA filed a separate complaint also seeking review in that court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A judge allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the authority\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and ruled that the bureau erred by not giving conclusive effect to the property classifications made in the Hastings appraisal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so ruling, he emphasized the statutory and regulatory provision, see G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 1; 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.01(7)(k)(2), that \u201cwhether an item of property is personal or real shall depend upon how it is identified in the acquisition appraisals and the closing or settlement statement with respect to the real property acquisitions . . . .\u201d The judge remanded the cases to the bureau for recalculation of the ADLP payment consistent with the property classifications in the Hastings appraisal. From that decision, RA appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>We conclude that the law does not support treatment of the Hastings appraisal as conclusive and unreviewable. Accordingly, we reverse so much of the judgments as required the bureau to recalculate the ADLP payment solely on the basis of the Hastings appraisal and remand the cases to Superior Court for consideration of the question, undecided below, whether the bureau\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The provision emphasized by the judge speaks to \u201cacquisition appraisals\u201d in the plural <em>and </em>specifies other criteria by which to assess the real or personal nature of property, namely, \u201cthe closing or settlement statement.\u201d G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 1, definition of \u201cpersonal property.\u201d Given the Legislature\u2019s recognition that there may be more than one acquisition appraisal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>that a closing or settlement statement is traditionally the product of negotiation by the parties, we can discern no basis for treating any single acquisition appraisal as conclusive and unreviewable. That approach does not comport with the remedial purpose underlying the statutory and regulatory schemes, see 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.01(1) (1993), and may raise concerns of constitutional import.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is inconsistent, as well, with the bureau\u2019s statutory authorization to review \u201celigibility for\u201d and \u201cthe amount of\u201d relocation payments. G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 7. Moreover, \u201c[w]e give substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration [and] enforcement. . . .\u201d <em>Bisazza\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 593, 597 (2008), quoting from <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). Here, the statutory language cannot be said to compel an interpretation contrary to that adopted by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Therefore, insofar as the judgments remanded the cases to the bureau of relocation for a redetermination of the ADLP award solely on the basis of the Hastings appraisal, the judgments are reversed. The cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> In the eminent domain context, a \u201cpro tanto\u201d payment is one that a landowner may accept without prejudice to an action for recovery of the full amount he or she claims is due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> The pertinent regulations were amended in 1998. All references to regulations in this decision refer to those in effect at the time of the taking in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> Hastings assigned the purported fixtures zero value after concluding that the best use of the land (in his view, \u201cbig box\u201d retail development) would require their removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> The decision below is nominally based on the applicable regulation, 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.01(7)(k) (1993). Whether the decision is based on the regulation or the statute makes no difference, however, because the language of the regulation simply mirrors that of G. L. c. 79 A, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\"> The cases were consolidated, and identical judgments were entered in the two cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> The parties do not address whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to review the bureau\u2019s decisions. That matter is not entirely free from doubt, as G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 7, provides that the bureau\u2019s disposition of a claim after review of \u201celigibility for, or the amount of, a [relocation] payment\u201d \u201cshall be final.\u201d In the absence of briefing and argument, we leave unaddressed whether this language was intended to bar judicial review and, if so, whether such a restriction could withstand constitutional scrutiny. See <em>Worcester Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Department of Hous. &amp; Community Dev., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 527 n.4 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> The judge denied RA\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The portion of the judgments (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>that is based on that ruling is not in dispute here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> The authority argues that the present appeal is from an interlocutory order and is, therefore, premature. See <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Ct. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>439 Mass. 729, 730 n.5 (2003) (an \u201corder of remand to an administrative agency is interlocutory and may not be appealed from by the parties to the underlying action\u201d). We disagree. Although the judgments ordered a remand, they were \u201cfinal [judgments] decisive of the issues.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>347 Mass. 24, 29 n.4 (1964). The judgments left nothing for the bureau to do except the ministerial task of recalculating the payments, if any, due RA in light of the property classifications in the Hastings appraisal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> \u201cAcquisition\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 1, as \u201cthe taking of real property by eminent domain, negotiated sale, or other means, by or for any public agency . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\"> We note that another appraisal, also commissioned by the authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>contradicted the Hastings appraisal by classifying some of the disputed items as personal property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> At common law, administrative action was presumptively susceptible to judicial review. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 336 (1965). Notwithstanding, the unavailability of judicial review does not, in all instances, constitute a deprivation of due process. <em>Pilgrim Co-op. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>369 Mass. 963, 964 (1976). Where judicial review is required but the scope of such review is unspecified, courts will look to the standards articulated in the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), for guidance. <em>Assessors of New Braintree </em>v. <em>Pioneer Valley Academy, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 610, 612 n.1 (1969) (Cutter, <em>J.). Sherman v. Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 9-11 (1975) (Kaplan, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
