Neither party has raised any question concerning the viability or propriety of this appeal without appointment of a representative on behalf of the decedent or his estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-12\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2s\">We are asked to interpret the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 39, which addresses payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits in case of the death of the injured employee and, in particular, the insurer\u2019s obligations to furnish legal services in connection with the appointment of a legal representative for the deceased employee. We conclude that an administrative judge in the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) erred in refusing a request by the employee\u2019s sister, Theresa Lopes (Theresa), for an order directing the insurer, Zurich American Insurance, to furnish legal services in proceedings in the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>and Family Court seeking her appointment as administratrix of the employee\u2019s estate, and in dismissing the claim (for failure to prosecute) because the sister (without counsel) had not obtained such an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Background. </em>On or about September 7, 2004, the employee sustained a disabling back injury while employed by Resource Management, Inc. Thereafter, the employee filed a claim for benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. After a conference conducted on June 2, 2005, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, an administrative judge denied the employee\u2019s claim. The employee appealed. The matter was assigned for hearing on March 7, 2006. Before the scheduled hearing, however, the employee died. The matter was accordingly continued in order to allow appointment of Theresa as administratrix of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On October 2, 2006, Theresa moved \u201cto join a claim under [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 39,] and to order the insurer to pay [her] $3,500.00 so that she may retain probate counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative judge denied the motion as \u201cnot ripe.\u201d Sometime in December, 2006, the employee\u2019s counsel informed the judge that Theresa had retained counsel to secure her appointment as administratrix. The matter was rescheduled for hearing on March 6, 2007. Sometime in January, 2007,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Theresa renewed her motion for an advance of funds to pay counsel in pursuit of her appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On March 6, 2007, Theresa did not appear and the employee\u2019s counsel informed the administrative judge that no one had yet been appointed as administrator or administratrix of the employee\u2019s estate. In furtherance of Theresa\u2019s request for an order directing the insurer to provide funds to allow her to retain counsel for probate proceedings, the employee\u2019s counsel argued that \u201c[Theresa] at this time is indigent and requests again an order under Section 39 that the insurer pay for or set her up as the representative of the estate. I feel the motion to dismiss at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>this time should not be granted simply because the estate has not been set up . . . .\u201d However, the judge entered an order dismissing the employee\u2019s claim for lack of prosecution. The department\u2019s reviewing board summarily affirmed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>A claimant\u2019s right to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits is not extinguished by the claimant\u2019s death; instead, it becomes an asset of the estate. See <em>Carlson\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 131 (1969). See also <em>Brek\u2019s Case, </em>335 Mass. 144, 145 (1956); <em>Therrien\u2019s Case, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 795 (1974). See generally Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 16.6, 22.9 (3d ed. 2003) (Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In pertinent part, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 39, as amended through St. 1987, c. 522, \u00a7 6, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cWhen the appointment of a legal representative of a deceased employee or dependent... is required to comply with this chapter, the insurer shall furnish or pay for legal services rendered in connection with the appointment of such legal representative ... or in connection with his duties, and shall pay the necessary disbursements for such appointment, the necessary expenses of such legal representative . . . , and reasonable compensation to him for time necessarily spent in complying therewith. Said payments shall be in addition to sums paid for compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In construing the language of a statute, the words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning in accordance with the approved usage of the language. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 364 (2005). As set forth in \u00a7 39, <em>supra, </em>the insurer\u2019s obligation to assist in the appointment of a legal representative is not limited to reimbursement for the cost of services previously paid by a deceased employee\u2019s appointed representative. Section 39 expresses the obligation disjunctively: \u201cthe insurer shall <em>furnish or </em>pay for legal services rendered in connection with the appointment of such legal representative\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA general principle of statutory interpretation is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u2018every word in a statute should be given meaning,\u2019 . . . and no word is considered superfluous.\u201d <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>451 Mass. 192, 196 (2008), quoting from <em>Matter of a Civil Investigative Demand Addressed to Yankee Milk, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 353, 358 (1977). See <em>Whittaker\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 582, 587 (1946) (discussing the \u201cduty of an insurer, who does not \u2018furnish\u2019 such legal services, to \u2018pay\u2019 for such legal services\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though the record does not include Theresa\u2019s written motions, the transcript of the hearing before the administrative judge reveals that Theresa framed her request in the alternative.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Passing the question whether the administrative judge properly declined Theresa\u2019s request for an advance of $3,500 toward anticipated, but not yet incurred, legal fees incident to her appointment as administratrix of the employee\u2019s estate, it was error to refuse her request to require the insurer to furnish her with legal services to that end.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">There appears to be no dispute that appointment of a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>representative for the deceased employee was \u201crequired to comply with [G. L. c. 152]\u201d in the present case, which involved \u201ca claim for compensation due the employee during his lifetime as an asset of the estate.\u201d Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall \u00a7 22.9, at 241. To the extent that cases have suggested that the insurer\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 39 to furnish or pay for services for the appointment of a representative may not attach in circumstances where the need for a legal representative arises independently of the claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, see <em>Mellon\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 399, 401-402 (1918), and <em>Liberman\u2019s Case, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 598, 600, <em>S.C., </em>393 Mass. 1004 (1984), there is nothing to suggest that any such independent need existed in the present case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The decision of the reviewing board is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> The description of the motion (as well as its disposition) is taken from the administrative judge\u2019s subsequent decision dismissing the claim for lack of prosecution. The judge\u2019s order also refers, without further description, to a motion by the \u201cemployee\u201d (then deceased) for an order \u201cunder Section 39,\u201d which the judge denied on January 9, 2007. Neither motion is in the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> The docket is unclear regarding the date. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> Section 39 does not specify how the insurer\u2019s obligation to \u201cfurnish\u201d such services may be discharged. We assume that the insurer would fulfil its obligation by engaging an attorney on behalf of the putative representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> The insurer does not contend that its obligation to facilitate the appointment of a legal representative for an employee who dies before resolution of his claim is contingent on a meritorious claim for benefits. The statute contains no suggestion that the obligation is contingent in any such manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> Since the written motions are not in the record, we do not know whether they requested only payment of an advance toward legal fees, or included a request in the alternative that the insurer furnish the necessary services. If the written motions did not include a request that the insurer furnish the services as an alternative to payment of a retainer, the first such request would have occurred at the March 6, 2007, hearing. However, even if that were the case, it was error for the administrative judge to deny the request and instead order the claim dismissed for want of prosecution, without previous warning that such a drastic sanction was in store. Of course, it would be preferable if, in response to a written request seeking only an advance payment of fees, an administrative judge would suggest reframing the request into one for the services themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to reach the question whether it would have been error for the administrative judge to order the payment of such fees in advance, and we decline to do so on the present record. We note, however, that there is nothing in the record to substantiate that the amount requested was an appropriate or reasonable amount for the services required to effectuate the appointment of a legal representative for the deceased employee. Moreover, though Theresa grounded her request on her claim that indigency prevented her from seeking such appointment without an advance by the insurer of the requested funds, there is nothing in the record to substantiate her claim of indigency, much less that she could not achieve the desired appointment without the requested funds. We note that she enjoyed the assistance of counsel before the administrative judge, and in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> The version of the statute applicable to <em>Mellon\u2019s Case </em>imposed the obligation to furnish or pay for legal services only where the appointment of a legal representative was \u201cnot otherwise necessary.\u201d <em>Mellon\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. at 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
