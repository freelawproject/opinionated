Able to accommodate thirty-two distinct voice channels on each of its 1,344 virtual circuits, a single OMNI chip could perform the work of ten chips made with prior technology. The product was revolutionary for its time and enabled substantial reductions in power use and system costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In 2002, the Department of Revenue (department) audited Onex\u2019s purchases of personal property. The audit period began on August 1, 1999, and extended through September 21, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over the course of the audit period, Onex had purchased $2,723,510 of personal property for research and development (R&amp;D) purposes, paying neither sales nor use tax. In December, 2002, the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) advised Onex that its R&amp;D purchases had been taxable and that the department intended to assess use taxes of $136,175 plus interest and penalties. Onex requested an abatement, contending that the items purchased were \u201cmaterials, machinery and replacement parts . . . used directly and exclusively in R&amp;D\u201d and were, as such, exempted from the use tax by G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6(r) and <em>(s), </em>as incorporated by G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 7(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The request was denied on the grounds that Onex had qualified as neither a manufacturing nor a research and development corporation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 38C or 42B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the circumstances, at least one such qualification was necessary for Onex\u2019s R&amp;D purchases to come within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the scope of the exemptions set forth in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6(r) and (S).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Onex challenged the denial of its requested abatement before the Appellate Tax Board (board). The board ruled that Onex had been a manufacturing corporation within the meaning of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42B, throughout the audit period, and that assessment of the use tax had been improper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we agree that Onex qualified as a \u00a7 42B manufacturing corporation throughout the audit period, we affirm the board\u2019s order directing a use tax abatement of $136,175 and cancellation of all penalties and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\"><em>\u201cFinished product\u201d limitation. </em>The commissioner maintains that Onex could not have been a manufacturing corporation during the audit period essentially because, at the conclusion of that period, Onex had yet to achieve a finished product.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That analysis may have superficial appeal, but it is not compelled by the statute. Indeed, the statutory text does little, if anything, to clarify what exactly the Legislature intended to qualify within the ambit of manufacturing. The relevant provision, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 42B, states only that a \u201cmanufacturing corporation\u201d is one \u201cengaged in manufacturing.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. 42, 44 (1996).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The pertinent decisional law, moreover, ascribes a far broader meaning to manufacturing than the minimalist interpretation urged by the commissioner. Massachusetts cases instruct that \u201c[t]he words \u2018engaged in manufacturing\u2019 are not to be given a narrow or restricted meaning.\u201d <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>323 Mass. 730, 748-749 (1949). Rather, the phrase is to be fairly construed and reasonably applied to effectuate legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 741. We have long inferred, without contradiction from the Legislature, that the tax exemption at issue was intended \u201c[to] induc[e] new industries to locate [in the Commonwealth] and to foster the expansion and development of [its existing] industries . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Ibid. Set Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">That purpose would be substantially frustrated were we to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 38C and 42B to mean that no corporation may be designated a manufacturing corporation until it has achieved its intended finished product. In particular, we note that such a policy would place new or specialized corporations in a highly disadvantageous tax position. Consider the R&amp;D purchases of an established corporation that, in addition to its R&amp;D efforts, engages in the assembly and sale of an entirely unrelated product. Provided these latter, clearly manufacturing activities are substantial, the corporation will be entitled to classification as a manufacturing corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tion, and its R&amp;D purchases, despite their irrelevance to the corporation\u2019s existing finished product, will be exempt from sales and use taxation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Now consider identical R&amp;D purchases, made in furtherance of R&amp;D efforts identical to those underway at the established corporation, but this time by a new corporation that has no preexisting finished product. Under the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the new corporation would be barred from qualifying as a manufacturing corporation and its R&amp;D purchases would be subject to taxation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That result is arbitrary and inimical to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><em>Classification of Onex\u2019s activities. </em>Having dispensed with the commissioner\u2019s contemplated finished product limitation, we must now consider at what times, if any, Onex was engaged in substantial manufacturing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We first note, but do not rely on, an amendment to \u00a7\u00a7 38C and 42B that took effect in 2006, several years after the present assessment against Onex. \u201c[T]he development and sale of standardized computer software,\u201d the text added by the amendment reads, \u201cshall be considered a manufacturing activity, without regard to the manner of delivery of the software to the customer.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 38C, 42B, as amended through St. 2005, c. 163, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 29, 59. Enactment of this language, which brings the creation of intangible software products within the statutory definition of manufacturing, cannot be reconciled with a legislative conception of manufacturing that is confined to the assembly line. Even before the aforementioned amendment to \u00a7\u00a7 38C and 42B, however, Onex\u2019s activities would properly have been classified as manufacturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The board found, on substantial evidence, that Onex was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>founded for the purpose of designing and manufacturing a microchip device to enhance data transmission over communications networks. Work on that device, ultimately branded as the OMNI chip, began from a blank sheet of paper. Onex engineers created, refined, integrated, and embedded OMNI\u2019s numerous software and hardware components. From a physical standpoint, the board\u2019s findings establish that \u201c[t]iny internal modules had to be interwoven, integrated, and laid out to enable the intended functionality.\u201d To that end, Onex engineers drafted intricate electronically-stored \u201cblueprints\u201d to direct, with absolute precision, the physical construction of the OMNI chip from raw silicon and the embedding of the software into the hardware.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Testimony credited by the board established that the development of these blueprints \u201cwas an essential step in manufacturing the OMNI chip.\u201d In sum, the board properly found, on the basis of the evidence before it, that \u201cOnex\u2019s activities during the audit period centered on taking the OMNI chip from abstract concept to production.\u201d It then ruled, as matter of law, that the entirety of this process constituted manufacturing. We agree. \u201c[PJrocesses which do not in themselves produce a finished product are nonetheless \u2018manufacturing\u2019 if they comprise an \u2018essential and integral part of a total manufacturing process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. at 47, quoting from <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>413 Mass. 576, 580 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. at 50, the court held that the creation of electronic proofs of the pages of a textbook constituted manufacturing. Preparation of the proofs began with editors, generally employees of Houghton Mifflin, engaging in \u201cextensive research and development activities regarding a proposed book\u201d to assess marketability and determine potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>content and formatting. <em>Id. </em>at 43. Composition and editing of a manuscript followed, in addition to the creation or gathering of illustrative charts, graphs, drawings, and photographs. <em>Id. </em>at 43-44. The exact placement of these various items was specified in the electronic proofs ultimately sent to outside vendors for printing and binding. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 50-51. As such, the court observed that \u201c[Houghton Mifflin] transforms ideas, art, information, and photographs, by application of human knowledge, intelligence, and skill, into computer disks, ready for use by independent printers, containing an immense amount of information in a highly organized form\u201d and concluded that these activities sufficed to warrant designation as a manufacturing corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 50-51. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized that the electronic proofs were not \u201cvalued solely for their artistic and intellectual content\u201d but were, rather, \u201cvaluable principally because they [were] physically useful in making the finished product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. See <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Fashion Affiliates, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 543, 545-546 (1982). The court, we note, was not concerned with whether the finished product had yet materialized. Its inquiry instead focused on the manufacturing process that was underway \u2014 one which, the context makes clear, was reasonably calculated to culminate in a finished product. The court agreed with the board that Houghton Mifflin\u2019s operations \u201cproduce a significant degree of change and refinement to the materials involved and ... are essential and integral steps in the manufacture of conventional books.\u201d <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. at 49. The court specifically acknowledged that some of the \u201cmaterials\u201d involved were intangible. <em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The board\u2019s ruling here drew many sound comparisons between Onex\u2019s activities during the audit period and the manufacturing process delineated in <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., supra. </em>Onex\u2019s creation of blueprints, the purpose of which was to direct with absolute specificity the manner in which the OMNI chip was to be assembled, does not admit of meaningful differentiation from Houghton Mifflin\u2019s creation of electronic proofs of textbook pages. In each instance, a vast amount of information was marshaled in a manner sufficient to permit, and for the express purpose of permitting, assembly of a physical object intended to unleash the benefit of the information so organized. The board properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>found that Onex\u2019s activities throughout the audit period were directed toward devising and refining the blueprints that specified how to assemble the OMNI chip. As such, all of Onex\u2019s activities during that period were essential and integral to the total manufacturing process, a circumstance entitling Onex to classification as a manufacturing corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-14\"> At all relevant times, Onex was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> The OMNI chip is also referred to in the record as a \u201cchip-set,\u201d apparently because it is actually made up of two microchips, one functioning as a \u201cswitch\u201d and the other as a \u201cnetwork processor.\u201d For convenience we refer to the product simply as the OMNI chip.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> The end of the audit period coincided with the acquisition of Onex by TranSwitch Corporation. Like the parties, we refer to both the pre- and post-merger entities as \u201cOnex\u201d in order to minimize confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> With exceptions not here relevant, G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 7(6), exempts from the use tax any item that is exempted from the sales tax imposed by G. L. c. 64H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 6(r) and (s), as amended through St. 1977, c. 620, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, contain tax exemptions for, inter alia, materials, machinery, and replacement parts \u201cused directly and exclusively in . . . research and development by a manufacturing corporation or a research and development corporation within the meaning of [G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 38C or 42B].\u201d The aforementioned \u00a7\u00a7 38C and 42B are applicable to domestic and foreign corporations, respectively. As a Delaware corporation, Onex is governed by \u00a7 42B. See <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>369 Mass. 178, 180 n.1 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> The board reserved decision as to whether Onex had qualified as a \u00a7 42B research and development corporation throughout the audit period. The substance of Onex\u2019s cross-appeal is that the board\u2019s findings compel a ruling that Onex was, at all relevant times, a \u00a7 42B research and development corporation. The commissioner maintains that further findings would be necessary to resolve that matter. We acknowledge Onex\u2019s preservation of the issue, but otherwise leave it unaddressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> Onex disputes the commissioner\u2019s assertion that Onex achieved no tangible, finished product during the audit period. Specifically, Onex points to the production of at least fifty OMNI chips in early 2001, followed by the production of certain additional OMNI chips in mid-2001, the latter incorporating a design modification. The commissioner characterizes all the OMNI chips produced in 2001 as mere prototypes (see note 8, <em>infra). </em>Because we hold that designation as a \u00a7 42B manufacturing corporation does not require a finished product ex ante, we do not address whether some or all of the OMNI chips produced in 2001 ought to have been considered finished products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> Department regulations contained at 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 58.2.1(6)(b) (1999), reproduced in part below, attempt to further illuminate the term \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d The commissioner emphasizes the guideline in subparagraph 5 to support her position, while Onex points to subparagraph 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">\u201c(b) Manufacturing. Manufacturing is the process of substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>transforming raw or finished materials by hand or machinery, and through human skill and knowledge, into a product possessing a new name, nature and adapted to a new use. In determining whether a process constitutes manufacturing, the Commissioner will examine the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the following principles will serve as guidelines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201c5. Manufacturing ordinarily involves the production of products in standardized sizes and qualities and in multiple quantities. Market research, research and development, and design and creation of a prototype, although prerequisites to manufacturing, are not manufacturing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201c7. A process which does not produce a finished product, but constitutes an essential and integral part of a total manufacturing process, may constitute manufacturing. A process that is a practical and necessary step in the production of a finished product for sale is generally an essential and integral part of a total manufacturing process.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> Classification as a manufacturing corporation does not require that manufacturing operations constitute the principal business of the corporation so classified. Rather, any such operations that are substantial, in relative or absolute terms, will suffice. See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>321 Mass. 90, 96-97 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> While this outcome could be avoided if the new corporation were able to qualify as a \u00a7 38C or \u00a7 42B research and development corporation, the law is unclear both as to (1) whether a corporation that has no receipts may so qualify, and (2) what constitutes \u201creceipts\u201d in this context. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, manufacturing corporations are entitled to certain local tax exemptions not available to research and development corporations. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 38C, 42B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\"> Because Onex lacked the sophisticated equipment necessary to assemble the OMNI chip internally, it outsourced that task to another corporation from July, 2000, through December, 2005. That corporation was required to implement Onex\u2019s blueprints with exactitude, and the contract provided that all completed chips were the property of Onex. This arrangement does not impair Onex\u2019s status as a manufacturing corporation. See <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. at 44, 48-51 (preparation of the electronic proofs for a textbook held to constitute manufacturing, notwithstanding that all printing and binding tasks were outsourced).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
