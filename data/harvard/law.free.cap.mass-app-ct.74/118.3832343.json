When the zoning board of appeals of Longmeadow (board) denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for a variance to allow the wall, he appealed to Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Following a jury-waived trial, the judge annulled the board\u2019s decision. The parties filed cross-appeals. The defendants argue that it was error to conclude that the board\u2019s denial of the variance was unreasonable. The plaintiff argues that the variance should have been granted and that, even if he is not entitled to a variance, one was not required because under the applicable by-law the wall could be constructed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We conclude that a variance was unnecessary and the wall could be constructed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><em>Background facts and proceedings. </em>We summarize the essential and undisputed facts. The plaintiff\u2019s two-family residence sits on a six-sided comer lot at Longmeadow Street and Fern-leaf Avenue in Longmeadow. The front and side yards of the lot are maintained as lawn space; the angled strip of back yard is heavily wooded. In 2004, the plaintiff constructed an approximately two-foot high, L-shaped stone wall on his front and side yards, adjacent to Longmeadow Street and Femleaf Avenue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bordering streets are heavily trafficked and the plaintiff constructed the wall to provide an enclosed play area for his tenant\u2019s children. As the parties agreed and the judge found, \u201c[t]he wall, at its closest points, is approximately seventy feet from Long-meadow Street and forty feet from Fernleaf Avenue. The wall does not interfere with drivers\u2019 visibility from either street.\u201d Construction was nearly complete when the town\u2019s building commissioner notified the plaintiff that the fence was in violation of art. IV, \u00a7 K, of the by-law because it was within the primary setback of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">After receiving the notice, the plaintiff briefly ceased construction but thereafter completed constmction of the wall and then applied for a variance to allow it to remain in place. The board denied the application, and the plaintiff appealed to Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7. Prior to commencement of the trial, his counsel requested a ruling that \u201c[t]he evidence supports a finding that the Zoning Bylaw can reasonably be interpreted to allow the stone wall as constructed without a variance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In her memorandum of decision, the judge determined that the board\u2019s denial of the variance was unreasonable. She further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>determined that the stone wall was \u201cwithin the primary setback line, in violation of the Town\u2019s By-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Although we discern no error in the board\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the conditions needed to obtain a variance under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, that decision was premised on a faulty determination that a variance was required under the by-law. See <em>APT Asset Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Melrose, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 133,138 (2000) (construction of provisions of zoning ordinance was question of law to be determined by court where board\u2019s denial of special permit \u201cwas expressly based upon the sole reason that the principal use was prohibited under the ordinance, as construed by the board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The issue of interpretation of the by-law was raised by the plaintiff in Superior Court and argued by both sides in that court and in this appeal. We \u201cexpress our views upon the issue that has been argued,\u201d <em>Simeone Stone Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bourne, </em>345 Mass. 188, 192 (1962), \u201c[b]ecause it may avoid further court proceedings and expense in a matter of community interest.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Paul Livoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Marlborough, </em>347 Mass. 330, 336 (1964); <em>Vassalotti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sudbury, </em>348 Mass. 658, 662 (1965); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>351 Mass. 410, 415 (1966); <em>Roberts-Haverhill Assoc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Haverhill, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 715, 717 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Although the board\u2019s interpretation is entitled to some measure of deference, the \u201cinterpretation is not dispositive.\u201d <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Boxford, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 649 (2004). \u201c[T]he court determines the content and meaning of statutes and by-laws and then decides whether the board has chosen from those sources the proper criteria and standards to use in deciding to grant or to deny the variance or special permit application.\u201d <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 73 (2003). \u201cA zoning by-law must be read in its complete context and be given a sensible meaning within that context. The intent of the by-law is to be ascertained from all its <em>terms and parts as </em>well as <em>the </em>subject matter to which it relates.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 478 (1986) (citations omitted). \u201cNor do we interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>a [by-law] so as to render it or any portion of it meaningless.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985). See <em>Korkuch </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Eastham, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 307 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that he is entitled to construct the fence as matter of right under the by-law, interpreted in light of the foregoing rules of construction. The by-law, at art. IV, \u00a7 K, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u201cFences</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cNo fence shall be erected in any zone except a fence which shall be within one of the classes and of a height as set forth herein, subject to the provisions of Article VI, Section H and which shall not be constructed <em>forward of the primary setback\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Under the by-law, the terms \u201cprimary setback\u201d and \u201cprimary setback line\u201d are distinct concepts. Article II defines \u201cprimary setback line\u201d as \u201c[t]he line running parallel or concentric to the street line which includes that part of the building nearest to such street line. In the case of a comer lot the primary setback requirement shall be observed from all bordering streets.\u201d A \u201cprimary setback\u201d is defined in art. VI, \u00a7 B (entitled \u201cFront Yards and Stmcture Set-Backs\u201d), at par. T.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u201c1. Primary Set-Back</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201cla. In the Residence A-2, the Residence A-l, and Agricultural Zones, no stmcture, and no addition thereto, extension or part thereof,. . . shall be erected, constmcted, or placed nearer than 40 feet to the line of the street or way upon which the lot fronts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Thus, a stmcture \u2014 which, under the by-law, also includes a fence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 may not be built \u201cnearer than 40 feet to the line of the street or way upon which the lot fronts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This no-build area is elsewhere called a \u201cprimary set back dimension.\u201d Art. VI, \u00a7 B, par. lc.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The defendants\u2019 interpretation of the by-law as precluding construction of a fence forward of the primary setback <em>line </em>\u2014 that is to say, any fence in front of the plaintiffs house \u2014 is inconsistent with the plain language of the by-law. It requires the addition of a word to the text (\u201cline\u201d) that changes the plain meaning of the existing language, which prohibits the construction of a fence \u201cforward of the primary setback,\u201d a dimension that lies between the street and forty feet \u201cto the line of the street.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To assist the reader, we have included in the Appendix to this opinion a sketch illustrating the manner in which setback lines might define setbacks or setback areas on a hypothetical comer lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The by-law is not a model of clarity. Numerous provisions permit the construction of fences pursuant to a deleted provision, art. IV, \u00a7 B, par. 1.2h.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Interpreting art. IV, \u00a7 K, as do the defendants could result in unintended restrictions. The primary setback dimension applies to \u201cany zone.\u201d In an agricultural zone, raising and keeping \u201chorses, cows, and sheep\u201d is permitted by art. IV, \u00a7 C. To the extent farm animals must be fenced, the defendants\u2019 interpretation would require that the animals be restricted to an area behind the building closest to the street, regardless how far from the main street that building is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We have endeavored to achieve a sensible result, with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>parts and words in the by-law made operative to the extent that task was possible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because the plaintiff\u2019s wall is not nearer than forty feet to the line of either street upon which his lot fronts, he is entitled to build his wall as of right and a variance is not necessary. The judgment is vacated, and a new judgment shall enter which declares that the plaintiff was not required to obtain a variance to construct the stone wall. See <em>Vassalotti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sudbury, </em>348 Mass. at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The plaintiff does not dispute the defendants\u2019 position that the low stone wall is a fence for purposes of the by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> The plaintiff introduced evidence, through testimony of the town building commissioner, regarding interpretation of the by-law. During trial and in her closing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued that the plaintiff had met the statutory requirements for a variance and that, properly interpreted, the by-law permitted the plaintiff\u2019s fence to be built as matter of right. Counsel for the defendants argued in closing that the by-law regarding what constitutes a fence and where a fence may be located were applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s stone wall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\"> Article VI, \u00a7 H, sets out requirements regarding visual clearances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-13\"> As defined in art. II, par. 44, \u201cA structure shall be anything composed of any material or combination of materials which is erected, constructed, or placed upon the property for apparent permanent or seasonal use, and which occupies more than four square feet in projected base area, or two feet in maximum horizontal dimension, and shall include a fence as hereinafter defined.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> Consistent with this interpretation is the treatment of setback lines, as compared to setback areas or dimensions, elsewhere in the by-laws. For example, in the definitions section of the by-laws a \u201csecondary setback line\u201d is \u201ca line that \u201crun[s] parallel or concentric with the street line which includes that part of the building nearest to the rear property line.\u201d Art. II, par. 38. A \u201csecondary setback\u201d is the area on the lot where no structure may be built that is \u201cnearer to the line of the street or way upon which the lot fronts than a line constructed parallel or concentric with the aforesaid street line and through the rearmost extremity of the main residence\u201d or extension. Art. VI, \u00a7 B, par. 2(2a). Similarly, a \u201cside-yard\u201d is defined as \u201ca required open unoccupied space within the lot between a side lot line which is not a street line and the parts of a building which are nearest to such side lot line. Such a side yard must extend through from the set-back lines to the rear yard.\u201d Art. II, par. 40. Article VI, \u00a7 C, par. l(la), further defines side yards as \u201cthe area between the primary and secondary set-back lines . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b156-13\"> See, e.g., art. VI, \u00a7 B, par. 2(2a) (prohibiting construction of any structure forward of the secondary setback \u201cexcept the main dwelling . . . and a fence . . .\u201d); art. VI, \u00a7 C, par. l(la) (prohibiting construction of any structure \u201c[w]ithin the area between the primary and secondary set-back lines . . . except a fence . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> A town is not precluded from enacting by-laws prohibiting construction of fences forward of the primary setback line. We hold only that the language used in the current version of the by-law does not impose such a rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
