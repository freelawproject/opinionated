The Town is host to a number of open-air parking lots owned by the Authority which provide parking for the ferry passengers. In 2004, the Town adopted what it characterizes as a health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>safety measure, Chapter 213, Article V, \u00a7\u00a7 13-22 of the Code of Falmouth (Article V), that establishes licensing requirements and fees for \u201centities engaged in operating open air parking lots.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Town asserts that Article V is authorized by virtue of G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 56, as amended through St. 1991, \u00a7 202, quoted below,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which it accepted, also in 2004. Upon the Town\u2019s adoption of Article V, the Authority brought an action in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to preclude its application to the Authority\u2019s parking lots. Judgment entered for the Authority; the Town and its fire chief (collectively, the Town) now appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The questions presented here are essentially two-fold: (i) whether the Authority is a \u201cperson\u201d in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of operating parking lots within the meaning of G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 56; and (ii) if so, whether the Authority\u2019s Enabling Act, chapter 701 of the Acts of 1960, as amended, prohibits the Town from attempting to \u201cregulate\u201d the Authority by imposing a license fee on the Authority\u2019s parking lots. Because we hold that the Authority is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 56, we do not reach the remaining question.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The Authority and its statutory predecessor<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have been in existence since 1948. The Authority was created as a \u201cbody corporate\u201d which is \u201cdeemed to be a public instrumentality for the purposes of this act.\u201d Enabling Act at \u00a7 3. Its purpose is \u201cto provide adequate transportation of persons and necessaries of life for the islands of Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\u201d Enabling Act at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00a7 1. The court observed in <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>429 Mass. 329, 332-333 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cTo this end, the Legislature has expressly granted the Authority the power to (1) \u2018acquire, maintain, repair and operate a boat line\u2019; (2) \u2018acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property ... for its corporate purposes\u2019; (3) \u2018make and enter into all contracts and agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties and the execution of its powers under this act\u2019; and (4) \u2018do all acts and things necessary or convenient to cany out the powers expressly granted in this act.\u2019 The legislation provides that its provisions are to be liberally construed, and there is nothing therein which even remotely suggests that. . . any . . . municipality ... is to have a veto power over the Authority\u2019s operation and maintenance of the boat line and related aspects of its operations.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Legislature also expressly provided that \u201cthe operation and maintenance of the steamship line by the Authority will constitute the performance of essential government functions.\u201d Enabling Act at \u00a7 6. The Authority\u2019s parking operations are ancillary to those essential functions. \u201c[W]e have no difficulty in concluding that the Authority\u2019s choice to provide off-site parking is directly and inextricably linked to its mission.\u201d <em>Plante, supra </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">With this background in mind, we turn to an analysis of G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 56, pursuant to which the Town adopted the licensing and fee scheme set out in Article V. Section 56 applies only to a \u201cperson\u201d who engages in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of conducting or maintaining an open-air parking space in a town. When the Legislature enacts a statute such as \u00a7 56 that applies only to \u201cpersons,\u201d it does not intend the statute to apply to the Commonwealth or any of its governmental entities, including government authorities. General Laws c. 4, 7, Twenty-third, provides that the words \u201c[p]erson\u201d or \u201cwhoever,\u201d as they are used throughout the General Laws, \u201cshall include corporations, societies, associations and partnerships.\u201d As has been many times observed, this definition does not encompass \u201cgovernmental agencies, municipalities, or municipal corporations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voight, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 771 (1990). See <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>329 Mass. 243, 250 (1952) (steamship authority not \u201cperson\u201d subject to regulation by Department of Public Utilities); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>368 Mass. 333, 338-339 (1975). See also <em>Teasdale </em>v. <em>Newell &amp; Snowling Constr. Co., </em>192 Mass. 440,442-443 (1906); <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>North Attleborough, </em>212 Mass. 243, 245-246 (1912); <em>Bretton </em>v. <em>State Lottery Commn., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 738 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The Authority\u2019s performance of \u201cessential governmental functions\u201d as a \u201cpublic instrumentality\u201d of the Commonwealth puts the Authority in the same category as the Commonwealth or a municipality, which likewise are not \u201cpersons\u201d under c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third. Enabling Act at \u00a7\u00a7 6, 3. See <em>New Bedford, supra. </em>Insofar as the Authority is not among those entities specified in c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third, namely, \u201ccorporations, societies, associations and partnerships,\u201d it is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The Town does not appear to argue that the Authority was originally a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 56, but instead suggests that the Authority became a \u201cperson\u201d when the Legislature inserted the last sentence of \u00a7 56 in 1965 (with later revisions in 1973), more than thirty years after the original enactment in 1930. The last sentence exempted the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and certain other regional transit authorities, as well as their lessees and licensees, from the operation of \u00a7 56. St. 1965, c. 444. St. 1973, c. 1141, \u00a7 6. The Town\u2019s contention is that the Legislature thereby inferentially amended the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 56 to include all Commonwealth agencies, departments and authorities not expressly excluded. Otherwise put, the Town maintains that if the Legislature had not viewed the term \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 56 as applying to agencies such as the Authority, there would have been little need to exempt specifically the MBTA and the regional transportation agencies (and their lessees and licensees) from the operation of \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">There are two ways of reading the pertinent language of \u00a7 56. The first is to view the last sentence as having been added to clarify that, to whatever extent the MBTA and regional transit authorities and their lessees and licensees might be viewed as a \u201cperson,\u201d the provisions of \u00a7 56 are not to apply to any open-air parking space that they maintain or conduct. The second is as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Town suggests, i.e., that the last sentence encompasses within the term \u201cperson\u201d all Commonwealth departments, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities, except for the MBTA and regional transit authorities (and their lessees and licensees). The first is the more sensible reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">As noted earlier, both by virtue of the statutory definition of \u201cperson\u201d used throughout the General Laws and by virtue of the case law, the term \u201cperson\u201d has long been understood not to include governmental agencies, municipalities or municipal corporations. It would be a significant departure from this longstanding practice for the Legislature, without expressly altering other language in \u00a7 56 that would make its intent quite plain, to include in the term \u201cperson\u201d all governmental entities other than those expressly excluded. We will not presume that such a radical expansion of the statute was intended by negative implication. See <em>Greater Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>438 Mass. 197, 202 (2002), quoting from <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954) (\u201cStatutes are to be construed in the light of the preexisting common and statutory law .... It is not to be lightly supposed that radical changes in the law were intended where not plainly expressed\u201d). The insertion of the last sentence is more sensibly understood as no more than the Legislature\u2019s effort to address specific situations warranting attention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Because the Authority is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 56, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Town may not apply Article V to the Authority\u2019s open-air parking lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> Article V defines \u201centity\u201d in a manner that would encompass the Authority. The Town\u2019s fire chief would administer the licensing process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> As relevant here, \u00a7 56 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cIn any city or town which accepts the provisions of this section, no person shall engage in the business of conducting or maintaining an open-air parking space without a license therefor granted ... by the local licensing authority, approved in all cases by the head of the fire department. . . . The provisions of this section shall not apply to any open-air parking space established under paragraph (g) of section three of chapter one hundred and sixty-one A or under paragraph (g) of section six of chapter one hundred and sixty-one B and maintained or conducted by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority or by an authority created under said chapter one hundred and sixty-one B or a lessee or licensee thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> The New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> There are substantial differences between the history and enabling acts of the Authority, on the one hand, and of the MBTA and regional transit authorities on the other, which may have prompted the Legislature\u2019s insertion of the last sentence in \u00a7 56. The Enabling Act for the Authority (as well as the enabling acts, for example, of the Massachusetts Port Authority and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, see St. 1952, c. 54, \u00a7 21; St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 29) contains an \u201cinconsistent laws\u201d provision, Enabling Act at \u00a7 19, ensuring that inconsistent statutes are inapplicable when they interfere with the Authority\u2019s ability to perform its essential governmental functions. Neither the MBTA\u2019s nor the regional transit authorities\u2019 enabling acts contain similar \u201cinconsistent laws\u201d provisions. The insertion of the last sentence accordingly provides a clarification for those parking lots that are operated by the MBTA, the regional transit authorities, and their licensees and lessees that the parking lots operated by the Authority do not need. Indeed, unlike the Authority, the MBTA and regional transit authorities operate indirectly through other entities such as licensees and lessees, which might well be regarded as \u201cperson[s] . . . engaged in the business\u201d of operating parking lots under \u00a7 56.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
