A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>decade later, their older daughter enrolled at a private university costing approximately $34,000 per year. The parties never reached an agreement on payment, and when Shawn refused to pay fifty percent of the cost, Paula initiated contempt proceedings against him. A Probate and Family Court judge eventually found that Paula and the child had selected a school \u201cfinancially out of reach\u201d for Shawn and ordered him to pay approximately one-quarter of the expenses of the private college. On appeal, Paula claims the judge erred by not requiring Shawn to pay one-half of the expenses actually incurred. Shawn argues that the judge properly limited his obligation to the expenses he would have paid had the child attended a State university. As we conclude that further proceedings regarding the reasonableness of the college expenses in these circumstances are required, we reverse and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The parties have two daughters who reside with Paula in Massachusetts. Shawn, now remarried, lives in Arizona with his wife, their son, and his wife\u2019s son from a previous relationship. The parties were divorced in Massachusetts in 1996. The judgment of divorce nisi incorporated a separation agreement. Exhibit \u201cA\u201d of the agreement provides that the parents are to share legal custody and that Paula has physical custody and the normal daily care of the children. It also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cBoth parents shall participate fully in providing access to the child and her activities, and input into educational, medical, behavioral and other significant decisions affecting the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Exhibit \u201cB\u201d of the agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cThe Husband and Wife shall each contribute 50% toward each child\u2019s college education expenses, including, but not limited to, room, board, tuition, books, fees and other normal educational expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">These provisions, along with other child-related terms, merged into the judgment. (We hereafter refer to these provisions as the college expense provisions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In 2006, the parties\u2019 elder daughter, Casey, enrolled at Roger Williams University (Roger Williams). The cost of her first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>year, after grants, was $34,000. Around that time, Shawn\u2019s annual income was $99,996, and his second wife\u2019s annual income was $12,376. Paula\u2019s annual income was approximately $93,305, and she received $14,300 per year from Shawn in child support. Shawn also paid $160 per week ($8,320 per year) for his wife\u2019s son to attend Arizona State University (Arizona State). Shawn likes Roger Williams but during the college search process had requested Casey apply in Arizona for more affordable costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In June, 2006, Paula initiated a contempt proceeding against Shawn for failing to pay his portion of Casey\u2019s college expenses. Following a hearing on September 15, 2006, at which Shawn did not appear, a Probate and Family Court judge found him in contempt and ordered him to pay Paula $17,000. The following month Shawn filed several motions, including a motion to vacate the September, 2006, order and a motion to hold Paula in contempt. In his motions, Shawn argued that he was not consulted in the college selection process and was denied access to loans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">A hearing on Shawn\u2019s motions was held on November 3, 2006. At the hearing, a Probate and Family Court probation officer who investigated the college selection process testified that \u201cI don\u2019t think father had the input that he would have liked to have had. I don\u2019t think he had as much information as he would have liked to have had.\u201d He also reported that Shawn \u201cdid have sufficient input that he could have come into court to seek action.\u201d Shawn insisted in his defense that he suggested that Casey apply to Arizona State as a resident or to a California State university, but that Paula threatened not to support her or contribute to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>college expenses if she considered either of those schools. He further explained that this upset Casey so much that he stopped suggesting alternate schools. The judge, however, made no findings regarding this testimony and made few findings regarding other matters addressed in the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">On the same day as the hearing, the judge vacated her September order holding Shawn in contempt and issued a new order reducing his obligation for Casey\u2019s annual college expenses from $17,000 to $7,800.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s order was accompanied by a memorandum, that did not explain how she arrived at the reduced figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Paula sought reconsideration. Another hearing was held on April 30, 2007, during which Shawn for the first time argued that he should only be liable for one-half the cost of a State university. He, not the judge, characterized the last order as a decision by the judge to limit his obligation to fifty percent of the cost of attending a public college.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Following the hearing, the judge affirmed her previous order limiting Shawn\u2019s obligation for Casey\u2019s college expenses to $7,800 per year. Her only explanation for this decision was that \u201c[m]other and daughter have selected a school financially \u2018out of reach\u2019 for Casey\u2019s father. He has not been ordered by this court to pay fifty (50) percent of their choice of schools which was made not in compliance with the divorce agreement or pursuant to court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>At issue is the interpretation of college expense provisions contained in a settlement agreement, where those provisions merged with and were incorporated in the divorce judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although a merged provision \u201cdoes not survive the judgment as a binding contract, we nevertheless will \u2018review the findings to determine whether the judge gave appropriate consideration to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in their written agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (2004), quoting from <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Ct. 563, 568 (2001). See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 477 (1997), quoting from <em>Feakes </em>v. Bozyczko, 373 Mass. 633, 635 (1977) (\u201cto the extent that the parties!\u2019] original [merged] agreement and the judgment of divorce left their obligations in doubt, the court should \u2018attempt to ascertain the objective sought to be accomplished by the parties\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 644 (1999) (\u201cWhere an agreement does not survive, it is nevertheless appropriate for a judge to take heed of the parties\u2019 own attempts to negotiate terms mutually acceptable to them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AaZ\">We begin with the relevant college expense provisions of the agreement. As previously noted, those provisions state in relevant part that \u201c[t]he Husband and Wife shall each contribute 50% toward each child\u2019s college education expenses, including, but not limited to, room, board, tuition, books, fees and other normal educational expenses,\u201d and that both parents are to \u201cparticipate fully in providing access to the child and her activities and input into educational . . . decisions affecting the child.\u201d The college expense provisions thus contemplate an interactive process regarding the selection of each child\u2019s college.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both parents have the right to participate in and provide input into the selection process. Neither parent is empowered to act unilaterally regarding college selection or payment plan. At the same time, there is no provision that addresses disagreement regarding the college selection process. Compare <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra </em>at 472 (parties expressly stipulated that future disagreement would be resolved by court \u201cat the appropriate time and in view of the law then appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The parties have differing interpretations of what they intended in the event of disagreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Paula, Shawn agreed to pay for one-half of Casey\u2019s expenses, regardless of the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>chosen or the cost. In support of her position, she points to the absence of language in the college expense provisions conditioning Shawn\u2019s obligation to pay on cost, his approval, or any other variable. Shawn claims that he and Paula both attended public universities and never intended the college expense provisions to require payment of private university expenses. He also suggests that his obligation to pay under the provisions is conditioned on Paula\u2019s providing him with satisfactory input into the college selection process, which he claims she did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We reject both parties\u2019 interpretation of the contested provisions. We cannot conclude on this record or as matter of law that the provisions to pay for Casey\u2019s college expenses necessarily encompassed the cost of private education as argued by Paula.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor can we conclude on this record or as matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>that the provision provided only for the payment of the cost of public education, as argued by Shawn.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the college expense provisions of the agreement reflected the parties\u2019 intentions that they each pay fifty percent of the cost of the college they had mutually selected, and in the event of disagreement on the college or the payment plan, each party would be responsible for fifty percent of the cost of reasonable college expenses. Cf. <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>439 Mass. 97, 105 (2003), quoting from <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>270 Mass. 140, 153 (1930) (agreement must be interpreted in accordance with \u201cprobable intention\u201d of parties, and \u201ccommon sense\u201d and to avoid unreasonable or inequitable construction).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In determining whether college expenses are reasonable, courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>have appropriately considered \u201call relevant equitable factors.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 477. These factors include \u201cthe financial resources of both parents, the standard of living the child would have enjoyed if the marriage had not been dissolved, the financial resources of the child, ... the cost of the school, the programs offered at the school, the child\u2019s scholastic aptitude, how the school meets the child\u2019s goals, and the benefits the child will receive from attending the school.\u201d <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>292 Ill. App. 3d 229, 237 (1997). See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra </em>(factors to be considered include educational needs of child and financial circumstances of parents); <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Piela, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 737 &amp; n.8 (2004) (\u201c[Cjhildren\u2019s needs are to be defined, at least in part, by their parents\u2019 standard of living,\u201d which in some cases \u201cincludes the ability to provide certain opportunities . . . such as private school education\u201d); Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines, principles par. 1 (2009) (encouraging \u201cjoint parental responsibility for child support in proportion to, or as a percentage of, income\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Also relevant to the inquiry is \u201cthe extent to which [a party] unjustifiably may have been excluded from the [college] decision-making process.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra. </em>Conversely, a party who has sat on his or her right to intervene, or to seek approval from the court when the parties disagree, until the college selection process has been completed, may have waived his or her right to object to the college and its concomitant cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In sum, we conclude that in the absence of an agreed-upon choice of, and payment plan for, college, the parties intended to provide for a payment obligation of fifty percent of reasonable college expenses. We believe that such an interpretation \u201cappears to be in accord with justice and common sense and the probable intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>439 Mass. at 105, quoting from <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>270 Mass. at 153. See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra. </em>We further conclude that in determining the reasonableness of those expenses, it is appropriate to consider the equitable factors discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In this case, we cannot discern from the judge\u2019s analysis whether she gave appropriate consideration to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in the college expense provisions that merged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>into the judgment. See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 139 (\u201cThe judge made no findings regarding the parties\u2019 intentions, as reflected in the [merged] separation agreement\u201d). The judge did not explain what she understood the provisions to mean or what she understood the parties\u2019 intentions to be regarding college expenses more generally. There was no legal analysis of the college expense provisions or fact finding regarding the parties\u2019 intentions. We know only that the \u201c[m]other and daughter have selected a school \u2018financially out of reach\u2019 for Casey\u2019s father\u201d and that he did not have to pay fifty percent of the cost of a college, the choice of which \u201cwas made not in compliance with the divorce agreement or pursuant to court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In addition, neither the judge\u2019s memoranda nor the record reflects how the judge arrived at the figure of $7,800. The only fact finding regarding the cost of a State college was Shawn\u2019s assertion that he paid $8,320 per year for his wife\u2019s son to attend Arizona State. Even if the judge decided to limit Shawn\u2019s obligation to the cost of a State college, there is no explanation as to why she ordered him to pay even less on Casey\u2019s behalf than he was paying for his wife\u2019s son to attend Arizona State.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">It is also unclear why the judge determined that the choice of school was not made in compliance with the college expense provisions. Shawn took no affirmative action in court to object to Casey\u2019s choice or limit his financial obligation until after she had already begun attending Roger Williams, despite knowing she was considering that school. The first action Shawn took in court was by motion filed in October, 2006, after the judgment of contempt entered against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the other hand, there is information in the record that Paula threatened not to support Casey if she considered the out-of-State schools proposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Shawn. In addition, Paula did not seek the court\u2019s approval of the choice of college before attempting to obligate Shawn to fifty percent of its cost. The judge does not expressly address this evidence, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">It was appropriate for the judge to consider whether the cost of Roger Williams was out of reach for Shawn. However, other important equitable factors were not addressed. From this record, we have very limited information about Casey\u2019s scholastic aptitude, course of study, or any benefits of attending Roger Williams or any alternate schools, or how they might meet Casey\u2019s goals. In sum, more is required to satisfy the requirement that the judge give appropriate consideration to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in the college expense provisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the judge\u2019s order dated November 3, 2006, and remand this case for a determination of what fifty percent of Casey\u2019s reasonable college expenses is under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> The record reveals little about Casey\u2019s willingness or ability to attend other schools besides Roger Williams, and the judge made no fact findings on the subject. It appears Casey was willing to attend the University of Massachusetts, but was not accepted there. She was, however, accepted at Salem State College and had apparently applied to Arizona State as an Arizona resident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> More specifically, in Shawn\u2019s motion seeking \u201c[ejqual opportunity in educational decisions,\u201d Shawn sought input into college selection and college payments, an \u201cOpportunity to benefit from any and all financial aid, student and parent loans and any other financial assistance programs they may qualify for,\u201d and an opportunity to claim a tax credit for payments made toward college expenses. This request was presumably in response to Paula\u2019s demand that Shawn pay his $17,000 share of the first-year expenses \u201cin full\u201d because \u201cshe [did] not believe he [would] pay loans as due and their child [would] graduate owing $80,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> The judge did not find Paula in contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> Although the judge\u2019s orders are not self-explanatory, she did not appear to be modifying the judgment by considering changed circumstances. There was no discussion of changed circumstances. Rather, she appeared to be considering and enforcing the original understanding of the parties regarding college expenses, which was reflected in the merged portions of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>Johnstone, </em>226 Iowa 503, 510 (1939) (concluding that agreement requiring father to pay for child\u2019s college expenses and mother to inform father of nature and cost of instruction did not give either party exclusive right to choose school regardless of cost, but rather \u201cindicate[d] that such matters were to be left to the future agreement of the parties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> Disagreement itself is not surprising. \u201cWith the explosive growth in the cost of financing a college education, the issue of who will pay those costs after the divorce of the parents is becoming increasingly acute.\u201d 2 Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 39:50, at 830 (3d ed. 2002). Overall, college tuition and fees have increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>for inflation. National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, Measuring Up 2008: The National Report Card on Higher Education 8 (2008). The difference between college costs at different types of universities is also significant. According to the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC), tuition and fees averaged about $3,200 for community colleges and $33,000 for private research universities in 2006-2007.

Prior to that, the main disagreement was over how he would pay his one-half of Casey\u2019s expenses at Roger Williams. Shawn wanted access to loans, or to pay Paula one-half of her loan payments as they came due, rather than being forced to pay a full one-half of the expenses on a yearly basis. In fact, at the end of the first hearing on November 3, 2006, Shawn indicated that as long as he was permitted to take out loans, it would be reasonable for him to pay for Casey\u2019s entire second year at Roger Williams since Paula had paid for her first year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> On a final note, Shawn has repeatedly argued that one of the reasons he cannot afford to pay for one-half of Casey\u2019s expenses at Roger Williams is his payment of his stepson\u2019s expenses at Arizona State.

While this principle generally applies in cases where a party seeks a modification, we think it applicable to the situation presented in this case as well. Shawn agreed to pay for one-half of his daughters\u2019 college educations prior to marrying his second wife and assuming payment of her son\u2019s college expenses. He has no obligation to pay these expenses. <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Minter, </em>349 R Supp. 1240, 1241 (D. Mass. 1972), citing <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Marchant, </em>14 Pick. 510 (1834) (\u201cUnder Massachusetts law ... a stepfather is not legally obligated to support his stepchildren\u201d). Nor has he the right \u201cto prefer his second family over his first.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Katz, supra </em>at 483. His self-imposed, voluntary assumption of his stepson\u2019s expenses at Arizona State, therefore, should not factor into a determination of his available resources to pay for Casey\u2019s education or the education of his other daughter with Paula. Cf. Child Support Guidelines II-I (\u201cObligations to a subsequent family may be used as a defense to a request to modify an order seeking an increase in the existing order but such obligations should not be considered a reason to decrease existing orders\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
