The circuit court affirmed the city court in its assessment of the penalty prescribed by the ordinance for such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On appeal to this court, Thompson insists that the ordinance does not apply to an ambulance, particularly when it is being driven in response to an emergency call.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We find no support for this contention. The ordinance does not except ambulances from its application, and the courts may not read such exception into it. <em>National Funeral Home </em>v. <em>Dalehite, </em>15 Tenn. App., 482, 491-494.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">It is altogether immaterial that the ambulance was being driven on a street designated as a part of the state highway system. Such designation does not destroy or limit the city\u2019s right to regulate traffic on such a street. <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>160 Tenn., 571, 27 S. W. (2d), 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
