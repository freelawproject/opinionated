There is no dispute that the demands of the relator are proper obligations of the district, matured, and unpaid. Therefore mandamus seems to be the proper remedy to determine the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The district was organized in 1911, under the provisions of Acts 1909, chapter 185. In addition to the assessments for the payment of bonds, authorized by the county court, an assessment was authorized and made to create a \"contingent or administration fund for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>purpose of meeting expenses and contingencies that may arise.\u201d The decree of the county court making the assessment provided further that the sums collected therefrom should he \u201cirrevocably pledged to the payment of the bonds and interest coupons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The county trustee has not heretofore kept the administration fund separate from the other funds of the district, and money collected from the additional assessment has been applied to the payment of bonds and interest ; with the result that the sum now held by the county trustee is much less than that collected from the additional assessment. The trustee and the directors of the district, joined as defendants to the petition, contend therefore that the money now on hand should be held and reserved for administration expenses, including the expense of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It was ruled by this court in <em>Bondholders\u2019 Protective Committee </em>v. <em>North Fork Drainage District </em>(unreported), appealed from Dyer county, that the act of 1909 contained no provision authorizing an assessment for administration or maintenance expense \u2014 a defect corrected by Acts 1915, chapter 63, enacted after this district was organized. In that case an unauthorized assessment for maintenance or administration was held to have been excluded from provisions of the county court decrees \u201cirrevocably pledging the entire assessment\u201d to the payment of the bonds, because the decree, plainly showed that the additional assessment was to be devoted to administration purposes. However, the additional assessment in that case was described in the county court decree as also intended to protect the bonds of the district against \u201ccasual default,\u201d and it was therefore held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>balance of the administration fund, remaining after proper expenses of maintenance had been met, was liable to the payment of bonds in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The decree of the county court in the case before us limits the additional assessment to the purpose of providing a fund for the payment of administration and contingent expenses, and does not contain language making such fund liable to the payment of bonds. Therefore, we think the pledge contained in the decree is plainly limited by its context to funds collected on assessments made for the purpose of paying the bonds and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">However, we do not think the district may replenish its depleted administration fund by retaining money collected on assessments included in the pledge. This would be contrary to the obligation of the bonds. It is no fault of the relator that money collected on the administration assessment has heretofore been paid out on other bonds. The relator is entitled to reach that part of the fund in the hands of the trustee which was collected from the landowner on the assessment made for the payment of bonds and interest. Presumably this amount is shown by the records of the trustee, and a decree for the proper amount can be entered here by agreement of the parties. If not, the case will be remanded to the chancery court of Gribson county for ascertainment of the amount and for decree in accordance with this opinion. Costs of the case will be paid by the drainage district out of its maintenance fund.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
