Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Murfreesboro, Tennessee: That the following-laws, rules and regulations shall govern the operation, driving and controlling of vehicles on the streets of the City of Murfreesboro, Tennessee: (Here follow 12 items not applicable to this case.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201c13. No child under the age of sixteen years shall be permitted to drive a vehicle in the City. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">This clause of the stipulation immediately follows the foregoing excerpt from the ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cThe foregoing shall be deemed sufficient properly to place the applicable provisions of said ordinance in evidence; but the complainant reserves the right to attack the validity of Sub-Section 13 of Section 1 of the ordinance on the ground that said subsection is too broad as not being limited to the streets of the City; but it is agreed that no other attack can be made on the validity of said ordinance or said sub-section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In support of this attack on the validity of subsection 13, it is argued that this subsection may apply to and cover any part of the city, even privately owned inclosures, and that, so applied, it is void for unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">In considering the validity of an ordinance, the rule of construction is that laid down in <em>Carroll Blake Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>140 Tenn., 181, 203 S. W., 945, 948, to the effect that, where an ordinance, like a statute, \u201cis susceptible of two constructions one of which will render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>it void and the other valid it is the duty of the court to adopt the latter.\u201d <em>Mayor, etc., of Jonesboro, </em>v. <em>Kincheloe, </em>148 Tenn., 688, 257 S. W., 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Giving effect to this rule of construction, we think that the objection offered to the validity of this ordinance is not well taken. It is apparent that the ordinance as a whole is directed to the regulation of the driving and operation of vehicles on the streets of the city of Mur-freesboro, as plainly recited in the opening section. The language of section 13 must he related to the purpose specifically indicated in the opening section. This is not a case in which an attempt is being made to extend the application of the ordinance to any territory within the city other than its streets. We are of opinion that the chancellor was in error in holding otherwise, and the assignment directed to his action in this regard must he sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">With respect to the insistence that the words \u201cin violation of law\u201d do not apply to this municipal ordinance, we think there can be no doubt that the chancellor was correct in following the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>U. S. Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>G. Co. </em>v. <em>Guenther, </em>281 U. S., 34, 50 S. Ct., 165, 166, 74 L. Ed., 683, wherein this question was directly dealt with. As said by Mr. Justice SaNeord in that case: \u201cWhen the words of the exclusion clause are taken in their ordinary meaning they are free from any ambiguity. . . . The plain and evident purpose of the clause was to prevent the Company from being held liable for any accident occurring while by reason of the age of the operator the automobile was being operated in violation of law. \u2019 \u2019 And, further: \u201cthe Clause uses the broad phrase \u2018fixed by law,\u2019 in which the term \u2018law\u2019 is used in a generic sense, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>meaning the rules of action or conduct duly prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force; including valid municipal ordinances as well as statutes.\u201d What is here said is equally applicable to the' broad phrase, \u201cin violation of law,\u201d as used in the instant contract. He cites <em>In re Mutual L. Ins. Co., </em>89 N. Y., 530, wherein the court held that a street grade fixed and established .by an ordinance of the city council was one \u201cfixed and established by law.\u201d And see <em>Ex parte Lawrence, </em>69 Cal., 608, 11 P., 217, and <em>Ex parte Christenson, 85 </em>Cal., 208, 24 P., 747 construing the words \u201claw of this state\u201d as used in the Penal Code (section 435) requiring a license to include a city ordinance. Also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>15 Barb. (N. Y.), 529, applying the phrase in the Constitution of the state \u201cestablished by law\u201d to a special law passed by a board of supervisors of a county.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It results that the automobile was being operated in direct violation of a plain exclusion provision of the policy contract, and the decree adjudging liability against the indemnity company must be reversed, and the suit dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
