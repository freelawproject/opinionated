An order opening a judgment entered by default for plaintiff was reversed by the general term, (54 H. Y. Super. Ct. 457,) and defendant\u2019s appeal to the court of appeals was dismissed, (14 H. E. Hep. 608, <em>mem.) </em>An order was then entered staying proceedings until the determination of the case of <em>Mayor, etc., </em>v. <em>Brady, ante, </em>179, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b197-11\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atm\">Under the circumstances of the case I am of opinion that it was within the power of the court below to postpone the trial for the purpose of gaining the benefit of a decision at general term in the ease of the mayor, etc., against the present plaintiff and others. The order stayed proceedings generally, but the proceeding aimed at was the trial. I think, however, that there should not have been a stay until the final determination of the action. The order should be modified and affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">O\u2019Gorman, J\u201e concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
