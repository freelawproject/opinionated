There was testimony tending to show that such statements were and were not. made; that the water was more and less than six feet; that the place was safe and unsafe; that the boat was overturned for the want of six feet of water, and by the condition of the bottom, and that it was not; that it was overturned by improper loading and its leaky condition. The controversy was fairly submitted to the jury as to whether or not defendant\u2019s negligence brought about the injuries complained of. The verdict was for the defendant, and this appeal is from the judgment thereupon, and the order denying motion for new trial. Plaintiffs\u2019 sole contention on this appeal, in the words of their counsel\u2019s brief is that \u201cthe question was not one of negligence, and none was shown on the part of plaintiffs, or attempted to be shown on the part of defendant;\u201d that it is \u201can action to recover for a breach of contract;\u201d that defendant, in contracting that this berth was all right for this boat, \u201ccontracted either that the boat would not touch bottom, or, if it did, that the bottom would hold it upright;\u201d that if \u201cthe ease had been submitted to the jury on the question of contract, the result might have been different.\u201d We cannot assent to the proposition that the wharf-owner letting a berth for a boat, representing it a safe one, becomes the insurer of the boat against damage, though he shall be found free from negligence and the owner guilty of negligence causing the injuries to the boat. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Abendroth, </em>102 N. Y. 406, 7 N. E. Rep. 417; <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>4 Hun, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">The court properly refused to charge that plaintiffs had the right to rely upon the statement that the place was all right. It assumed that such statement had been made, and then there is testimony tending to show that dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ing the 10 days the boat was moored to the dock before the accident plaintiffs learned the depth of the water, and the condition of the bottom, for during that time, at low tide, the boat touched and rested upon the ground. Certainly plaintiffs could not rely upon statements they knew were untrue. It was a question of fact for the jury, and not one of law, whether or not these-representations relieved the plaintiffs, in the exercise of ordinary care, from the further use of their senses to ascertain the safety of the berth. There is testimony from which it might reasonably be inferred that the plaintiffs, before the accident, though after the alleged representations, acquired such information in respect to depth and conformation of the berth while their boat for 10 days at low tide rested upon the ground, as might indicate to them its-probable unsafeness. If such indications would impel persons of ordinary prudence and experience under the circumstances, notwithstanding the representations, to further examine the condition of the berth, then the same-duty would rest upon the plaintiffs. This disposes of the questions raised by appellants. The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Osborne, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
