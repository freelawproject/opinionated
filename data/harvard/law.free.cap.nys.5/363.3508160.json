Dewey and George Edinger, against George K. Burdick and Abigail Burdick, his wife. On March 17, 1879, defendants executed a mortgage covering real estate therein described to \u201cthe commissioners for loaning certain money of the United States of the county of Onondaga,\u201d for the consideration of $1,000, interest payable annually. A proceeding for the foreclosure of the mortgage by advertisement was had. Hotice of foreclosure was given \u201cpursuant to an act authorizing the loan of certain moneys belonging to the United States, passed April 4, 1837,\u201d and the land was bid off by C. E. Billington, as loan commissioner. A notice to quit was served, which was refused, and the petition in these proceedings was filed. An answer was filed denying the allegations of the complaint, except that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>parties were officers, as averred, and setting up that the mortgage was void by reason of an alteration thereof.

In the petition it is averred that Dewey and Edinger \u201c were duly elected loan commissioners in and for the said county of Onondaga, and duly qualified and entered upon their duties as such officers. \u201d They assumed to make the petition \u201cas loan commissioners in and for the county of Onondaga. \u201d After describing the premises by metes and bounds, the petition avers in respect thereto\u2014in respect to said premises, viz.: \u201cBeing the same premises conveyed to the commissioners of said fund for Onondaga county by said mortgage. \u201d Section 5, c. 150, Laws 1837, (1 Rev. St. 7th Ed. 511,) provides as follows: \u201cThe commissioners of the several counties to be appointed in pursuance of this act shall respectively be known and distinguished by the name and style of \u2018 the commissioners for loaning certain moneys of the United States of the county \u2019 of which they are respectively commissioners, and they shall be named and described by such name and style in all legal and other proceedings which may be had under the provisions of this act. \u201d From the quotations we have already made from the petition it is obvious that the petitioners were not \u201cnamed and described by such name and style\u201d as the statute from which we' have just quoted requires. The petition was irregular in stating that the commissioners were duly elected; whereas, section 2 of the act already referred to provides that the governor shall nominate, and, with the consent of the senate shall appoint, two reputable inhabitants, etc. By chapter 337 of the laws of 1850 \u201cloan commissioners for the several counties in this state of the loans of 1792 and 1808 are abolished. \u201d See title of the act, 1 Rev. St. 529, and section 6, p. 531. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>79 N. Y. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">2. Section 2232 of the Code of Civil Procedure extends the summary proceedings for the recovery of land' to four enumerated cases, and allows such proceedings to be instituted and conducted against \u201ca person who holds over and continues in possession of real property after notice to quit the same has been given, as prescribed in section 2236. \u201d The respondent seeks to uphold the proceedings in question, and insists that the county judge had jurisdiction, in virtue of subdivision 2 of section 2232. That subdivision is as follows: \u201c(2) Where the property has been duly sold upon the foreclosure\u2014by proceedings taken as prescribed in title ninth of this chapter\u2014of a mortgage executed by him, or a person under whom he claims, and the title under the foreclosure has been duly perfected. \u201d Title 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure relates to \u201cproceedings to foreclose a mortgage by advertisement;\u201d and section 2387, which is found in title 9, prescribes what mortgages may be foreclosed by advertisement. The section contains the following: \u201cA mortgage upon real property situated within the state, containing therein a power to the mortgagee or any other person to sell the mortgaged property upon default being made in a condition of the mortgage, may be foreclosed, in the manner prescribed in this title, where the following requisites concur1 (1) Default has been made in a condition of the mortgage, whereby the power to sell has become operative. * * * (3) The mortgage has been recorded in the proper book for recording mortgages, in.the county wherein the property is situated. \u201d The mortgage which was given by the defendants was substantially in the form prescribed by section 56 of the act of 1837, c. 150, (1 Rev. St. 7th Ed. 523.) The mortgage contains no \u201cpower to the mortgagee, or any other person, to sell the mortgaged property upon default being made in a condition of the mortgage. \u201d Under such a mortgage as was given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defendants, after default for 23 days in the payment of money due thereon \u201call title and interest of the mortgagor in the land is gone.\u201d \u201cThe whole title to it vests in the commissioners. But, as the state wants no more than its debt and interest, the mortgagor is relieved from the forfeiture he has incurred if he will, before the actual sale, come forward, and pay it, with the expenses. \u201d <em>Pell </em>v. Ulmar, 18 N. <em>Y. </em>146. By the mortgagor\u2019s default the mortgage became foreclosed by operation of law, \u201cand nothing remained in the mortgagor but a special privilege of redemption. \u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Lester, </em>4 Abb. Dec. 588; <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Ulmar, supra. </em>Inasmuch as the petition and proofs before the\u00b0county judge did not show that the property in question had been sold upon a foreclosure authorized by the provisions of title 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, there was a failure to show facts conferring jurisdiction upon the county judge to conduct the summary proceedings. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>52 N. Y. 445. It seems that the authority to sell premises covered by a mortgage like the one in question rests upon the statute, rather than a power of sale contained in the instrument. It seems that section 2409 of the Code of Civil Procedure was adopted to exclude from the operation of the other sections of title 9 the foreclosure of a mortgage given like the one before us. In <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Reade, </em>7 Hill, 433, it was said, the authority to sell as conferred by this statute is special in its nature, and must be strictly pursued, or the sale will be invalid. Judgment and order reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
