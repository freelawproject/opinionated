Errors of law arising on exceptions taken at the trial are therefore-alone before the court for consideration. The only exception which appears in the case is one to an order denying a motion for a new trial. Such an exception is not, therefore, available for any purpose. On trials by jury the-only subjects for exceptions are rulings at the trial. The motion for a new trial is a proceeding subsequent to the trial, and an order made on such motion is reviewable only by appeal. <em>Boos </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>64 N. Y. 236; <em>Thurber </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>60 N. Y. 326. The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">Tbuax, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
