E. Rep. 676. Action by Alice Richards against John H. Beach as a stockholder of the American Opera Company, (Limited,) to recover under the general act of 1848, and also under Laws .1875, c. 611, \u00a7 37, making stockholders personally liable for corporate debts to the amount of their stock until the full amount of the capital stock is paid in. Plaintiff sued for the value of her services to the American Opera Company as a ballet dancer. An order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint was affirmed by the general term of the city court, and defendant appeals. Laws 17. Y. 1875, c. 611, \u00a7 25, is identical with section 24 of the act of 1848, which exempts stockholders of manufacturing corporations organized under it from the liability for corporate debts imposed by section 10 in certain cases, except that the act of 1875 omits a clause from the earlier act to the effect that stockholders shall not be liable until an execution against the corporation shall have been returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-9\">The following is the opinion of McAdam, C. J., at the general term of the city court: \u201cThe facts of this case are almost similar to those in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Coe,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>except that the plaintiff in the present action declares upon a judgment against the corporation; but the complaint fails to allege that an execution has been duly issued thereon and returned unsatisfied. This omission is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action for the reasons assigned in the <em>Coe Case. </em>There is no provision in the act of 1875, c. 611, making a stockholder liable for debts due to laborers, servants, or apprentices, for services performed to the corporation, and the allegations of the complaint attempting to bring the plaintiff\u2019s claim within the category merit no comment, and may be regarded as surplusage. The provisions of the manufacturing act of 1848, (chapter 40, \u00a7 18,) which the pleader evidently had in mind, because they refer to these subjects, do not in any manner affect corporations created under the act of 1875; but even under these provisions of the manufacturing act of 1848 the stockholder cannot be sued until the legal remedies of the creditor have been exhausted. The demurrer to the complaint must therefore be sustained, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-10\"><em>William W. Badger, </em>for appellant. <em>George W. Cotterell, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-12\"> Not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b590-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ATC\">This court is not restrained by the injunction in the case of <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>American Opera Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>even if the parties to the appeal are. If either of them has violated the injunction by bringing on the argument of the appeal, he is responsible. Since the first argument of this case the court of appeals have decided the matter in controversy in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>110 N. Y. 109, 17 N. E. Rep. 676, adversely to the respondent, and the judgment must therefore be reversed. But as this decision was made after the appeal had been taken from the city court, we think the respondent should have liberty to answer over, on payment of the costs of the appeal to this court only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
