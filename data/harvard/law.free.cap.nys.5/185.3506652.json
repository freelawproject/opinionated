Loveless against the Manhattan Railway Company for personal injuries sustained through defendant\u2019s negligence. On the trial it appeared that plaintiff after purchasing his ticket started to board one of defendant\u2019s trains, but, before reaching the platform, he slipped and fell in the passage-way, where slush and snow had accumulated, and ruptured the internal ligament of his knee-joint. Defendant appeals from a judgment entered on the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b201-13\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKN\">The action was for damages from alleged negligence of defendant\u2019s servants. The question that on the trial was asked of plaintiff when a witness, and that defendant\u2019s counsel objected to, and that related to the declarations of Dr. Freer, was not answered, and the next question asked by the court, which was different substantially from the first question, was not objected to. Dr. Stimson, a witness on behalf of defendant, testified on direct examination that he had heard the testimony that there was a rupture of certain ligaments of plaintiff\u2019s leg. The next question was: \u201cWhat have you to say off the testimony you have heard on that subject?\u201d This question was properly excluded, for his general opinion as to the testimony was not evidenee. The next question was properly overruled. It was: \u201cDoes the testimony you have heard on that subject satisfy your mind as to the existence of any such double rupture?\u201d The witness was here asked to weigh the evidence he had heard. This was the office of the jury. Beyond this it did not appear from the question what evidence the witness had heard, or as to what part of the testimony the question was pointed. The learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the complaint should have been dismissed, under the law of the case of <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>20 N. E. Rep. 383. The cited case sustains the law as charged by the court below; and the facts of this case differ from the facts in the <em>Kelley Case </em>in such respects that the judge below was correct in not dismissing the complaint. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
