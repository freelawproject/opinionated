H. Childs against William Mayer, as executor, etc., of Zizilia Mayer, deceased, to recover the sum of $882.10 for oil sold and delivered. The answer alleged that the oil was sold under an express warranty that it was fit for the purpose for which it was bought, and that in consequence of its inferior quality it was totally unfit for that purpose, and that by reason of such breach of warranty defendant had sustained damages in the sum of $1,000, such damages being pleaded as a counter-claim. Bills of particulars of plaintiff\u2019s claim and of defendant\u2019s counter-claim were served; the former consisting of some 50 items of sales at different times, and the latter consisting of about the same number of \u201citems of damage,\u201d part of them being for articles of glassware manufactured by defendant\u2019s testatrix, and rendered defective by reason of the inferior quality of the oil bought of plaintiff and used in their manufacture, and part being items of time lost by stoppage of works, and wages paid to workmen during such stoppage. After the cause was noticed for trial and placed on the jury calendar, plaintiff moved for an order of reference, tin the ground that the trial would involve the examination of a long account. In response to this motion dei'endant admitted that all the oil claimed in plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars, except one lot, had been delivered. From an order granting the motion defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b356-9\">Argued before Barnard, P J., and Dykman, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-10\"><em>William B.

An examination of the pleadings is sufficient to show that the result of the trial will be controlled by the question of warranty involved in the case; but in any view there is no such account as the law requires to justify a compulsory reference. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
