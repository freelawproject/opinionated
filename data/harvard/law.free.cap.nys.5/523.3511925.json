He did not return it upon proper demand, .and made representations which the court could properly hold to be evasive. The case was thus presented where one tenant in common of personal prop\u25a0erty makes an exclusive appropriation of it to himself in hostility to the right of his co-tenants to its possession and enjoyment. In such case his eo-ten.ants can maintain an action against him. <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>83 N. Y. 201, .and cases there cited. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
