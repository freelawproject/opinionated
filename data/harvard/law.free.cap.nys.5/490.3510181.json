In this view we concur. It is not the case of a plaintiff who cannot coin\u00e9 to testify, but it is that of a plaintiff who refuses to come to testify, and by his absence is refusing to submit to the authority of our courts. Such a plaintiff, being a resident of the state, certainly cannot call upon the facilities of the- court to enable him to continue to evade its authority. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Macomber and Bartlett, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
