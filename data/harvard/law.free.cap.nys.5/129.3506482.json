The answer alleged that the transactions between the parties were only colorable and speculative, and not real; that no securities were in fact to be bought and sold; and that the transactions were void under the statute against gaming. It also pleads usury, fraud, and false representations. The learned judge at special term set aside the order for the examination of the plaintiffs as witness\u00e9s upon the ground, mainly, that the evidence sought was not necessary for the protection of the defendant\u2019s rights; that it was, in substance, an effort to obtain the plaintiffs\u2019 proof of their case before trial; and that the agreements relied upon for the defense are set up positively in the answer as of the defendant\u2019s own knowledge. Another objection which might be stated is that the affidavit upon which the examination was sought was not of the character required by tlie Code of Civil Procedure (section 872) before such examination can properly be had. The affidavit is argumentative. It asserts that the testimony of the plaintiffs is m;.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>terial and necessary for the reason, etc., \u201cthat the said plaintiffs, acting, as they claim, as the agents of this deponent.\u201d \u201cAnd the said plaintiffs also alone knowing, and the only persons known to this deponent,\u201d etc., who can testify. Before a party can be permitted to obtain the evidence of his adversary before trial he should present an affidavit which alleges positively, and not argumentatively and inferentially, the facts going to show the necessity of such examination. For this and for the reasons stated by the judge at special term the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
