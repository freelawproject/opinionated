Thompson against Charles E. Thompson and Mary T. McConihe, executrix of and trustee under the will of Gilbert G. Thompson, deceased. The plaintiff obtained, on the 19th day of April, 1888, a judgment of divorce against her husband, the defendant Charles Thompson. The judgment directed the defendant to pay the plaintiff yearly the sum of $800 for her support and that of their child, whose custody was awarded her. The defendant is entitled under the will of his deceased father, Gilbert G. Thompson, to the income of an estate valued at $39,344. That income is found in this action to be $1,600 yearly. The defendant Mary T. McConihe is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>executrix and trustee under the will, and has the custody of the estate charged with the payment of said income. The will provided that the income of testator\u2019s estate should be paid to his son Charles E. Thompson until January 1, 1895, when, if living, he should receive the principal. If he should die before that time the income was to be paid to his issue, and at that time the principal was to be equally divided among such issue. If he should die without issue, but leaving a widow, she was to receive $10,000 out of testator\u2019s estate. This action was brought to subject the income to the payment of the alimony mentioned. Judgment for plaintiff, and the trustee appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b621-5\">Argued before Learned, P.

She is simply directed to pay a portion of the income of the trust-estate in her hands to the plaintiff, the wife of the defendant Charles Thompson, instead of paying it to Thompson himself. The sum directed to be paid is the alimony and allowance awarded by the judgment obtained in an action for divorce by the plaintiff against her husband, Charles Thompson. In this action the defendant Charles Thompson appears by his attorney, and suffers default. The appellant must pay the income of the trust-estate, and this judgment protects her in paying a portion of it to the plaintiff. The only persons who can claim that they are not bound by this judgment are the judgment creditors of Charles Thompson. The trial court held, and we think properly, that the trust created by the will of Gilbert G. Thompson for the support of Charles Thompson extends also to the support of his wife and child, and that a judicial provision for their support out of the income is a proper application of a portion of the income, and paramount to the rights of judgment creditors. <em>Tolles </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>99 N. Y. 616, 1 N. E. Rep. 251. Should a judgment creditor hereafter attempt to impeach such provision, the court would extend the necessary protection to the appellant as trustee. We think the judgment right, and that it should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed; costs of both parties payable out of the fund. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
