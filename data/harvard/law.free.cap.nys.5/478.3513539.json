Curtis and Helen C. Waters, as individuals and as executrices aforesaid, within twenty days from the service of a copy of this interlocutory judgment to pay the costs of the plaintiffs as taxed;\u201d and also provided that in case of a failure to pay the costs and serve an answer final judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring, viz.: \u201c(1) That the devises in the will of Palmer H.

Curtis, dated September 13, 1879, and the codicil thereto annexed dated June 7, 1882.\u201d The \u25a0complaint also sets out the will and the codicil.

Curtis and Helen C. Waters, and the grandfather of the said defendant Bertie Curtis, from whom they inherited said premises, and as sucii widow claims a right of dower which has not been ad-measured in the premises.\u201d Palmer H.

Brown, all my household furniture, goods, family pictures, and books, to be equally divided between them by my executrices in said will appointed as in said will directed. Said household goods, furniture, family pictures, and books shall not be divided during the life-time of my wife, Fanny Curtis, nor until my executrices shall sell and convey all the real estate of which I shall die seised, and my said wife, Fanny Curtis, and my said daughters Helen C.

That my two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>married daughters, to-wit, Mary A. Underwood and Theresa L.

This codicil is made to enable my wife and two unmarried daughters to live upon and occupy the said real estate until such time as it shall be sold as in said will provided.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">Bespondents\u2019 learned counsel is correct in claiming that the will and codicil are to be construed together, as though the language thereof was contained in one instrument. 3 Rev. St. (7th Ed.) p. 2288, \u00a7 71; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>105 N. Y. 68, 11 N. E. Rep. 373; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>77 N. Y 369. We do not agree with the learned counsel for the respondents, however, in his contention that \u201csaid will and codicil, and said codicil, and each and all \u25a0of them, are illegal, null, and void, for the reason that the absolute power of alienation or ownership of the property is thereby suspended for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the creation of the estate.\u201d Of course, the provision of the statute in respect to the suspension of power of alienation for not more than two lives in being must be borne in mind in giving construction to the will and codicil before us. 3 Rev. St. (7th Ed.) p. 2176, \u00a7 15; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>11 Wend. 259; <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>47 N. Y. 389; <em>Schettler </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>41 <em>N. </em>Y. 328. We are of the opinion that an estate for the life of Fanny Curtis, the widow, vested in the whole estate upon the death of the testator for the benefit of Fanny Curtis, Helen C. Waters, and Harriet S. Curtis. We are also of the further opinion that, on the termination of the life-estate first provided for, Mary A. Underwood took a contingent life-estate in one-quarter of the real estate, subject, however, to the contingency of an omission to sell within 10 years, according to the contingencies mentioned in the will and codicil. We are also of the further opinion that one-quarter of the real estate passed to Theresa Brown under like contingencies, and that the other two-fourths of the remainder of the estate vested in the two daughters Helen C. and Harriet S. Curtis. Ackerman v. <em>Gorton, </em>67 N. Y. 66. While there was a discretion vested in the executrices to make a sale, there was no creation of a trust term for any limited or stated period of time, and hence there was no suspension of the power of alienation. The mere creation of the trust did not suspend the power of alienation. There was no period when a sale would be in contravention of the trust, although it may be conceded there was a discretion given to the trustees as to the time in which a sale might be made. <em>Robert </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>89 N. Y. 225; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>20 N. E. Rep. 814. These views lead us to the conclusion that the judgment, so far it declares portions of the will \u201cillegal and void,\u201d is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">It is suggested, however, by the learned counsel for the respondent that an action for partition may be maintained by virtue of section 1533 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section provides, viz.: \u201c Where two or more persons hold, as joint tenants or as tenants in common, a vested remainder or reversion, any one or more of them may maintain an action for a partition of the real property to which it attaches, according to their respective shares therein, subject to the interest of the person holding the particular estate therein. But in such an action the property cannot be sold; and, if it appears in any stage thereof that partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners, the complaint must be dismissed.\u201d Under this section it must be obvious that the complaint before us, so far as it asks for a sale of the property, cannot be upheld under the section just quoted. It may be questionable whether, upon the facts that are stated in the complaint, it appears that an actual partition \u201ccannot be made without great prejudice to the owners.\u201d We do not regard it important to pass upon that view of the case upon the facts now before us. It may be suggested there is also doubt as to the propriety of the plaintiffs maintaining a partition against Bertie Curtis. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>66 N. Y. 37. However, we do not consider it important to pass upon the question finally in the determination of the appeal before us. It is quite apparent that the pleader did not prepare the complaint in this case with a view of bringing the rights of the parties before the court that the property might be partitioned in virtue of the enabling provisions found in section 1533 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It may be further observed that the complaint does not contain an artistic statement of facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for the purpose of maintaining an actual partition against the defendants as executrices in pursuance of the provisions of section 1533 enabling two or more persons who hold as tenants in common \u201ca vested remainder or reversion\u201d to maintain an action for a partition of real property. If the plaintiffs are to be allowed to maintain an action for actual partition in virtue of the section just alluded to, before doing so they should amend their complaint and so frame it as to bring their case fairly within the permissive provisions of the section of the Code. It seems to be conceded by the respondent, and to have been held at the special term, that this will and codicil effected a conversion of the real estate into personalty, so that the statute in relation to accumulation of personal property was the only one applicable to the questions involved in the case. However, we do not think it opportune to pass conclusively upon that question; nor whether that view of the case stands in the way of an actual partition of the real property. See <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>15 Wkly. Dig. 118. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>85 N. Y. 53. Nor do we deem it important to pass upon the question as to whether the plaintiffs can present a proper state of facts entitling them to a construction of the will and codicil. <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>94 N. Y. 247. Because of the erroneous provisions found in the judgm'ent brought before us by the appeal we think it should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave, however, to the plaintiffs to amend their complaint upon payment of costs of the demurrer and the costs of this appeal within 20 days. Judgment reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiffs to amend their complaint within 20 days upon payment of costs of the demurrer and of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
