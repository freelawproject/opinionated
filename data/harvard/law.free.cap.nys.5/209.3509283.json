An examination of the answer discloses no redundant or irrelevant allegation, except perhaps the charge that no action had been commenced against the brother of the defendant, to whom the board was furnished. That averment may be unnecessary, but no other objection can be lodged against the answer, and the order is much too broad and sweeping. The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
