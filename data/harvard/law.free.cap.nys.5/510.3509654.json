Weatherwax on a promissory note executed by defendant, and payable to plaintiff. It appeared that plaintiff had recovered a judgment for $103 against one Van Loon, defendant\u2019s son-in-law, and that at the time defendant executed the note plaintiff executed a satisfaction of his judgment against Van Loon. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was to the effect that he had tried to collect the judgment by execution; that defendant came to him and stated that if he would satisfy the judgment against his son-in-law, Van Loon, he would give plaintiff bis note, payable in six months, for $80, in payment of the judgment; that they went to the law-office of Mr. Reynolds, at Amsterdam, who, at the request of the parties, drew the note in suit, and a satisfaction of the Van Loon judgment; that defendant then signed the note, delivered it to plaintiff, and plaintiff signed and acknowledged the satisfaction of the judgment and delivered it to defendant. Defendant testified that he gave the note to procure the release of certain property of Van Loon\u2019s wife, which plaintiff had seized under execution.

The defense of want of consideration was not sustained. Contemporarily with the execution of the note, the plaintiff executed, acknowledged, and left for the defendant a satisfaction piece of the judgment recovered by the plaintiff against Van Loon. Whether Van Loon was solvent or not at that time, this was a consideration, if the parties so agreed, for the defendant\u2019s note. Judgment affirmed, with costs</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
