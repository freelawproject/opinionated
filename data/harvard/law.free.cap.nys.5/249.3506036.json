French, as executrix of Phebe E. Hitchcolk, deceased. Phebe E. Hitchcolk died on the 81st day of March, 1886, leaving a will dated July 22, 1884, in which were the following provisions: <em>\u201cFirst. </em>I give, devise, anct -bequeath unto my husband, John Hitchcolk, all of my real estate, situate in said town of Davenport, to do with as he shall think best. <em>Second. </em>I give, devise, and bequeath unto my said husband all and every kind of my personal property, consisting in part of mortgages, bonds, notes, and money, etc., and wish my said husband to do with said property as he shall think best during his lifetime, without any let or hindrance from any source whatever. <em>Third. </em>I give, devise, and bequeath unto my daughter, Mrs. F. A. Churchill, the sum of eight thousand dollars, to be paid her out of my real and personal estate, at and after the death of my said husband, provided there be that amount in my husband\u2019s hands at his decease. <em>Fourth. </em>I wish it to be distinctly understood that my-said husband may use so much of my real and personal estate as he may wish to during his life-time, and at his death, if there be the sum of eight thousand dollars remaining in his hands, that- that amount be paid to my daughter, Mrs. F. A. Churchill, and, if there be not the sum of $8,000 in his hands, then, and in that case, it is my wish that my said daughter have and receive whatever then remains in my said husband\u2019s hands, to do with as she shall think best. <em>Fifth. </em>I do hereby nominate and appoint and constitute my husband, John Hitchcolk, my executor, and my daughter, Mrs. F. A. Churchill, now of the city of Hew York, my executrix, of this my last will and testament.\u201d John Hitchcolk, the husband of Phebe E. Hitchcolk, died on 10th June, 1886, leaving a will bearing\" date May 5, 1886, in which, after divers provisions not material here, he gave all the rest of his property, real and personal, to his two daughters, Mrs. French, formerly Churchill, and Mrs. Simpson, share and share alike, and appointed them executors. In this will no reference was made to the will of Mrs. Hitchcolk, or to the property therein named. The will of Mrs. Hitchcolk was admitted to probate as a will of real and personal property on 26th July, 1886, and letters issued to the executrix. The will of John Hitchcolk was in like manner admitted to probate on 27th July, 1886, and letters issued to the executors. After the death of Mrs. Hitchcolk, her husband did not use or expend for himself or his benefit any part of the personal property of liis wife, and the securities in the hands of the executrix, and accounted for on the accounting, are the original securities owned by Mrs. Hitchcolk at her death, and that were passed over to the executrix without change. After the payment of debts and expenses there remained in the hands of the executrix, of the personal estate of Mrs. Hitchcolk, the sum of $2,606.22. This amount the surrogate decreed should be paid to Mrs. French upon the legacy to her of $8,000.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b266-10\">Argued before Hardin, P.

If there was such a power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>his will was in form sufficient to operate as an execution of it, and pass the-title to the residuary legatees therein named. <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Benkard, </em>92 N. Y. 295. Mrs. Hitehcolk, by the second clause of her will, gave to her husband all her personal property, wishing him to do with it as he should think best during his life-time. By the third clause she gave to her daughter, then Mrs. Churchill, $8,000, to be paid her out of her real and personal estate, at the death of her husband, provided there was that amount in her husband\u2019s hands at his decease. By the fourth clause she wishes it to be distinctly understood that her husband might use so much of her real and personal estate as he might wish to during his life-time, and that at his death whatever then remained in his hands, to the extent of $8,000, should be paid to her daughter. In <em>Greyston </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>41 Hun, 125, by the will there under consideration, the testator in the first clause gave and devised all his real and personal property to his wife absolutely, to have and to hold for her own use and benefit forever, and with full power and authority to sell or mortgage as she thought proper. In the second clause the testator provided that, on the death of his wife, \u201c whatever property she may die seised of that belonged to me, and remains in her by virtue of this will, shall be divided\u201d among others named. It was held that the widow had no power to dispose of any portion of her husband\u2019s estate by her will, and that so much thereof as remained in her hands undisposed of at the time of her death passed under her husband\u2019s will to the other parties. In <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Seeley, </em>47 Hun, 109, the testator gave all the rest and residue of his estate to his wife, \u201cto be held and used by her as she shall see fit and proper during the full term of her life, and at her death, if any part of my said estate shall remain unexpended, then, and in that case, I give and bequeath such remaining portion\u201d to other parties. It was held that the widow had a life-estate in the residue, with the power to use such portion thereof as she should deem proper for her support during her life, and that the provision as to the remainder, if any remained unexpended, was valid. In <em>Re Cager, </em>111 N. Y. 343, 18 N. E. Rep. 866, (recently decided by the court of appeals,) the testator gave all his estate, after the payment of debts, to his wife, \u201cto be used and enjoyed, and at her disposal, during the term of her natural life,\u201d and what might remain at her decease he gave to other parties. It was held that, while the widow had the power to dispose of the <em>corpus </em>of the .estate, such power was not absolute and unconditional, but was limited by the language devising the property for her use and enjoyment during her life, and did not give her the power of disposing of it by will. These cases seem quite analogous to the present. Here there is a gift of the personal estate to the husband, to do with it as he shall think best during his life-time, with power to use so much as he may wish during his life, and at his death whatever then remains in his hands, to the extent of $8,000, is given over to the daughter. The will operates in express terms on whatever is in the hands of the husband at his decease. That necessarily carries with it the idea that the husband by will cannot affect it. The intent on that subject seems very clear. The testatrix evidently contemplated that something would be left at her husband\u2019s death, but that there might not be $8,000. Mo provision is made for any excess over that amount. The inference is quite strong that none was contemplated. Many cases, earlier than those above referred to, have been cited, some of which are not entirely harmonious. It does not seem necessary to consider them here. The <em>Cager Case </em>contains the latest expression of the views of the court of appeals, and that and the <em>Greyston Case </em>are quite in point here. I am therefore of the opinion that the will of John Hitehcolk did not operate upon the balance of Phebe Hitchcolk\u2019s estate remaining at his death, but that such balance is properly applicable on the $8,000 legacy. The decree of the surrogate in that respect is therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It is further claimed by the appellant that the surrogate had no right to construe the will as to the real property, and that he erroneously assumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u2022do so in deciding that whatever remained unused and unexpended of the property of said deceased, to the amount of $8,000, passed on the death of said \u2022John Hitchcolk to Frances A. French. The construction of the will was necessary to determine the questions arising on the accounting, and in such a \u2022case jurisdiction to construe a will attaches as incident to that proceeding. <em>Purdy </em>v. <em>Hayt, </em>92 N. Y. 450. The real and personal were mingled in the provisions to be construed. In order to determine the <em>status </em>of the personal, .it was necessary to consider and pass upon the provisions referring to both real and personal. The real estate was not in question before the surrogate, and there is no specific adjudication about it. The decree affects only the personal estate, and whatever determination is made by the surrogate upon the question of construction relates very evidently in its effect only to the subject-matter then before the surrogate. The surrogate in this regard did not exceed his jurisdiction. It follows the decree appealed from should be affirmed, with \u2022costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
