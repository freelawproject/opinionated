Nestor against Magdalena Bischoff, executrix, and others. The sheriff of Richmond county took possession of the property in said county, and kept possession until an order was served on him to discontinue the action, which order was granted to plaintiff, at his request, on bis giving bond for payment of costs and damages. Nearly four years after said discontinuance the sheriff presented his bill for fees to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and a demand was served on the sheriff for taxation of said bill. The taxation of said bill was regularly noticed before the county judge of Richmond county, who made an order refusing to tax the said bill, on the ground that he had no jurisdiction of the matter. The sheriff then noticed the bill for taxation before a justice of the supreme court, at his chambers in the courthouse in the city of Poughkeepsie. Affidavits were presented to said justice upon said taxation on behalf of plaintiff in opposition to said bill, and on behalf of said sheriff in support thereof. An order was made by the said justice taxing and allowing the said bill. From this order plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b328-11\">Argued before^DYKMAN and Pratt, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-12\"><em>Wm.

And, had the objection been raised in season, it would have been the duty of the judge to have refused to proceed with the taxation. The objection could be waived, and proceeding without objection was a waiver. The case is analogous to the trial of an action at law. If objection is made, that can only take place within the proper county. Yet for considerations of convenience such trials frequently take place in an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>other county, and the validity of judgments rendered upon such trials have never been impugned. The amount allowed upon the taxation was reasonable, and the taxation must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
