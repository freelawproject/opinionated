J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">Appellant is a municipal corporation in virtue of chapter 335 of the Laws of 1869. Section 12 of the act provides for the items that, \u201cshall be included in the ordinary expenses of the village,\u201d and in the seventh subdivision are found these words: \u201c(7) For the necessary advances in making or repairing sidewalks, or abating nuisances, after such proceedings have-been had, as to make such expenses a lien upon real property, upon the failure of the owner to comply with the directions of the trustees in respect, thereto.\u201d Also subdivision 15: \u201cFor the necessary expenses of doing any act expressly authorized by law. * * * \u201d Section 27 provides as follows: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the trustees, and they shall have the power.. * * * \u201d Subdivision 14: \u201cTo direct the manner and superintend the making and repairing of sidewalks and cross-walks in said village.\u201d Subdivision-15: \u201cTo exercise the duties of commissioner of highways of towns within the limits of the village, so far as those powers and duties are consistent with-other parts of this act, and are applicable to the village. * * *\u201d And in-section 32 of the act we And the following words: \u201cSec. 32. The board of trustees shall have the power to cause any sidewalks in said village, which have not already been flagged and curbed, to be raised, leveled, graded, curbed, and flagged, graveled or planked, in such manner, and with such material, as-they may deem proper; and to cause any sidewalks which have been flagged or curbed, or in any other way made, to be relaid, amended, or repaired, whenever they may deem it necessary, \u201d etc. And in section 33 a further provision is inserted, viz.: \u201cAnd the said trustees shall, within the bounds of said village, have all the powers of commissioners of highways of towns, and shall-perform all such duties which by law are enjoined upon commissioners of', highways, and be subject to like restrictions. * * *\u201d Section 45 provides as follows: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the street commissioner * * * to keep in good condition the streets and highways within the boundaries of' his district, subject to the direction of the trustees, as herein provided..</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1. We think the provisions which we have quoted from the charter confer a sufficient power upon the trustees to keep the sidewalks in a reasonable condition, and that it is their duty to keep them in such condition. The same question was passed upon by this court in the case of <em>Round </em>v. <em>Village of Oneida, </em>47 Hun, 632, and the power and duty of the trustees affirmed. In speaking of a charter quite similar to the one before us, in <em>Pomfrey </em>v. <em>Village of Saratoga Springs, </em>the court of appeals said: \u201cThat under such a charter it was the duty of the defendant to keep its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe and proper condition for public use, and that for neglect of such duty it was liable for damages to persons, without fault on their part, receiving injuries upon its streets, has been settled by many decisions in this state, and-is no longer open to question.\u201d <em>Pomfrey </em>v. <em>Village of Saratoga Springs, </em>104 N. Y. 459. 11 N E. Rep. 43; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Village of Canastota, </em>98 N. Y. 496; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>City of Newburgh, </em>109 N. Y. 301, 16 N. E. Rep. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">2. Whether the sidewalk where the plaintiff received the injuries was out of repair, and the defendant had actual notice thereof, or it had remained but of repair sufficient time to give the defendant constructive notice thereof, and whether the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence or not upon the occasion of receiving the injuries, were questions of fact which were proper for the jury, and they were severally submitted, clearly and carefully, by the trial judge, \u201cand there is nothing in the evidence which requires us to disturb their verdict upon those questions.\u201d <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>11 Hun, 218. We think the fact that the sidewalk in question was inspected by Up-son, the chairman of the sidewalk committee, about the 1st of September, 1883, and considered by him in a \u201csatisfactory condition,\u201d does not of itself constitute a defense. It was evidence for the jury to consider, and in respect thereto the trial judge very properly instructed the jury that the trustees \u201cwere bound to use reasonable diligence in discovering whether this walk was out of repair, and it is a question of fact for the jury to say whether, if they did what they claim, they used due diligence or not. I cannot, as a matter of law, hold that they did use due diligence.\u201d We think the langu\u00e1ge of the charge was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">3. When Doyle was describing the condition of the sidewalk in 1883, he .stated that he was walking with his son-in-law, and tripped and fell. That testimony seems to have been received without objection. He was then asked to tell what occurred. A general objection was made to that, and it was overruled, and the witness answered that his son-in-law \u201cstepped a little quicker than me, and stepped on the end of a plank, and it tipped up, and caught my foot, and pitched me off. It was along Johnson\u2019s lot, about twelve feet from his west line. During the summer I noticed loose boards in the walk along the east part of Johnson\u2019s lot, near the hydrant, along in August.\u201d This witness also testified that he gave \u201cnotice to the trustees of the condition of \u2022this walk.\u201d Hesays: \u201cI went toMr. Remick. He told me he had nothing to do with the sidewalks. He told me to go to Mr. Upson, and I went right over and told him. He was one of the trustees. He said: <em>\u2022 </em>I will attend to having it repaired.\u2019 They were never attended to,\u2014never anything done to them after I saw it.\u201d When George Leigh was testifying, in the course of his cross-examination, he said: \u201cI have seen loose boards there on more than \u25a0one occasion. This time I went over is all I can remember, after I fell. I can\u2019t tell whereabouts this board was. I am certain it was on Johnson\u2019s walk, because there is where I saw loose boards, and on the other walk I never saw any, to my knowledge. As near as I can get at it, it was the latter part -of April. I didn\u2019t complain to anybody of this walk.\u201d Thereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel remarked that the evidence \u201cought to be stricken out as too remote.\u201d The motion was denied, but no exception was taken to the ruling. When Morris ICilts was giving his testimony, he said that he worked on the street in question under the street commissioner, and that at \u201csome time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>August, 1883,1 passed along this walk in front of Mr. Johnson\u2019s house, in company with Mr. Thompson. I should think the sidewalk was built of hemlock. The boards were about four feet long. I should think there were two stringefs under it, laid in a little from the end of the boards,\u2014four inches, I should think.\u201d He was then asked to tell what occurred to him and Thompson in August, while they were passing along there. This was objected to, and an exception taken by the defendant. The witness answered: \u201cMr. Thompson and I were walking down there, and a board tripped me. It .was on this walk, within six or eight feet of the hydrant.\u201d This same witness mentions a circumstance as occurring in August, 1883, when he was walking over the walk with his wife, and he was asked to describe what occurred, and he stated that she fell, and he said that a board flew up. He says: \u201cI stepped quicker than she did, and it threw her. It was one of those loose boards in the walk. They were loose during the summer of 1883, a good share of the \u25a0time. She tripped on about the same spot I did with Mr. Thompson. I think I spoke to Mr. Pardy about it.\u201d This same witness, in describing another instance, says: \u201c1 saw another man fall about the time of this accident to-Mrs. Stebbins. \u201d He was asked to describe how Dutzler fell. That was objected to, and the defendant excepted, and the witness answered: \u201cA board threw him,\u2014one of those loose boards in the walk. Happened about this-time in front of Johnson\u2019s house, and on the west corner of Walnut street. I can\u2019t say positively about any more. He just struck on his hands. \u201d Apparently the evidence was received for the purpose of showing the condition\" of the walk preceding the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and with a view of fixing notice upon the defendant of its condition. Justice Field refers to-the case of <em>City of Chicago </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>42 Ill. 169, and quotes approvingly therefrom, viz.: \u201cIf another person had met with a similar fate at the same place, and from a like cause, it would tend to show a knowledge on the part of the city that there was inattention on the part of their agents having charge of the bridge, and that they had failed to provide proper means for the protection of persons crossing on the bridge. As it tended to prove this fact, it was admissible, and, if the appellants had desired to guard against its improper application by the jury, they should have asked an instruction limiting it to its legitimate purpose. \u201d He then cites a large number of cases approving- of this class of evidence. <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Armes, </em>107 U. S. 526, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840. In speaking of similar testimony, offered in <em>Pomfrey </em>v. <em>Village of Saratoga Springs, </em>11 N. E. Rep. 47, the court observes \u201cthat evidence was given apparently to show how she came to know the condition of the walk at that place. But such evidence has been held to be competent. <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>11 Hun, 217, affirmed 74 N. Y. 603. \u201d In referring to a similar question in <em>Ster </em>v. <em>Tuety, </em>45 Hun, 49, nothing contrary to the principle of the eases we have already referred to was asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u2022 4. We think the court committed no error in refusing the nonsuit of plaintiff; that the verdict is supported by the evidence, and ought not to be disturbed. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Merwin, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
