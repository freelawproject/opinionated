It does not appear that the proceedings of the commissioners were reversed by <em>certiorari, </em>or that plaintiff ever took any action during the time he was out of office, and his reappointment cannot be treated as a voluntary reinstatement on the part of the commissioners, because their resolution does not so read; neither does it appear that the plaintiff ever \u2022demanded that he be put back in the department, and that he was reappointed \u25a0pursuant to such demand. For the above reasons, and on the opinion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>case of <em>McManus </em>v. <em>The City of Brooklyn, ante, </em>424, (decided at the present, general term,) we think that the judgment appealed from was right, and must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Osborne, ,T. concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
