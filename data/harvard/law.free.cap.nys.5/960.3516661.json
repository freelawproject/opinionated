The plaintiffs made a slight case. Many probabilities and intrinsic circumstances were in favor of defendant. The defendant\u2019s witnesses gave substantial testimony in favor of plaintiffs. In rebuttal, the plaintiffs called as a witness a person for whose credibility he vouched by putting him under oath. That witness\u2019 testimony told for the defendant, and against the plaintiffs, so clearly, and in such substantial respects, that to me it appears certain that the preponderance of evidence was with the defendant. The motion should have been granted. I think, also, that the verdict should have been directed for defendant, as requested on the trial. Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
