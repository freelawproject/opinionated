Defendant not having designated any one within the state on whom process, could be served, the summons in this action was served on Charles Oberg as managing agent. Oberg made affidavit that he was not defendant\u2019s managing agent, but only in charge of the passenger department of the company within the state, and that the company had another agent within the state who was in charge of the freight department. Defendant\u2019s time-tables contained the following: \u201c Charles Oberg, General Agent, Passenger Department, 261 Broadway, New York. \u201d On the windows of defendant\u2019s office at 261 Broadway appeared, \u201cChicago <em>&amp; </em>Alton Railroad Company, Office;\u201d also, \u201cFreight and Passenger Agency of the Chicago and Alton Railroad Co. \u201d The name also appeared on the various rooms in the building occupied by defendant. Defendant moved to set aside the service of process on the ground that the person served was not the managing agent of defendant, and that defendant had no. property in the state. The motion was granted, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-14\">In granting the motion, Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien delivered the following opinion: \u201c Where it is sought to obtain jurisdiction in an action against a foreign corporation by service on a managing agent, it must appear, not only that the-person served was such managing agent, but that the corporation has property within the state, or the cause of action arose therein. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 432, subd. 3. This cause of action did not arise in this state. To maintain it, therefore, the two other requisites should be present, viz.-, that the person served was the managing agent, and that the corporation has property within the state. Applying the rule laid down in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Co., </em>35 Hun, 370, and other cases referred to in plaintiff\u2019s brief, to the facts here presented, it must be concluded that Oberg was a managing agent, within the meaning of that term as used in the Code. The other question, as to whether or not the defendant had property within the state sufficient to obtain jurisdiction on the facts, is a more difficult one. The plaintiff nowhere states that there was such property, but relies on the admission made in defendant\u2019s morning papers, which is as follows: Defendant \u2018 has no plant or capital within the state of New York, and has no property located or situated therein, * * * although it sometimes happens that some of its cars are-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>brought within the state, but not in the transaction of its own business within the state.\u2019 From this admission it cannot be concluded that the company at the time of service had any of its property within the state. The mere facts that the company has had, or at various intervals hereafter may have, a fugi-' tive freight-car here, loaned to or brought by a company operating lines within the state, and remaining upon its territories for a short time, is not, in my opinion, sufficient to meet the spirit of the statutory requirement. As stated in <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 Hun, 127: \u2018The Code does not require any specific amount to be found. But it certainly should be something from which the creditors may have some chance of benefit.\u2019 For the reason, therefore, that it is not shown that the defendant now has, or at the time of service had, any property within the state, the motion to set aside the service of the summons should be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b510-5\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afru\">This action ivas brought to recover for a cause of action arising in the state of Missouri. The defendant is a foreign corporation, and the service of the summons and complaint herein was made upon Mr. Charles Oberg, who is claimed to be the general agent of the said company in Hew York. A motion was made to set aside the service, upon the ground that the person served was neither the president, secretary, cashier, or director \u2022of the company, and that the corporation had no property located within this state. The learned court granted the motion, and from the order thereupon \u25a0entered this appeal is taken. It appears from the opinion rendered upon the \u2022decision of the motion that the court was of the opinion that the person served was a managing agent, within the meaning of that term as used by the Code, but there was no evidence that the defendant had property within the state at the time of the service of the summons and complaint. The position in respect to the managing agent is clearly upheld by the decision in the case of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Co., </em>35 Hun, 370, and it is not necessary to discuss further that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">It is undoubtedly true that the papers must show that the defendant has some property within the state at the time of the service from which the creditors may have some chance of benefit. The allegation in the affidavit of the plaintiff is that the defendant has a large business in the city of Hew York, and has property within the state of Hew York, and, as affiant is informed .and believes, had property in the state of Hew York at the time of the service \u2022of the summons and complaint; that it had at that date its offices in the city \u25a0of Hew York, and owned the furniture of said office, and the tickets, and it .also had cars of the defendant\u2019s road with! n the j urisdiction of the court.. The answering affidavits upon the part of the defendant, in support of its allegation that there was no property within this state, simply alleges that the office in which the business of the defendant is carried on is hired by the freight \u2022department, and that the passenger agency which was under the charge of said Charles Oberg, and with which department the affiant had nothing to do, kept a small portion of said office, which was partitioned off for its use. There is no allegation in this affidavit that the defendant road is not the lessee, and liable for the rent. Heither is there any allegation that it does not own the furniture in said office. The mere statement that this office is hired by the freight department of the company shows upon its face that the defendant is the lessee, because it is liable for the contracts of each of its departments. This being the case, it is apparent that there is an admission upon this record that it does own the office furniture situated within this state, and that it is the lessee of this office, and that its business is there carried on. It would be a strange proposition that a foreign corporation may bring its property within this state, carry on business within this state, and enter into contracts within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>this state, and then, claim exemption from the laws of this state, upon the ground that it has not all its property within this state. We think it is clear from these affidavits that the defendant has property within this state from which the creditors may have some chance of benefit, and therefore the service was brought within the rule. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">It is sufficient to say, with respect to the motion to dismiss the appeal, that such motion is absolutely frivolous. The result of the position of the defendant, if sustained, would be that, no matter how erroneous the decision of the court below might be, there could be no possible appeal from such order, because there was nobody upon whom to serve the notice of appeal. Where an attorney appears for the purposes of motion, he still remains the attorney sufficient to receive notice of appeal, and the corporation has so far, at least, submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court. The motion should be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
