We conclude that (1) although the LFO order remains valid, the judgment and sentence must be modified to specify that repayment cannot be made from the proceeds of Social Security disability payments and (2) the failure to raise the mental health argument to the trial court precludes our review of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mr. Catling was charged in the Spokane County Superior Court with two counts of delivery of heroin resulting from sales of the drug to a police informant over a three month period. An agreement was reached and Mr. Catling pleaded guilty to one charge; the second count was dismissed. The parties jointly asked the court to impose a residential drug offender sentencing alternative (DOSA) sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The ensuing evaluation recommended treatment. The trial court agreed and imposed the suspended 24-month residential DOSA sentence requested by the parties at\n   the sentencing hearing held September 23, 2016. Discussion then ensued concerning LFO payments. Defense counsel told the court about a decision issued a day earlier,\n   <em>\n    City of Richland v. Wakefield,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462744\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/186/596/\">\n    186 Wash.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=380%20P.3d%20459\">\n    380 P.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). He argued that although\n   <em>\n    Wakefield\n   </em>\n   only involved discretionary LFOs, its reasoning that federal law prohibited attachment of social security payments should also apply to mandatory LFOs and they should not be assessed against his client. Mr. Catling, age 36, told the court that he had been receiving the disability payments for about 10 years. His mother told the court that the payments had been received for more than 10 years. When asked about her son's condition, she described it as \"based mostly on medical, but also some mental issues.\" Report of Proceedings (Sept. 23, 2016) (RP) at 9. She told the court that he had been born with his bladder turned inside out and that multiple surgeries to address the problem had caused her son pain and prevented him from working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Not having read\n   <em>\n    Wakefield,\n   </em>\n   the court took the matter under advisement. By order entered the following Monday, the court imposed mandatory LFOs totaling $800-a $500 victim penalty assessment, a $200 filing fee, and a $100 DNA fee, payable at the sum of $25 per month. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 35. Two weeks later the defendant sought reconsideration of the LFOs on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Wakefield.\n   </em>\n   The motion reiterated counsel's sentencing argument that\n   <em>\n    Wakefield 's\n   </em>\n   reasoning should prevent imposition of any LFOs. The court denied reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mr. Catling timely appealed to this court, raising two challenges to the LFO rulings. A panel heard oral argument on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Catling alleges that LFOs cannot be imposed against him nor collected from him because his sole source of income is a nonattachable federal disability payment. He also argues that the court erred in not considering whether his mental disability required remission of some of his LFOs under RCW 9.94A.777. We consider those contentions in the order listed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Mandatory LFOs and Disability Income\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mr. Catling argues that mandatory LFOs are invalid under the supremacy clause for those, such as himself, whose only legal source of income is Social Security disability. We disagree with his contention that mandatory LFOs cannot be imposed in his case, but we agree that the federal anti-attachment statute precludes a court from collecting LFO payments where the sole source of income is social security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The constitution does not limit the ability of the states to impose financial obligations on convicted offenders; it only prohibits the enforced collection of financial obligations from those who cannot pay them.\n   <em>\n    Fuller v.

RCW 9.94A.760(1). The financial obligations may include restitution to crime victims, the cost of incarceration, the cost of medical care during incarceration, a crime penalty or victim assessment fee despite also paying restitution to one's crime victims, a crime laboratory fee, the State's criminal case filing fee, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) collection fee, a domestic violence assessment, the cost of a public defender, and a sheriff's service fee, among other costs.

This language necessarily applies to the imposition of the financial obligations at the time of sentencing. Washington courts impose, as part of sentencing, mandatory legal financial obligations regardless of the offender's likely ability to pay in the future.

The requirement that the offender pay a monthly sum toward a legal financial obligation constitutes a condition or requirement of a sentence, and the offender faces penalties for noncompliance. RCW 9.94A.760(10). An offender delinquent in payment of legal financial obligations faces contempt charges and imprisonment. RCW 9.94B.040 and 10.01.180. The judgment for obligations may also be enforced as a civil judgment. RCW 9.94A.760(4). The offender avoids most of these extreme consequences if the State does not enforce payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 39 Many other consequences result from the judgment for legal financial obligations regardless of whether the State actively seeks to collect payment. From the date of judgment, legal financial obligations bear interest at a rate of twelve percent per annum. RCW 10.82.090 ; RCW 4.56.110(4) ; RCW 19.52.020(1). The State may add collection fees to the sum of the financial obligations. RCW 36.18.16(29); RCW 9.94A.780(7) ; RCW 9.94A.760. Most importantly, the trial court retains jurisdiction over the offender until the defendant completely satisfies the financial obligations, regardless of the statutory maximum for the crime. RCW 9.94A.760(4). This latter statute plays a critical role in my analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 40 The sentencing court continuously monitors the offender and often requires court attendance at hearings to disclose his or her financial condition with the attendant disruption in the offender's schedule. RCW 9.94A.760(5) and (7) requires the defendant to provide information and documentation to the court clerk. RCW 9.94A.760(7)(b) declares in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   During the period of repayment, the county clerk may require the offender to report to the clerk for the purpose of reviewing the appropriateness of the collection schedule for the legal financial obligation. During this reporting, the offender is required under oath to respond truthfully and honestly to all questions concerning earning capabilities and the location and nature of all property or financial assets. The offender shall bring all documents requested by the county clerk in order to prepare the collection schedule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 41 The Washington Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The harms include increased difficulty in reentering society, the doubtful recoupment of money by the government, and inequities in administration. The trial court's lengthy involvement in collecting obligations inhibits reentry of the offender to society regardless of whether the State actively seeks to collect the judgment. Legal or background checks will show an active criminal record in superior court for individuals who have not fully paid their financial obligations. The active record impairs the defendant's access to employment, housing, and credit. Reentry obstacles increase the chances of recidivism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 42 A Social Security disability benefits recipient will likely not receive credit regardless of a judgment for legal financial obligations, and by definition the recipient is unemployable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A).

Nevertheless, because of his disability, he abides trapped in an enduring legal process and he suffers other coercive consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 62 In the previously discussed decision,\n   <em>\n    In re Lampart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334810\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/306/226/\">\n    306 Mich.App. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20N.W.2d%20192\">\n    856 N.W.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the Michigan court reversed a court order that employed the civil contempt powers to enforce a restitution order because the State, through a formal procedure, would gain control over the offender's SSDI benefits. The court qualified its ruling by stating the court might freely and periodically direct the offender to attend a hearing to disclose her assets and sources of income as long as the court avoids any directive that will cause the offender to invade her Social Security disability benefits to satisfy the continuing obligation. One wonders if the Michigan court would permit an order for contempt if the offender failed to appear for such a debtor's examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 63 I disagree with the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Lampart.\n   </em>\n   Compelling an offender to attend a court hearing constitutes employment of the legal process. The State does not directly seize the offender's Social Security benefits. Nevertheless, the State still arrays the legal process in an attempt to gain payment despite knowing federal law protects the offender's only income fund. Because of the offender's inability to pay, he remains stuck in an ongoing, burdensome court process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 64 Other collateral consequences coerce an offender to invade his Social Security disability benefits to satisfy the order of mandatory legal financial obligations. The offender cannot exercise rights, including constitutional rights, available to others without relinquishment of his protected benefits. Catling remains under the penalty of denial of voting and gun rights and the right to vacate and discharge his conviction. In this sense, the State will continuously hold a lien on Catling's civil rights and encumber his Social Security disability benefits until he pays all of his legal financial obligations from this sheltered source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 65\n   <em>\n    Washington State Department of Social &amp; Health Services v.

Assuming the State wishes to maintain its judgment against Catling, I would remand to the trial court to determine whether Jason Catling will likely receive other income in the indefinite future. I would direct the sentencing court to strike the judgment for mandatory legal financial obligations if the court finds to the contrary or the State agrees to the contrary.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
