Wilson (Wilson) with: (1) Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) (2007) and 291E-61(b) (Supp. 2014);\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Refusal to Submit to a Breath, Blood, or Urine Test (Refusal to Submit to Testing), in violation of HRS \u00a7 291E-68 (Supp. 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a bench trial, Wilson was found guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wilson's conviction for Refusal to Submit to Testing was based on her refusal to submit to a breath or blood test to determine alcohol concentration after being arrested for OVUII. This appeal presents the question of whether Wilson could be prosecuted for Refusal to Submit to Testing in light of the Hawai'i Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Won\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    137 Hawai'i 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court overturned Won's OVUII conviction, which was based on a breath test that showed his breath alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit, holding that Won's consent to the breath test was coerced by the criminal sanctions that could be imposed if he refused to consent.\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    137 Hawai'i at 348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1083-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained below, based on the supreme court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Wilson could not be prosecuted for Refusal to Submit to Testing. We therefore reverse that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wilson also challenges her OVUII conviction. Wilson contends that her OVUII conviction should be vacated because the trial court erred in accepting her stipulation that the arresting officer was qualified to administer field sobriety tests. Wilson contends that her stipulation was invalid because the trial court failed to engage in a colloquy with her to ensure that she personally approved of the stipulation. We conclude that Wilson's colloquy argument is without merit and affirm her OVUII conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wilson was driving a white Volkswagon convertible when Maui Police Department (MPD) Officer Jun Hattori signaled for her to pull over. Wilson's car moved to the shoulder of the road, then climbed the curb and came to a stop with both passenger tires on the curb. In speaking with Wilson, Officer Hattori observed that her eyes were red, her speech was slurred and mumbled, and there was an odor of liquor coming from her person and her car. Officer Hattori asked Wilson if she would be willing to participate in field sobriety tests, and Wilson agreed to participate. Wilson performed poorly on the tests, and she was arrested for OVUII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the police station, Officer Hattori, using a standard MPD \"implied consent\" form\n   (MPD Form 332), advised Wilson that pursuant to HRS Chapter 291E:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, street, road or highway ... shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration ... of the person's breath [or] blood....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or both, for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wilson told Officer Hattori that she was \"not taking any tests[,]\" and she signed the MPD Form 332 after checking the box signifying that she \"refuse[d] to take a breath and/or blood test\" for alcohol concentration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Hattori then used the standard MPD \"refusal to take test(s)\" form (MPD Form 332a), to advise Wilson, among other things, of the administrative and criminal sanctions she may be subject to if she persisted in refusing to submit to testing. With respect to criminal sanctions, Wilson was informed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If you refuse to submit to a breath [or] blood ... test, as requested, you may be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000, and/or the sanctions of HRS 291E-65, if applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although Wilson initially indicated she would take a breath test using a breathalyzer machine, she changed her mind and refused to submit to testing. Wilson checked and initialed the box on the MPD Form 332a that signified that she refused to take a breath or blood test for alcohol concentration, and she signed the form. At trial, the State introduced both MPD Form 332 and MPD Form 332a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After considering the evidence presented, the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   found Wilson guilty as charged of OVUII and Refusal to Submit to Testing. The District Court entered its Judgment on August 27, 2015, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Hawai'i Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   was issued after the trial in this case. Wilson argues that in light of\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , evidence of her refusal to submit to testing was obtained in violation of her right to be free from unreasonable searches, and the District Court erred in admitting such evidence. She thus argues that her conviction for Refusal to Submit to Testing must be reversed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As explained below, we conclude that the supreme court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   requires the reversal of Wilson's Refusal to Submit to Testing conviction. To understand the application of\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   to this case and the development of the law, it is helpful to review the history of legislative enactments and judicial decisions in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 1967, the Hawai'i Legislature enacted an implied consent statute to reduce deaths, injuries, and damages arising out of highway traffic accidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1967 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 214, at \u00a7 1. While the statutory scheme has evolved over time, its underlying premise has remained the same, that a person who operates a motor vehicle on the State's public roads \"shall be deemed\" to have given consent to testing for evidence of impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 286-151 (1968); HRS \u00a7 291E-11(a) (2007). The original statute authorized testing of a driver's breath or blood to determine the alcoholic content of the driver's blood. HRS \u00a7 286-151 (1986). Subsequent amendments to the statutory scheme expanded the scope of testing to breath, blood, or urine to determine the alcohol concentration or drug content of the driver's breath, blood,\n   or urine, as applicable. HRS \u00a7 291E-11(a) (2007). A driver whose alcohol concentration in breath or blood exceeds the legal limit is subject to criminal liability for OVUII without the State having to prove at trial that the driver was actually impaired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(3) (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to 2011, a person who refused to submit to testing, as required by the implied consent statutory scheme, was subject only to civil administrative sanctions, including the revocation of his or her driver's license and referral for substance abuse assessment and treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291E-41, 291E-65 (2007). However, effective January 1, 2011, the Legislature enacted HRS \u00a7 291E-68, which imposed criminal sanctions for the refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. 2010 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 166, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 26, at 398, 415. The version of HRS \u00a7 291E-68 applicable to Wilson's case stated: \"Except as provided in section 291E-65, refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test as required by part II is a petty misdemeanor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court considered the impact that the criminal sanctions under HRS \u00a7 291E-68 for refusal to submit to testing had on the validity of a defendant's consent to submit to a breath test under the statutory scheme. Won was arrested for OVUII.\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    137 Hawai'i at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Won indicated his agreement to take a breath test by initialing the form next to the statement \"AGREED TO TAKE A BREATH TEST AND REFUSED THE BLOOD TEST,\" and he signed the form.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Won took a breath test, and the test results showed that he had a breath alcohol content of 0.17 grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath, far above the legal limit of 0.08.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Won was charged with and convicted of OVUII, in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291E-61(a)(3) and (b)(1), as a first offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The supreme court addressed the question of whether Won's consent to the breath test was valid where he was informed by the police of his right to refuse consent, but was also told that if he exercised that right, his refusal to consent would be a crime for which he could be imprisoned for up to thirty days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court reasoned that a breath test was a search subject to constitutional constraints, including the warrant requirement generally applicable to searches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 338-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1073-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court recognized, however, that the warrant requirement was subject to exceptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After concluding that certain established exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances and search incident to arrest, did not apply in Won's case, the court focused its attention on the consent exception to the warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 339-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1074-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 n.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court held that because Won had been informed that his refusal to submit to testing would subject him to criminal penalties, Won's consent to the breath test had been coerced by the threat of criminal sanctions and was therefore invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1083-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this regard, the court concluded that if Won had only been advised that his refusal to submit to testing would subject him to statutory civil administrative penalties, Won's consent would have been\n   valid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 349 n.34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1084 n.34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in the court's analysis, it was the threat of being subjected to criminal sanctions imposed by HRS \u00a7 291E-68, which the police communicated to Won in obtaining his consent to the breath test, that rendered his consent invalid. The court concluded that because Won's consent was invalid, and no other exception to the warrant requirement was applicable, Won's breath test constituted an unconstitutional warrantless search; therefore, Won's breath test results were subject to suppression and inadmissible as evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Unlike Won, Wilson did not consent to a breath test, but rather refused to submit to testing. Thus, this case is factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   . However, we conclude that the analysis used by the majority in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   to arrive at its determination that Won's consent was invalid controls our decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   majority observed that in the absence of a warrant or an exception (besides consent) to the warrant requirement, the choice presented to Won by the implied consent form, which required him to surrender either his constitutional right to refuse to be searched or his constitutional right to not be arrested for constitutionally authorized conduct, rendered his consent to search involuntary. The majority opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In situations in which police have not obtained a warrant and no other exception to the warrant requirement is present, the choice presented by the [i]mplied [c]onsent [f]orm forces a defendant to elect between fundamental rights guaranteed by the Hawai'i Constitution. On the one hand, the person may exercise the constitutional right to refuse to be searched, thus relinquishing the constitutional right to not be arrested for conduct that is authorized by the constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Alternatively, the person may \"choose\" to be searched in order to prevent being arrested for the refusal crime, thus forfeiting the constitutional right to not be subject to a search absent a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   That is, with respect to both alternatives, a person must surrender one constitutional right for preservation of another. However, the government may not condition a right guaranteed in our constitution on the waiver of an equivalent constitutional protection. \"It is intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   It is manifestly coercive to present a person with a \"choice\" that requires surrender of the constitutional right to refuse a search in order to preserve the right to not be arrested for conduct in compliance with the constitution. It is equally coercive to \"allow\" the person to preserve the fundamental\n   right to refuse a search by requiring the person to relinquish the right to not be arrested for conduct that does not violate the constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    at 347-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d at 1082-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, footnote, emphasis, and brackets omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Integral to the majority's analysis is that absent a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement, an arrested driver has a constitutional right to refuse to consent to be searched, i.e. submit to a breath test. Therefore, where the police lack a search warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement, imposing criminal penalties on an arrested driver, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 291E-68, for refusing to submit to testing would impermissibly impose criminal sanctions on the driver for engaging in conduct that is constitutionally protected. Stated another way, where there is no warrant or exception to the warrant requirement, an arrested driver has a constitutionally protected right to be free from governmental searches, and such driver cannot be subject to criminal penalties for exercising that right by refusing to consent to a breath-test search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the police did not have a warrant to search Wilson, and based on\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , there was no exception to the warrant requirement that would permit the police to compel Wilson to submit to testing. In accordance with the majority's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , the State could not subject Wilson to criminal punishment for exercising her constitutional right to refuse to submit to testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the aftermath of the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Won\n   </em>\n   , the Legislature repealed HRS \u00a7 291E-68 effective April 26, 2016. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 17, \u00a7 2 at 21. Accordingly, under the current statutory scheme, refusal to submit to testing is no longer a crime subject to criminal penalties.

To require the trial judge to engage in a colloquy with a criminal defendant on every stipulation presented in a case, and to give the defendant veto power over every stipulation agreed to by his or her counsel, would burden the trial process and interfere with the role of defense counsel to exercise appropriate judgment in trial tactics and procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Those types of sanctions are not affected in any way by our decision. Because we conclude only that the threat of being subjected to criminal sanctions inherently coerces a suspected OVUII offender into giving consent, if a police officer does not inform the offender of the criminal sanctions because they were omitted from the notice given by the officer,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 291E-15 ( [Supp. 2010] );\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 28, then proving OVUII through evidence of a defendant's [breath or] blood alcohol content,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(3)-(4), will remain a viable option for purposes of prosecution.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     Won\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     137 Hawai'i at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    349 n.34,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     372 P.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1084 n.34. The court read HRS \u00a7 291E-15 as giving the police the option of only advising an arrested driver of the civil administrative sanctions under HRS \u00a7 291E-41, and not the criminal penalties under HRS \u00a7 291E-68.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 345 n.28,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n     372 P.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1080 n.28.

This omission, however, would also preclude the State from prosecuting an arrested driver for Refusal to Submit to Testing because as a prerequisite for such prosecution, the statutory scheme required the police to advise the driver of the criminal sanctions under HRS \u00a7 291E-68, and then ask the driver if he or she still refused to submit to testing. HRS \u00a7 291E-15 (Supp. 2010).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court concluded that \"breath tests do not implicate significant privacy concerns\" because: (1) the required physical intrusion \"is almost negligible\"; (2) the information revealed by breath tests is limited to the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath; and (3) participation in a breath test is not likely to cause any great enhancement in the embarrassment inherent in any arrest.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2176-77 (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Court observed that \"[a]lcohol consumption is a leading cause of traffic fatalities and injuries\" and noted that its cases have \"long recognized the 'carnage' and 'slaughter' caused by drunk drivers.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2178. The Court also noted the burden on the police and the courts that would be imposed by requiring a search warrant for every breath test: \"If a search warrant were required for every search incident to arrest that does not involve exigent circumstances, the courts would be swamped. And even if we arbitrarily singled out BAC tests incident to arrest for this special treatment ... the impact on the courts would be considerable. The number of arrests every year for driving under the influence is enormous-more than 1.1 million in 2014.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2180.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
