Tash appeals his conviction. He asserts that he was not required to register because RCW 9A.44.130(4)(a)(i)'s registration requirement applies only to those released from custody on a sex or kidnapping offense, and he was released from custody on a Department of Corrections (DOC) violation. Tash also alleges he did not receive notice that he was required to register. Lastly, Tash argues that the sentencing court erred when it failed to consider his ability to pay before imposing legal financial obligations (LFOs). We affirm Tash's conviction and the sentencing court's imposition of LFOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In November 2003, Tash was convicted of indecent liberties with forcible compulsion in Thurston County and was required to register as a sex offender. In 2014, Tash was convicted of failure to register as a sex offender. On December 26, 2014, Tash was released from custody after serving his sentence for failure to register as a sex offender. At that time, Tash signed a sex offender registration requirement form notifying him that he is required to register as a sex offender. The form also notified Tash, \"If you change your address within Thurston County,\n   <strong>\n    or have been released from custody\n   </strong>\n   , you are required to notify the Thurston County Sheriff's Office in person or by mail within three business days.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 57\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On February 8, 2016, Tash was again convicted of failure to register as a sex offender. Tash was released on May 13, 2016, and then incarcerated again following a DOC violation. He was released from custody on June 1, 2016. At that time, he was notified that he must \"immediately contact the Sheriff's Office to stay in compliance.\" CP at 51. Also, on June 3, 2016, an employee of the Thurston County Sherriff's Office left Tash a phone message \"INSTRUCTING [TASH] TO SUBMIT A CHANGE OF ADDRESS.\" CP at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Tash did not register. On October 6, 2016, the State charged him with felony violation of sex offender registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Tash moved to dismiss the charge, arguing RCW 9A.44.130(4)(a)(i) only requires registration if Tash was in custody as a result of a sex or kidnapping offense. The trial court denied his motion, concluding, \"The plain language of the statute requires that individuals required to register as sex offenders must register within three business days of their release from custody regardless of the reason for their detention.\" CP at 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Following a bench trial, the trial court found Tash guilty of failure to register as a sex offender. The sentencing court imposed as LFOs a $500 crime victim assessment fee, a $100 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) collection fee, and a $200 court costs fee. Tash appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. FAILURE TO REGISTER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Tash argues that we should reverse his failure to register as a sex offender conviction because the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss when it misconstrued RCW 9A.44.130 regarding the registration requirement and because Tash did not receive notice of his duty to register. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. RCW 9A.44.130\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 We review conclusions of law following a motion to dismiss de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It furthers the purpose of the sex offender registration statute to require sex offenders in custody to register when they are released.

Clearly, the purpose of the sex offender registration\n   statute is better furthered by requiring registration upon release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 We, therefore, conclude that RCW 9A.44.130(4)(a)(i) requires a sex offender to register within three days of release from custody with the county sheriff for the county of the person's residence.

Additionally, in December 2014, Tash signed a sex offender registration requirement form, which notified him that he was required to register as a sex offender.
