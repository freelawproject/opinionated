Amy and Cameron Pelly, the successors in interest to Kelleran, sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. Pelly alleged the dock, boatlift, and certain landscaping and fencing violated the rights established by the 1970 documents. Panasyuk and Tseng filed a counterclaim asserting title to the Waterfront Strip or alternatively, a declaratory\n   judgment on the scope of the rights under the 1970 \"Grant of Easement\" and \"Quit Claim Deed.\" Following trial, the court issued a 25-page decision and extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found the parties clearly intended the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed be given effect. The court interpreted the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed together and ruled the dock, boatlift, some fencing, and portions of the hedge and potted shrubs violated the right to prohibit permanent structures on the Waterfront Strip and materially interfered with the easement rights. The court issued an injunction prohibiting Panasyuk and Tseng from interfering with the right to ingress and egress to the Waterfront Strip for foot traffic and hand-carried boat access. On appeal, Panasyuk and Tseng argue the court erred in admitting extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the original parties in executing and recording the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed. Panasyuk and Tseng contend the language of the Quit Claim Deed eliminated all rights to ingress and egress. We hold the court did not err in considering extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the original parties and whether the recorded Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed were part of the same transaction and interpreting the two documents together to give effect to the right to ingress and egress, and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The unchallenged findings establish the following facts. In 1953, C.R. (Russ) and Jean Kelleran (Kelleran) purchased Lake Sammamish waterfront property in Bellevue. George and Virginia Fey (Fey) owned the adjacent property to the east of the Kelleran property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 20, 1969, Fey filed a lawsuit to quiet title to a 30-feet-wide by approximately 300-feet-long strip of land that runs north to the lakeshore, the Waterfront Strip. Kelleran filed a counterclaim asserting title to the Waterfront Strip. The following exhibit shows the location of the Kelleran and Fey property and the Waterfront Strip:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The parties agreed to resolve the lawsuit by executing a Grant of Easement and a Quit Claim Deed. On November\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   23, 1970, Fey executed an easement granting Kelleran the right to \"ingress and egress, for foot traffic and boat access purposes only,\" and\n   the right to prohibit placing any \"permanent structure of any kind\" on the Waterfront Strip. The Grant of Easement states the 30-foot Waterfront Strip includes \"the Lake Sammamish Shore lands adjacent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Grant of Easement recorded on December 29, 1970 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE GRANTORS, GEORGE C. FEY and VIRGINIA L. FEY, husband and wife, for and in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable consideration, hereby give, grant and convey to C. R. KELLERAN and JEAN B. KELLERAN, husband and wife, as grantees, and to their heirs, successors and assigns forever, a right of way for purposes of ingress and egress, for foot traffic and boat access purposes only, over and upon the following described real estate situate in King County, Washington ...:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A strip of land 30 feet in width, being a portion of Government Lot 2 in Section 13, Township 24 North, Range 5 E.W.M., King County, Washington ...

The Quit Claim Deed was recorded on December 31, 1970 and provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE GRANTORS, C. R. KELLERAN and JEAN B. KELLERAN, husband and wife; DONALD E. CHANDLER, a single man; and ELIZABETH A. JOHNSON, individually and as executrix of the Estate of Howard B.

This right shall be interpreted as and is intended to be a covenant running with the land for the benefit of the property of the grantors which lies adjacent to and westerly of the property conveyed by this instrument, and as a burden upon that portion of the property conveyed by this instrument which said right touches and concerns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7 The undisputed evidence shows that after executing the two documents, Kelleran used the Waterfront Strip for ingress and egress and boat access. In 1999, Bruce and Rebecca Kelleran built an \"auxiliary dwelling unit\" on the property for Russ and Jean. In 2000, Bruce and Rebecca demolished the summer cabin and built a 5,000-square-foot house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 In 2005, Anatoliy Panasyuk and Sharon C.W. Tseng purchased the Fey property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The \"Statutory Warranty Deed\" expressly conveys title to Panasyuk and Tseng\n   <strong>\n    \"SUBJECT TO: RIGHTS, RESERVATIONS, COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, RESTRICTIONS, AGREEMENTS AND EASEMENTS PRESENTLY OF RECORD AND AS SET OUT ON EXHIBIT 'A' ATTACHED.\"\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit A identifies the 1970 Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed.

The letter acknowledges the easement rights to ingress and egress and that consistent with those rights, Panasyuk and Tseng plan to landscape and install a fence on the boundary line. The letter states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   As you know, the Panasyuk &amp; Tseng property abuts yours to the east. In addition, you have an easement across a portion of the northern panhandle of my clients' property. Such easement was granted and conveyed in the Grant of Easement recorded on December 29, 1970 and modified in the Quit Claim Deed recorded on December 31, 1970.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The scope of the easement benefiting your property is limited. Such easement only permits you to use the northern portion of my clients' panhandle for ingress and egress for pedestrian and boat access purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Panasyuk and Ms. Tseng intend to make certain landscaping improvements to their property, including within the panhandle. When they make such improvements, they reasonably expect that you will not interfere with or disrupt their activities and improvements. As long as my clients' improvements afford you the ability to continue to use the northern portion of their panhandle for pedestrian and boat ingress and egress, you have no legal right to challenge or dictate what they do with their property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   For your information, Mr. Panasyuk and Ms. Tseng intend to place an attractive light-duty steel fence along the west and east sides of their panhandle. To afford you the continued ability to use the easement\n   as authorized, they will have two\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   double-wide gates installed in areas to northeast and southeast of your residence that you will be able to swing open when necessary and close as you exit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Although they are not required to receive your input, Mr. Panasyuk and Ms. Tseng are hereby graciously inviting you to identify where you would like them to place the two double-wide gates. If they deem your suggestion to be unreasonable, however, they reserve the right to place the gates wherever they choose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   My clients may or may not continue to have the lakeside portion of their panhandle covered with grass. They may also install a third gate to afford another access point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 11 Panasyuk and Tseng planted a hedge of Emerald Green arborvitae along the Waterfront Strip boundary with Kelleran and installed a black metal fence with a gate to allow ingress and egress. Panasyuk and Tseng also placed potted Emerald Greens and erected other fencing near the beach on the Waterfront Strip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 12 In 2010, Bruce and Rebecca Kelleran sold the house to their daughter and son-in-law Amy and Cameron Pelly (Pelly).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 13 In 2014, Panasyuk and Tseng filed an application for a shoreline permit to \"[i]nstall a Hewitt pre-manufactured freestanding dock 56 [feet] long and covering 257 [square feet]\" and \"[i]nstall a freestanding boatlift.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 14 Felly notified Panasyuk and Tseng that constructing the dock and boatlift violated the Grant of Easement-\"The proposed dock and boatlift are clearly structures which are being proposed within the area encumbered by the easement.\" Pelly asked Panasyuk and Tseng to withdraw the city of Bellevue application and remove \"obstructions,\" including the hedge, potted plants, and fences that \"block access from the Pellys['] property to enter the 30 foot strip\" for ingress and egress and \"to launch watercraft.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 15 Panasyuk and Tseng asserted the dock was not in the easement area and \"the dock and boatlift are not in any sense 'permanent' \" structures. As to the \"shrubs in pots\" and \"row of shrubs planted along the property boundary,\" Panasyuk and Tseng stated they \"were careful to leave gaps between these shrubs in a few locations to permit foot traffic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    2015 Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 16 On May 18, 2015, Pelly filed a complaint and declaratory judgment action. Pelly alleged the dock, boatlift, plantings, and fencing violated the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed. Pelly sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 17 Panasyuk and Tseng filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims. Panasyuk and Tseng asserted title to the Waterfront Strip. In the alternative, Panasyuk and Tseng sought a declaratory judgment on the scope of the Grant of Easement. Panasyuk and Tseng alleged Pelly were not entitled to the rights of ingress and egress provided by the Grant of Easement recorded December 29, 1970 on the theory that those rights were eliminated by the Quit Claim Deed recorded two days later. Panasyuk and Tseng asserted the portable dock was not a permanent structure in the easement area, the potted plants and \"small fences\" were not structures, and the landscaping did not violate the Grant of Easement. Panasyuk and Tseng also asserted vehicle access over the Waterfront Strip is \"not allowed under the 1970 Easement,\" the easement was \"only intended for ingress and egress by foot traffic,\" boat access is limited to small hand-carried watercraft, and Kelleran and Pelly abandoned the right to launch a boat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Cross Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 18 Panasyuk and Tseng filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Panasyuk and Tseng argued Pelly did not have the right to ingress and egress over the Waterfront Strip because the Quit Claim Deed reserved only the right to prohibit permanent structures. Panasyuk and Tseng argued the \"portable dock is not a 'permanent structure' \" within the easement area and they had the right to plant the hedge and install the fencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 19 Pelly filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment. Pelly argued the dock and boatlift were located in the area described in the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed, the language of the documents prohibited the dock and boatlift, and they did not abandon the right to ingress and egress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court ruled the legal description of the Waterfront Strip as \"shore lands adjacent\" includes the submerged second-class shore land adjacent to the shore. The court ruled the 1970 Grant of Easement and the 1970 Quit Claim Deed \"inextricably relate in subject and chronology such that they are to be considered together.\" The court found the intent of the parties, the admission of \"certain extrinsic\" evidence, whether the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed language was ambiguous, whether the dock was a permanent structure, and whether Felly abandoned their easement rights were material questions of fact for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 21 At trial, Felly argued the pleadings filed in the 1970 dispute and correspondence between the parties established the intent of Kelleran and Fey to resolve the ownership dispute over the Waterfront Strip. Felly asserted the court should interpret and give effect to the recorded Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed. Felly argued the proposed dock and the hedge, potted plants, and fencing violated their right to prohibit any \"structure of any kind\" and the Quit Claim Deed did not eliminate the rights to ingress and egress for foot traffic and boat access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 22 Panasyuk and Tseng argued the proposed dock, plants, fences, shrubs, lighting, sprinkler system, and other existing property are not \"permanent\" structures that \"interfere with any 'easement' rights or the covenant.\" Panasyuk and Tseng asserted the language of the Grant of Easement and the Quit Claim Deed \"expresses an unequivocal intent to eliminate\" the rights to ingress and egress. Panasyuk and Tseng also argued Felly abandoned the right to use the Waterfront Strip for boat access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 23 Panasyuk and Tseng filed a motion in limine objecting to the admission of extrinsic evidence related to the 1970 dispute and the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed. Panasyuk and Tseng argued the evidence was inadmissible to modify, vary, or contradict the language of the recorded documents. The court ruled the evidence was admissible to show context and intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 24 Cameron Felly, Amy Felly, Bruce Kelleran, Rebecca Kelleran, Panasyuk, Tseng, engineer Jeffrey Layton, surveyor Bruce Dodds, landscape architect Thomas Walker, Hewitt Company representative Robert King, and shoreline permitting consultant Gregory Ashley testified at trial. The court admitted into evidence more than 80 exhibits, including the 1970 Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed; the 2005 Statutory Warranty Deed; and a number of photographs of the property, the Waterfront Strip, landscaping, and fences. The court issued a 25-page decision and extensive findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 25 The court rejected the argument that the Quit Claim Deed eliminated the easement rights to ingress and egress. Because the original parties executed the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed as part of a single transaction to resolve the ownership dispute over the Waterfront Strip, the court concluded the two documents \"must be read and interpreted in light of each other\" and the parties \"clearly intended them both to be effective.\" The court found that in exchange for easement rights, \"the Kellerans quit-claimed to the Feys any fee interest they had in the same Waterfront Strip with one major reservation\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [T]he Kellerans or their successor landowners retained the right to \"prohibit the placing of any road or other structure of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   any kind\" on the Waterfront Strip, again defined as extending to the adjacent shore lands of Lake Sammamish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 26 The court noted the reservation of rights in the Quit Claim Deed appeared broader in scope than the reservation in the Grant of Easement because \"the word 'permanent' is not used to modify the word 'structure.' \" Interpreting the language of the two documents together, the court concluded Felly had the right to prohibit only permanent structures.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [G]iven the intent of the Kellerans and the Feys that the two documents be read together as a part of a single transaction, the Court concludes that the 1970 Quit Claim Deed reserved the right of the Pellys to restrict only permanent structures on the Waterfront Strip and its second class shore lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 27 The court found the dock Panasyuk and Tseng sought to install was \"a permanent structure within the meaning of the 1970 Easement or Quit Claim Deed.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Although Hewitt did not originally design the Roll-A-Dock to be a permanent structure fixed to the lake floor, the type of dock the Defendants would need to install to ensure it remained in place would not be the lightweight portable version seen on the Roll-A-Dock website. The dock would need to be pinned to the lakebed with 6-inch augers and would need additional structural support to make it safe to use ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ... Once erected, the dock will remain in the lake year round....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ... The evidence leads the Court to conclude that this dock is a \"permanent structure\" within the meaning of the 1970 Easement and 1970 Quit Claim Deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 28 The court concluded the 1970 Grant of Easement established the right to ingress and egress over the Waterfront Strip, including \"the right to launch a trailered jet ski using a riding lawn mower,\" and that this right was not abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The 1970 Grant of Easement established an easement for ingress and egress for foot traffic and boat access over the\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Waterfront Strip and the adjacent second class shore lands. This easement grants to the Pellys and their guests the right to walk across the Waterfront Strip to reach the Nelson and Hughes Properties. It also grants to the Pellys and their guests the right to use the easement area to launch boats into Lake Sammamish.... The easement does not permit access by third parties unless accompanied by or authorized to use the easement by the Pellys.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 29 The court found certain landscaping and fencing interfered with the right to ingress and egress and required removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   court entered a final judgment and injunction.

KNIFFEN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS \u00a7 24.21, at 216 (rev. ed. 1998) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 42 The unchallenged findings establish the court did not err in concluding the Grant of Easement and the Quit Claim Deed should be interpreted together and given effect. In 1969, Fey and Kelleran disputed ownership to the Waterfront Strip. In 1970, they agreed to resolve the dispute by executing an easement and quitclaim deed. The Grant of Easement gave Kelleran the right to ingress and egress for foot traffic and boat access purposes over the Waterfront Strip and the right to prohibit placing any permanent structure on the Waterfront Strip. In exchange, Kelleran quitclaimed any interest in the Waterfront Strip subject to a reservation to prohibit any structure on the Waterfront Strip. The Grant of Easement was recorded on Tuesday, December 29, 1970. The Quit Claim Deed was recorded on Thursday, December 31, 1970. The parties then filed a stipulated order to dismiss the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 43 The undisputed record establishes that after recording the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed in 1970, Kelleran used the Waterfront Strip for ingress and egress for at least 35 years. The undisputed record also establishes that when Panasyuk and Tseng purchased the property in 2005, they had actual knowledge of the easement rights to ingress and egress and expressly recognized the rights to ingress and egress for foot traffic over the Waterfront Strip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 44 The court interpreted the language of the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed together to determine the meaning of the restrictive covenant and whether the right to ingress and egress was eliminated. The language of the Quit Claim Deed prevents Panasyuk and Tseng from placing any \"structure of any kind\" on the Waterfront strip. But the Grant of Easement prohibits placing \"any road or other\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   structure of any kind\" on the Waterfront Strip.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Interpreting the language of the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed as part of a single transaction and agreement, the court concluded Pelly had the right to prohibit only \"permanent\" structures on the Waterfront Strip, not to prohibit placing \"any structure of any kind\" on the Waterfront Strip. Absent the rights to ingress and egress, there would be no reason to prohibit permanent structures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 45 Panasyuk and Tseng argue the plain and unambiguous language of the Quit Claim Deed eliminates the right to ingress and egress. Panasyuk and Tseng also claim that because the Quit Claim Deed does not refer to ingress and egress, the Grant of Easement right to ingress and egress was terminated. These arguments ignore the finding that the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed are part of the same transaction and should be interpreted together. Likewise, the argument that the language \"hereafter acquire\" as used in the Quit Claim Deed terminated the right to ingress and egress is unpersuasive. Interpreting the two documents together, \"hereafter acquire\" clearly applies only to interests conveyed after the parties executed and recorded the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 46 The court did not err in interpreting the Grant of Easement and Quit Claim Deed together, concluding the rights to ingress and egress were not eliminated, and giving effect to the two documents.

The Kellerans and Pellys have continued to use the easement to hand-carry watercraft to the lake. Panasyuk and Tseng have, by their own words and actions, indicated an intent to respect the Pellys' right to launch a hand-carried boat across the easement by installing a gate in the black metal fence for this purpose. Although the Pellys acquiesced in the installation of the black metal fence and landscaping, the Court finds that this lack of opposition to the fence and landscaping does not demonstrate an abandonment of all boat access easement rights because at the time Panasyuk and Tseng made these improvements, the Pellys could and did continue using the easement area to launch small watercraft.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    ... The Kellerans apparently launched jet skis in this manner for many years before Panasyuk and Tseng purchased the property.... [T]he only reason they stopped was because Panasyuk and Tseng planted a hedge and placed potted plants along the western boundary, effectively precluding this type of boat access.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    ... Panasyuk and Tseng have not established that the Pellys intentionally abandoned their right to use the Waterfront Strip to maneuver a jet ski and trailer in and out of their shed with a riding lawn mower.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The findings of fact and conclusions of law state, in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    The hedge has grown so much in the last 10 years that the hedge has become as impenetrable like a permanent fence ... [.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    ... The Court agrees with the Pellys that Panasyuk and Tseng intended this hedge to remain in place continuously and has become a permanent structure within the meaning of the 1970 Easement and Quit Claim Deed. However, the Pellys do not seek removal of the entire hedge. They only seek the removal of some of the plantings that they contend interfere with their easement rights. The Court finds that some of these planted Emerald Green shrubs do materially interfere with the Pellys' easement rights and should be removed....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    ... In addition to the planted Emerald Greens, Panasyuk and Tseng placed additional potted Emerald Greens along the boundary near the lake. The plants have grown to such an extent that the roots have grown into the ground. These Emerald Green potted plants have, over time, become a permanent fixture on the strip. Some, but not all, of these potted plants are materially interfering with the Pellys' use and enjoyment of their easement rights.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    An easement appurtenant \" 'is not a mere privilege to be enjoyed by the person to whom it is granted or by whom it is reserved.
