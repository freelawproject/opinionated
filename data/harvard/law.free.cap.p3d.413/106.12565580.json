In 2001, Allen Willey created the Allen F. Willey Trust Agreement and Declaration of Trust, a revocable trust that provided for the management of his assets during his lifetime, and for distribution of the assets upon his death. The Willey Ranch, located in Sheridan County, was included as a trust asset. Mr. Willey served as the trustee of the trust during his lifetime. Mr. Willey's trust initially named his son, Spencer, as successor trustee and the trust ultimately benefitted Spencer's minor children, E.W. and A.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b64] Mr. Willey amended the trust in 2006 and 2009, adding his wife's daughter and\n   granddaughter as beneficiaries under the trust. In 2010, he executed the Allen F. Willey Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, which made additional changes to the original trust. Most significantly, the amendment removed Spencer as beneficiary and successor trustee. Appellants, however, remained as beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] In March 2014, Mr. Willey amended the trust again. The amendment changed the successor trustee to First Interstate Bank of Sheridan and provided that under no circumstances should Spencer or any lineal descendant of Mr. Willey be named trustee. The amendment also added the following\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   , or \"no-contest\" clause, which is the subject of this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It is my intention that the provisions of my Trust be honored and respected without challenge from my son SPENCER WILLEY, from my grandchildren, from my sisters or their children, or from anyone purportedly acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. Any challenge to this Trust made directly by or on behalf of my son or grandchildren shall immediately terminate any interest in the Trust of any descendant of mine[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b66] In 2013, Mr. Willey entered into a listing agreement with a real estate broker for the purpose of selling the Willey Ranch. In May 2014, Spencer filed a Complaint for Injunction and Declaratory Judgment against Mr. Willey, individually and as trustee of the Allen F. Willey trust, and Mr. Willey's wife, Bertha. Spencer sought to set aside the listing of the ranch and requested that Mr. Willey be removed as trustee due to incapacity. Spencer also alleged that Bertha Willey had exercised undue influence over Mr. Willey's weakened condition to convince him to sell the ranch instead of leaving it in the trust for the benefit of E.W. and A.W. He sought a declaration that would void any part of the trust permitting sale of the ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b67] In May 2015, Spencer amended the Complaint, adding a claim that Bertha Willey had exercised undue influence over Mr. Willey by convincing him to remove Spencer from the trust, reduce the benefits to E.W. and A.W., and grant additional benefits to Mrs. Willey. He further alleged that he had an oral agreement with his father that he would inherit the Willey Ranch, and that the sale of the Ranch constituted a breach of that agreement. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, and the district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b68] Approximately one month after the Amended Complaint was filed, Mr. Willey died. The case subsequently went to trial and the jury found that the trust amendments were not the product of undue influence. Spencer appealed, challenging the award of summary judgment and several aspects of the trial, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Willey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12191538\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/290/\">\n    385 P.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b69] In early 2016, while the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Willey v. Willey\n   </em>\n   was pending, Appellants filed the present action through Spencer, who acted as \"next friend\" for his children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants sought an injunction preventing sale of the Willey Ranch, a declaratory judgment that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause would not apply to them, removal of First Federal as trustee, and damages for First Federal's alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Appellees answered and subsequently moved for summary judgment on the grounds that, due to Spencer's 2014 suit, Appellants were no longer beneficiaries of the trust by operation of the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause. Appellants responded by claiming that, in\n   <em>\n    Willey\n   </em>\n   , the district court had determined that Spencer did not have standing to challenge his removal from the trust. They asserted that, because Spencer lacked standing, the 2014 suit did not trigger the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause. They also claimed that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause was void because it violated public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b610] Following a hearing, the district court granted summary judgment to Appellees. The court concluded that Appellants' claims relating to Spencer's standing in the 2014 suit lacked cogent supporting argument or authority. The court also determined, however,\n   that Spencer had standing to challenge the trust in the 2014 action and that the challenge terminated E.W.'s and A.W.'s interest in the trust. The court further concluded that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provision of the trust did not violate public policy.

Whether Spencer's 2014 suit constituted a \"challenge\" to the trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b612] In Appellants' first issue, they claim Spencer's 2014 challenge to the trust was void because he did not have standing to challenge the trust. According to Appellants, in\n   <em>\n    Willey\n   </em>\n   , the district court determined that Spencer did not have standing. They claim, \"The District Court's judgment was affirmed by this Court, so Spencer's lack of standing must be accorded\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect.\" Additionally, Appellants assert that \"Since Spencer had no standing to challenge the post-2010 Trust Amendments, his entire legal proceeding in the 2014 action was governed by, and its effect determined by, the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause that was in effect when he had standing in 2010.\" As a result, Appellants contend Spencer's 2014 suit did not trigger the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provision of the trust. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b613] Contrary to Appellants' assertions, the district court did not conclude that Spencer did not have standing to bring his suit in 2014. Rather, as noted in\n   <em>\n    Willey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12191538\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/290/\">\n    385 P.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court determined that, \"If the jury found no undue influence on the 2010 amendment, Spencer had no further interest in the trust.\" This does not amount to a conclusion that Spencer lacked standing. Standing is a jurisdictional question, and a finding that Spencer lacked standing would have constituted grounds for dismissal of the action.\n   <em>\n    Gheen v. State ex rel. Dep't of Health, Div. of Healthcare Fin./ EqualityCare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6944560\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/326/918/\">\n    2014 WY 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6944560\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/326/918/\">\n    326 P.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (Wyo. 2014). Spencer's claim that the amendments to the trust were the product of undue influence was tried and submitted to the jury. The jury found no undue influence. As is evident from these facts, the district court did not conclude that Spencer lacked standing to assert his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b614] Further, even if Spencer did lack standing to file the 2014 suit, that fact did not prevent him from \"challenging\" the trust under any interpretation of the word. Spencer filed a complaint seeking injunctive and declaratory relief relating to the terms of the trust, and subsequently alleged additional claims of undue influence and breach of contract. After finding no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the breach of contract claim, the district court granted summary judgment on the merits of that claim. As noted above, the undue influence claim was ultimately tried and submitted to the jury. After a five-day trial, the jury determined that the trust amendments were not the product of undue influence. There is\n   no question that Spencer's 2014 suit constituted a \"challenge\" to the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b615] We are also not persuaded by the claim that, because he lacked standing, the 2014 suit was governed by the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause that was in effect in 2010. As noted above, there has been no judicial determination that Spencer lacked standing to bring the 2014 suit. Further, Appellants have provided no cogent argument or pertinent authority in support of the claim that Spencer's alleged lack of standing has any bearing on the trust provisions in effect at the time of Spencer's 2014 suit. Accordingly, we will not consider it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the\n    <em>\n     in terrorem\n    </em>\n    clause violates public policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b616] In their second issue, Appellants contend the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provision is void because it violates public policy. We have said that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In its general sense, public policy refers to the law of a state embodied in its constitution, statutes and judicial decisions. When the constitution and statutes have not spoken on a subject, public policy refers to a principle of law that holds no one can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public good.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of MM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436210\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/652/974/#p978\">\n    652 P.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 978 (Wyo. 1982). Appellants claim that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provision violates public policy because it permits a minor child to be deprived of property by the action of his parent. According to Appellants, this result is contrary to constitutional provisions protecting minors, providing for due process, and providing access to the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b617] We begin with the proposition, long established in Wyoming precedent, that it is \"the absolute right of the testator to dispose of his property after death as he sees fit, provided he is legally qualified so to do and acts as the law directs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lane's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8513427\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/50/119/#p135\">\n    50 Wyo. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8513427\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/50/119/#p135\">\n    58 P.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (1936).

No right is more solemnly assured to him by the law. Nor does it depend in any sense upon the judicious exercise of that right. It rarely happens that a man bequeaths his estate to the entire satisfaction of either his family or friends. The law wisely secures equality of distribution where a man dies intestate, but the very object of a will is to produce inequality.... In this country a man's prejudices form a part of his liberty. He has a right to them. He may be unjust to his children or relatives. He is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its use after his death, subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by law. Where a man has sufficient memory and understanding to make a will, and such instrument is not the result of undue influence, it is not to be set aside without sufficient evidence, nor upon sentimental notions of equality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b618] Based on the rule favoring the testator's choice to distribute his estate as he chooses, we have previously rejected the claim that no-contest clauses are unenforceable as violative of public policy, even where a challenge to the testamentary instrument is made in good faith and with probable cause.

Wells' intentions to impose conditions on the three daughters' gifts generally were within his rights as a testator. And public policy favors his desire to avoid litigation.

We conclude that they are not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   In response to Robyn's and the trial court's conclusion that the particular terms of Wells' no contest clause are so unfair that they trump the traditional public policy of upholding the testator's intent, we\n   point out that the fairness of a testamentary instrument, unless it violates public policy, is not an issue for judicial review. We note that valid wills or trusts may contain terms that might strike outside observers as unfair. We might see it as unfair if a testator gave nothing whatsoever to a dutiful child while giving the entirety of a large estate to the dutiful child's unworthy sibling-but a testator may do that, and we would step dangerously outside our proper role were we to rewrite such an instrument to reflect our sense of justice. We further note that neither we nor the trial court can ever possess the intimate understanding of the internal dynamics and interrelationships within a family that a testator would have. This is another reason why courts generally should defer to a testator's clearly stated intentions, even in situations where a testamentary instrument might seem unfair to an outsider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568693\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/93/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676770\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/144/554/#p565\">\n    144 Cal.

The parties disputed whether the provisions of the will relating to the divorced spouse were revoked immediately upon the testator's divorce from her husband. Additionally, the testator's stepson contended that the testator's son had been disinherited by operation of the no-contest provision of the will. The New Mexico Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that \"where the circumstances upon which a will is based have changed substantially between the time of its execution and the time of its probate, courts should not discourage contests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568693\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/93/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568693\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/93/328/\">\n    600 P.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also noted that, in New Mexico, no-contest provisions \"are not effective to disinherit a beneficiary who has contested a will in good faith and with probable cause to believe that the will was invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568693\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/93/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   No-contest provisions are valuable will devices. They serve to protect estates from costly and time-consuming litigation and they tend to minimize family bickering over the competence and capacity of testators, and the various amounts bequeathed. However, the function of the court is to effect the testator's intent to the greatest extent possible within the bounds of the law. To strictly construe no-contest provisions in the face of obvious indications of unresolved legal questions, such as were present in this case, could result in complete destruction of a testator's intent....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Whenever a beneficiary contests a will in the face of a no-contest provision, he does so at the peril of his bequest. But, when he does so in good faith and for probable cause, his bequest should not be jeopardized by the contest. The court should infer the existence or absence of good faith and probable cause from the totality of the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568693\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/93/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Seymour\n   </em>\n   , Wyoming does not recognize an exception to enforceability of no-contest clauses where a will contest is made in good faith. Further, in this case, Appellants do not allege any changed circumstances between the time of the creation of the trust in this case and Mr. Willey's death. Ultimately, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Seymour\n   </em>\n   says nothing on the subject of whether a challenge to a testamentary instrument during the testator's lifetime triggers the provisions of a no-contest clause. As indicated by the foregoing discussion, Appellants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Liggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pasternack\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Seymour\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Absent any authority supporting Appellants' contention, from Wyoming or elsewhere, we are not persuaded that the 2014 suit could not have constituted a challenge to the trust because it was initiated during Mr. Willey's lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b630] We are also not persuaded by Appellants' claim that, because Mr. Willey did not remove them as beneficiaries after the 2014 suit was filed, he must have intended for the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provision not to apply. We must interpret the intent of the settlor according to provisions contained in the trust. \"The rules of construction of a trust agreement are simple. A trust agreement is governed by the plain language contained in the four corners of the document.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WY%20157\">\n    2011 WY 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20P.3d%20222\">\n    265 P.3d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (Wyo. 2011).
