Evidence of a shoplifting conviction is admissible only when the court can readily determine that the conviction turned on such proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The State indicted Darren Winegardner on one count of sexual conduct with a minor, alleging that he engaged in sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter, L.B. At trial, the prosecution called L.B. to testify. Winegardner told the court that he intended to impeach L.B. with a 2015 misdemeanor shoplifting conviction. He offered no details of the conviction other than stating that it was a crime of moral turpitude. Finding that the \"probative value does not substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice,\" the trial court refused to admit the impeachment evidence. The jury found Winegardner guilty, and the court sentenced him to a mitigated term of 3.5 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Noting that Rule 609(a)(2) requires courts to admit evidence of convictions involving dishonest acts or false statements, Winegardner argued on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error by precluding him from impeaching L.B. with evidence of the shoplifting conviction. The court of appeals disagreed and rejected classifying shoplifting as a \"dishonest act or false statement\" for purposes of Rule 609(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    State v.

By contrast, criminal offenses that primarily involve stealth, such as burglary, or force, such as robbery or assault, do not inherently demonstrate a trait of untruthfulness and should not be admitted under Rule 609(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We agree, and, as in\n   <em>\n    Malloy\n   </em>\n   , we hold that the phrase \"dishonest act or false statement\" should be construed narrowly to include only those crimes that involve deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13\n   <em>\n    Malloy\n   </em>\n   instructs that determining whether a prior conviction is admissible for impeachment purposes under Rule 609(a)(2) depends on the statutory language of the underlying offense and whether the conviction required proof of a dishonest act or false statement. Winegardner argues that Arizona's shoplifting statute contains elements of deceit and fraud and therefore satisfies Rule 609(a)(2)'s standard for admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 Under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1805(A), a person commits shoplifting when he or she knowingly obtains\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   merchandise ... displayed for sale ... with the intent to deprive [another] of such goods by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) Removing ... the goods ... without paying the purchase price; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) Charging ... the goods to a fictitious person or any person without that person's authority; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) Paying less than the purchase price of the goods by some trick or artifice ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) Transferring the goods from one container to another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (5) Concealment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Although multiple subsections of the statute include elements of dishonesty and false statement, others do not. Winegardner unpersuasively contends that even subsection (1) of the statute includes elements of deceit because the \"shoplifter consciously misleads the true owner and fails to reveal true ownership by taking the item from the store.\" Although purposefully leaving a store with an item without paying for it is dishonest in layman's terms, it does not meet Rule 609(a)(2)'s threshold of establishing a trait of untruthfulness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malloy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739460\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/131/125/#p126\">\n    131 Ariz. at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739460\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/131/125/#p126\">\n    639 P.2d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reaching same conclusion with respect to attempted burglary). Likewise, subsection (5) indicates an element of stealth but does not necessarily establish a trait of untruthfulness. Subsections (2), (3), and (4), however, might implicate dishonesty and false statement and could establish a basis for admissibility under Rule 609(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State argues that when, as here, the record is devoid of any details regarding a witness's prior shoplifting conviction, the conviction might have rested on any of the five enumerated subsections. Because not all involve a dishonest act or false statement as contemplated by Rule 609(a)(2), the State reasons, courts properly preclude prior shoplifting convictions for impeachment purposes. Winegardner responds that shoplifting, as codified in \u00a7 13-1805, is a unitary offense that may be charged in the disjunctive, using \"and/or\" to allege conduct covered under any of the statute's subsections. Thus, any shoplifting conviction may involve a dishonest act or false statement, even if the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement do not list a specific subsection that itself indicates a dishonest act or false statement. Accordingly, Winegardner argues that shoplifting convictions should be per se admissible under the rule. The correct approach lies somewhere between these two all-or-nothing positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 The shoplifting statute, \u00a7 13-1805, indicates that a conviction may or may not involve elements of dishonesty or false\n   statement. Therefore, shoplifting is not like perjury or criminal fraud, which require the state to prove a dishonest act or false statement before a defendant can be convicted. Consequently, shoplifting is not a conviction that is per se admissible under Rule 609(a)(2).

But the admissibility of evidence is a question of law that is determined by court rules and judges, not jurors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ariz. R. Evid. 403 ; Ariz. R. Evid. 404 ; Ariz. R. Evid. 802. Indeed, the evidentiary rules strictly confine the admissibility of arguably material evidence that may be prejudicial. The jury's authority to weigh evidence only exists as to prior convictions that are admissible, and a judge does not encroach that authority by determining the admissibility of such a conviction. Given that Rule 609(a)(2) provides for mandatory admission of convictions and involves no judicial discretion under Rule 403, only those convictions that are inherently relevant to a witness's tendency to perjure himself are properly admitted under the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 Accordingly, we conclude that shoplifting does not necessarily involve a dishonest act or false statement for purposes of Rule 609(a)(2) and therefore is not automatically admissible under the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24 Rule 609(a)(2) provides that admission of a conviction is only proper \"if the court can\n   <em>\n    readily determine\n   </em>\n   that establishing the elements of the crime required proving-or the witness's admitting-a dishonest act or false statement.\" Ariz. R. Evid. 609(a)(2) (emphasis added). In most circumstances, the statutory elements of the offense will show whether a conviction required proving or admitting a dishonest act or false statement. However, in cases \"[w]here the deceitful nature of the crime is not apparent from the statute and the face of the judgment ... a proponent may offer information such as an indictment, a statement of admitted facts, or jury instructions\" to demonstrate that the conviction rested on the defendant admitting or the factfinder finding a dishonest act or false statement. Fed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's note to 2006 amendment. The rule does not permit, however, a \"trial within a trial\" delving into the factual circumstances of the conviction by scouring the record or calling witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, L.B.'s shoplifting conviction was not automatically admissible under Rule 609(a)(2), and Winegardner provided the trial court with no information showing that it involved a dishonest act or false statement.

I respectfully disagree and would instead hold that shoplifting, as codified in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1805(A),\n   should be automatically admissible because it clearly qualifies as a \"dishonest act\" under Rule 609(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28 I do not contest the majority's analytical framework, as it is familiar terrain.

I disagree, however, that the federal guidance compels the majority's narrow interpretation and application of Rule 609(a)(2)'s definition of \"a dishonest act.\" Although we consult the federal approach for guidance, we are not bound to federal courts' interpretations of the Federal Rules of Evidence when considering similar provisions in the Arizona Rules.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In doing so, we glossed over the Rule's plain language to find a much narrower meaning in its legislative history. But our decisions repeatedly emphasize that we should apply plain meaning before resorting to secondary interpretation methods such as legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

A \" 'dishonest' act\" is one that is \"[d]ishonorable,\" \"[c]haracterized by fraud,\" or \"[w]anting in honesty or integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    See Dishonest\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Second New International Dictionary 748 (1949). The majority tacitly concedes that shoplifting is a dishonest act under a plain meaning interpretation of the rule by acknowledging that shoplifting \"is dishonest in layman's terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Shoplifting is a \"dishonest act\" within the plain meaning of the phrase, and by the Rule's terms, \"deceit, untruthfulness, or falsification\" are not necessary prerequisites to its application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 We must apply the Rule, of course, to the specific statutory language that Arizona uses to define shoplifting. Even under the federal authorities' narrow definition of \"dishonest act,\" adopted by\n   <em>\n    Malloy\n   </em>\n   , shoplifting remains admissible under Rule 609(a)(2) because its commission necessarily involves an element of \"deceit.\" The majority concedes that subsections (2), (3), and (4) of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1805(A)\"might implicate dishonesty and false statement,\" but concludes that subsections (1) and (5) do \"not necessarily establish a trait of untruthfulness\" sufficient for admissibility under Rule 609(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that subsections (1) and (5) do not necessarily establish a trait of untruthfulness. Instead, I would find that those sections qualify under the Rule because they, too, inherently involve deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 31 Subsection (5) requires knowingly obtaining goods belonging to another by \"[c]oncealment.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1805(A)(5). \"Concealment\" is defined as the \"practice or fact of concealing what ought to be revealed; improper secrecy.\"\n   <em>\n    See Concealment\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Second New International Dictionary 552 (1949). Shoplifting by \"concealment\" plainly connotes \"deceit\" because the shoplifter removes a storekeeper's property by exiting the store while improperly hiding an unpurchased item. This is the essence of deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 32 Subsection (1) presents a closer call. That provision defines shoplifting as \"[r]emoving ... the goods ... without paying the purchase price.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1805(A)(1). The\n   State argues that various methods of shoplifting covered by subsection (1) do not involve deceit, such as brazenly stealing a case of beer while under the watchful eye of employees or eating grapes throughout the grocery store while shopping. But the State and the majority ignore the fact that shoppers have only a limited license to enter a store and it is premised on the understanding that the shopper will take merchandise only after he purchases it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

The majority reasons that \"[a]lthough purposefully leaving a store with an item without paying for it\n   <em>\n    is dishonest in layman's terms\n   </em>\n   , it does not meet Rule 609(a)(2)'s threshold of establishing a trait for untruthfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (emphasis added). The majority, like the court of appeals, invokes\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   's oft-cited proclamation that \"[h]uman experience does not justify an inference that a person will perjure himself from proof that he was guilty of petty shoplifting,\" to support its legal conclusion concerning a shoplifting conviction's admissibility.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. But\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   supplants the common experience of judges for that of jurors (as laymen) under the guise of \"human experience\" to bolster its legal conclusion. While it may be the experience of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   judges that a demonstrably dishonest person, namely a shoplifter, is not more likely to lie under oath than an honest person,\n   we cannot know whether jurors share this counterintuitive proposition. What \"human experience\" tells us about a witness's shoplifting conviction is better suited for a judgment about the conviction's weight, in context, than its categorical admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309919\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/44/\">\n    242 Ariz. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309919\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/44/\">\n    392 P.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"It is primarily the province of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses and to find the facts.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 35 Despite the considerable value of conforming Arizona's evidentiary rules to the federal rules,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, which I acknowledge, we retain the prerogative to determine the scope of\n   <em>\n    our\n   </em>\n   rule. The federal approach loses itself in its hyper-technicality and subtly chips away at the truth-seeking purpose of our evidentiary rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 102 (explaining the purpose of Arizona Rules of Evidence as the fair and efficient \"development of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination\"). Although the majority quotes Justice Frankfurter's observation that \"if a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source ... it brings the old soil with it,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, in this unique context of interpreting our own rule we are free to shake the old soil loose to give the words \"dishonest act\" truer purchase. In a close admissibility case like this one, I respectfully submit that the better approach is to allow jurors to determine, under the unique circumstances of each case, the weight of a witness's shoplifting conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 36 From a practical standpoint, the majority endeavors to streamline its case-by-case approach for admissibility of shoplifting convictions under Rule 609(a)(2) and cautions that the \"rule does not permit ... a 'trial within a trial' delving into the factual circumstances of the conviction by scouring the record or calling witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. This may prove easier said than done. Inevitably, the majority's approach will result in additional or prolonged contested trial court hearings for no meaningful purpose. A per se rule of admissibility would be a more efficient approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 102 (\"These rules should be construed so as to administer every proceeding fairly, [and to] eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 37 Because I would find that a shoplifting conviction is automatically admissible under Rule 609(a)(2), I would vacate the court of appeals' opinion. I would, however, affirm Winegardner's conviction because the trial court's error in refusing to admit L.B.'s shoplifting conviction for impeachment purposes was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Valverde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043106\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/220/582/\">\n    220 Ariz. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 585 \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043106\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/220/582/\">\n    208 P.3d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (2009) (\"A reviewing court will affirm a conviction despite the error if it is harmless, that is, if the state, in light of all the evidence, can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to or affect the verdict.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Considering the overwhelming evidence of Winegardner's guilt, including DNA evidence and L.B.'s impeachment by her inconsistent testimony, any impeachment value of L.B.'s misdemeanor shoplifting conviction would not have affected the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
